Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer Prahlad Singh  Prahlad Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Bryan  and good evening everyone  I m pleased to report that PerkinElmer had a strong finish to 2019 with reported revenue in the fourth quarter increasing 6  year over year and adjusted earnings per share growing 14   beating both the top and bottom line of our previous guidance Our revenue in the fourth quarter was  806 million  representing organic growth of 5  and our adjusted earnings per share was  1 35  As I reflect on 2019  the rapid transformation we made as an organization has put us in an excellent position to accelerate profitable growth and advance outcomes around the world in 2020 and beyond  I have no doubt that these positive changes will become increasingly apparent to external stakeholders over the coming quarters and years From a financial perspective  we delivered strong performance in 2019 across our businesses despite evolving macro headwinds  We delivered organic growth of 5   170 basis points of margin expansion and 14  adjusted earnings per share growth  Jamey will discuss our financial results in greater detail As you are familiar  last summer we aligned our go to market approach and combined our R D teams  empowering our regional commercial leaders to make decisions closer to customers and encouraging our R D team to think differently and leverage the breadth of our capabilities across the end markets we serve to develop full workflow solutions that address evolving customer needs We entered 2020 as a new highly collaborative organization that has significant opportunity to leverage our differentiated capabilities to accelerate positive outcomes for the betterment of people and their environment  All in all  I am extremely proud of all of our 13 000 employees who come to work every day with enthusiasm around our mission of innovating for a healthier world  a relentless focus on transformative innovation and operational excellence and a strong commitment to meeting the ever changing needs of our customers I ll just share a few examples from the fourth quarter where we ve seen our transformation efforts pay off  Our targeted focus on solving critical issues impacting the future of science and healthcare enabled us to achieve new milestones by working with our customers and partners Within the Diagnostics business  the FDA approval of our GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase  MM kit has resulted in first commercially available assay for screening newborns affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy  PerkinElmer s kit is specifically designed for screening newborns and is a cost effective way to screen for DMD with a two tier testing approach using the CK MM assay and then DMD gene analysis  Screening newborns not only prevents DMD patients and their families from an unnecessary diagnostic odyssey but it also ensurers timely treatment for a disease that could otherwise go undetected for years Via our proprietary DMD kit  PerkinElmer is participating in Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy s consented pilot program to screen newborns in New York State for Duchenne  The program aims to screen 100 000 babies  about half of all those born each year in New York over a two year period Taking a step back for a moment  when we think about positive and accelerated outcomes  we are looking at the whole human care cycle  not just siloed points along the diagnostics and therapeutics spectrum  Our advancements in newborn screening  such as the DMD kit for example  play into a larger strategy focused on the full continuum from family planning to maternal fetal to newborn health  childhood and family health  To this end  we are excited about some of the truly novel solutions that we have in our pipeline today and hopefully we ll be discussing more in the months and years ahead Turning to DASH   Phonetic  our new go to market strategy is fundamentally shifting how we are approaching new analytical market opportunities  As I mentioned at a recent conference  cannabis is an early win example of this new go to market approach that we hope to replicate going forward  We have progressed from a relatively nascent business in early 2018 to  26 million in revenue from cannabis testing in 2019  Thanks to our efforts to really understand the voice of the customer and provide an end to end workflow solution  including sample prep  quality and safety testing and analytics capabilities To continue to show a strong commitment to this rapidly expanding market and to broaden our distribution reach  this past December at MJBizCon  we announced that Emerald Scientific  a leading cannabis and hemp lab technology player and testing standard leader will now offer a cannabis and hemp testing portfolio to their North American customers Our success in developing complete workflow solutions is also serving as a key differentiator across our life sciences portfolio  With the acquisition of Cisbio  for example  which is tracking ahead of our deal model  we now can provide end to end solutions in the discovery stage on target identification  lead generation and optimization in preclinical for both pharma and biotech research  During the fourth quarter alone  we introduced several new Cisbio kits for phosphor relate and total protein and biomarker detection  And with our reagent R D for all PerkinElmer technologies now consolidated at our site in Codolet  France  we expect an uptick in drug discovery screening reagent innovation in the future A final example of our new strategy coming to life is within the fast growing food market where we are already reverse integrating some PerkinElmer food assets into the Meizheng sales channel to take advantage of its commercial breadth customer intimacy and local domain expertise  One example of this in action is with our recently introduced PaddyCheck PC 6800 technology from Perten which automates analysis and increasing testing accuracy of paddy rice for key quality markers The new solution also eliminates the need for traditional labor intensive steps and delivers accurate results with 5 to 10 minutes  With rice serving as a key staple in people s diet  helping to ensure the quality of this mega grain is important for the increasing research and planting demands of the ever growing global food chain While Meizheng was only consolidated for part of the fourth quarter  we were pleased with its double digit growth and early synergies  As we look ahead  critical to our success will be our ability to execute across the Company on three key priorities we have laid out for our organization this year  ensuring a customer first mindset  innovating to address critical health and scientific challenges and evolving our employee experience  From the customers  standpoint providing exceptional experiences with PerkinElmer means that we are improving our tools  processes and responsiveness to deliver solutions when  where and how our customers need them On the innovation front  this year you will see us further our partnerships with customers and industry organizations to accelerate the visibility and development of new offerings across our end markets  And internally we will continue to work on creating a culture that drives greater cross company collaboration than ever before Before I hand it over to Jamey  I want to briefly provide an update on Vanadis  Earlier this month  our team hosted people from the investment community at our lab in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania where we discussed Vanadis and the broader PerkinElmer genomic strategy  Specific to Vanadis the key messages that we try to drive home were Vanadis NIPT is a test for every woman due to its high precision and low no call rate  The system has clear workflow advantages over NGS  Customer feedback continues to remain positive and the NIPT market is sizable and growing rapidly We truly believe that Vanadis NIPT will play a pivotal role in helping to democratize noninvasive prenataltesting across the globe over the next few decades  In terms of placements in 2019  we achieved 28 systems and we continue to have a healthy funnel For 2020  our plan is to end the year between 50 to 55 installations in total  which would imply another 22 to 27 systems this year  up from 10 placements in 2018 and 18 placements in 2019  All told I m confident that we are on the right path as an organization  While there were a lot of internal changes in 2019  we are now well positioned as we turn the page to the next chapter of the PerkinElmer story  I look forward to sharing our continued progress throughout the year I ll now hand it over to Jamey to discuss our Q4 and 2019 financial Results in more detail as well as our 2020 guidance Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Prahlad and good evening everyone  Before I start  I want to point everyone s attention to our fourth quarter earnings call presentation  which has been posted on the Investors section of our website under financial information  The goal of this document is to drive additional transparency and simplicity around the Company and our quarterly performance  Today I plan to begin by highlighting the fourth quarter  Then I ll provide some additional color on our served end markets and financial metrics  Lastly  I ll finish by providing a look back on our 2019 performance and our financial outlook for 2020 Jumping in  we are pleased with our fourth quarter results and full year 2019 performance  Market conditions were in line with our expectations  entering the fourth quarter  As they have all year  our growth accelerators continued to perform well  lead by EUROIMMUN which grew at a double digit clip on broad based global demand and cannabis which more than doubled year over year  Our genomics testing business remains on track to complete the Branford to Pittsburgh consolidation by the end of the first quarter and Vanadis momentum continues to build As Prahlad mentioned  the recent granting of the Vanadis NIPT PLA code by the American Medical Association  was an important development in December that favorably positioned Vanadis Diagnostics for 2020  Our 2019 acquisitions of Cisbio  Meizheng and Solus all performed well during the quarter and concluded the year well positioned to be strong  incremental contributors in the years ahead From an operational standpoint  prior actions to reduce organizational complexity undoubtedly made us a nimbler organization  Our 50  organic incremental margin in 2019 is a direct product of the increased transparency and accountability across the organization Turning to the fourth quarter results  We achieved 5  organic revenue growth with broad based momentum across our portfolio  Adjusted reported revenue grew 6  to  806 million and included a 1  foreign exchange headwind and a 2  net acquisition tailwind  By business Diagnostics  representing 38  of total sales grew 5  organically driven by our immunodiagnostics and reproductive health business lines  Discovery   Analytical Solutions representing 62  of total sales also grew 5  organically due to continued strength in life sciences and a rebound in our core food business  I will provide some additional color on both businesses in a moment On a geographic basis  organic growth trends  largely paralleled what we experienced during the third quarter  Asia Pacific and Europe both grew mid single digits  While the Americas grew low single digits  Operationally  we are extremely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and we continue to see significant potential to improve our profitability moving forward Adjusted operating margins expanded 210 basis points in the fourth quarter to 23 9  driven by productivity  mix  cost out actions and some timing  As Prahlad mentioned  adjusted earnings per share of  1 35 was an increase of 14  versus the fourth quarter of 2018 and  0 03 ahead of our guidance  Looking further into the key drivers within our segments  let s start with our Diagnostics business  As mentioned in my earlier remarks  organic revenue grew 5  which was off a strong 14  organic growth comparison in 4Q  18  Immunodiagnostics grew low double digits  EUROIMMUN led the way with a mid teens growth rate which was broad based from both a geographic and product basis Geographically  the US and Western Europe both grew over 20  and China grew at a healthy mid teens clip  Reproductive health grew low single digits organically driven by expanded coverage in Asia Pacific  We highlighted expanded newborn screening in the Philippines on our last earnings call  Additionally  we also benefited from expanded screening programs in Japan and Vietnam in 2019  Paralleling the third quarter our applied genomics business remained soft  declining high single digits in the fourth quarter  Momentum in our NGS and nucleic acid extraction reagents was more than offset by softness in automated workstation and robotics products segments Turning to Discovery   Analytical Solutions  organic growth of 5  in the fourth quarter was driven by our life sciences and food franchises  By end market  we experienced high single digit organic revenue growth in pharma biotech propelled by our Discovery and Informatics product lines Our informatics business continues to perform well  growing double digits in the fourth quarter  PerkinElmer Signals solutions are increasingly gaining traction among the top pharma  biotech and contract research organizations as Signals helps drive increased collaboration  improve efficiencies and accelerate time to discovery for R D scientists  The applied markets were up mid single digits in the quarter  driven by an improvement in our core food business  continued strength in our cannabis solutions and a modest sequential improvement in Asia Pacific industrial and environmental safety demand  Overall industrial and environmental grew approximately 1   Food was up mid teens with core food up mid single digits and cannabis up over 150  year over year Shifting to below the line items  adjusted net interest and other expense for the fourth quarter was approximately  13 million and our adjusted tax rate was approximately 16  Turning to the balance sheet  we finished the year with approximately  2 1 billion of debt and  192 million of cash  Free cash flow in the quarter was  192 million and adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was  193 million  As a reminder  the difference between the reported and the adjusted number is due to cash payments associated with prior acquisitions For the year  we achieved an adjusted free cash flow conversion of 70  which was an improvement versus 2018  While this was short of our 80  estimate  we understand the fundamental levers of the shortfall and we feel confident that we have the right action plans in place to improve the conversion rate over the coming years Finally  we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2 8 times  Turning to the full year results  We are very pleased by our performance  the progress we made aligning our organization and the relentless focus of our entire organization displayed during times of internal change and external macro uncertainty For 2019 we posted 5  organic revenue growth and 14  adjusted earnings per share growth  Except for core food  end markets performance played out as we expected entering the year and conditions were consistent throughout the year  From an adjusted EPS standpoint we beat the midpoint of our initial guide by  0 07 due to our strong margin performance and improved tax benefits  which more than offset a slight organic shortfall  As we transition to 2020  we remain excited by the prospects for growth given the portfolio transformation over the past few years  including our recent acquisitions  the momentum of our growth accelerators and our new organizational structure Consequently  for 2020  we expect 5  to 6  organic growth and reported revenue to be between  3 05 billion and  3 09 billion  including  12 million from foreign exchange headwinds and approximately  35 million of contributions from acquisitions  We are forecasting full year adjusted EPS guidance of  4 50 to  4 60  up 10  to 12  and including a  0 02 headwind from foreign exchange  We expect to expand our operating margin    adjusted operating margin by 80 basis points Finally  we anticipate  54 million in adjusted interest and other expenses  a 16  tax rate and our share count to average  112 million for the year  Embedded in this full year guide is the impact from a 53rd fiscal week in 2020  As most of you know  PerkinElmer operates on a 364 day fiscal calendar  Therefore  similar to the year 2015 every fifth year includes a 53rd week  For 2020 we anticipate the impact of the 53rd week will be approximately  10 million to  15 million of revenue  However  given the extra week of expenses  the extra week will dilute our adjusted operating margin by 25 basis points to 30 basis points and adjusted EPS by a negative  0 03 to  0 05  For modeling purposes the extra week falls into the first quarter We anticipate adjusted free cash flow conversion of 75  to 80  during the 2020 fiscal year which would represent a 5  to 10  improvement year over year  We are acutely focused on improving our free cash flow conversion in a prudent way while balancing growth and profitability  It is going to be a two to three year process to get back to the 85  to 90  range Turning to the first quarter of 2020  we are forecasting reported revenue of  700 million  representing 6  organic revenue growth  including a foreign exchange headwind of approximately  8 million versus the comparable prior period  In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance for the first quarter  we are forecasting  0 70  We expect the impact from the extra week to dilute our first quarter operating margin rate by 90 basis points to 110 basis points  Excluding the extra week  foreign exchange headwind and higher tax rate  earnings in the first quarter would be up 9  to 12   Again  all of this is noted in the last page of our fourth quarter earnings presentation  which I mentioned earlier Before I hand it back to the operator  the growing corona virus outbreak is a concern on multiple fronts  First  our thoughts and prayers go out to those impacted  Teams across PerkinElmer are actively working to develop solutions to control and hopefully help stop the spread of this infection  That said  we have not embedded any financial impact in our first quarter or full year guidance  If the epidemic continues to grow  it could negatively impact our EUROIMMUN and CIMBio franchises  given patients in China may avoid going to the hospital for immunology and infectious disease testing  There are currently a lot of unknowns  Therefore  we think it is prudent to highlight this risk going into the year This concludes my prepared remarks  Operator  at this time  we would like to open the call to questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird  Your line is open Catherine Ramsey    Robert W  Baird    AnalystHey guys  Thanks for the questions  I just wanted to go back to that first quarter guide  If we back out that extra week  I think the first quarter comes in closer to 3 5  to 4   despite having a fairly easy comp with the government shutdown we saw last year  So can you just walk us through the pluses and minuses off of what you think a normalized growth rate should look like in that first quarter Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  thanks  Catherine  I ll take this one  So I think if you back out the extra week  it s more like 4  to 4 5  in the first quarter  which is down versus every I think    every quarter in the year 2019 we reported 5  organic growth  So it s a similar comp throughout the year  I think there s two things largely that are affecting us in the first quarter First genomics testing  if you remember 2019 we started off very high  particularly in the sequencing part of that business  And so that had a great first half and a little bit softer second half due to the consolidation  We expect that to continue into the first quarter  So that s probably 0 5 point of organic growth by itself  what we re planning on in the first quarter here And the second area is applied genomics  Similarly  what I mentioned on robotics and automated workstations that had a stronger first half  weaker second half  We re expecting that to continue into the first half year  And so  those two things really are the only difference between our 5  organic run rate that we saw throughout the year  including the fourth quarter and walking into the first quarter here Catherine Ramsey    Robert W  Baird    AnalystOkay  And on that applied genomics business  we ve seen a number of data points suggesting that DTC microarray industry will continue to have some meaningful headwinds this year  Now you have some exposure there  So how do you think about that business returning to better growth Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Catherine  this is Prahlad  So I think our exposure to the DTC market is not much  Most of our relationships there are pharma and on the newborn screening side  The thing that we are just going through is the consolidation piece that we    as we ve pointed out earlier  by the end of Q1 that should be resolved  So we don t    we  at this point  don t see that as our exposure to DTC is not too much Catherine Ramsey    Robert W  Baird    AnalystGreat  thank you Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Catherine OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel  Your line is open Dan Arias    Stifel    AnalystGood afternoon  guys  Thanks Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi  Dan Dan Arias    Stifel    AnalystMaybe just on    hey  Jamey    maybe just on Vanadis since Prahlad touched on it and we were just out there  what kind of revenues are you thinking that the placements in utilization will yield for 2020  And then along those lines  can you just sort of talk to the visibility that you have when you think about the labs that will get you there  Is there a volume trajectory that you feel confident about at this point or is it still kind of fluid in terms of what the ramp will look like Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Dan  in fact as a matter of fact we have a very healthy funnel and we are actually in the    currently in the process of shipping and installing several systems  As we ve said earlier and I have  our focus right now continues to be that the earlier adopters have a flawless experience If you just look at what I pointed out earlier of 50 to 55 installations  Dan  We have placed 10 systems in 2018  18 systems in 2019 and the implied range between 22 to 27 in 2020  So from our perspective  we think installations are an important metric to track early on in the product s life cycle  But in the end  eventually as I ve said  our goal is to democratize Vanadis NIPT  So that s where we are focusing And also with the NIPT PLA code  that gives us several advantages in the US once that is issued  So from a priority perspective  we are looking at the number of installations  getting the clinical data out and working on the PLA code Dan Arias    Stifel    AnalystOkay  So it sounds like that s a TBD on a forecast for Vanadis Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think from a revenue perspective our guidance will be to continue to monitor the number of installations Dan Arias    Stifel    AnalystOkay  Okay and then just secondly  Jamey  if I just think about the top line guide and I take out the half  one  Phonetic  or so that you re getting from the extra week  that s 5  organic at the midpoint  which is in line with 2019  which is a year where you had some organizational issues and then either one off or maybe somewhat unlikely to repeat elements  And then I think at the end of this year you should also be getting a little bit of juice from Meizheng  So I guess how much of the outlook for 2020 on the organic side is conservatism to start the year versus maybe something that s under appreciated about either the DX ramp or the factors that are at play in DAS Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  good question  So I mean maybe we just kind of talk through the end markets here  Dan  So I would say where we have a little bit of incremental caution is around life sciences and immunodiagnostics  I ll start with immunodiagnostics  Obviously EUROIMMUN leads the way there  They have been mid teens for quite some time  but I think we re pretty consistent in saying that we re going to model them at 12  organic growth  So I think we expect a little bit of down downtick there Life sciences  I don t think we ve seen anything  but funding levels have remained very strong  And so we re hopeful that it continues  but I d say there s probably more downside than there is the upside  So I d say that s where we re cautionary Conversely  if you look at food and applied genomics  food what we ve talked about in terms of some kind of rebound in the core  and we had at least one data point here in the fourth quarter  should provide some upside  Offsetting that  I don t anticipate cannabis being as large an incremental contributor this year  So those kind of offset a little bit there And then applied genomics  once we get through the first half we ll see how it s going  but hopefully that has a little bit of easier comp  Indecipherable     comp as well in the second half year  So overall  Dan  to answer your question probably a little bit cautious in life sciences and immunodiagnostics  maybe a little bit of upside in food and applied genomics  the others pretty steady Dan Arias    Stifel    AnalystOkay  thanks a lot Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Derik DeBruin with Bank of America  Your line is open Derik DeBruin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  thanks  So a couple of questions  I think the first one  did    I think some companies  but maybe you don t have as much exposure here  but I think some companies were flagging that they didn t expect a significant budget flush during the fourth quarter from some of their customers as in prior years  I m just wondering what you saw in terms of incremental spending and just sort of what was sort of like the year end budget activity Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  it s always difficult to tell  Derik  but I don t think we saw much  In terms of life sciences  actually it was a little soft in the Americas in the fourth quarter  Applied market hung in there in the fourth quarter  So maybe there s a little bit off there  But I d say it s difficult to tell and overall  nothing out of the ordinary here Derik DeBruin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  And just on the China  I appreciate the comments on the corona virus  I mean  we ve been getting some questions today just given that you do have an infectious disease testing business that you ve got  Just sort of  I think we were wondering  would you    are you testing for it  are you going to see potentially any incremental sales into your diagnostics products to potentially offset some of the headwinds you re referring to Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And maybe I ll take that  So  Derik  we are in the process of developing a PCR and an antibody assay  PCR is generally a frontline assay during an outbreak and we are making strides  But we do have to take it through the CFDA which is now the NMPA approval process  And they are working with us and with several other entities to get a front line testing assay out Again  most of the focus right now is doing it more from a CSR perspective  just to make sure that we have an assay that we can use for testing  What s the commercial impact of that  I would say at this point is unknown Derik DeBruin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks  And Jamey if I can squeeze one more in  So if you    if you adjust for the extra week  about a 105 basis points  110 basis points of implied op margin expansion in 2020  I guess is that a    I mean  how sustainable is that through like 100 basis points number on a go forward basis  I mean  is there incremental    you re sort of at your 22  ish operating margin target that you put out there a few years ago  Is there an upside to that number Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean like we ve been saying  we see a lot of room for continued expansion and profitability here  And I don t think 22  was ever a stopping point  We see that ultimately over time getting up into the mid 20 s  How much can be done in the year 2020  we think 100 basis points ex the extra week is a pretty healthy clip coming off 170 basis point in 2019 To your point  I mean we guided in 2019 120 basis points to 250 basis points and ended up beating that at 170 basis points  So could there be upside to the 80 basis points that we re guiding  sure  But I think we re more focused on the long term and putting programs in place to get this to the mid 20 s OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI  Your line is open Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystHey guys  Thanks for taking my question  Jamey  if I could just touch on the margin question  Extra week incremental revenues  can you walk us like why margins would be down  I would have thought the extra revenues benefited margins Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  You re talking for the quarter  Vijay  or for the year Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystQuarter and now for the year  I m just curious why incremental revenues have lower margins Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So if you look at it  Vijay  the    and then we tried to lay this out in our earnings presentation  the exact numbers  so we feel like the extra week will provide  10 million to  15 million of additional revenue  which is not what we experienced  if you just take our total year and divide by 52 weeks  But we think that that s the right amount of extra revenue coming in the year However  if you look at the expenses for an extra week that more than offsets that amount of gross margin  So if you take the  10 million to  15 million  you get a 50  roughly thereabouts gross margin then you add an extra week of operating expenses  and an extra week of interest expense  it s actually dilutive to the year  And like I said  we tried to lay that out both for the quarter and for the year on that last page in the earnings presentation Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot you  And then maybe just a follow up on that theme  the extra week  One on Vanadis  is there    are you guys in a position to compete for tenders in Europe  And related to that extra week that  10 million to  15 million is sub 50 basis points on the top line  Should it be just  if you did the one week or for 53  something higher than what the implied on the extra week is Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLet me start with the extra week  then Prahlad is going to jump in on Vanadis here  So we think most of our customers  and we actually saw this back in 2015  operate on a calendar year  so January 1st to December 31st  And if you look at where the extra days in this year fall  they fall on the fringes  So take this quarter for example  December 31st and 31st for 2019 actually fall in this fiscal year 2020  But we think that the revenue from that is mostly going to be spent in the 2019  And therefore  it was recorded in our 2019 revenue So once you back out a couple of those days  you get down to  let s say  three more days and a lot of that is capex  some of that is scheduled professional services  so not just a daily run rate  And so therefore you get down to some recurring revenues that are  we believe  in the 10  to 15  range  which ends up being a 1 5  to 2   which was very    in sort of the third quarter 2015  we actually said that it was 2  impact to our organic growth  So it s kind of a similar operating assumption here Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd Vijay to your    for the first part of your question  yeah  we are    we can and are starting to participate in tenders in Europe Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystThat s helpful  Prahlad  And just to be clear  the guidance has no assumptions around any potential wins in Europe on Vanadis Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think what we are assuming basically is 22 to 27 installations  So some of it is in Europe  some is in Asia and some is it in the    some in the US  We are not sort of focusing on which particular tender  Vijay  we could win or which we would win Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerBut there will be some capex revenue in our   Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerThat will come from  Speech Overlap Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIn our year guidance as well as some sample ramp as well Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot you  Thank you  guys Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research  Your line is open Stephen Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystHi  good afternoon  Thanks for the time here  I was hopping first if you could help unpack your thought process around reproductive in the 2020 guidance  Birth rates  particularly in China  were a headwind there in 2019  What do you expect for broader growth in that category  And how are you thinking about the birth rate dynamic prospectively Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So I think    hey  Steve  Overall we think reproductive health ticks up a little bit  So we ve got Vanadis that should kick in  some genomics testing that gets reported in there that should kick in and some    I don t anticipate    we re not anticipating any good news on birth rates  We think we ve continued to see significant issues particularly in China  We expect that to continue We have a lot of good APAC expansion that I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks around the Philippines  in Japan and Vietnam  So that has a little pressure  So net net  there is probably a little bit of upside to reproductive health year over year  but we re definitely planning on birth rates impacting us and we ll see where geographic expansion gets us Stephen Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  And then    not just for 2020  but maybe even far out  Phonetic  with a medium term bent  I wonder if you could speak for a minute about cannabis  You mentioned that the growth in fact for cannabis in 2020  you expect to be somewhat smaller than it was in 2019  Can you put any numbers around that and is that a market that s just somewhat matured or is there a competitive dynamic  Why would that be slower growth after a big 2019  Thanks Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean in cannabis this year performed extremely well  We re thrilled with the team  the solution that we bring  Prahlad mentioned that it was  26 million in revenue  which was off a  10 million base  That kind of incremental contributor is difficult to predict and we are not banking on that in this guidance  We expect it to go up still at a double digit rate  But to go up another  16 million just feels like a significant planning assumption that we re not  It could happen  but that s not what we re banking on right now So the market still seems great  We ll see how states roll out  I think there s a couple more that will come online in 2020  But I don t think we re going to bank on that kind of incremental contributor this year Stephen Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  Thank you for all the color guys Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Steve OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan  Your line is open Tycho Peterson    JP Morgan    AnalystHey  Thanks  Sorry to go back to the 1Q guide  but you mentioned backing out the extra week  EPS would have grown 9  to 12    0 75 to  0 77  That s still below consensus  I would have thought with the recent reorganization efforts you would have at least been able to guide to consensus  So can you just talk about if there are other offsets other than the extra week that are kind of weighing on the EPS in the first quarter Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean    hey  Tycho  So in general there s probably a little bit of mix difference in the gross margin line versus what we kind of exited the last end of the year on as well as on the operating margin line  There s a little bit of comp timing year over year as well as some investments we re making in our growth accelerators in terms of Vanadis and cannabis etc  that kind of set up the year  So overall we think we d be up about 40 basis points in the quarter excluding the extra week and that continues to uptick throughout the year here Tycho Peterson    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  And then a couple of quick clean ups  It sounds like the Vanadis installed base went down  It was 19 last quarter  Now you re saying 18  Was there something    is it customer return or why did it go down Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerTycho  it s 28  So till the end of the third quarter we were 19 and that went to 28 Tycho Peterson    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay Maybe  Tycho  what we were saying was in 2018 we delivered 10 systems  In 2019  we added 18 systems to get to 28  Next year  we re guiding somewhere in the 22 to 27 Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive Officer27 Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo we re taking a methodical approach to increase our placements every year and be prudent on how we roll out these systems Tycho Peterson    JP Morgan    AnalystAll right  And then on EUROIMMUN  mid teens in the fourth quarter  you made a comment that that s maybe not sustainable and we should be back to thinking 12   maybe 13   Was there something in the fourth quarter that allowed it to overshoot to the upside Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  no  I mean  look  we hope that it s mid teens  I think we ve been consistent in saying that we re going to budget a year at 12  going forward  That s what we plan in the initial deal model throughout the first two years of having EUROIMMUN in the PerkinElmer family  it s grown mid teens both years  maybe it does again  But we ve always been consistent in saying we d like to plan this at about 12  based upon terrific product introductions  geographic expansion  including the US and we just think 12  is a good operating assumption Tycho Peterson    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  And then just one last quick one on the genomics  the automation  it sounds like you re going to recapture half of it in the first quarter  Was that in line with your original expectation or were you expecting to recapture most of that in the fourth quarter Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  not as much  Actually  Tycho  we re expecting that to persist into the first quarter  So some of the pressure we saw in the second half of 2019 we re expecting to persist  We keep seeing things pushed to the right here from a demand perspective and we re not banking on that that will change in the first half year Naturally when you get to the second half  you get a different comp  If it s better than that  we re happy  But right now our operating assumption is that we re going to continue on with the growth rates we saw in the second half of 2019 into the first half of 2020 Tycho Peterson    JP Morgan    AnalystGot it  Okay  Thanks Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi  Your line is open Patrick Donnelly    Citi    AnalystGreat  thanks  Maybe just building on Tycho s question on EUROIMMUN  Can you just talk through how sensitive that business is to the China hospital volume  And then maybe just give us some color on what the volume per day looks like on the gross there Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Patrick  I think it will be difficult to give a volume per day  I think as Jamey pointed out in his remarks  given the evolving situation right now  all we are doing is highlighting the corona virus thing  We don t know what the impact of that will be  It all depends on how it plays out over the next few days or weeks  I think the point that Jamey made to Tycho s earlier question is that EUROIMMUN has done better than what we have forecasted in the deal model  which has been 12  over the past couple of years and we hope that it continues to do that way  From our forecasting perspective  we have modeled it at 12  Patrick Donnelly    Citi    AnalystOkay  And then maybe Jamey just on the cash flow  appreciate the 75  to 80  conversion guidance  Can you just talk about some internal initiatives you guys are focused on there  I know you had some headwinds around receivables and inventory kind of extended out some agreement terms  Can you just talk about the trends you re expecting in 2020 there  the focus points Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  sure  Thanks  Patrick  So I mean we ve learned a lot about cash flow over the last year here and we ve made some progress  not where we wanted it to go to  but definitely some uptick  The 2020 operating assumption is that working capital turns are basically static  Unlike the last couple of years where we ve actually been reducing our working capital turns and it s been a headwind  So there is internal processes around things like billing and invoicing accuracy and timeliness and collection efforts  etc  But really  when you look at receivables it s in three or four different business models And we expect some of that to somewhat plateau in 2020  We ve seen terms changing  particularly in China and some of the emerging markets that are much more developed now  Informatics  we ve started to sell subscriptions on a three year basis a couple of years ago  So we should expect some more cash from that  Cannabis  we ve been leaning into a little bit here  So the fundamental embedded in the 75  to 80  is basically static from an efficiency standpoint  which will be great  Hopefully  there s upside and certainly over the next couple of years we will drive that The second thing I d say is around capital expenditures  So capital expenditures downtick I think about 20  this year  We didn t repeat some of the investments in genomics and we ve been kind of monitoring EUROIMMUN  I would say over the next couple of years  there are two remaining areas that require capital expansion  That s EUROIMMUN in China  we re building out a facility there  and then our Tulip business in India  growing extremely well  And we got to increase some of the facility space there  But after that  I don t think we see a lot of capital expansion  So we ve kind of reduced it a little bit here  It will be static for a little while and then hopefully that downticks over time Patrick Donnelly    Citi    AnalystAppreciate it OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen  Your line is open Doug Schenkel    Cowen and Co     AnalystHey  good afternoon guys  I m just going to ask three quick ones and then get back into the queue  Just getting on the train and I don t want to have too much of background noise  So first  following up on Patrick s question  has there been or is there any formal change  plan for incentive comp as it relates to free cash flow conversion  And the second  what assumptions for growth by geography are embedded into revenue growth guidance for the year  And three  what are your capital deployment priorities for the year  Do you have a target in terms of capital you intend to deploy and what s the mix you d expect between share repurchases and M A  Thank you Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  sure  So I didn t catch the second one  But I ll answer the other two and then I ll ask you to repeat that one  Doug  So  incentive comp is now in all of our financial plans  Free cash    or sorry  free cash flow is now in our incentive comp plans  So that answers that question From a capital deployment perspective  we continue to remain acquisition first from a priority standpoint  And so  I think if you look at the last couple of years we did four acquisitions in  18  four acquisitions in  19  We always look at a healthy pipeline  I think you can expect us to be active there  The dollar amount may fluctuate  But I think that s still our priority here from a capital deployment We ended leverage a little bit down versus the end of last year and our liquidity is much stronger after the refinancing  And then in terms of where  it s always been pretty consistent  I think we re primarily focused on diagnostics and life sciences  And I think that s it  And you cut out on the second question there  Doug  What was the second question Doug Schenkel    Cowen and Co     AnalystYeah  Sorry about that  Jamey  What are your assumptions for growth by geography in terms of what you ve embedded into your revenue growth guidance for the year Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  good question  So basically we re pretty much mid single digit across the board  If you look at Americas and APAC  that s been mid single digits all of 2019  Europe was low single digits  We expect the Vanadis kind of revenue to clip that over into maybe the mid single digit train  Phonetic   I call it a weaker mid single digit  So  pretty consistent across the board and pretty consistent with what we saw in 2019 Doug Schenkel    Cowen and Co     AnalystOkay  thank you Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays  Your line is open Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystThanks  good afternoon  I wanted to start maybe move back to DAS  I was curious what you re seeing from your industrial customers  what that grew in the fourth quarter and just given the current state of the macro what the 2020 guidance assumes there in terms of progression Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo I think we ll talk about 4Q to start with  Jamey Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  4Q was flat  consistent with where it s been most of the year  Jack Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystAnd then for 2020 Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe expect no change  Industrial environmental has been remarkably consistent for us  pretty flat throughout the entire year  And I think that s our operating assumption going into 2020 Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystGreat  Okay  And then back on the Diagnostics business  I wanted to follow up on the genetic testing lab  Just marking to market  what was the final contribution for 2019  What does the guidance assume for 2020 contribution  And given the pace of the transition  is there any additional timing dynamic there assuming for the first quarter as well Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  so 2019 genomics testing did extremely well  Obviously  it was much stronger in the first half  Then the second half  it was probably a little under  20 million in total  In terms of 2020  I think we d rather not give the specific guidance here  but you can expect that it s going to grow substantially  And in terms of the cadence through the year  I mentioned in my earlier remarks that the first quarter will continue to be challenged  because the consolidation is not supposed to happen until the    well  it s happening right now an the real roadblock there is hiring  We feel good about it  but sometimes it can take two to three months to on board people in that space  And so we feel like the second quarter is when we ll start to ramp back up again  And so overall  we expect another healthy incremental growth driver from genomics testing in 2020 Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystGreat  If I could squeeze in one more  What were the individual contributions from Meizheng and Cisbio  The acquired growth in DAS was a little bit higher than what you were looking for  Just was there anything outside that contributed in the quarter Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  not really  no  Cisbio and Meizheng both continued to do well  I think we said Meizheng had been growing into the 20  plus range and continues to perform well  We got I think 11 out of 13 weeks or something in the quarter from them  And Cisbio has been double digit all year Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystGreat  Thanks  Jamey Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Jack OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies  Your line is open Brandon Couillard    Jefferies    AnalystHey  thanks  Good afternoon  Hey  Prahlad  curious if you could just touch on the services business for a minute  I know you did some restructuring there in the third quarter  I m just curious what your outlook is for the OneSource business  specifically enterprise services as you look into  20 Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Brandon  I think in terms of the services business we did some restructuring as you said  And this was again innovate the implementation of ServiceMax  We continue to sort of see productivity coming out of there  I think as we look forward  we are in a good position for 2020 and we expect to win some tenders  And I think as we ve said it will continue to be a high single digit growth business for us Brandon Couillard    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  Then one just for Jamey on the tax rate ticking up a little bit this year  Is there anything specific behind that or just an added level of conservatism just sort of embedded for the tax rate  Thanks Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  Yeah  I mean it s a good question  Brandon  It had gotten down to about 14  in 2018  We guided 16  for the year and came in at 15   So there is a little natural uptick in tax  I think if you look at where we are growing  you look at EUROIMMUN  you look at informatics  enterprise  a lot of those areas are higher tax jurisdictions  So therefore  we do anticipate that to go up a little  And then the offset to that  which is difficult to forecast  are some of the discrete items  We always have tax planning items  We had a lot in 2019 which basically brought us from the 16  down to 15   But there is a little natural upward pressure there that makes us think that 16  is the right number Brandon Couillard    Jefferies    AnalystVery good  Thank you Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo  Your line is open Dan Leonard    Wells Fargo    AnalystThank you  A couple of things  One  Prahlad you teased us with some potential proof points coming in 2020 as a result of the combined efforts of the organization  Are these    whether they d be new product introductions or service efforts or what have you  are these things that would have an impact in 2020 or are these things that would build and have a further impact in 2021 and beyond Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think we started seeing some of the benefits already  as I pointed out  the whole cannabis workflow solutions that we have seen  There have been other examples of where we ve combined our sample prep business from the applied genomics side with reagents from oure life sciences business  So we ve started seeing proof points of this and I don t think it s going to be a discrete 2020 item  It will continue to be ongoing and we expect to see more synergistic opportunities coming out of this Dan Leonard    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  And then secondly  can you walk me through your strategy to go from    you mentioned the PLA code    can you walk through your strategy to go from that PLA code to getting that code included in medical coverage policies for NIPT Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think just getting the code offers us the advantage that as a manufacturer we can devote negotiated reimbursement rates directly with payers and direct billing on a methodology that would be specific to Vanadis NIPT  And that hopefully offers better reimbursement rate for the laboratories  And also additionally we can bill insurance without any risk of incorrect coding So I think that s the level I want to share just given the competitive situations and for commercial reasons  But at this point really what I would say is that we are really excited what AMA s acceptance of our PLA code that came in at the end of December  And right now we are all hands on to ensure that the submissions get in time and we get the code in hand Dan Leonard    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  thank you  And then just final cleanup for Jamey  Jamey  what was the China growth rate in Q4  Was it consistent with the mid single digits of APAC or was it higher or lower than that Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerConsistent with APAC  Dan Dan Leonard    Wells Fargo    AnalystThank you Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo problem OperatorThank you  And we have a question from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery  Your line is open Paul Knight    Janney Montgomery Scott    AnalystThanks for the time  The    I know the product portfolio has clearly benefited from cannabis and food safety testing  Is there any goal you would have or point out on the R D that you want to spend this year  Is it increasing faster than revenue  And what are the    some of the areas you would like to develop further Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Paul  overall R D  if you look at it in 2019  we actually saw a little bit of efficiency and that was related to some of the organizational restructuring  We want that to be ticking up a little bit over time  And so what s embedded in this guidance is kind of a constant R D as a percent of sales  if anything  maybe a little bit of uptick  You mentioned cannabis and food  that s one of the areas that we re increasing some of our budget  And I think in general  we re putting a little bit more resources between    behind life sciences  diagnostics and food  And I think you can expect that R D as a percent of revenue will be at least flat if not up a little bit this year Paul Knight    Janney Montgomery Scott    AnalystOkay  thank you Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS  Your line is open Daniel Brennan    UBS Equities    AnalystGreat  Thanks for the questions  So Jamey or Prahlad  just wondering for DAS  I don t know if you guys broke out exactly what s baked in for 2020 guidance overall  And then maybe within that  I know you touched on applied and environmental book  Can you break down a little bit food and biopharma  Both were solid in the quarter  kind of what s baked in going forward and what s    kind of  what is the outlook Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think we re optimistic to have  Phonetic  upticks here  And maybe it s a point or point and a half  Phonetic   If you look at food  I mentioned it earlier  I mean we expect some kind of rebound in core food  Fourth quarter was a good data point  If nothing else  there is some good comp here  Obviously it s difficult to predict weather and climate change  And if that impacts us then that will be different than what we re planning on  But core food should rebound  I mentioned that cannabis will have a slight offset to that though that we re not expecting as much incremental contributors  But net net I think food ticks up a little bit Life sciences  I think ticked up a little bit  We talked about    Prahlad talked about some of our enterprise business going well and some extra tenders and an extra week here  I think Cisbio and informatics continues to be extremely strong  both were double digit this year  We re planning them more in the high single digit range  So we haven t seen anything  but I just don t think we re going to plan them at double digit  So net net  that probably upticks a little bit And then industrial and environmental  we are planning flat  So no change from 2019  So if you mix a little bit of improvement in the life sciences and food  you probably uptick a little bit in DAS year over year Daniel Brennan    UBS Equities    AnalystGreat  thank you  And then if you kind of pull this go back a little bit  I know like a year or so ago the conversation was maybe kind of high single digit growth type of portfolio which obviously you guys still sound very constructive on the momentum that you have with all the business changes  But when you think about 2020 guidance  you ve given a lot of color on the different businesses  but how would you characterize the 5  balance or is there a conservatism in it  And if you had to call out a swing factor on the upside or downside what would that be  Thank you Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And I think    look  again we continue to be very excited about the portfolio and the prospects that we have for accelerating profitable growth  You ve got a lot of fans in the fire  I think entering the year  we are trying to be balanced  given there are some uncertainties that we see  And again example that Jamey talked about just coming in  is with the corona virus  You don t know how that plays out  but essentially the growth accelerators that we have are inherently the swing factors that will play a very important role as we look forward Daniel Brennan    UBS Equities    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorThank you  We have a question from Bill Quirk with Piper Sandler  Your line is open William Quirk    Piper Sandler    AnalystGreat  thanks  Good evening  everybody  So a couple of questions for me  First off  Prahlad  really do appreciate all the Vanadis commentary  Is there any    just I guess last question maybe on that    any particular geography or customer type where you re seeing an outsized interest and success in terms of placements  And then secondly  just staying in diagnostics for a moment  with respect to the corona virus assay development  the CDC has some emergency procedures in place to be able to rapidly disseminate tests from a regulatory standpoint  Are you familiar  are you aware of a similar type of program in any of the other affected countries  Thanks Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  and just starting with your first question around Vanadis  I think from an interest perspective  we are seeing interest in all the three    all the three regions  In APAC ex China given that we don t have approval in China yet  we are going through the clinical  In Europe and of course with the recent launch that we did in the US  we continue to see broad spread interest on it In regards to your second question  yes  similar to the CPC the CFDA    the MMPA and CFDA in China also has accelerated emergency processes that they have in place and we are working with them to get a test out hopefully in a few weeks William Quirk    Piper Sandler    AnalystGreat  thank you very much Prahlad Singh    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah OperatorThank you  And we have a question from Derik DeBruin with Bank of America  Your line is open Derik DeBruin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  great  Thanks for taking the follow up  Just one question  I just wanted to clarify some since I got a bunch of questions from investors  So typically the rule of thumb  what do you look at extra days is about 0 5  organic revenue growth is a contribution for consumable heavy  Phonetic  companies  So the  10 million to  15 million seems a little bit light in terms of revenue contribution on the extra week  Did I hear you correctly in saying you thought some of that was pull forward into the fourth quarter  I m just trying to say to make sure that is because it just seems like it s a lower number than I would have thought  given your business mix Jamey Mock    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  overall  it s 1 5  to 2   So the rule of thumb of 0 5  times 5 we re only really I guess 0 5  to 1  off here  I don t think it s too different than what we saw in 3Q  15 or the rule of thumb overall  I did say that    yeah  I mean if you look at December 30th and 31st  I think most customers operate on a calendar budget in that our sales force  probably much like every other year looks at the capex spending and says  let s execute those before December 29th and I don t think that s any different than what we ve done in most years  So I think it s pretty much noise around the    around the fringes here Derik DeBruin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  great  thanks  Just want to

119465,340980,PKI,What Investors Liked and Didn t Like About PerkinElmer s Q4 Earnings Results,news,"PerkinElmer  NYSE PKI  entered 2020 with a pretty good head of steam  The global healthcare company saw its shares jump 24  last year  But there hasn t been a lot of news from PerkinElmer so far in January to move the stock either up or down    until yesterday 
The company announced its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year results after the market closed on Monday  Here are the highlights from PerkinElmer s quarterly update 

By the numbers
PerkinElmer reported revenue in the fourth quarter of  805 5 million  This reflected a 6  increase from the prior year period revenue total of  756 3 million  It also topped the consensus Wall Street revenue estimate of  800 9 million 
The company announced net income of  64 5 million  or  0 58 per share  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   In the prior year period  PerkinElmer posted GAAP net income of  71 3 million  or  0 64 per share 
PerkinElmer s adjusted earnings in Q4 came in at  1 35 per share  This was a 14  jump from the  1 18 per share reported in the fourth quarter of 2018  It was also a little better than the average analysts  adjusted earnings estimate of  1 33 per share 
Behind the numbers
The company s discovery and analytical solutions segment was its biggest winner in the fourth quarter  Sales for the segment increased by 8  year over year to  496 5 million 
PerkinElmer s diagnostics segment increased by 4  year over year to  309 million  The segment s organic growth  which excludes the impact of currency fluctuations  acquisitions  and divestitures  was slightly higher at 5  
While the company s year over year GAAP earnings decline might cause some eyebrows to raise  there s more to the story  This negative comparison was primarily due to debt extinguishment costs of  32 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019  The adjusted earnings figure gives a better picture of the company s bottom line status 
CEO Prahlad Singh said   We are pleased with our strong finish to 2019   However  investors weren t quite as pleased  PerkinElmer shares fell by nearly 3  in after hours trading on Monday  spurred more by the company s outlook than its performance in the fourth quarter 
Looking ahead
The company expects that revenue for full year 2020 will be between  3 05 billion and  3 09 billion  The company anticipates GAAP earnings per share  EPS  of  2 89 to  2 99  with adjusted non GAAP EPS between  4 50 and  4 60 
For the first quarter of 2020  PerkinElmer is looking for revenue of  700 million  It also projects Q1 GAAP EPS from continuing operations of  0 33 with adjusted EPS of  0 70    lower than the consensus Wall Street adjusted EPS estimate of  0 84 
This year could be more volatile for healthcare stocks like PerkinElmer than in recent years because of the U S  presidential election  However  Singh stated that PerkinElmer s  rapid transformation we made as an organization over the past few years and in particular 2019 has put us in an excellent position to accelerate profitable growth and advance outcomes around the world in 2020 and beyond  ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnuxt,2069225

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of scientific instruments is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 8  
Revenues are expected to be  644 45 million  up 0 1  from the year ago quarter

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PerkinElmer 
For PerkinElmer  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 64  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that PerkinElmer will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PerkinElmer would post earnings of  1 16 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 18  delivering a surprise of  1 72  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 7  and increasing 44 6  year over year  We believe the upside was driven by robust revenue growth  The stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Revenues increased 4  at constant currency exchange rate  CER  on a year over year basis to  590 million  The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  582 1 million  The stellar top line performance was driven by silicone hydrogel lenses  led by the Clariti and MyDay in the dailies space and Biofinity in the monthly space Segmental AnalysisThe company has two business segments   CooperVision  CVI  and CooperSurgical  CSI  The Cooper Companies  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    CVIRevenues at CooperVision Segment increased 8  at constant currency  cc  to  444 8 million on a year over year basis  The segment continues to gain from the company s silicone hydrogel lenses led by solid prospects in the MyDay  Clariti and Biofinity platforms  Coming to the major catalysts within the CVI segment  robust performance by Toric  31  of CVI revenues   Multifocal  11    single use sphere lenses  26   and non single use sphere lenses  32   propelled solid growth Multifocal revenues rose 5  year over year at

2 million on a year over year basis  However  the company witnessed 32  increase in this segment on a reported basis on the back of the PARAGARD acquisition  The fertility category  39  of CSI revenues  saw a 5  drop in sales at cc to  57 million  Also  the office and surgical products category declined 6  at cc to  88 2 million Margin DetailsAs a percentage of revenues  adjusted gross margin at the CSI segment was 69  in the reported quarter  up 700 basis points  bps  year over year  The margin was negatively impacted by the inventory step up associated with the PARAGARD buyout As a percentage of revenues  adjusted gross margin at the CVI segment was 67  in the reported quarter  higher than 63  of revenues in the year ago quarter  This reflects an increase of 400 bps on f avorable currency and product mix Hence  adjusted gross margin as a whole for Cooper Companies was 68  of revenues  up 500 bps year over year Adjusted operating margin  as a percentage of revenues  was 28  of net revenues in the fiscal first quarter  up 500 bps on a year over year basis GuidanceFor fiscal 2018  total revenues are now expected in the band of  2 510  2 560 million compared with

of  1 865  1 900 million  higher than  1 830  1 865 million  Meanwhile  CSI revenue range has been slashed to  645  660 million from the prior  650  665 million Adjusted earnings per share are now anticipated in the band of  11 70  11 90 versus  11 35  11 65 earlier  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings stands at  11 57  below the guided range Our TakeCooper Companies ended first quarter fiscal 2018 on a solid note  The company s CooperVision business has always been posting impressive results  The company s raised guidance for fiscal 2018 is promising  However  intense competition in the contact lens space will continue to increase pricing pressure for the company Notably  Cooper Companies has completed the acquisition of Paragon Vision Sciences  This added a leading ortho k technology to the company s lens portfolio  Considering the outstanding performance of the stock  we expect Cooper Companies to scale higher in the coming quarters  In this regard  positive long term growth of 10 8  holds promise Key PicksA few better ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express   NASDAQ PETS    PerkinElmer   NYSE PKI   and

seven and 13 years  Notably  the data is based on MiniMed 670G system and was demonstrated at the Advanced Technologies   Treatments for Diabetes  11th International Conference in Vienna  Austria Study Results in DetailThe multi center study had enrolled 105 participants within the 7 13 years  age group  The trial consisted of a two week run in phase along with a study phase of three months  97  of the participants chose to continue using the system as part of a Continued Access Program  Moreover  the study results demonstrated data from the pivotal trial of MiniMed 670G system on patients aged 14 years and above Using the study results  the company has applied for an expanded FDA approval to include the patients ranging from seven to 13 years as eligible for using the MiniMed 670G system  At the same time  the company is working to expand the usage of the product on children aged between two and six years  Hopes are harbored on the effectiveness of this system  which should get greater customer adoptability over time MiniMed 670G at a GlancePost the receipt of the FDA approval in 2016  Medtronic had commercially launched the MiniMed 670G system in June 2017  It is a Hybrid Closed Loop insulin delivery system for Type I diabetic patients aged 14 years or older  The MiniMed 670G system features Medtronic s latest Guardian Sensor 3  a glucose sensor with increased accuracy and enhanced performance  This is the only FDA approved sensor to control a hybrid closed loop system including diagnostic technology that continuously checks sensor health  The system also carries Medtronic s most advanced algorithm known as  SmartGuard HCL technology Developments in Diabetes BusinessMedtronic witnessed sluggish growth in Diabetes business last quarter  However  the company gained on a strong uptake of new sensor augmented insulin pump systems in the United States as well as in the international markets  This growth was temporarily offset by a limited supply of continuous glucose monitor  CGM  sensors  Moreover  a strong customer enrollment under the Priority Access Program briefly affected revenues Per management  the diabetes business should witness revenue growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as the company has finished shipping pumps for the Priority Access Program  Also  the company is moving steadily with its sensor capacity expansion plans  scheduled to be completed in fourth quarter fiscal 2018 Additionally  Medtronic geared up for the international launch of the MiniMed 670G and the U S  launch of CGM system Guardian Connect with sugar IQ in late 2018 and its new professional CGM iPro 3 in 2019  In this regard  the company also announced favorable results supporting the use of CGM on people with type 2 diabetes in October 2017 This apart  we are upbeat about Animas Corporation s  one of the Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  Diabetes Care Companies  exit from the insulin pump business with Medtronic as partner to support a smooth transition for patients  caregivers and healthcare providers  Notably  patients using an Animas insulin pump will be offered the choice to switch to a Medtronic pump Market PotentialAn ageing

Earlier  while providing its 2018 initial outlook  CVS Health noted that  it expects to deliver net revenue growth of 0 75  to 2 5  in the year  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year revenues is pegged at  188 04 billion 
For the first quarter of 2018  the company expects to register adjusted operating profit growth in the range of 0 5  to 4 5  
Our Take
CVS Health ended the year 2017 on a solid note with a better than expected fourth quarter performance  The year over year growth in the top line was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment  benefiting from the upside in the specialty services  However  year over year Retail LTC comparisons were dull

figure however outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  189 million and was above the company s guidance of  187  189 million  The year over year decline was however caused by a fall in Hereditary

120058,341573,PKI,Integra LifeSciences Global Prospects Solid  Competition Rife,opinion,"On Jan 29  we issued an updated research report on Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation   NASDAQ IART    The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Over the past year  Integra LifeSciences has been trading above the broader   The stock has gained 26 4   compared with 4 6  gain of the industry  Integra LifeSciences has been witnessing key developments on the overseas front  International sales within specialty surgical increased in last reported quarter driven by strength in door repair and tissue ablation franchises in Asia Pacific and Europe 
According to the company  the acquisition of Codman will effectively double the company s international business within this segment  Within Orthopedics   Tissue Technologies  international sales increased double digits largely on incremental revenues from Derma Sciences 
Moreover  the consistently strong performance of its Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies  segment buoys optimism  Notably  the company s Regenerative Technologies is the largest franchise under Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies  In the last reported quarter  the company registered mid single digits growth in this franchise primarily on the addition of Derma Sciences and strong growth in inpatient skin portfolio  
Moreover  Integra LifeSciences introduced several products that have expanded its solutions portfolio in the United States hernia repair market and in the European breast reconstruction market  This should spur growth in 2018 

 
We are also encouraged by the company s three pillar strategy  optimize  execute and accelerate growth  According to management  this will help the company s optimize its infrastructure  deliver commitments through improved planning and communication  and grow through the launch of products  internal development  geographic expansion and strategic acquisitions  
However  Integra LifeSciences faces significant competition in the surgical implants and medical instruments market  The company needs to be innovative on the product front to fend off competition  Moreover  consolidation in the industry could lead to intense pricing pressure  Further  the company generates significant revenues from the international business  which increases its vulnerability to adverse currency movements

We ve had old presidents  young ish  presidents  fat presidents  thin presidents  tall and short presidents  presidents of Irish descent  Dutch descent and even our first African American  Now we stand to elect either our first female president or our first non politician president  Whichever way the scales tip  it will be an historic occasion  Which leaves me with one question 
Is it  bleep ing over yet 
A year and a half of insults  half truths  outright lies  rumors  intrigue  passions and   every once in awhile   policy matters  It s a multi billion dollar industry  this business of electing a president in this country  and those involved mean to squeeze every last dime out of it  Personally  I m still getting emails imploring me to donate to various campaigns  what good would an extra  100 or  1000 do for candidates now that the polls are already open 
Barring the three ring circus that was Election 2000  by this time tomorrow we will have a new president   either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton  Market analysts have priced in a 4  bump for stocks if Clinton wins  though yesterday s big up day has likely priced in nearly half of this already  while a Trump win means the market will likely take a 7  hit 
Trump s policies  where they are concrete  represent a dramatic shift from current policy  which means greater uncertainty  The stock market does not like uncertainty  Wall Street s preference would be for a Clinton victory  provided she keeps most economic policies in place  but the Republican Party to retain both houses of Congress   the better to keep gridlock with

120244,341759,PKI,PerkinsElmer  Selling Has Abated  Time To Own The Stock ,opinion,"Being a Market Technician has a lot of freedom  Because my trades are based off of price action I can look at any company in any sector any day for a possible trade  No boundaries  I know that is hard for many to understand  They think we are detached floating through space or something 
I hear things like  these are the clean ones   How can you buy that stock  it has a forward P E of 60 and the industry average is only 33  plus its margins are sinking   or  The economic environment shows a slowing in consumer spending so it is time to pump the brakes on stocks   I have been around the sun a few times and also hold a CFA designation so I know what these people are talking about  And their thoughts and comment may play out eventually over time  But day to day they just do not matter 
One of the quirky things about being a Technician is that sometimes I have no idea what a company does when I am looking at a chart  Here is a good example  PerkinElmer  NYSE PKI   This stock could be the holding company for Perkin s Pancake House  Elmer s Glue  or anything else  So I often look them up to find out what they do  Here is what Yahoo Finance YHOO says about PerkinElmer 

Well that clears things up  So no pancakes or glue  but huh  Whatever  It is the price action that catches my attention anyway 

The chart above shows the price action over the last year  3 things are prominent in this chart  First  the pullback from the July high in a rounded bottoming format  It is clearly heading higher now since the October low  Second  is the red zone just under 46 that was important for buyers in June and July and sellers in August and November is now important for buyers again  acting as a support level 
The third is the short term red line that has acted important for sellers  a resistance level  until Tuesday  With the move over that level the selling has abated and it is time to own the stock for a move higher  It may encounter another area of selling at the prior high near 48  but history shows there is not much inventory of holders at that level to work through to continue higher 
How high could it go  Who knows  But one measure is to look at the move into the range between support and resistance and add that back to the break out  This suggests that a move to 50 50 is possible  Technicians will point out other patterns that could move the stock higher as well  But a quick 7 5  would not be anything to snarl at  Unless you don t like the earnings multiple  or sales to book ratio or something else

120245,341760,PKI,Top Trade Ideas For Week Of August 3  2015  CAG  FL  FMER  PKG  PKI,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
ConAgra Foods  NYSE CAG 
ConAgra Foods had been trending higher through 2014 and took a break in 2015  Then it got an activist investor involved and gapped higher in June  Since then  it has consolidated with the Bollinger Bands  tightening  often a precursor to a move  The MACD has slowed its decent and is turning as the RSI falls  but in the bullish zone  Watch for a break of the consolidation either way 
Foot Locker  NYSE FL 
Foot Locker is one way to avoid a decision between Nike  NYSE NKE  and Under Armour  NYSE UA  altogether  It has been moving higher in long steps for quite some time  Now it sits under resistance at 71 with tightening Bollinger Bands  The RSI is bullish and rising while the MACD has been pulling back  but is stabilizing  Watch for a break over 71 to enter 
FirstMerit  NASDAQ FMER 
First Merit stock fell hard following its earnings report last week  But notice that the level it is holding has been an important one in the past  as both support in the second quarter and resistance at the end of 2014  It is also holding at the 200 day SMA  The RSI is oversold and kinking back higher  but the MACD is falling  Look for a potential bounce in this stock 
Packaging Corporation of America  NYSE PKG 
Packaging Corporation of America had a strong move up off of the October 2014 bottom in the market to a peak in February  Since then  though  it pulled back  making a low as a double bottom in July  Now it is rising again and testing resistance at the gap down from April  It has support for a move higher from the rising and bullish RSI and MACD 
PerkinElmer  NYSE PKI 
PerkinElmer has been a strong stock  rising through most of 2015 until the June and July pullback  There are signs that the pullback is over though and the stock is ready to reverse back higher  The RSI moved up off of the oversold level again and is making a higher high into the bullish zone  The MACD is turned and crossing up as well  Finally  the price is breaking above a falling wedge and pushing the Bollinger Bands higher 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the dog days of August  sees the Equity markets having weathered another storm  but not showing strength to push higher yet 
Elsewhere  look for gold to consolidate or continue lower  while crude oil moves to the downside  The US dollar index looks to move sideways with an upward bias  while US Treasuries are biased to continue higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets both are biased to the downside  but trying to consolidate 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts suggest that there is potential for some weakness in the current move short term though  On the longer timeframe  the QQQ looks strong and may be ready for new all time highs  while the SPY is on consolidation and the IWM a retrenching consolidation  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

120246,341761,PKI,Top Trade Ideas For Week Of November 30  FITB  HBAN  ODFL  PKI  ZTS,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Fifth Third Bancorp  O FITB 
Fifth Third Bancorp  FITB  dropped hard in August from a consolidation zone  The next few months saw a failed attempt higher and then some consolidation before a move higher in mid October  That found resistance at the prior zone of importance and pulled back  It made a higher low and moved back up through the zone last week  The RSI is rising and bullish and the MACD is rising  both supporting further upside 
Huntington Bancshares  O HBAN 
Huntington Bancshares  HBAN  also dropped hard with the market in August and then consolidated for a couple of months  The rise that began in October met resistance at the pre drop level and pulled back to a higher low at the 20 day SMA  before rising to test it again  The RSI is bullish and rising and the MACD is flat but positive  A new high is an entry signal 
Old Dominion Freight Line Inc  O ODFL 
Old Dominion Freight Line  ODFL  has been in a downward channel since March  with the exception of a small period riding the top of the channel as support in August  The price action may have changed in September though as it has been moving sideways since then  Into the new week the price is pressing against resistance with the RSI pressing against the bullish zone  The MACD is bullish and rising  Look for a move over that resistance to participate 
PerkinElmer  N PKI 
PerkinElmer  PKI  fell lower with the market in August then took a second leg down in September  A 25  drop in all  before a strong run higher to the prior resistance zone  After a small pullback the price reversed back up and is testing that resistance again  The RSI is bullish and rising and the MACD is crossing up after a short pullback of its own  Look for a push through the resistance as a signal to participate 
Zoetis Inc  N ZTS 
Zoetis  ZTS  spiked 10  higher in June only to reverse and more the very next day  It then embarked on a downward journey finding a double bottom near 40 in October  Since then it has been slowly rising and looks ready for more  The RSI is in the bullish zone while the MACD is rising  both supporting more upward price action  Look for a break of consolidation to participate higher 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into December sees the equity markets looking solid and maybe with new leadership

120247,341762,PKI,5 Stocks To Watch  AMTD  DHR  ETN  PKI  RHT,opinion,"TD Ameritrade  NASDAQ AMTD 
TD Ameritrade fell hard with the market to start the year  It found support into early February as volume ramped up and them fell back  Since mid February it has been rising  reaching resistance at the January bounce level and consolidating through March  Friday saw a bullish engulfing candle break over that range and the 100 day SMA  With the RSI bullish and the MACD about to cross up and rise again look for continuation to participate to the upside   
Danaher  NYSE DHR 
Danaher ended 2015 with a strong run higher stopping just short of 100 at the end of November  The pullback that followed was deep  retracing the entire move higher  bottoming in late January  That was followed by another sharp leg higher  What was that about the Efficient Market Hypothesis  It is now consolidating and Friday saw a bullish engulfing candle  This shifted the MACD from a possible cross down to flat with the RSI strong in the bullish zone  Look for a continuation to participate to the upside   
Eaton  NYSE ETN 
Eaton also had a long run lower over the summer of 2015  There was some bouncing around then from October through to a final low in mid January  Since then there has been no doubt the trend is up  with the stock rising for nearly 3 months  The last two weeks it has consolidated and Friday s bullish engulfing candle looks for continuation higher  The RSI is bullish and the MACD pulling back slightly  Look for continuation higher Monday to participate to the upside   
PerkinElmer  NYSE PKI 
PerkinElmer started the year with a quick move lower followed by consolidation  Then a second move lower ran to the lower in early February on a spike in volume  The following move higher has stalled at the prior resistance  until Friday saw a break higher  It has support for more upside from a rising and bullish RSI and MACD  Look for follow through to participate to the upside   
Red Hat  NYSE RHT 
Red Hat started the year off to the downside as well  bottoming nearly 30  lower in early February  But since then it has risen steadily  It touched the 200 day SMA 2 weeks ago and pulled back  The reversal back higher made a higher low and it is now back at the prior high  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising while the MACD avoided a cross down  These support more upside  and if it pushes to a higher high look to participate on the upside  
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which heading into the first full week of April sees the equity indexes looking strong and ready to make another leg higher 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue its pullback along with crude oil  The US dollar also looks to continue lower  possibly testing key 12 month support while US Treasuries are breaking to the upside and look to continue  The Shanghai Composite looks poised to move higher in its downtrend as Emerging Markets continue to trend higher 
Volatility looks to remain low and biased lower keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETFs NYSE SPY  NYSE IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  despite the moves the past week  Their charts also look strong on both the daily and weekly timeframe with the only slight warnings coming from slowing momentum indications  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

120248,341763,PKI,Moving Average Crossover Alert  PerkinElmer  PKI   ,opinion,"PerkinElmer Inc    NYSE PKI   is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective  as the company is seeing favorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for PKI broke out above the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting a short term bullish trend 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved higher by 8 4  in the past four weeks  Plus  the company currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  suggesting that now could definitely be the time for this breakout candidate 
More bullishness may especially be the case when investors consider what has been happening for PKI on the earnings estimate revision front lately  No estimate has gone lower in the past two months  compared to 8 higher  while the consensus estimate has also moved higher too 
So given this move in estimates  and the positive technical factors  investors may want to watch this breakout candidate closely for more gains in the near future ",2016-05-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/moving-average-crossover-alert:-perkinelmer-(pki)-200129108,200129108
