187187,408703,FAST,Why Shares in Fastenal Soared 41  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares in industrial supply company Fastenal  NASDAQ FAST  soared 41 3  in 2019 according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  It was a truly remarkable occurrence  not least because most of it comes down to internal execution 

In a year when U S  industrial production came in lower than most of the expectations going into it  Fastenal managed to generate high single digit sales and operating income growth largely based on its strategy of expanding onsite locations  e commerce sales growth  and placing industrial vending machines 
There s a useful snapshot of the company s progress on its strategic initiatives in the third quarter earnings figures 

Onsite locations increased 30  year over year to 1 076 
The installed base of vending machines increased 12 2  year over year to 88 327 
Third quarter e commerce sales increased 28  compared to the same period a year ago 

The end result was a 7 8  year over year increase in sales in the third quarter and a 7 4  increase in operating income  Fastenal is still a growth stock  
So what
Fastenal s results in 2019 are very good  especially when you consider the headwinds it s faced from a slowing industrial economy  cost increases emanating from tariff actions  and the threat from online competition  
As you can see below  the company s year over year growth rate has slowed as a consequence of weakness in the industrial economy  but Fastenal still remain firmly in positive territory  For reference  industrial supply companies have what economists call short cycle sales  This means there s a short lead time between initial contact and the generation of a sale  so when industrial production starts to slow  industrial supply companies will be hit first 

Now what
With Fastenal having demonstrated it can grow even in a slowing environment    indeed  a slowdown could lead to a scenario where it grabs market share from smaller distributors    the key question is what kind of assistance the company can receive from the economy in 2020 
The question is subject to debate  Bulls will argue that the slowdown is largely a consequence of issues that can be rectified in due course  such as the trade conflict and a natural slowing in transportation markets  automobile and truck sales   In addition  the underlying economy remains in good shape with falling unemployment  low interest rates  and solid housing markets 
Meanwhile  bears will point out that the current trend in the industrial economy is negative  Europe remains in an anemic growth mode  and there s no shortage of geopolitical issues to worry about right now 
If the bulls are right  there should be an improvement in the industrial economy at some point in the middle of 2020    something that could lead to a much brighter outlook for Fastenal s earnings in 2021 ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pghzs,2057053

187192,408708,FAST,Fastenal  FAST  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Fastenal  FAST  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 17  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of industrial and construction fasteners is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 32 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 29 billion  up 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fastenal 
For Fastenal  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 59  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Fastenal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Fastenal would post earnings of  0 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 37  delivering a surprise of  5 71  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Fastenal appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fastenal-fast-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200498020,200498020

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Fastenal shares have added about 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 7  
What s Next for Fastenal 
While Fastenal has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Fastenal was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

187201,408717,FAST,GMS Or FAST  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Building Products   Retail sector have probably already heard of GMS Inc   GMS  and Fastenal  FAST   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
GMS Inc  has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Fastenal has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that GMS likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FAST has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
GMS currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 15  while FAST has a forward P E of 26 24  We also note that GMS has a PEG ratio of 1 45  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  FAST currently has a PEG ratio of 1 64 
Another notable valuation metric for GMS is its P B ratio of 1 98  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  FAST has a P B of 8 06 
These metrics  and several others  help GMS earn a Value grade of B  while FAST has been given a Value grade of D 
GMS sticks out from FAST in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that GMS is the better option right now ",2019-11-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gms-or-fast-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200486081,200486081
187203,408719,FAST,Fastenal  FAST  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Fastenal  FAST   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Fastenal basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Fastenal  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Fastenal
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this maker of industrial and construction fasteners is expected to earn  1 38 per share  which is a change of 4 6  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Fastenal  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 6  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
GMS Inc  and Fastenal are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that GMS has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
GMS currently has a forward P E ratio of 8 84  while FAST has a forward P E of 24 39  We also note that GMS has a PEG ratio of 1 26  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  FAST currently has a PEG ratio of 1 52 
Another notable valuation metric for GMS is its P B ratio of 1 72  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  FAST has a P B of 7 67 
These metrics  and several others  help GMS earn a Value grade of B  while FAST has been given a Value grade of C 
GMS stands above FAST thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that GMS is the superior value option right now ",2019-09-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gms-vs-fast-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200464029,200464029

187243,408759,FAST,What The World Doesn t Need Now Is Lower Rates,opinion,"The Q2 earnings season is upon us and the risks to the rally that started after the worst December on record at the close of last year is in serious jeopardy  We received a glimpse of this with some of the current companies that have reported  For example  to understand how dangerous this earnings reporting season can be  take a look at what one of the largest US multinational firms had to say recently after it reported earnings  The Minnesota based Fastenal  NASDAQ FAST   which is the largest fastener distributor in North America  reported worse than expected second quarter earnings and revenue  Shares of Fastenal promptly tanked more than 4   But what the management said about the quarter was very interesting The company said in its press release that its strategy to raise prices to offset tariffs placed to date on products sourced from China were not sufficient to also counter general inflation in the marketplace 
In fact  companies that collect more than half their sales outside the U S  are expected to see a 9 3  slump in second quarter earnings  according to FactSet estimates  This quarter s earnings overall are expected to drop by 2 3   making it the second quarter in a row of declining EPS growth 
What I find most interesting is that we have a capital spending slowdown  a global manufacturing recession  global GDP grinding downward  US Q2 growth falling to about 1 5  from the 3  level seen last year  and an S P 500 earnings recession  All of this is happening in the context of asset prices that are at all time high valuations and are clinging precariously to a worldwide fixed income bubble that is destined to go supernova and obliterate asset prices 
I ve gone on record indicating that the daggers for the bubble on Wall Street and the global bond market are inflation and recession  A recession would blow up the  5 4Trillion worth of BBB  Junk and Collateralized Loan markets  And rising rates of inflation would leave the entire fixed income spectrum in tatters 
But what happens if you get both occurring at the same time  What if we see the return of stagflation  What if rates undergo a massive spike due to global central bank insanity and their inability to ever come even close to normalizing interest rates  and then you also have a recession that causes multiple trillions of dollars  worth of bonds to default  The answer is  yields would soar like a surface to air missile from the currently insane level of low rates that could only make sense in the twilight zone 
How insanely low are interest rates you ask  There are now Junk bonds in Europe that have a negative yield  Austria recently issued a one hundred year bond with a yield of just 1 2   And  almost every single country in Northern Europe and the nation of Japan have sovereign bonds with a negative yield   some of which going out ten years in duration 
Therefore  because rates have been forced down by central banks to such an insane level  a gradual normalization that is fairly innocuous for markets is virtually impossible to occur  What is more probable is a violent interest rate shock like we have never before seen  especially if we end up in an environment of stagflation that causes yields to jump by 100s of bps very quickly and destroys the global equity markets with catastrophic expediency  Speaking about the insanity of low yields  the Treasury Department recently stated the deficit grew 23  from October 2018 through June  for a total Fiscal  19 Deficit of  747billion with one quarter of the year still left  Annual deficits near  1 trillion are happening outside of a recession  During an economic contraction  deficits should surge towards  2 5  3 trillion 
The global bond market suffers from a plethora of insolvent corporations and sovereigns that are issuing debt with yields that offer less than zero percent  The day of reckoning may not be imminent  but you must be fully prepared for its eventuality  It is possible to profit from it  but if you don t anticipate its occurrence the economic consequences will be severe 
But central banks and governments are unconcerned about these asset bubbles  Incredibly they are printing and borrow more money  To this end  we should all be aware that the Fed no longer has a dual mandate consisting of stable prices and full employment  The Fed s primary concern is to try and levitate asset bubbles  After all  Trump says this is the best economy ever  and even members of the FOMC assent that underlying growth is very strong  The unemployment rate is at a record low  and the CPI for all items less food and energy rose 2 1 percent over the last 12 months  So  core inflation is over the Fed s asinine target  and the jobs market is very strong at this time  initial unemployment claims are at a 50 year low 
Why then would Powell indicate during his latest testimony before congress that a rate cutting cycle will begin later this month  The truth is the economy is very fragile precisely because it has become 100  dependent upon perpetual asset bubbles  Powell became aware of this when stocks plunged in Q4 of last year and the Junk Bond market completely shut down  The truth is that Powell  and his merry band of counterfeiters have become absolutely petrified about a recession because they know that it will implode the entire corporate bond market turning an average run of the mill recession into a depression in short order 
Therefore  he will now run to the printing press at the slightest hint of a downturn  But the chances are high that a 25 basispoint rate cut won t be enough to bail out the global economy  Nor will several more like it do the trick  It should take 100s of bps and a return to QE to push prices higher 
Are we supposed to believe that central banks are going to make this all ok by easing monetary policy further from here  After all  they have already forced  13trillion worth of sovereign debt below zero  and the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan already have negative rates and have been at that level for years  And the Fed only has 225bps of rate cuts available  when it usually has needed 500bps or more 
Perhaps central bankers can manage to force a few more drinks down the hatch in order to delay the inevitable hangover  But that just makes the eventual collapse all the more severe ",2019-07-22,Michael Pento,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-the-world-doesnt-need-now-is-lower-rates-200442408,200442408

187261,408777,FAST,Fastenal  FAST  Q2 Earnings Preview  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Fastenal  FAST  is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 11  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of industrial and construction fasteners is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 37 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  1 38 billion  up 8 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 45  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fastenal 
For Fastenal  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 60  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fastenal will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Fastenal would post earnings of  0 34 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 34  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

What s Next for Fastenal 
While Fastenal has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

187281,408797,FAST,3 Reasons Why Fastenal  FAST  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Fastenal  FAST  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of industrial and construction fasteners is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Fastenal is 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 7 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 2 2  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Fastenal is 31   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 6 5  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 11 7  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 11 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Fastenal have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Fastenal a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

187328,408844,FAST,Fastenal  FAST  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Fastenal  FAST  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of industrial and construction fasteners a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Fastenal is 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 7 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 1 3  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Fastenal is 31   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 2 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 11 7  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 11 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Fastenal  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 7  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Fastenal a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Both Beacon Roofing Supply and Fastenal have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
BECN currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 84  while FAST has a forward P E of 21 42  We also note that BECN has a PEG ratio of 0 62  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  FAST currently has a PEG ratio of 1 34 
Another notable valuation metric for BECN is its P B ratio of 1 32  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  FAST has a P B of 7 55 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to BECN s Value grade of A and FAST s Value grade of C

187361,408877,FAST,Fastenal  FAST  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Fastenal  FAST  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 17  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of industrial and construction fasteners is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 60 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  33 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 22 billion  up 12  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 23  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fastenal 
For Fastenal  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 19  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fastenal will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Fastenal would post earnings of  0 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 69  delivering a surprise of  2 99  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Fastenal doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fastenal-fast-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200374498,200374498

Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
TGLS currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 96  while FAST has a forward P E of 22 26  We also note that TGLS has a PEG ratio of 0 60  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  FAST currently has a PEG ratio of 1 59 
Another notable valuation metric for TGLS is its P B ratio of 2 29  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  FAST has a P B of 7 14 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to TGLS s Value grade of B and FAST s Value grade of D

187379,408895,FAST,Will Fastenal  FAST  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Fastenal  FAST   which belongs to the Zacks Building Products   Retail industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This maker of industrial and construction fasteners has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7 55  
For the last reported quarter  Fastenal came out with earnings of  0 69 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 67 per share  representing a surprise of 2 99   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 66 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 74 per share  delivering a surprise of 12 12  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Fastenal lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Fastenal has an Earnings ESP of  1 67  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 16  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-fastenal-fast-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200368790,200368790

187454,408970,FAST,Can Fastenal Company  FAST  Beat Earnings Estimates In Q3 ,opinion,We expect Fastenal Company   NASDAQ FAST   to beat expectations when it reports third quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 11  before the opening bell Last quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4   Moreover  Fastenal surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters  the average being 1 8  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is pegged at  0 60   A positive Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Fastenal Company Price and EPS Surprise    Zacks Rank  Fastenal currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  Conversely  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement The combination of Fastenal s Zacks Rank  3 and  0 60  ESP makes us reasonably confident about an earnings beat in the to be reported quarter What is Driving the Better than Expected Earnings Increased installation of industrial vending machines is expected to boost sales and profits in the to be reported quarter as it is one of the primary growth drivers for Fastenal  Moreover  a continual increase in the number of on site locations is likely to expand Fastenal s market share and contribute to the quarterly numbers We are also encouraged by Fastenal s acquisition of certain assets of industrial and fastener supply distributor   Manufacturer s Supply Company  Mansco    in March 2017  This ensures Fastenal s presence in markets where it has not meaningfully contributed in the past  Mansco contributed 3 6  to fastener daily sales growth of 7 9  in the last reported quarter and is expected to contribute in the to be reported quarter as well However  we are apprehensive about Fastenal s changes in product and customer mix that have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time now  Also  sales in the quarter could be adversely affected owing to the impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma For the quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 50 cents  reflecting a 13 4  year over year increase  Meanwhile  the estimate for revenues is pegged at  1 13 billion  implying 11 1  growth Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the  sector that  according to our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter McDonald s Corporation   NYSE MCD   has an Earnings ESP of  1 29  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  The company is slated to release quarterly results on Oct 24 Domino s Pizza Inc   NYSE DPZ   has an Earnings ESP of  2 12  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is scheduled to release quarterly results on Oct 12 Bravo Brio Restaurant Group  Inc    NASDAQ BBRG   has an Earnings ESP of  6 25  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release quarterly results on Nov 1 Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2017-10-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-fastenal-company-fast-beat-earnings-estimates-in-q3-200217987,200217987

187563,409079,FAST,Beware The Industrial Recession  And Conflicted Strategists,opinion," The industrial environment is in a recession   I don t care what anybody says  because nobody knows that market better than we do   stated Daniel Florness  Chief Financial Officer of Fastenal Co   O FAST   on the company s third quarter conference call 
The man was adamant  and he had reason to be 
Fastenal doesn t just sell nuts and bolts to local hardware stores  It provides a wide variety of industrial and construction supplies including power tools  packaging materials  electrical connectors  chemicals  HVAC components  and hydraulic systems 
Fastenal serves non residential construction companies  manufacturers  farmers  railroads  mining companies  and the energy sector 
So  if Fastenal is seeing extreme weakness in its customers  spending rates  then there s good reason to believe that the United States is  in fact  suffering an industrial and manufacturing recession 
Of course  others who basically have to be bullish on stocks are saying   Not so fast  
To Bias or Not to Bias 
Tobias Levkovich  Chief Equity Strategist at Citigroup Inc  N C   dismissed industrial sector worries on Bloomberg Television last week 
Levkovich noted   Even if you look at durable goods orders  they have not plummeted 20  to 30  like they ve done in previous recessions  so every time I hear the words  industrial recession   I cringe  
However  we should be wary of his commentary 
Like economists at investment banks  equity strategists basically get paid to tell clients what they want to hear  Their clients own a boatload of equities  so these financial pundits tend to dismiss any and all risks 
For example  heading into 2008  Levkovich was bullish on financials and had an end of year S P 500 price target of 1675  equivalent to a 14  gain   The S P actually lost 38   and 2008 was the worst year for financials since the Savings and Loan Crisis 
Needless to say  if someone failed to warn about the worst recession since the Great Depression  they re either biased by conflicts of interest or can t see the big picture  and it s probably both  
Currently  the market seems to be listening to utterly conflicted bank strategists rather than heeding the warnings of company executives with boots on the ground 
Heavy Duty Risk
It s scary that industrial stocks don t seem to be  pricing in  even the possibility of an industrial recession  let alone evidence that one has already started 
The price to sales ratio  P S  for the S P 500 Industrials Index is 1 56 times  as can be seen in the chart below 

At a time when many industrial companies are struggling to grow revenues   as Fastenal can attest   the P S ratio for this sector is well above its 10 year average 
In the latter part of 2011  recession fears brought the Index s P S ratio down to around 1 0 times  but we re currently nowhere near that valuation level 
Be mindful of your exposure to industrial stocks 
And be wary of the opinions you hear in the financial media  Most  analysts  aren t trying to get things right  They re simply sticking to the script that was formulated by a committee within their firm ",2015-11-04,Alan Gula,https://www.investing.com/analysis/beware-the-industrial-recession…-and-conflicted-strategists-270259,270259
187564,409080,FAST,Fastenal Is Ready To Move,opinion,"Fastenal Company  O FAST  is a wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies around the world  Its stock looks fast and ready for action 
I noticed the stock back in mid December as it was making a higher high with good momentum heading into year end  Unfortunately it could not hold onto that break and fell back  A trip to pit row  The result though was a double bottom and move back higher quickly  Now over that prior break out level and consolidating it is testing a 52 week high 

As it sits idling at the starting line the momentum indicators are bullish and moving higher  The RSI is turning back up after holding at 60 on the consolidation  while the MACD just moves higher  The Bollinger Bands  are also angled higher and open  A move over 44 would be the trigger to get long with a stop under 42 
The first target would be the December 2014 high at 48 and over that would be a major rebound and look for a return to 52  a full  17 off of the low print at the start of the year  Hmm  Ricky s car is number 17  would be fitting huh  Earnings are in the rear view mirror  but perhaps the Daytona 500 will provide the catalyst for a move higher ",2016-02-16,Gregory W.
