1  Powell to dominate market attention at Jackson Hole
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver a speech at 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT  Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium 
Markets will be looking for clarity on the outlook for monetary policy after the minutes from the July meeting showed opinion among Fed officials was sharply divided

European bond yields have also recovered from record lows posted earlier in the week  after U K  Prime Minister Boris Johnson s visits to Paris and Berlin spurred hopes that a  No Deal  Brexit can be avoided

106449,327964,VMW,Salesforce Q3 Earnings Preview  Buy Surging CRM Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Salesforce   NYSE CRM   shares have surged 15  in the last month to crush its industry s 7 5  expansion  The cloud based customer relationship management powerhouse posted stronger than projected Q2 results back in August and raised its full year sales outlook 
The enterprise software firm has benefitted from the continued digitalization of businesses big and small  Salesforce  under the leadership of CEO Marc Benioff  has also expanded its reach through acquisitions  So is now the time to buy CRM stock ahead of its Q3 earnings release that is due out on December 3 
Salesforce s Pitch
Salesforce is the world s fifth largest enterprise application software firm by revenue  according to research firm Gartner Inc  The company s cloud based customer relationship management services provide clients a wide range of tools and applications to help them run everything from sales and e commerce to marketing and analytics 
The San Francisco based firm s clients include everyone from Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI   to Yeti   NYSE YETI    and it has expanded its partnership with Amazon Web Services   NASDAQ AMZN    CRM has also bolstered its offerings through artificial intelligence  new voice control features  and more 
Salesforce also completed its purchase of data analytics platform Tableau in August  The company boasted that its  15 billion deal its largest acquisition joined together the  World s  1 CRM and  1 analytics platform   The firm then announced a much smaller deal to buy ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd 
 
 
 
 
 
Other Fundamentals 
CRM is part of our Computer   Software industry  which currently rests in the top 25  of our more than 250 Zacks industries  Salesforce stock closed regular trading hours Thursday at  162 88 per share  just off its new highs 
Overall  CRM shares are up 31  in the last year  which includes a decent amount of volatility  CRM stock is also up 115  in the last three years to crush its industry s 46  average climb  which includes Adobe   NASDAQ ADBE    Oracle   NYSE ORCL    VMware   NYSE VMW    Intuit   NASDAQ INTU    and others  
Salesforce  which is still very much in its growth phase  does not pay a dividend  The company is also trading at a pretty high forward earnings multiple  With that said  CRM s forward price sales ratio comes in at 7 2  This is above its industry  but sits below its five year high of 8 2X  despite the fact that its stock price has surged    
 
 
 
 
 
Q3 Outlook   Beyond
Last quarter  Salesforce s revenue jumped 22  to  3 99 billion  Looking ahead  the firm s Q3 revenue is projected to jump 30 7  to reach  4 43 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  The firm s full year fiscal 2020 sales are then expected to climb nearly 27  to  16 85 billion  with 2021 projected to jump 24  higher to reach  20 92 billion 
Investors should be pleased to note that these estimates would see Salesforce continue its impressive streak of 24  or higher full year revenue expansion over much of the last decade  At the bottom end of the income statement  CRM s adjusted Q3 earnings are projected to pop 6 6  to  0 65 per share 
The tech company s full year fiscal 2020 EPS figure is expected to climb 3 6   with 2021 projected to come in 8 4  higher  CRM has also seen its earnings estimate revision picture turn slightly more positive recently 
 
 
 
 
 
Bottom Line
Salesforce is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  at the moment that sports an  A  grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system  Overall  the third quarter has been better than expected for tech companies  so some investors might want to take a chance on CRM stock before its early December release in the hopes of a nice pop 
However  buying a stock heading into earnings is never easy  as no one knows what Salesforce s actual numbers and guidance will be  much less how Wall Street will react 
In the end  though  CRM appears to be a solid longer term buy as businesses  governments  and every other entity in between continue their digital transformations  Salesforce is also prepared to expand its international reach

106466,327981,VMW,Buy Intuit  INTU  Stock Heading Into Earnings ,opinion,"Intuit   NASDAQ INTU   stock is in the midst of a solid run  but its shares have cooled off a bit recently  This could set up a buying opportunity for those high on the software as a service firm  Plus  quarterly earnings season has treated many tech companies well and the Dow  S P 500  and Nasdaq all touched new highs Friday 
Intuit s Pitch 
Stocks have climbed on the back of better than feared quarterly results  solid U S  jobs data  a third Fed interest rate cut  and some U S  China trade war progress  Meanwhile  yields on the 10 year U S  Treasury note have climbed over the last few months  in a sign that investors  recession fears have cooled  And Intuit operates a somewhat recession proof business  if there is such a thing 
Intuit  which is part of the quickly growing cloud based SaaS industry  offers a variety of financial services and it might be most famous for its online tax software  TurboTax  The Mountain View  California based firm also offers software geared toward accounting  small business money management  and personal finance  which include QuickBooks and Mint  The company s easy to use cloud based offerings have helped it accumulate roughly 50 million customers globally 
 
 
 
 
Other Fundamentals 
Investors will see in the chart above that INTU shares have surged over 190  in the last five years  which comes in well above its industry s 72  average climb  Intuit stock has also outpaced its peer group s 142  jump  which includes the likes of Salesforce   NYSE CRM    VMware   NYSE VMW    and Adobe   NASDAQ ADBE   
The financial services focused SaaS power s stock is also up 26  in the last year  But as we mentioned at the top  INTU stock has moved somewhat sideways in the past three months  despite crushing our earnings estimate last quarter on 15  higher sales 
Intuit currently pays an annualized dividend of  2 12 per share  up 13  from last year s  1 88 payout  INTU s yield rests at 0 80  per share at the moment  This is nothing to write home about but it is a nice bonus for a company that still presents investors solid growth  Intuit is also part of our Computer   Software industry that rests in the top 16  of our more 250 Zacks industries 
Intuit s valuation picture is somewhat stretched compared to its recent history  as we can see below  However  it has traded at a premium compared to its peer group for three years 
 
 
 
 
Outlook 
Looking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for the firm s Q1 fiscal 2020 sales to jump 10 6  from the year ago period to hit  1 12 billion  This would mark a slowdown compared to last quarter s 15  revenue expansion 
Peaking further down the road  Intuit s full year fiscal 2020 and 2021 revenues are expected to climb 10 6  and 10   respectively  Once again  this would come in below 2019 s 13  top line growth  Nonetheless  INTU is expected to see its 2021 sales come in at  8 26 billion and stable double digit growth is no easy task   
The company s adjusted Q1 earnings figure is projected to dip 6 9  from Q1 2019 to  0 27 per share  Despite this projected setback  Intuit s adjusted fiscal year EPS figures are projected to jump 12 5  in each of the next two years 
Bottom Line
Intuit is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  as its earnings outlook has remained unchanged recently  With that said  the firm does boast a strong history of quarterly earnings beats  including at 54  average over the trailing four periods 
INTU stock also rests about 8  off its 52 week highs  Therefore  investors who can handle some risk might consider taking a small bite out of Intuit before it reports  But playing stocks around earnings is more than difficult  Therefore  it is likely better to wait and see how Wall Street reacts and then make a move 
Intuit is scheduled to release its first quarter fiscal 2020 financial results on Thursday  November 21

106512,328027,VMW,What Wall Street Gets Wrong About The Inverted Yield Curve,opinion,"Things that ll be  different this time  usually aren t  especially when it comes to hot stoves  hot steering wheels  and hot bond markets  Touch  em and you ll get burned  or so goes the thinking 
Every once in a while  though  the situation plays out 
Take the inverted yield curve that caused last Friday s vicious selloff and made countless headlines around the world when it happened for the first time since 2007 
Contrary to what Wall Street and legions of economists want you to believe  it may NOT be the harbinger of doom that it s been for the past 50 years 
Here s my case  and what to buy if you re interested in big profits  
An Outdated Predictor
First  let s set the stage 
If you ve never heard of an  inverted yield curve  or you re uncertain exactly what one is  you re not alone  In fact  I know a lot of professionals who can t explain yield curves properly 
What you need to understand is actually pretty simple 
The  yield curve  is a very specialized economic indicator based on the comparison between short term risks and longer term risks  as reflected by the rates of return associated with them over time 
Normally  there s an upward slope because longer term investments are riskier than shorter term investments  because of the time involved so your required rate of return is higher  But every once in a while  the curve  inverts    meaning that short term risks become higher than longer term risks 
When that happens like it did last Friday  the  curve  goes from this 

To this 

Now  here s the part that will get me uninvited from every Wall Street cocktail party for the next 200 years  yield curves have zero predictive capacity whatsoever  
Financial heresy 
Not really  Yield curves simply show you what the market thinks about how inflation is being managed and where interest rates are headed 
The other thing to think about is that there are lots of curves  not just one  So blanket statements like there s been  an inverted yield curve today  really don t amount to a hill of beans 
For instance  you can construct a yield curve of 3 month treasury bills and 10 year notes  or 10 year notes and 30 year notes  You can even construct cross currency curves to compare rates in different countries or regions as a means of assessing economic prospects around the world
The most popular curve   and the most widely reported   is the 2 year versus 10 year which hasn t yet inverted but is very close  as I type  Last week s inversion  in fact  was actually between the 3 month rates and 10 year yields 
What does that tell you 
Again  not much 
It s circumstantial evidence at best  If anything  the yield curve is merely flattening and   ta da   the markets can have plenty of positive performance with a  flat  yield curve   meaning long and short term rates are nearly equal 
Which brings me back to where we started 
Why You SHOULDN T Worry About The Inverted Yield Curve
There are three reasons why I think the inverted yield curve really will be different this time 

Short term rates were held so low by a clueless Fed that they don t have far to rise to overcome long term rates 
The economy that has driven this indicator to unprecedented reliability over the past 50 years doesn t exist anymore  In today s markets  leverage drives what s actually happening and that  in turn  doesn t create the pronounced difference between short term and long term rates like it used to 
The rapid growth in capital despite a slowing economy creates a diminishing return cycle for both long and short term rates that you can see very clearly in the Fed s own data  It s a variation of the Law of Diminishing Returns 


This time around  the inverted yield curve that everybody thinks is such a big deal isn t  a big deal  Rather  it s nothing more than the ghost of bad Fed policy decisions  thanks in good measure  to the amount of money sloshing around at every level in our financial system 
The other thing to think about is that inverted yield curves do not mean a recession is imminent  In fact  there have been plenty of times where the yield curve has  flattened   then taken a year or more to invert after hitting 0 5  
Here s a chart from LPL Financial that makes this point nicely 

Pay particular attention to the two numbers I ve highlighted at the bottom right 
That s the length of time in months   44 8 or nearly 4 years   from 0 5  yield curve to recession and the average return of the S P 500 from the same point until a recession actually rears its head   some 67 9  
The question you need to ask yourself if you re tempted to run for the hills because of the headlines surrounding last Friday s inverted yield curve is  can you really sit on the sidelines  possibly as long as another 4  years knowing the S P 500 could still rack up nearly 70  in gains you will miss if you go to the sidelines  
My hat s off to you if you can but  frankly  I don t know of very many investors who can throw away that kind of profit potential 
Especially when you could do even better 
My team and I regularly identify companies with the potential to beat the markets 2  3  5 even 10 to 1 
Our sister services are chock full of plays from Insperity  NYSE NSP   VMware  NYSE VMW  and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  that given readers following along as directed the opportunity to bag returns of 247 69   262 90   and even 300 00  that would have turned every  10 000 invested into  24 769   29 820 or even  30 000  excluding fees and commissions

106515,328030,VMW,Add These 5 Stocks With Solid Sales Growth To Your Portfolio,opinion,Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market  The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage  as strong sales generally get converted into growth Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business  This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base Flat or declining sales growth indicates obstacles for the company and offers lower scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors Without impressive revenue growth  the bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term  While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses  a sustainable bottom line recovery usually requires robust sales growth But sales growth alone can t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits So  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening     Carlisle Companies Incorporated   NYSE CSL   operates as a diversified manufacturing company  This Scottsdale  AZ based company s expected sales growth rate for 2019 is 5  and it carries a Zacks Rank  2 Based in Evansville  IN  Berry Global Group  Inc    NYSE BERY   manufactures and supplies non woven  flexible  and

Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research Add These 5 Stocks with Solid Sales Growth to You PortfolioStrong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market  The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage  as strong sales generally get converted into growth Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business  This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base Flat or declining sales growth indicates obstacles for the company and offers lower scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors Without impressive revenue growth  the bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term  While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses  a sustainable bottom line recovery usually requires robust sales growth But sales growth alone can t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits So  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized

Verizon  Eli Lilly and AccentureThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Verizon  Eli Lilly and Accenture  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Verizon s shares have gained 14 2  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Wireless National industry s increase of 1  during the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Verizon remains poised to benefit from the upcoming 5G boom led by healthy traction in the wireless business Verizon is further seeking a first mover advantage in the 5G race as it plans to launch commercial 5G smartphones in the market in the first half of 2019 in collaboration with Samsung  KS 005930   Focus on online content delivery  mobile video and online advertising should also drive growth However  the company continues to struggle in a highly competitive and saturated wireless market  where spectrum crunch has become a major issue  reducing its profitability to some extent  Verizon continues to face softer wireline revenues and margins due to technology shifts and ongoing secular pressures from legacy technologies  In an effort to expand its customer base  Verizon is spending heavily on promotion and is also offering lucrative discounts  which is further weighing on margins  You can   Shares of Eli Lilly have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry year to date   40 4  vs   10 4    The Zacks analyst thinks Lilly s new products like Trulicity  Taltz  Basaglar  Cyramza  Jardiance  Lartruvo and Verzenio will drive revenues  Lilly expects to launch 20 new products by 2023  including at least two new indications line extensions on average every year Lilly is also having a strong year in terms of its pipeline with several positive late stage data readouts and regulatory nods  The newly launched CGRP antibody  Emgality could emerge as a significant contributor to long term growth  It has also added promising new assets through business development deals However  competitive pressure on Lilly s drugs is expected to rise this year  Challenges remain for the company in the form of generic competition for several drugs including Cialis and rising pricing pressure in the diabetes franchise  You can   Accenture s shares have underperformed the Zacks Consulting industry in the past year  gaining  13  vs   15 3   Accenture has been steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing business  The Zacks analyst thinks acquisitions have been a key growth catalyst and will contribute significantly to the company s revenue stream Accenture has been strategically enhancing its cloud and digital marketing suite through acquisitions and partnerships  The company s strong operating cash flow has helped it reward its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases Despite such tailwinds  Accenture faces stiff competition from strong companies like Genpact Limited  Cognizant Technology Solutions  NASDAQ CTSH  and Infosys  This leads to increasing pricing pressure for the company  Buyout related integration risks can impact the company s organic growth  Global presence exposes Accenture to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are

average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 36 1   In the last reported quarter  the company reported earnings of 19 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by couple of cents  In the year ago quarter  the company had reported a loss of 11 cents Revenues increased 22  year over year to  611 7 million in the last reported quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  601 million  The year over year growth was primarily driven by strong growth in subscription plan revenues  well supported by higher product subscriptions For the third quarter  Autodesk expects revenues between  635 million and  645 million and earnings in the range of 24 and 28 cents per share The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at 26 cents per share  indicating year over year increase of 316 7   Further  the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at  642 3 million  increasing 24 7  from the year ago quarter Let s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement Factors Likely to Influence Q3 ResultsIn the last reported quarter  Autodesk achieved robust growth in annualized revenue per subscription  ARPS  and billings  Billings of  605 million surged 27  year over year Notably  Industry Collections generated significant ARPS coupled with a high renewal rate for the company  which increased 60  year over year and accounted for 40  of the total product subscriptions in the last reported quarter  which is a positive The company is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer aided designing and manufacturing in both its domestic and overseas markets  We believe that higher demand for its cloud based products  mobile products and design suites will drive the top line over the long term Autodesk benefited from growth in annual recurring revenue  ARR  from all major geographies  with APAC exhibiting the strongest growth  Subscription plan ARR increased substantially driven by growth in product subscription on both a year over year and sequential basis in the second quarter  Moreover  cloud ARR grew more than 20  year over year and 10  sequentially Additionally  the biggest contributor to cloud ARR was BIM 360 family of products  with the company adding 31 000 subs in the BIM 360 space in the previous quarter  We expect this momentum to continue in the to be reported quarter Notably  Autodesk acquired Assemble in the second quarter to enhance market positioning for BIM 360 across the design and construction phase  which is expected to boost revenues in the to be reported quarter Autodesk s business transition from perpetual licenses to cloud based services is expected to benefit it by boosting its subscriptions and deferred revenues  Also  in order to encourage customers to move from maintenance subscriptions to product subscription  management is offering discounts  which is increasing its subscription base  However  this is expected to negatively impact top line growth in the near term In the previous quarter  Autodesk s e store accounted for a significant portion of the company s digital sales and generated 20  of the product subscriptions  Management stated that e store grew 70  year over year and captured a significant portion of the company s AutoCAD business  Additionally  Autodesk s direct and indirect business channels are growing at the same pace  which is a positive   However  the on going business model transition has impacted top line of the company  Revenues have been adversely impacted by the movement of perpetual licenses to cloud based services  as well as migration of maintenance plan customers to subscription plan offerings  This is expected to have a negative impact on the company s revenues in the to be reported quarter Autodesk  Inc  Price

106540,328055,VMW,EMC executive and his GM past played key role in EMC Dell mechanics ,news,"By Liana B  Baker and Michael Flaherty NEW YORK  Reuters    As a young investment banker in the 1990s  Harry You learned about an obscure General Motors Co  N GM  security called a  tracking stock   As an EMC Corp  N EMC  executive working on selling the data storage company to Dell Inc  he helped revive it  The addition of a tracking stock for VMware  a software maker majority owned by EMC  is a critical part of Dell s  67 billion deal for EMC struck on Monday  the biggest technology acquisition ever if it goes ahead   Tracking stocks allow stockholders to benefit from the performance of a specific unit of a publicly traded company  without giving away any ownership or control  At the same time  investors lose money if it falters  a potential concern if VMware s shares continue to fall over the next seven to 12 months as the deal is finalized   Harry You  an executive vice president in charge of EMC s corporate strategy  was instrumental in devising the structure that helped Dell afford the massive acquisition  according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to discuss the deliberations   You  a former  Oracle Corp   N ORCL  Chief Financial Officer  brainstormed with Egon Durban  managing partner of Silver Lake  the private equity firm that is an investor in Dell  and other senior executives for close to a year to put together the plan that would allow heavily indebted Dell to finance its offer  They came up with a stock that tracks the value of VMware Inc  N VM   the virtualization software company in which EMC has an 81 percent stake  Revenues of VMware  focused on cloud based services  are growing much faster than EMC as a whole  The tracking stock helped boost Dell s  24 05 per share cash offer for EMC  bringing it to  33 15 based on the value of the shares before the market opened on Monday  While the tracking stock helped pay for the deal  it also introduced uncertainty to it  VMware common shares ended trading on Monday down 8 1 percent  and slid further on Tuesday on concerns the market could be flooded with tracking shares of EMC shareholders looking to offload them  and fears Dell itself may sell more shares to lighten its debt load  Dell will have  49 5 billion in debt under current plans to finance the EMC deal   EMC shares closed at  27 55 on Tuesday  below the estimated offer value of around  31 80 per share  suggesting investors were pricing in some risk into the merger    I think people do not understand how the tracking stock works   their use for companies with traded common stock  is a relatively new phenomenon in the market place  We will have to spend a lot more time with our shareholders explaining what is going on with the tracking stock   David Goulden  Chief Executive of EMC Information Infrastructure  the company s biggest division  told Reuters in an interview   General Motors was the first U S  company to issue a tracking stock when it acquired Electronic Data Systems in 1984 from Ross Perot  better known years after as a U S  Presidential candidate  You  55  who worked as an investment banker at Salomon Brothers  Lehman Brothers and  Morgan Stanley   N MS   advised on transactions on which General Motors used tracking stock as currency  You did not offer any comment when contacted by Reuters  Tracking stocks reached their peak of popularity at the end of 1990s and then lost much of their allure with the bursting of the dot com bubble  They were used mostly to reflect the value of divisions that companies  many of them in the technology sector  did not want to have publicly listed  To be sure  tracking stocks are still in use by a few companies  Liberty Media Corp  O LMCA  Chairman John Malone  for example  used them in 2012 to separate the home shopping services assets of Liberty Interactive Corp  O QVCA  from its digital media assets  VMware is an EMC subsidiary that is already publicly listed  EMC did not want to relinquish control of the unit because it complements EMC s other businesses and has the potential to work well with Dell  Activist investor Elliott Management called on EMC to spin off its stake in VMware last year  only to be rebuffed   NO VOTING RIGHTS EMC shareholders are to receive tracking shares representing 53 percent of the total economic interest of VMware  These shares have no voting rights and would only pay a dividend at the behest of Dell s board  VMware  under EMC s control  does not currently pay any dividends  and so the companies argue that the tracking stock should trade in line with the common stock   What they should have done was build a collar around VMware  They could have structured it whereby if VMware falls below  75 per share  the value of the tracking stock goes up proportionately  Right now  there is no downside protection   said Macquarie analyst Rajesh Ghai   VMware shares closed at  69 31 on Tuesday  They traded as high as  82 25 last week  before any public talk of the Dell deal   EMC shareholders will be called upon to vote on the deal with Dell in the new year  provided a 60 day  go shop  period does not result in a higher offer  which most industry experts consider unlikely   
Proxy solicitors said it was too early to judge how EMC shareholders will value the VMware tracking stock by then  Investors will be looking to see whether the recent overhang in the common stock of VMware is removed in the coming months   The big question is how do other shareholders other than Elliott feel about this deal  They are just going to have to do the evaluation   said a person who worked on the proxy vote solicitation during Dell Chief Executive Michael Dell s move to take his computer maker private for  24 9 billion two years ago ",2015-10-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/emc-executive-and-his-gm-past-played-key-role-in-emc-dell-mechanics-365987,365987

106548,328063,VMW,DXC Technology  DXC  To Post Q4 Earnings  A Beat In Store ,opinion,DXC Technology Company   NYSE DXC   is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 24  after the market closes  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether or not this IT services company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter Notably  DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation   CSC   and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise   NYSE HPE    which was closed on Apr 1  2017  So  this will be the fourth quarterly result of the combined business  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement What the Zacks Model Unveils Our proven model shows that DXC Technology is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of  1 06   You can see  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth quarter earnings is pegged at  2 20  which indicates a massive 91 3  year over year jump  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged  over the past 30 days  Additionally  analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly  6 12 billion  up approximately 224  from the year ago quarter DXC Technology Company  Price and EPS Surprise   Synergies from the merger of CSC and HPE s Enterprise Services business will likely have contributed to the company s top and bottom line results  Apart from this  strategic partnerships and acquisitions are anticipated to have brought in additional revenues in the to be reported quarter  However  escalating interest expenses resulting from increased debt burden might have dampened the company s profitability  offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent Let s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail Merger Synergies   The Key Growth CatalystThe above mentioned merger has combined Computer Sciences  strength in insurance  healthcare  and financial services with HPE s expertise in industries like transportation  pharma  technology  media and telecom  Post merger  DXC Technology has become the world s second largest end to end IT services providing company after Accenture plc   NYSE ACN    We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the combined entity will have generated revenues of  more than  24 billion in fiscal 2018  Also  DXC Technology is projected to generate cost synergies worth  1 billion during the first fiscal and record a run rate of  1 5 billion at the end of the same Notably  the company registered more than 200  surge in revenues in all the preceding three quarters  mainly benefiting from the merger  The analysts covering the stock anticipate that the merger benefit will drive DXC Technology s fiscal fourth quarter top line performance as well Additional Revenues From AcquisitionsFollowing the footsteps of CSC  DXC Technology is also focusing on acquisitions to expedite growth  Since its formation  the company has announced six acquisitions   Tribridge  Logicalis SMC  Racemi  M Power  eBECS and Stable37 Therefore  the buyout is likely to benefit the company s soon to be reported quarter results in the form of increased customer base and additional revenues Partnerships Enhancing Customer BaseGoing ahead  the company s continued focus on making strategic partnerships to expand its share in the cloud computing market is likely to aid the fiscal fourth quarter results  The company  in August 2017  collaborated with VMware   NYSE VMW   and launched DXC Managed Cloud Services  supported by VMware s next generation hybrid cloud platform It should be noted that the company has strategic partnerships with the likes of AT T  NYSE T  and HCL  It has also joined forces with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to develop cloud based solutions for enterprise and public sector clients  In addition  it has entered into cloud partnership agreement with IBM  NYSE IBM  and SAP  as well  These alliances have increased its access to new technology  backed innovative product development and creation of new markets Also  it has enabled clients to leverage the benefits of mobility  social networking and big data facilities  This  in turn  is likely to expand DXC Technology s customer base and help garner additional revenues Escalating Interest Costs to Impede ProfitabilityRising interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company s profitability  As of Dec 31  2017  DXC Technology has a total long term debt  excluding current portion  of  6 37 billion  while it had paid  231 million as interest expenses during the first three quarters of fiscal 2018  which was 166  higher than the previous fiscal period tally The company s long term outstanding debt significantly increased last fiscal  CSC  prior to the completion of its merger with HPE s Enterprise Services business  had taken additional debt  This increased DXC Technology s total long term liability  thereby escalating its interest cost burden  Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company

106555,328070,VMW,Add These 7 GARP Stocks To Your Kitty For Maximum Returns,opinion,Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains  This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that are likely to offer solid returns in the near term Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Last 5

quarter  Lack of progress on a deal to sell the company has also hurt shares  Is there hope for a turnaround for RCII Q4 ResultsBoth the top and bottom line fell short of analyst expectations RCII posted an adjusted loss of 41 cents per share  which marks a loss per share for the third straight quarter   Total revenues were  639 million  tumbling 6 6  year over year due to a decline in the Core U S  and Acceptance Now segments Management did note that hurricane related disruptions and soft comparable store sales also hurt results Total comps dropped 2  in Q4  reflecting declines of 3 6  and 2 3  in the Core U S  and Mexico segments  respectively  partly mitigated by 6 7  increase noted at the Acceptance Now segment Deal to Sell For a while now  investors have become deeply concerned about the rent to own company s business model  as well as its top and bottom line performance  Many were hoping that the retailer would end up being acquired At the end of January  news broke that a

 After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Honda Motor Company  Ltd  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Honda Motor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 9  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  its current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years However  the stock s PE also compares slightly unfavorably with the industy s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 9 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Honda Motor has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 6 3  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Honda Motor has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now If anything  HMC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Honda Motor currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Honda Motor a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Honda Motor is 1 2  lower than the industry average of 1 4  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Honda Motor might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of A  This gives HMC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year and next has seen two estimates going higher in the past 30 days compared to none lower As a result  the current year consensus estimate has declined by 27  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched up by 4 1  This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHonda Motor is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  among the Top 9   and strong Zacks Rank  Honda Motor looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past year  its industry has outperformed the broader market So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Investor Alert  Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance

106578,328093,VMW,7 GARP Stocks That Will Maximize Your Portfolio Returns,opinion,If you re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing  try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy  It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects However  one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy  While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks  GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the GARP strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is also considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  P E and P B ratios less than M industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  These few criteria have narrowed down the

106587,328102,VMW,Stocks Decline As Political Uncertainty Fuels Volatility  ,opinion,"Stocks Decline as Political Uncertainty Fuels Volatility  U S  stocks finished the trading session lower  but well off the day s the worst levels as volatility ramped up on heightened uncertainty inside the beltway  Afternoon reports suggesting that the Senate has enough votes to pass its tax bill were overshadowed by some uncertainty regarding the possible ramifications that the developing situation surrounding former NSA advisor Mike Flynn may have for the Trump administration  Treasury yields and the U S  dollar traded lower as some upbeat reads on the manufacturing sector were seemingly brushed aside  Energy shares outperformed amid a rise in crude oil prices and gold gained ground 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  declined 41 points  0 2   to 24 232  the S P 500 Index decreased 5 points  0 2   to 2 642  and the Nasdaq Composite lost 26 points  0 4   to 6 848  In heavy volume  972 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 2 3 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq  WTI crude oil gained  0 96 to  58 36 per barrel and wholesale gasoline ticked  0 01 higher to  1 74 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price increased  5 61 to  1 280 61 per ounce  and the Dollar Index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was nearly 0 2  lower at 92 88  Markets were mixed for the week  as the DJIA rallied 2 9  and the S P 500 Index advanced 1 5   while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0 6  
Ulta Beauty Inc  NASDAQ ULTA    ULTA  213  reported Q3 earnings per share  EPS  of  1 70  or  1 71 ex items  versus the  1 66 FactSet estimate  as revenues rose 18 6  year over year  y y  to  1 3 billion  roughly in line with forecasts  Q3 same store sales rose 10 3  y y  matching expectations  UTLA s gross margin came in south of expectations  The company issued Q4 EPS guidance that was below estimates  while its same store sales outlook for the period had a midpoint that was just shy of forecasts  Shares closed solidly lower 
VMware Inc  NYSE VMW   VMW  124  posted Q3 earnings of  1 07 per share  or  1 34 ex items  compared to the projected  1 28  with revenues growing 11 0  y y to  2 0 billion  roughly in line with forecasts  The cloud infrastructure and business mobility company issued Q4 guidance that exceeded expectations  Shares were nicely higher 
The major automakers reported November sales today  with General Motors Co s  NYSE GM  43  sales declining 2 9  y y  compared to FactSet s projected 1 5  decrease  Ford Motor Co  NYSE F  13  reported a 6 7  rise in sales  versus the expected gain of 3 3   Fiat Chrysler Automobiles   NYSE FCAU   FCAU  17  Chrysler sales fell 3 7   compared to the expected 5 6  drop  GM and FCAU traded lower  while F finished higher 
Manufacturing activity continues to show solid expansion  tax reform uncertainty flares up
The Institute for Supply Management  ISM  Manufacturing Index    for November declined to 58 2 from 58 7 in October  compared to the Bloomberg forecast calling for a dip to 58 3  New orders rose 0 6 points to 64 0 and production gained 2 9 points to 63 9  while employment dipped 0 1 points to 59 7 and prices declined 3 0 points to 65 5  Order backlog remained at 55 0 and new export orders decreased 0 5 points to 56 0  ISM said comments from respondents reflect expanding business conditions 
The final Markit U S  Manufacturing PMI Index was revised to 53 9 for November from the preliminary reading of 53 8  versus expectations of 54 0  and below the 54 6 level posted in October  The release is independent and differs from ISM s manufacturing report  as it has less historic value and Markit weights its index components differently 
Construction spending    rose 1 4  month over month  m m  in October  well above projections of a 0 5  increase  and following September s unrevised 0 3  increase  Residential spending was up 0 4  m m  while non residential spending jumped 2 1  
Treasuries finished higher  with the yield on the 2 year note dipping 1 basis points  bp  to 1 77   the yield on the 10 year note falling 5 bps to 2 36  and the 30 year bond rate dropping 7 bps to 2 76  
The U S  dollar reversed to the downside  along with Treasury yields following a two day rally  after former National Security Advisor Flynn pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI and agreed to cooperate with the Special Counsel s Office  This caused a spike in volatility and fostered uncertainty about what this could mean for the Trump Presidency  with the Senate scrambling to find enough support to bring its tax bill to a final vote  The Senate delayed yesterday s final vote as a key area of compromise regarding deficit concerns hit a snag  The Senate spent much of the day in preliminary procedures to try to mend disagreements  Afternoon reports have suggested that the legislative body now has enough votes to pass its bill with a vote expected later in the day 
Negotiations between the two chambers will likely be extremely challenging  given the differences between the two approaches  For investors  we still think it is too early to take any drastic action  If and when a tax bill passes  there will be time to review the details and amend your tax and financial plans accordingly  Regardless of the outcome of the tax bill  it s always a good idea to meet with your tax and financial advisors before the end of the year to review your current financial situation and discuss your plans for the coming year 
Europe falls late in the day  Asia mixed
The European equity markets fell late in the session  with yesterday s delayed vote on tax reform in the U S  stymieing recent optimism regarding progress being made to pass a bill and causing uncertainty to flare up  This was exacerbated former U S  National Security Advisor Flynn pleading guilty for lying to the FBI and agreeing to cooperate with the Special Counsel s Office  Technology issues in the region extended the week s selloff  while auto related issues saw some pressure  However  the energy sector was the lone group in positive territory amid a rally in crude oil prices on the heels of yesterday s OPEC agreement to extend its production cuts to the end of next year  An upbeat read on November eurozone manufacturing growth by Markit  which showed growth was revised to a higher acceleration from October s than initially estimated  was overshadowed 
The euro overcame early pressure as the U S  dollar fell noticeably on the exacerbated U S  political uncertainty  and the British pound came off the worst levels of the day but still modestly pared a recent rally  The pound found some strength this week amid signs that the deadlocked Brexit negotiations may be heading to the next stage  Bond yields in the region mostly saw solid pressure 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed with the markets choppy following yesterday s delayed tax reform vote in the U S  that appeared to cool some of the optimism that has led a sharp rally in the U S  equity markets this week  Shares of Japanese companies advanced with the yen reversing a brief spike yesterday  while reports showed the nation s Q3 capital spending accelerated more than expected and household spending for October came in stronger than anticipated  while national October consumer price inflation rose in line with expectations  Mainland Chinese stocks finished flat and equities trading in Hong Kong declined on the heels of the flared up U S  tax reform uncertainty and a report from Caixin showing growth in the country s manufacturing output unexpectedly slowed  diverging from yesterday s government report that suggesting expansion surprisingly accelerated 
Australian securities gained ground with financials modestly paring yesterday s drop on the government s announcement that it will launch an inquiry into the sector  while energy issues rose following yesterday s OPEC production extension  Indian stocks fell on the heels of late yesterday s report that showed Q3 GDP accelerated to a 6 3  y y pace of growth  but slightly below the projected 6 4  expansion  South Korean equities finished flat in the wake of the recent selloff in the tech sector  yesterday s Bank of Korea rate hike  and today s stronger than expected Q3 GDP report 
Stocks higher on week as damage already done by the bulls
Despite the spike in volatility on Friday  most U S  equity markets posted solid gains for the week  bolstered by signs the Senate s tax reform bill was finding enough support to gain momentum toward a final vote  Telecom and financial stocks led the way on the tax reform optimism  though a noticeable sector rotation came to the detriment of technology issues and the Nasdaq  which have led the markets  yearly rally and string of record highs  Economic optimism also helped boost the markets  with Consumer Confidence hitting a 17 year high  new home sales unexpectedly jumping to a decade high  Q3 GDP being revised higher to 3 3   and culminating with the Fed s Beige Book showing business activity remained steady and noting a slight improvement in the outlook  Energy issues finished higher  while the highly anticipated OPEC meeting delivered a production cut extension  Following Friday s volatility surge  the U S  dollar finished little changed after showing mid week signs of life and the Treasury yield curve gave back a brief bout of steepening 
This sets the stage for next week  in which the  will likely contend with continued scrutiny of tax reform  while delivering factory orders  the trade balance  the ISM non Manufacturing Index  Q3 nonfarm productivity and unit labor costs  as well as the preliminary December University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index  However  the headlining report will likely be Friday s November nonfarm payroll report  with the Fed s December monetary policy meeting looming the following week and highly expected to deliver a third rate hike of the year 
International reports due out next week that deserve a mention include  Australia Q3 GDP and the Reserve Bank of Australia s monetary policy decision  China trade balance  Caixin s PMI Services Index and inflation statistics  India the Reserve Bank of India s monetary policy decision  Japan Q3 GDP  Eurozone Markit s business activity reports  retail sales and Q3 GDP  along with German factory orders and trade balance  U K  industrial and manufacturing production  trade balance and the Bank of England s inflation target ",2017-12-03,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-decline-as-political-uncertainty-fuels-volatility-200269966,200269966

106590,328105,VMW,VMware s Stock  Just What Is Going On ,opinion,"The last few days have been highly eventful for VMware Inc  NYSE VMW  as investors try to figure out what will happen with them and Dell  On Friday  reports that Dell was considering an IPO and buying up VMware saw VMware s stock  which had already performed well over the past year  shoot up by over 10 percent  But on Monday  CNBC reported that  VMware could buy Dell in massive reverse merger  sources say  VMware lost all of Friday s gains and some more  closing on Monday at  125 05 
No one knows what is going to happen to a certainty  Reports indicate that both a Dell IPO and a reverse merger are merely possibilities which Dell executives are discussing instead of concrete decisions  But what is clear is that now is a good time for investors to examine their holdings in VMware 
While some investors may tell you that VMware s stock is still undervalued  the recent reports of a reverse merger are concerning for VMware and more likely than a Dell IPO  There are other concerns as well  and investors who before may have considered VMware should stay away until there is more information

To recap things from the beginning  Dell went private in 2013 as it transitioned from selling personal computers to supplying hardware and software to corporate data centers  In 2015  Dell acquired EMC Corp  NYSE EMC  for  67 billion in 2015 and obtained 80 percent of VMware stock at the same time  The other 20 percent stayed on the market  and VMware stock had nearly doubled over the past 12 months before Monday s collapse 
Dell owns VMware  but would essentially sell itself to VMware as part of the reverse merger  While investors do not know what Dell is currently worth  we can presume that it is worth more than  67 billion  which  notes would make it the biggest tech deal in history 
But why is Dell considering a reverse merger or going public  especially since CEO Michael Dell has spent years talking about how he was happy not having to worry about investors every quarter  Because Michael Dell may not like investors  he does need our money to deal with Dell s serious debt load 
 reports that Dell has over  52 billion in debt and spent  2 billion over the past 12 months to handle interest payments  Much of this debt is frontloaded and set to come due in 2021 and earlier  Furthermore  the recent U S  tax bill limits how much interest expense companies can deduct from their taxes  which would further encourage Dell to get out of debt quickly 
Given Dell s problems  a reverse merger is more likely than an IPO  Dell would have to persuade investors to buy shares for a formal listing  which would be tricky as investors would not be interested in seeing their money just pay off Dell s debt  But in a reverse merger  Dell would be compensated for with VMware stock which has performed very well  and perhaps even give Michael Dell and executives an opportunity to cash out  
VMware s problems
A reverse merger could be good for Dell  but it would be a different story for VMware  In addition to giving up shares  Dell could also shunt some of its debt onto VMware s books  relieving its debt load at VMware s expense  Dell might counter by arguing that VMware and Dell merged together would be highly synergistic  VMware specializes in virtualization software  often used in providing  in sensitive situations  which lets companies cut costs and store more data by combining multiple operating systems on a single PC  Meanwhile  Dell sells corporate application to companies  which can now use more applications with VMware s virtualization software 
But this touches onto another problem with VMware s prospects which have nothing to do with Dell  Virtualization was revolutionary technology five to ten years ago  but companies are steadily moving towards storing data on the cloud with servers like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  VMware has continued to grow and be profitable as the corporate world s transition to the cloud will be slow  but it has a lot of work needed to stay a leader in data collection services 
Wait and See Dell will likely reach a decision on how it will relieve its debt load in early February  and it is possible that the fervent speculation which bought VMware up and then crashed it down is empty noise  But a reverse merger would be a major blow for a company which already has to figure out how it will compete with cloud technology  VMware performed well throughout 2017 in a bull market  but investors are better off waiting for more concrete news about Dell and figuring out if the market will continue to stay hot  VMware is not a bad buy  but a little more caution and time is needed for this company ",2018-01-30,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vmwares-stock-just-what-is-going-on-200285173,200285173
106591,328106,VMW,DXC Technology To Post  DXC  Q3 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,DXC Technology Company   NYSE DXC   is set to report third quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8  Notably  DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation  CSC  and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise   NYSE HPE    which was closed on Apr 1  2017 So  this will be the second quarterly result of the combined business  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at  1 99  representing a year over year increase of a whopping 145 7   We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been revised upward over the past 30 days  Additionally  analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly  6 23 billion  up a massive 224 9  from the year ago quarter DXC Technology s fiscal third quarter result is likely to benefit from CSC and HPE s Enterprise Services business merger  strategic partnerships and acquisitions  However  escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company s profitability  offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent DXC Technology Company  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail Combined Entities Opened Up Avenues of GrowthPost merger  DXC Technology has become the world s second largest end to end IT services providing company after Accenture plc   NYSE ACN    We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company  The merger has combined Computer Sciences  strength in insurance  healthcare  and financial services with HPE s expertise in industries like transportation  pharma  technology  media and telecom It is anticipated that the combined entity will generate revenues of approximately  26 billion  Also  DXC Technology is projected to generate cost synergies worth  1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of  1 5 billion at the end of the same Notably  the company had registered a 229  surge in the fiscal second quarter revenues chiefly benefiting from the merger  The analysts covering the stock anticipate that the merger benefit will drive DXC Technology s fiscal third quarter top line performance as well Enhancing Customer Base with PartnershipsThe company s continued focus on making strategic partnerships to expand its share in the cloud computing market is likely to aid fiscal third quarter results  The company  in August 2017  collaborated with VMware   NYSE VMW   and launched the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware s next generation hybrid cloud platform It should be noted that the company has strategic partnerships with the likes of AT T  NYSE T  and HCL  It has also joined forces with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to develop cloud based solutions for enterprise and public sector clients  In addition  it has entered into cloud partnership agreement with IBM  NYSE IBM  and SAP as well  These alliances have increased the company s access to advanced technology  backed innovative product development and creation of new markets Furthermore  it has enabled clients to leverage the benefits of mobility  social networking and big data facilities  This  in turn  is likely to expand DXC Technology s customer base and help garner additional revenues Buyouts to Generate Additional RevenuesFollowing the footsteps of CSC  DXC Technology is also focusing on acquisitions to expedite growth  Since its formation  the company has announced two acquisitions   Tribridge and Logicalis SMC  While it completed the Tribridge buyout in July last year  the Logicalis SMC acquisition is still in process Tribridge is one of the largest independent integrators of Microsoft s Dynamics 365  which explains why this acquisition makes sense for DXC Technology  Therefore  this buyout is likely to benefit the company s to be reported quarter results in the form of increased customer base and additional revenues Rising Interest Costs to Dent ProfitabilityFlaring up interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company s profitability  As of Sep 30  2017  DXC has a total long term debt  excluding current portion  of  6 33 billion  while it paid  154 million as interest expenses during the first half of fiscal 2018  which was 185  higher than the first half of fiscal 2017 tally The company s long term outstanding debt has significantly increased this fiscal  CSC  prior to the completion of its merger with HPE s Enterprise Services business  had taken additional debt  This increased DXC Technology s total long term liability  thereby escalating its interest cost burden  Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company s bottom line results Currently  DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent

106613,328128,VMW,5 Stocks With Solid Sales Growth Worth Considering,opinion,A healthy business with stable sales growth is the key to survival in today s fast changing and highly competitive environment  So  superior revenues are essential to drive growth  Most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise Revenues are income generated by a company through business activities  Though a company might not be profitable over a particular time period  it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations In cases when companies tend to incur a loss on a temporary basis  these are valued based on revenues and not on earnings  This is because sales growth  or decline  is usually an early indicator of the company s future earnings performance While sales growth is an important metric for any corporation for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision making  this in isolation does not reflect too much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits Hence  a consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and further potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening Based in Chattanooga  TN  Unum

106615,328130,VMW,5 Stocks To Buy For Remarkable Earnings Growth In 2017,opinion,Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  But the question here is why  This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings Investors should always look out for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price Future OutperformersEarnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates  However  if you pick stocks just on the basis of earnings growth then you are paying for something that has already been reflected in the stock price So  what is earnings acceleration  It is the incremental growth in a company s earnings per share  EPS   In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be called earnings acceleration Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  Sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down  Hence  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance Screening Parameters Let s look for stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rate is also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1

106619,328134,VMW,Don t Get Caught Without VMware In Your Portfolio,opinion,"VMware Inc  NYSE VMW  Information Technology   Software   Reports October 26  After Market Closes
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 11 on  1 77 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than the Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
Former foes  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and VMware signed a partnership to become primary private cloud partners
VMware faces a number of near term risks including stiff competition  soft IT spending and economic uncertainty in some of its key markets
What are you expecting for  
VMware is scheduled to report third quarter earnings tomorrow  after the market closes  This is the first quarter after partner company EMC  NYSE EMC  was acquired by Dell in September  The new Dell brand now holds about 80  of VMW shares which were previously held by EMC  Shares have barely been impacted by the move and have traded sideways for the past 30 days  This should also have little to no impact on its financial performance  Analyst expectations have been tepid on the heels of the upcoming report 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 11 on  1 77 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than the Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Compared to a year earlier that represents an 8  increase in earnings and 5  in sales  Shares historically drop by 1  immediately through the print  only to jump 30 days following a report 

VMware is well positioned to leverage its leading position in the virtualization market to other markets such as data centers  hybrid cloud and mobile devices  These three markets will likely be the fastest growing segments in cloud computing over the next several years  VMware also continues to form strong partnerships with major players such as Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and IBM  NYSE IBM  
A recent partnership with Amazon might be the most important though  The former foes will now be primary private cloud partners  enabling VMware to leverage Amazon s robust footprint in the cloud market 
A few major concerns still stand in the way of its success  including stiff competition  soft IT spending and macroeconomic uncertainty in some of its key markets  Additionally  a subpar report from key competitor Citrix last week might be an indication of weakness in the virtualization market ",2016-10-26,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/don’t-get-caught-without-this-cloud-computing-company-in-your-portfolio-200160783,200160783
106620,328135,VMW,Buy These 5 Stocks With Strong Sales Growth Now,opinion,"Persistent sales growth is the key to survival for any business  particularly in today s fast changing and highly competitive business environment  For any corporate house  sales growth not only provides an insight into product demand and pricing power  it is vital for growth projections and strategic decision making as well From investors  perspective  sales growth remains a key measure as well  Here  we have crafted a meticulous stock picking strategy that is primarily focused on sales growth of a company Often  investors fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric  This might be because of investors  preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum Nevertheless  investors should look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise  This is because in cases where companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues not earnings  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future performance Also  investors should make sure that not only sales numbers are increasing but are accelerating as well  Precisely  sales growth rate in the current year should exceed the prior year s sales growth Hence  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  This metric s importance lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings However  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits  Hence  considering a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Strategy to Bet onA careful selection of stocks considering certain factors should help investors to not only build wealth but beat the market as well In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we added 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our primary screening parameters However  sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added a few other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric measures the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable

106621,328136,VMW,4 Stocks To Buy On Solid Earnings Acceleration,opinion,Investors are always on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Better than expected earnings  more often than not  lead to an uptick in shares  Consistent earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings  But  earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price Finding Future OutperformersIf you pick stocks just on the basis of earnings growth then you are paying for something that has already been reflected in the stock price  However  steady earnings acceleration helps you select stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet and are consequently on the verge of solid price appreciation  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Earnings acceleration is basically incrementally growing EPS of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases over a considerable period  it is termed as earnings acceleration   Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down Screening Parameters Let s find stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS

106622,328137,VMW,What s In The Cards For Nutanix  NTNX  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Nutanix Inc    NASDAQ NTNX   is set to report its first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Nov 29  2016  This will be the company s first earnings call since it went public on Sep 30  The enterprise cloud platform provider raised almost  238 million by selling 14 87 million shares at a price of  16 00 per share Although the stock surged 131 3  to close at  37 00 on debut  the share price has significantly come down in the last couple of months  Since Sep 30  the stock is down 8 11  as compared with the Zacks It Services industry decline of 0 43  

Nutanix s enterprise cloud platform  converges traditional silos of server  virtualization and storage into one integrated solution and can also connect to public cloud services   The company s offerings include two software products Acropolis and Prism  which are delivered on x86 servers In fiscal year 2016  revenues soared 84  year over year to  445 million  slightly lower than almost 90  surge it posted in fiscal 2015  However  net losses widened from  84 million in 2014  to  126 million in 2015 and  168 million in 2016  The company anticipates reporting net loss for the foreseeable future Key FactorsWe believe that Nutanix is well positioned to benefit from the strong growth prospect of hyperconverged integrated systems  HCIS   Per market research firm Gartner  HCIS will grow 79  to reach almost  2 billion in 2016  By 2019  HCIS will be the fastest growing segment of the overall market for integrated systems  reaching almost  5 billion Per MarketWatch  Nutanix had 3 768 end customers as of Jul 31  2016  which includes the likes of Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI   and Nintendo However  intensifying competition is a key concern  Dell s majority control over VMware   NYSE VMW    post the EMC  NYSE EMC  acquisition is a major headwind for Nutanix  If Dell chooses to use VMware products instead of Nutanix  the company s top line growth will suffer  consequently impacting stock price NUTANIX INC A Price and Consensus
 

   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nutanix will beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  currently stands at 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 44 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Nutanix has a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum Stocks to ConsiderHere is a stock that you may want to consider  as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Supernus Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ SUPN    with an Earnings ESP of  30 77  and a Zacks Rank  2 You can see

106623,328138,VMW,Bulls Or Bears  ,opinion,"After posting an impressive bull run after the election  the markets pulled back this week  prompting traders to wonder whether the run was over  Some analysts are arguing that the prospects of an interest rate hike are applying the brakes to this rally  I am more inclined to think we are looking at a simple case of profit taking 
If we back up a moment and look at the overall market for 2016  this has been a tough year for traders of all stripes to make money  S P 500 had only gained a little over two percent when we hit that low on November 4th  That isn t a very pretty picture to present to your institutional clients  However  when the market hit that high on November 25th  the year to date gain was suddenly a much more respectable 8 6   Maybe it s time to lock in some gains  The large players were predictably nervous and ready to take profits the minute any softness appeared  The trading volume in S P 500 supports this viewpoint  The two strongest down days this week were Wednesday and Thursday  and trading volume spiked way above average both days  Anecdotal evidence comes from individual stocks  Some of the best recent stock runs abruptly ended this week for no apparent reason  e g   NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA   VMware Inc  NYSE VMW   Veeva Sys Inc  NYSE VEEV  and others  Traders were locking in profits before they got away 
The prospects of lower corporate tax rates and a more business friendly administration has fueled this recent market run higher  But now the market is taking a bit of a breather  I think this is principally profit taking  so I don t expect prices to trend lower from here  However  that doesn t mean we can ignore the relatively weak economic data and modest levels of corporate profitability reported most recently  By most measures  this market is at least fully priced and may be nearing an overbought stage 
But we shouldn t forget the calendar  The so called Santa Claus rally during the last week of the year is thought to be triggered by large funds unloading losers for tax purposes  This may lower the prices of some attractive stocks that are quickly bought up  resulting in a short lived rally  The Stock Traders Almanac has noted the historical pattern of small cap stocks outperforming the large caps in January and terms this the  January Effect   This effect tends to begin around mid December and lasts well into February 
Therefore  we are entering a time of the year that tends to be bullish  whatever the explanation  I will be watching the market on Monday to see if today s modest gains signaled the continuation of a sideways to slightly bullish market  The strong run of late November couldn t continue to the moon  but I don t see any evidence of the bears taking charge of this market ",2016-12-04,Dr. Duke,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bulls-or-bears-200167990,200167990

Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC    Financials  Wells Fargo is still in the midst of its fake account scandal that will surely not be forgotten in the near future  The company s CEO was ordered to testify on Capitol Hill about his involvement  or lack thereof  in the scandal  At the testimony  Stumpf openly denied that this was an orchestrated act by management and apologized to all those who were impacted  It s often the case that a company s stock performs poorly when its CEO is interrogated by the Senate  Sometimes no news is good news 
Tableau  NYSE DATA    Enterprise Software  Small Mid   Shares are down 43  year to date thanks to a weak fourth quarter that cut the stock by 25   Since then  shares have largely traded sideways with recent earnings reports failing to shine new light  Adding to its woes  the stock has become victim to a slew of downgrades  In the past few months  RBC Capital  DA Davidson and Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB  all downgraded the stock  More recently  the company gave a bearish crossover when share prices dipped below its 50 day moving average

Time Warner  NYSE TWX    Media  In the three weeks that Media game has been in existence  Time Warner s average rank has progressively worsened  In the inaugural game  the cable provider garnered an average rank of 4 79  which then dropped to 5 31 and this week it holds down the bottom spot with an average user rank of 6 5  Since then  shares have dropped 3  and should continue to see greater declines  The stock is currently trading below its 20  and 50 day moving average combined with a negative MACD  spelling trouble for investors  Finally  share prices are still well above the volume profile  so a continued dip cannot be ruled out 
Yelp  NYSE YELP    Social Media  Since bottoming out in February  shares of Yelp are up a resounding 160   Despite the rebound  Yelp is still the worst ranked company in this week s social media game and there is certainly a case to be made for a broad pullback  Conventional wisdom would suggest that such a large spike in a small amount of time is not sustainable  Closely watched technical indicators also support a dip on the horizon  There is still a very large gap yet to be filled just above  32 while an RSI of 63 is slightly reflective of an overbought stock 
VMware  NYSE VMW    Most Heavily Shorted  For a second week  VMware was the worst ranked company in the most heavily shorted and large enterprise software contest  Shares are down about 8  in the past 12 months  driven by an ongoing slowdown in revenue growth  The stock has received a number of downgrades over this time  the most recent coming from Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  at the start of September  The investment bank downgraded the stock from buy to neutral  similar to a call by Citigroup  NYSE C  a month earlier  Meanwhile  the company s chart doesn t do VMW any justice  There are multiple gaps below its current trading price that still need to be filled  Additionally  negative OBV and a declining MACD support a downturn on the horizon

Most Attractive Stock Feature for August  American Express  NYSE AXP   65 share 

American Express  AXP   global credit card provider  is one of the additions to our Most Attractive stocks for August  We ve previously detailed a strategy that could boost AXP s value by  50 billion 

Since 2010  American Express has grown after tax profit  NOPAT  by 25  compounded annually to  5 5 billion in 2015  Over the past twelve months  TTM   NOPAT has grown to  5 8 billion  AXP s NOPAT margin has improved from 7  in 2010 to 18  TTM  per Figure 1 

Figure 1  American Express  Improving Margins   Profit



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

Further testament to fundamental strength of AXP s business  the company has improved its return on invested capital  ROIC  from 11  in 2005 to 14  TTM and generated cumulative  16 6 billion in free cash flow over the past five years 

Impacts of Footnotes Adjustments And Forensic Accounting

In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and an accurate shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to American Express  2015 10 K 

Income Statement  we made  733 million of adjustments  with a net effect of removing  495 million in non operating expenses  2  of revenue   We removed  119 million in non operating income and  614 million in non operating expenses 

Balance Sheet  we made  7 5 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of  2 5 billion  One of the largest adjustments was  2 7 billion due to other comprehensive income  This adjustment represented 7  of reported net assets  You can see all the adjustments made to AXP s balance sheet  

Valuation  we made  2 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  2 billion  There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value  The largest adjustment was the removal of  1 1 billion in off balance sheet operating leases  This adjustment represents 2  of American Express  market cap  Despite the decrease in shareholder value  AXP remains undervalued 

Current Valuation Implies Permanent Profit Decline

AXP is down around 6  on the year and its share price is significantly undervalued  At its current price of  65 share  AXP has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 8  This ratio means the market expects AXP s NOPAT to permanently decline by 20   This expectation seems overly pessimistic given American Express  long history of profit growth 

If American Express can grow NOPAT by just 3  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  94 share today   a 45  upside 

Most Dangerous Stock Feature  Cirrus Logic  CRUS   51 share 

Cirrus Logic  CRUS   specialized semiconductor provider  is one of the additions to our Most Dangerous stocks for August 

Cirrus Logic has grown revenue by 13  compounded annually from 2013 2016  Over this same time  Cirrus Logic s economic earnings  the true cash flows of the business  have declined from  66 million to   11 million in 2016  or  56  compounded annually  Economic earnings have fallen even further  to   35 million  over the last twelve months  per Figure 2 

Figure 2  CRUS s Growing Losses



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

In addition to increasing losses  since 2013  Cirrus  ROIC has fallen from 20  to 8  TTM  Furthermore  Cirrus Logic has burned through cumulative  244 million in free cash flow over the past five years 

Forensic Accounting Reveals Overstated EPS

In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to Cirrus Logic s 2016 10 K 

Income Statement  we made  37 million of adjustments with a net impact of removing  4 million in non operating income   1  of revenue   We removed  16 million in non operating expenses and  21 million in non operating income 

Balance Sheet  we made  837 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of  213 million  The largest adjustment was  457 million related to asset write downs  This adjustment represented 43  of reported net assets 

Valuation  we made  479 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  113 million  The largest adjustment was the removal of  72 million in outstanding employee stock options  This adjustment represents 2  of Cirrus  market cap 

High Expectations Already Baked Into Valuation

Despite the clear deterioration of CRUS  fundamentals  the stock is priced for significant profit growth long into the future  To justify its current price of  51 share  CRUS must grow NOPAT by 15  compounded annually for the next 15 years  In this scenario  Cirrus Logic would be generating nearly  10 billion in revenue 15 years from now  nearly equal to that of MasterCard s  MA  2015 revenue and  1 5 billion greater than eBay s  EBAY  2015 revenue 

On the other hand  even if CRUS can grow NOPAT by 10  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth only  29 share today   a 43  downside

106631,328146,VMW,Solid Sales Growth Makes These 5 Stocks Attractive Now,opinion,"What s the mantra for making money from the daily roller coaster ride in the stock market   Well  there is no set rule for successful investing  However  knowledge of some of the basic strategies should help investors in taking smart investment decisions Among numerous stock picking strategies  we chose a rational down to earth investment approach   one that focuses on the sales growth of a company Sales growth is an important measure for any corporate  as it is vital to growth projections and strategic decision making  Notably  revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business  It s worth keeping in mind that when companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues  as sales growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance Hence  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  Notably  this metric s importance lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales unlike earnings Focusing solely on sales growth is  however  not enough  Considering a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments The Winning StrategyA careful selection of stocks considering certain factors should help investors to not only build wealth but beat the market as well In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we added 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our primary screening parameters However  sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added a few other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric measures the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen Nu Skin

106632,328147,VMW,What s Behind The HPE Software Unit Sale  ,opinion,"It s being rumored that Hewlett Packard Enterprise   NYSE HPE   is on the verge of selling its software unit to Thoma Bravo LLC for  8 10 billion in a deal being managed by Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Or  it can also sell to other interested parties like Vista Equity Partners Management  Carlyle Group  NASDAQ CG  and TPG Capital  all of which have reportedly expressed interest 
 HEWLETT PKD ENT Price    
The software division generated 2015 revenue of  3 6 billion  It includes the highly controversial Autonomy acquisition that was mostly written down by the current CEO Meg Whitman  It also includes other acquisitions like Mercury Interactive and Vertica  But the segment hasn t been doing too well of late as customers shift toward cloud supported  as a service software purchasing 
The sale news doesn t come as much of a surprise since Whitman has been focused on taking out costs and disposing off non core assets  In May  she announced the spin off and merger of the business services division with Computer Sciences Corp    NYSE CSC   in a deal valued at  8 5 billion for HPE shareholders 
And this was just a continuation of restructuring actions that started last year when Hewlett Packard Company split itself into the consumer facing HP Inc   NYSE HPQ   and the enterprise facing   Hewlett Packard Enterprise after a prior attempt to sell the computing business wasn t well received by investors 
Just as Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   did recently when it announced a 7  cutback in its workforce  HPE too is trimming the fat so it can mobilize resources to the fast growing areas of the cloud such as SDN and converged and hyper converged infrastructure 
Understanding The Opportunity
As more companies move their workloads to the cloud  vendors have been trying to differentiate themselves by providing improved efficiency  lower operational complexity and rapid scaling  This in turn has led to various degrees of convergence of the IT building blocks  computing  storage and increasingly  networking resources  
Companies like EMC Corp   NYSE EMC   may be able to supply fully integrated solutions where it also offers all the components or include components made by other technology vendors  depending on customer demand   Both these categories use discrete systems that are designed to work in combination 
The single vendor market is dominated by EMC  Oracle  NYSE ORCL  and HPE  These three companies accounted for 25 5   24 0  and 22 5  of this  1 58 billion market in the first quarter according to IDC  EMC and HPE grew strong double digits while Oracle declined  The Cisco NetApp combine dominated the multivendor market with 55 2  market share  up low single digits  in the first quarter  with EMC the only other major player with 35 6  share representing a high single digit decline 
EMC is in the process of being acquired by Dell  so the five major vendors will then be Dell  Oracle  HPE  Cisco and NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  
But that s not the end of the story  There is a third and emerging category  hyper converged solution  that offers storage and computing as a single unit using the same server resources  Gartner says that this market will grow 79  to reach almost  2 billion in 2016 growing steadily from those levels to  5 billion  or 24  of the converged infrastructure market by 2019  IDC says this market grew 148 0  in the first quarter to  371 88 million 
This last segment is dominated by smaller players like Nutanix and SimpliVity that pioneered the concept  as well as others like NimBoxx  Scale Computing and Pivot3  The only major player here is VMware   NYSE VMW    which is owned by EMC  which Dell is buying  Since most of the players are lesser known and also have more limited resources  enterprise adoption is probably slower than it could be 
But with Cisco claiming strong demand for its HyperFlex  management mentioned 500 new customers in the first full quarter since launch  and VMware saying that its hyper converged license bookings  including VSAN and VxRail grew over 200  from last year  things could be about to change  HPE has offerings including the Hyper Converged 380 and HPE Hyper Converged 250 but the company would clearly like to do more here   
To Conclude
Dell entering the picture strengthens HPE s competitor and Cisco s clout at customers and its UCS advantage makes for another very strong competitor  not to mention VMware  which is already moving ahead full steam  So HPE needs to raise its game 
Also  the hyper converged segment is likely to be somewhat cannibalistic for existing vendors unless they cede share completely  So the company is taking the best course of action  freeing up some cash to innovate buy its way into this opportunity

106633,328148,VMW,EMC Dell Merger Receives Advisory Firms  Endorsement ,opinion,"The mammoth EMC Corporation   NYSE EMC   Dell deal has received endorsement from three high profile proxy advisory firms  Glass Lewis  Egan Jones and Institutional Shareholder Services   ISS  ahead of EMC s special shareholders meet on Jul 19  2016  The special meeting has been convened to allow shareholders to take the call on the EMC Dell merger 
In October last year  Dell along with others  had announced to take over EMC in a record  67 billion cash and stock deal  Speculations about a merger between Dell and EMC Corp  had first surfaced in Sep 2014 
Coming to the terms of the deal  EMC shareholders will receive  24 05 per share in cash along with tracking stock related to a portion of EMC s economic interest in VMware  Inc    NYSE VMW    Based on EMC s estimated outstanding shares at the close of transaction  stockholders will get 0 111 shares of new tracking stock for each EMC Corp  share  The deal values each share of EMC at nearly  33 15 
EMC s CEO Joe Tucci has constantly stressed that the coming together of these two companies will be in the best interest of all stakeholders 
If we look closely at Dell s financial position  it had to disclose the details last year   we can clearly see that most of its businesses  except Enterprise  have been going downhill for a while  Further  Dell  at present  has high stakes in the declining PC market 
EMC seems a good bet because EMC already has a strong product base and it is also advancing well in the cloud computing and Big Data domain  Also  its rapid expansion in all flash arrays  AFAs  is a big positive  Furthermore  this acquisition will allow Dell to have significant control over EMC s most prized division  VMware 
This deal seems to be a positive for EMC as well considering that its core data storage business has been struggling for a while due to growing competition from flash storage peers such as Nimble Storage  Inc    NYSE NMBL    SanDisk Corp  and Western Digital Corp   NASDAQ WDC

Cisco System s transition into the cloud has allowed the company to grow beyond its traditional area of routers and switches  In its latest earnings report on February 11th  Cisco saw a 40  increase in its earnings driven by data relevant product and services   Cisco also reported that its Unified Computing System data center platform has been adopted by more than 41 000 customers Brian White currently has a Buy rating issued on Cisco Systems with a price target of  33  The analyst highlighted Cisco s transition into software defined networking  SDN   noting  the trend toward SDN is real and will force the incumbent networking players to change their models  e g   Cisco Systems  but this trend will take a long time to play out   White explained   You have got easy comps and a nice product cycle in routing  in switches and in SDN  And you have got a cloud product called Intercloud that is starting to ramp up   He concluded   The mantra at Cisco is to become the No  1 IT company  it s not to be the No  1 networking company So they are rolling out more software  more services with Intercloud and offering a revamp of their switch portfolio with  new  ACI  switches   Brian White has rated Cisco systems 12 times since September 2010  earning an 87  success rate recommending the company and a  14 7  average return per recommendation International Business Machines  NYSE IBM

106639,328154,VMW,This Trade Shows Real And Relative Strength,opinion,"VMware  NYSE VMW  is one of those companies that people love  Even if they re not entirely certain about what it is that the company does  That s about all I know of the company  Oh  that and the fact that EMC  NYSE EMC  own a big stake VMW and there are rumors of a total buyout  That s good news for the stock price  which is launching higher as the broad market starts August to the downside 
But when I look at the stock s price chart it has been moving up for almost a month  So not only is there relative strength today  but real strength too  One other thing about the chart  It looks ripe to continue higher 

The chart above shows the stock price pulling back from a high just shy of 104 in August  Reaching a bottom in January  it started back higher  building a rounded bottom  Since April the stock s moves higher have run into resistance between 90 80 and 92  The latest thrust higher is at that range now  Like the high in April  the RSI is bullish and rising and the MACD is also rising 
But the MACD is still well below the levels where it has reversed at prior peaks  Also  this time the price is rising inside of the Bollinger Bands   Is the the one  We ll find out soon  But if it is  look for a move to the 98 50 to 103 50 range as it continues to build the Cup ",2015-08-03,Gregory W.

106641,328156,VMW,Here s What You Need To Know Ahead of VMware s Tuesday Earnings Report,opinion,"VMware Inc   NYSE VMW  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings after the market closes on Tuesday  April 22nd  VMware is an American software company that specializes in cloud and virtualization technology and services  Over the past 2 years VMware has enjoyed steadily growing revenue and profitability  So far in early 2014 VMware stock is up significantly  18   but has been volatile as well 
This quarter Wall Street is expecting a year over year EPS gain of 5c per share and yoy revenue growth of 13 5  while the Estimize community has slightly higher expectations on both the top and bottom line  Here s what investors expect from VMware Tuesday afternoon 

The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for VMware to report 79c EPS and  1 352B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 26 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 80c EPS and  1 358B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting VMware to beat the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue by a small margin 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting VMW s EPS every time and has been more accurate in forecasting revenue 4 times  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a small differential between the two groups  expectations 
The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 76c to 86c EPS and from  1 347B to  1 407B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a larger than usual distribution of estimates on VWM 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings  
Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS forecast dropped from 83c to 79c while the Estimize consensus both started and ended the period at 80c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus increased from  1 342B to  1 353B while the Estimize consensus increased from  2 805B to  2 843B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and analyst revisions at the end of the quarter were relatively flat 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is TechStockRadar who projects 80c EPS and  1 363B in revenue  TechStockRadar is ranked  among over 4 150 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years TechStockRadar has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue an impressive 66  and 64  of the time respectively throughout 402 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case TechStockRadar is expecting VMware to report in line with the Estimize EPS consensus while exceeding revenue expectations by a small margin 
Last quarter the Estimize community nailed the EPS number from VMware and was also extremely accurate in predicting revenue  This time around the community expects VMware to report 14  revenue yoy revenue growth which is in line with recent quarters  However the community also forecasts a 6c per share gain in EPS which would represent slowing growth in earnings

106644,328159,VMW,Should EMC Corp Break Itself Apart ,opinion,"Introduction
On Monday a Wall Street Journal article reported that the hedge fund Elliott Management Corp has taken a more than  1 billion stake in EMC Corp  NYSE EMC  and revealed that it intends to petition the company to break itself apart   Elliott believes that this would unlock shareholder value   Implicit in that thesis would be the idea that EMC Corp is not receiving full value from the market   This article is offered as an in depth analysis of the fundamental value of EMC Corp in relation to how the market is evaluating its business  
Short Company Description
The following short business description on EMC Corp provided courtesy of Capital IQ

Earnings Operating History
The following earnings only  on EMC Corp illustrate the dynamic nature of a company s earnings per share growth over different time periods   Earnings growth is a dynamic calculation that varies when graphed from one time frame to the next   Consequently  it s important to review several timeframes when evaluating a company s historical earnings growth rate   The following 15 calendar year  10 calendar year  7 calendar year and 5 calendar year graphs illustrate that EMC s earnings growth has been accelerating  see earnings growth rates circled in yellow  
Earnings  Operating  History 15 Year

Earnings Operating History 10 Year

Earnings Operating History 7 Year

Earnings Operating History 5 Year
 
Operating Earnings and Dividend History
The important take away from the following earnings and dividend graph is that prior to 2013 EMC Corp was purely a growth stock   However  as revealed by the dividends paid out  blue shaded area  and plotting of dividends as a percentage of earnings  the pink line  we see that as of December 2013 the company has recently morphed into a dividend paying stock   It will be interesting to watch how future dividends are paid 

15 Year Earnings and Price Correlated FAST Graph  with Dividends and Normal P E Ratio 
During the tech bubble that ran from 1995 to 2000 we see that EMC s stock price was dramatically above its earnings justified valuation   Furthermore  when earnings dropped during the recession of 2001  the stock price correction was swift and severe   However  since that  tech bubble  period EMC Corp has produced a steady stream of above average earnings growth   Additionally the normal P E ratio was greatly skewed due to the excessive overvaluation during the tech bubble 

10 Year Earnings and Price Correlated FAST Graph  with Dividends and Normal P E Ratio 
This timeframe clearly illustrates the importance of earnings and their influence on stock price in the long run   Since 2006 there were several periods where EMC Corp s stock price deviated from earnings and simultaneously becoming overvalued  before inevitably returning to fair value  the orange line  

7 Year Earnings and Price Correlated FAST Graph  with Dividends and Normal P E Ratio 
 
15 Year Historical P E Ratio Trend
The dark blue line reflects the fiscal year end P E ratio for EMC Corp since 2001  the right scale on the graph    Here we see a steady decline in EMC s P E ratio   However  consideration should be given to the excessive high P E ratios that were afforded most tech stocks during the tech bubble 

Performance
Historical performance is functionally related to earnings growth achievement and starting valuation   Consequently  when performance is properly measured  it is imperative that starting valuation be considered in conjunction with earnings  and dividends  if any  growth 
A high beginning valuation will reduce capital appreciation  a low beginning valuation will enhance capital appreciation   When a company s beginning valuation is in alignment with earnings  capital appreciation will be highly correlated with the company s earnings growth rate 
15 Year Performance   From Beginning Overvaluation

7 Year Performance   From Beginning Fair Valuation

Earnings Forecasts
The  Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator  provides several specific future year s earnings forecasts   Specific near term earnings forecasts  varies from two to four years  are provided to include the number of analysts reporting to Capital IQ  yellow and green highlights    Additionally a long term  three to five year  growth rate is also provided  orange highlights    The specific number of analysts offering the long term forecast is found in the FAST FACTS box  orange circle   
Therefore  we highly recommend placing more credence on the near term forecasts because they are likely to be more accurate   Moreover  near term forecasts tend to include a greater number of analysts in the consensus 
 
Earnings Yield
Shareholders in publically traded companies  even though they are passive owners  can expect to be rewarded for their investment in proportion to the company s earnings capacity   Consequently  the earnings yield calculated from current and future  expected  earnings represents an important valuation consideration  

FUNdamentals   A Deeper Look
Utilizing FUN Graphs  fundamental underlying numbers   the following important fundamental metrics and key ratios are offered to provide a deeper look into the company s financial strength and current valuation 
Balance Sheet
The following balance sheet items are offered to reveal the financial health of the company   They include assets per share  atps   cash and equivalents per share  cashps  and common equity or book value per share  ceps   
These key balance sheet items reveal that EMC Corp possesses a strong and healthy balance sheet   This begs the question as to whether or not it makes sense to break the company apart as Elliott Management suggests 

Gross and Net Profit Margins
EMC Corp has maintained consistently strong gross profit margin  gpm  and net profit margin  npm    Moreover  both have shown increases in recent years   Once again  this raises the question of the need to have this company broken apart 

Return on Assets  Equity and Invested Capital
EMC Corp has produced strong returns on assets  roa   returns on equity  roe  and returns on invested capital  roi    Although all three fell during the Great Recession  gray shaded area  they remained at reasonably healthy levels 

Key Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity is an important consideration when evaluating a business   There are two primary ratios that prudent investors look to 
The quick ratio  qr  also known as the acid test ratio  measures a company s ability to meet short term obligations by utilizing its liquid assets   Generally speaking  a quick ratio of one or better is considered healthy  
Additionally  the current ratio  cr  measures the company s ability to retire its short term liabilities  debt and payables  with its short term assets  cash  inventory and receivables    This important ratio is often referred to as the liquidity ratio and is a good indicator of a company s ability to remain a going concern   
Since many investors are concerned about price volatility  we have included five year beta as an additional key ratio   A beta of one or lower is considered ideal relative to risk   On the other hand  a beta above one may also indicate the potential for above market long term performance 
Although these key liquidity ratios relating to EMC have deteriorated following the Great Recession  both have shown positive improvements since 2011   Consequently  it is clear that EMC Corp is capable of meeting short term obligations  

Additional Key Valuation Ratios
Two important valuation ratios that investors consider are price to book value  pb  and price to sales  ps    When considering both of these valuation ratios  the lower the better  
Consequently  it is clear that EMC s current price to book and price to sales ratios are on the historically low side   This offers an additional indication that the company is currently fairly valued 

Key Management Shareholder Friendly Metrics
Many investors consider a company s shareholder friendliness based on its dividend policy and or share buyback policy   A consistent record of paying dividends  and better yet  increasing the dividend are considered positive attributes of management  
However  many companies in the growth phase may consider it more profitable to retain their cash to fund growth   Consequently  the lack of a dividend does not necessarily indicate that management is not shareholder friendly 
Regarding share buybacks  they are considered friendly because they are anti dilutive   However  share buybacks should only be considered shareholder friendly when management is buying back shares when stock price is sound or undervalued 

Bonus  VMware Inc  NYSE VMW  Earnings and Price Correlated Graphs and Performance
As reported in The  on Monday  and again in The   EMC Corp maintains an 80  stake in VMware Inc  which is also a publically traded company   Elliott Management believes that EMC s stock would receive a substantial boost if they were to spin off these assets   However  we believe that based on the high rate of earnings growth that VMware Inc has achieved  and the high earnings growth that it is forecast to achieve  does not support Elliott Management s thesis   Furthermore  as reported in The Wall Street Journal above  VMware Inc contributed less than a quarter of EMC s consolidated revenue last year 


 
Summary and Conclusions
It seems that Elliott Management is disturbed about EMC s current market price  contending that the shares are not being fairly valued by the market price   However  based on fundamental value  we contend that EMC Corp is being properly valued by the market currently  and has been for the last 18 months   Therefore  we believe that this company is best left at its current capital structure  
On the other hand  if Elliott Management continues  it could prove temporarily destructive   Therefore  prospective investors should consider and monitor these developments as they unfold
