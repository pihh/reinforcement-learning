Economic News 

 Sales of previously owned U S  homes declined to a one year low in August as affordability continued to hamper demand and Hurricane Harvey caused a slump in Houston area purchases  a National Association of Realtors report showed Wednesday  
The median sales price rose 5 6  y y to  253 500
 While decreased purchase activity in Houston helped push down the sales count nationwide  and may continue to do so in coming months  residential real estate is struggling to improve because of declining affordability  NAR said in the report  Housing data may be volatile for several months in the wake of Harvey and Irma  As a result  U S  sales in 2017 will probably be weaker than they were last year  according to the group  which plans to issue a revised forecast next week  A pause in both sales and construction in Texas and Florida as clean up efforts continue will probably give way to improving demand later this year and into next  according to economists 
Even before the storms  home price growth was exceeding wage gains because of lean inventory  crimping affordability for some and leaving buyers with fewer properties to choose from  At the same time  a steady job market and still low borrowing costs remain sources of support for the housing recovery 
Existing home sales account for 90  of the market and are calculated when a contract closes   Source  Bloomberg  The Federal Reserve announced it will begin reducing its balance sheet  which swelled to  4 5 trillion amid unconventional measures deployed following the financial crisis  in October  Officials believe the hurricanes that have battered parts of the U S  will have a temporary effect on activity  Most policymakers believe it will be appropriate to hike rates again this year  with only four officials wanting to maintain the current policy rate through year end  the same number as in June  During a press conference  Chair Janet Yellen deemed the persistent shortfall of inflation from its 2 percent target to be a mystery   Source  Bloomberg 

The Fed will initially cut up to  10bn each month from the amount it reinvests  It also said it will hold benchmark interest rates steady  and signaled a rate hike by the end of 2017  The move to unwind the portfolio the Fed acquired during its crisis era bond buying programs was widely anticipated   Source Bloomberg  

Week Ahead Highlights  The 3rd quarter draws to a close next week with the market making multiple new highs over the past 3 months  we may see some profit taking and position squaring as investors lock in unrealized gains made during the 3rd quarter  If that happens  look for some weakness in stocks  bonds  and the euro 
October will be the beginning of a new era  in which the Fed starts winding down its huge balance sheet  slowly drawing liquidity from the market  This will add uncertainty to the market   no one knows for sure how the market will react   even though the Fed s pace of selling its assets will be glacial at 1st 
Next Week s US Economic Reports  There will be multiple consumer based reports due out next week  in addition to several housing reports

 The Dow Jones Industrial avg  did something on Monday  it has never done in its 121 year history  The 30 stock average is now up more than 5 000 points in a year  marking its biggest annual points gain ever  This following a 200 point rally Monday which sent it to an all time high  Most of the big point moves are in recent years for an obvious reason  the Dow is much bigger than it was decades ago  So investors should keep this point move in perspective 
Jonathan Krinsky  chief market technician at MKM Partners  noted the spread between the Dow s price and its 200 day moving average a key technical indicator was about 13 percent   It s getting a bit extended  but I think it has more room to run  
 He said that some of the indicators on the S P 500 which typically matches the Dow s performance on a yearly basis are reaching extreme  overbought  territory 
Wall Street is generally bullish on stocks heading into next year  but do not expect a repeat of this year  Strategists  on average  expect a 5  gain on the S P 500

125239,346754,CIM,What To Expect From Chimera  CIM  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Chimera Investment Corporation   NYSE CIM   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 13  before the opening bell  The company s quarterly earnings per share  EPS  and net interest income  NII  are expected to decline year over year 
In the last reported quarter  this mortgage real estate investment trust  REIT  posted core earnings of 60 cents per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents  However  NII of  315 6 million declined 6  year over year 
Over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and missed in the other  It delivered average positive surprise of 1 4  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history Chimera Investment Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Chimera s investment strategy is focused primarily on acquiring residential loans  non agency residential mortgage backed securities  RMBS   agency commercial mortgage backed securities  CMBS  and agency residential mortgage backed securities  RMBS  
Its prudent capital allocation to MBS is expected to buoy the fourth quarter results  Specifically  wider Agency MBS spreads during the Dec end quarter likely provided the company with higher spread income and improved its portfolio liquidity 
Further  by creating a high yielding mortgage portfolio through securitization activity  the company enjoys a competitive edge over its peers  Hence  the company s portfolio of re securitized subordinate bonds is expected to lend support to the Dec end quarter results 
However  high mortgage rates and down trending homebuilder confidence is expected to have impacted prices of Chimera s residential mortgage credit 
Additionally  a spike in fixed income volatility  weaker U S  economic fundamentals  government shutdown and escalating trade tensions have elevated concerns over global economies  and might act as dampeners for the company in the to be reported quarter 
Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter NII of  146 8 million represents a decline of 6 9  year over year 
In addition  an increase in interest rates  volatility and wider Agency MBS spreads in the fourth quarter are anticipated to impact Chimera s book value 
Lastly  Chimera s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter EPS remained unchanged at 56 cents in a month s time  In addition  it indicates a 9 7  year over year decline 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Chimerais likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Earning ESP  Chimera s Earnings ESP is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP to be confident of the earnings beat

The yield has skyrocketed from the 3  to 4  range into double digits  Which would normally be pretty sweet  except the reason for the 10   payout is a collapse in the stock price from  72 to  9 something

 First level  income investors tend to turn their brains off once they have identified the yield   Hey  it pays 4   I don t care what the price does   It s a noble statement but they do care when shares slip into free fall and shed a year s worth of dividends in a week s worth of trading 

Not all 10  yields are dangerous  Take Chimera Investment Corporation  NYSE CIM   which pays 9 9  today and is a legit cash machine  This unique mortgage REIT has doubled the S P 500 itself over the last five years 
A Money Machine




It s also paid an amazing  4 5 billion in dividends since inception  Chimera mints money from housing loans  which are  too risky  for big banks to take on but plenty profitable for this firm   It benefits from the lasting stigma established by The Big Short as it s able to buy high paying assets for cheap  
The other half of Chimera s portfolio consists of mostly residential and some commercial mortgage backed securities  MBSs   More than 80  of these are issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae  Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac  which means credit risk is absorbed by Uncle Sam s agencies rather than Chimera 
The nimble Chimera pays its generous  0 50 per share dividend every quarter  an  instant  2 5  payout on its  20 stock  like clockwork  The firm makes enough money to cover the payout  and the 10  yield acts as a flotation device for the stock 
Let s contrast this situation with our outdated Tupperware set  The obsolete firm slashed its own dividend by 60  recently  thus removing any potential floor for the stock price 
There s A Right Way  And A Wrong Way  To Yield 10 




So how do we buy more Chimeras  In the 10  dividend world  we can start with  addition by subtraction   There are many businesses gone bad  like Tupperware  There are also mediocre ones that will waste your time 

Let s call out FS KKR Capital  NYSE FSK  and  Prospect Capital   NASDAQ PSEC   two business development companies  BDCs  that make their money by lending to small and medium sized businesses  This is a competitive market and it tends to show in the mediocre returns these firms provide 
FSK and PSEC pay 13 2  and 11 2  today but they tend to  take your dividend back  by tapping their own book value to pay you  This lowers their stock price and  over time  they don t return much more than zero 
The BDC Shell  LON RDSa  Game In Perspective





Pennant Park Investment Corp  NASDAQ PNNT  is another BDC that taps its own capital to pay its  theoretical  11 9  dividend  This isn t sustainable  of course  and the firm already cut its dividend by 36  a few years ago  Its book value is still declining  which is a sign that PNNT can t afford its current payout  either 
The New Payout Still Too Rich For Pennant





The money shufflers  BDCs and beyond  are often adept at masking incompetence behind big stated yields   Western Asset Mortgage Capital   NYSE WMC  for example pays 138  of its profits as dividends  If there s anything worse than a triple digit payout ratio like this  which means you are borrowing money to settle up with shareholders   it s a negative one  which means you are not even making a profit   Invesco Mortgage  Capital  NYSE IVR  is the firm mortgaging its future to pay investors their 11 4  yield today  Avoid IVR and WMC  which promises a 12 3  yield that isn t likely to happen for much longer  

Moving back into the world of  real products   our job here is to avoid the old Tupperwares of the world   Or at least recycle them   Shopping center landlord Macerich  NYSE MAC  is on the receiving end of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  com s reduction in brick and mortar retail  This 10 2  yield is living quarter to quarter as tenants  and the rents they pay this REIT  or real estate investment trust  are being bombarded by free shipping courtesy of Bezos   Co 
These Token Dividend Hikes Don t Fool Mr  Market





B G Foods  NYSE BGS  is another  token hiker  that is being beat up for lunch money every day the market opens  Its frozen and canned Green Giant vegetables don t have the monopoly on peas that they used to  Food shoppers are pickier about quality and have less brand loyalty than ever before  and B G s 11 9  yield depends on the uptake of products like Green Giant Veggie Tots  yikes  
A Pea Sized Dividend Hike  Not Enough Of A Distraction





Chico s FAS  NYSE CHS  used to be a cool store that sold high end gear to women with money  The firm also used to make money  too  but its brand has faded and the company no longer makes a profit  Which means it should be paying any dividend  let alone a 10  yield on its depressed share price

share since its initial public offering in May 2008 through fourth quarter 2019 ConclusionAGNC Investment has reaped benefits from its strategy to invest in prepay protected pools and lower coupon TBA securities and MBS  while reducing exposure to generic cohorts with higher pre payment exposure  In fact  such prudent hedging strategies and continued portfolio repositioning efforts have cushioned its portfolio from interest rate risks and high prepayment speed  However  volatility in the repo markets in 2019 escalated funding costs and dampened performance of many industry participants  In fact  in mid September  the rate on overnight general collateral repo spiked to 10   about four times more than usual levels  due to shortage of cash available for lending  Amid this turbulence in the

Income Statement  For the 4 year trend analysis comparing years 2012 up to 2015  we notice that total revenue and gross profit are in an uptrend  but so is operating expenses  and the result is that operating income peaked at FY 2014  and had a decline of 57 51  in FY 2015  Net income follows the exact same 4 year trend as the operating income  Diluted normalized EPS have increased during these 4 years  peaked at FY 2014 and declined 45 27  in FY 2015 at  1 62  from  2 96 in FY 2014  This large decline of profitability in FY 2015 compared to FY 2014  can be attributed to a large degree to very big increase in operating expenses  On quarterly basis  examining the trend of the last 4 quarters  we observe an absolute increase in total revenue  gross profit  operating income  net income and diluted normalized EPS 
Balance Sheet  Some key points examining the 4 year trend are the significant decrease of Cash   Equivalents and very large increase of total debt  while total equity has decreased over the same mentioned period  On a quarterly basis period  for the last 4 quarters we notice an increase of total debt  which is something to focus on as we are in a scenario of rising interest rates 
Cash Flows  Our 4 year trend shows a positive absolute increase in cash from operating activities  which is good as operating activities are considered the key element of business operation  but both cash from investing activities and cash from financing activities show a very volatile trend  and there is the positive effect of reducing debt in FY 2015 
Relative Valuation  Chimera has lower P E and price to sales ratios than relevant ratios of the industry for a trailing twelve months period  and a lower price to book ratio than the relevant ratio of the industry for most recent quarter  These figures make stock attractive and relative undervalued 
Profitability  Management Effectiveness and Growth  The company has a higher gross margin  operating margin and net margin than the relevant margins of the industry  The only margin which is lower for the company in a 5 year trend analysis is the gross margin  Especially worth mentioning is the net profit margin of 50 9   TTM   which is 134 13  higher than the net profit margin of 20 74  for the industry  However management effectiveness seems to be the weak spot for the company  All following three ratios  return on equity  return on assets  and return on Investment for the company are lower than relevant financial ratios for the industry  on a trailing twelve month period  In terms of growth  the company shows a very large increase in EPS of 248 34   TTM   which is much higher than the relevant increase of EPS for the industry  but we do not like the fact that sales growth for same period has been negative  while the industry had an increase in sales of 6 23  for last twelve months 
Financial Strength  Efficiency and Dividend Yield  While long term debt to equity ratio and total debt to equity for the company and most recent quarter are lower than the relevant ratios of the industry  their absolute levels are considered too high  meaning that the company uses a lot of leverage  and is considered risky  We would like to see this large financial leverage get significant reduced and operating efficiency increase  Receivable turnover ratio for the company for last twelve months is lower than the relevant ratio of the industry 
Now dividend yield is a factor to consider adding the stock to a portfolio for income generating purposes  The company has a current dividend yield of 11 1   much higher than 2 01  dividend yield for the industry  However this dividend yield is lower than 5 year average dividend yield of 16 72  for the company  and we have concerns about sustainability of high current payout ratio of 102 11  as well 
Technical Analysis  On a daily  weekly and monthly basis  moving averages and technical indicators give a strong buy summary  However any correction of stock price would be preferred as a long term investment 
Intrinsic Value  Our discounted cash flow analysis using EPS for next 5 years with 5  annual growth  and only 2  growth after  provides a stock value per share of  30 41 
Investment Conclusion  Chimera stock seems relative undervalued at current level of about  18 00  The large dividend yield is a great positive factor to add it to a portfolio  But caution is required as the company has a very large financial leverage and in a rising interest rates environment  leverage can add a lot of volatility to profitability

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the GOP s new health care bill would have taken away health coverage for 24 million Americans  The revised bill would have reduced the U S  deficit by only  150 billion over 10 years  whereas the original bill aimed to reduce the deficit by  337 billion

Next on the DC agenda will be Tax reform  which may have a better chance of passing  before the August summer break  The campaign promise was for a 15  corporate tax rate  but that counted on savings from the defunct healthcare bill  so now observers are pointing to a rate in the 25  30  range

125282,346797,CIM,Is Chimera Investment A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Chimera Investment Corporation   NYSE CIM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks P E RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Chimera Investment has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 34  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 28  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Chimera Investment s current PE level puts it puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified REIT Mortgage Trust industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 10 18  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is highly undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Chimera Investment has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 20  which is in line with the current level  Hence the forward earnings estimates are already incorporated in the company s current share price P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Chimera Investment s P CF ratio of 6 80 is lower than the Zacks classified REIT Mortgage Trust industry average of 7 23  which indicates that the stock is undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Chimera Investment currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CIM a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Chimera Investment might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives CIM a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen no upward estimate revision in the past sixty days compared to one downward  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and one downward revisions in the same time frame As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has moved down by 4 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate inched lower by 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Chimera Investment Corporation Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineChimera Investment is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 17  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks REIT Mortgage Trust industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors  analyst sentiment and estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many

125315,346830,CIM,3 Dividend Stocks for Those Who Like To Live Dangerously,opinion,One of my favorite scenes in the classic James Bond spoof Austin Powers is when Powers sits down at the blackjack table occupied by Dr  Evil s Number 2  Number 2 s cards give him 17 and because he  likes to live dangerously  he says  hit me    Number 2 has x ray vision that lets him see that the next card was a 4  but that is not particularly important in this metaphor    Of course  Powers loses to the house  It is mathematically impossible to bust when you have a total of five  you would need at least two more cards to exceed 21  So Power s decision to stay was not living dangerously  it was a case of not understanding the rules of the game   This is how I feel when I see investors chasing yield in some dodgy sectors of the market  Not only are they living dangerously  they are failing to appreciate that they are taking risks at all   I ll start with mortgage REIT Chimera Investment Corp  CIM   which yields an impressive 13 7    When you hear  REIT  you automatically think of productive real estate  But that is not at all what Chimera is  In fact  it has far more in common with a high flying hedge fund than it does with a staid old real estate investment  Mortgage REITS like Chimera play the spread game  borrowing large sums of money cheaply and investing it  generally  in mortgage bonds and their derivatives   The ability of mortgage REITs to maintain their massive dividends depends on the spread between the short term rates at which they borrow and the prevailing market rate on the mortgages they buy  Well  have you checked mortgage rates lately  They are at all time lows  And with Bernanke s QE Infinity in full effect  that s not likely to change   But let s say mortgage rates start climbing tomorrow  That s great for future mortgage purchases  but what about the existing portfolio  It s book value gets hammered  and the investment manager may be forced to liquidate and sell at a loss if short term borrowing rates rise   I m not telling you to never buy a mortgage REIT  In fact  I myself have a small position in Two Harbors Investment Corp  TWO  in some of the portfolios I manage  My point is that these are not your grandpa s real estate investment trusts  If you want stable dividend growth from a pool of real estate  consider something like Realty Income Corp  O   But invest in mortgage REITs at your own risk   Lest you think I am being dramatic  Chimera has seen its share price swing from  3 16 to  1 81 and back to  2 69 over the past 12 months    Next on the list is SandRidge Permian Basin Trust  PER   which yields 14 3   Oil and gas royalty trusts have become popular in recent years as yield hungry investors have had a lack of better alternatives  But these should not be confused with oil and gas based Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs    I love MLPs  They pay high and growing streams of tax deferred income while  generally  taking little commodity price risk  They operate like toll roads  getting paid for the volume of oil and gas they transport  irrespective of the market price  If bought at a reasonable price  they are about as close as you can get to a perfect investment   Alas  none of this holds true for oil and gas trusts  The trusts are highly sensitive to the price of energy and to engineering estimates of their reserves  But more than this  they are not going concern businesses  they are depleting assets  You shouldn t expect long term capital gains from these  the high income you receive today is all you re going to get   Again  this is not to say that you should never buy an oil or gas trust  Under the right set of circumstances  you can make a killing in them  But these are highly speculative investments and should not be confused for safe and stable dividend producers   Finally  I ll throw out France Telecom  FTE  as an example  Investors have flocked to American and European telecom stocks in recent years because the high dividend payouts seemed too good to ignore  I recommended Spanish telecom giant Telefonica  TEF  two years ago primarily for its exposure to Latin America  but its 8  dividend at the time was certainly a sweetener   Alas  it was too good to be true  With its domestic market in free fall and its borrowing costs surging  Telefonica suspended its dividend to conserve cash   Though France Telecom did not face a crisis on the level of Telefonica  it too recently had to cut its dividend  from  1 40 to  0 80  This dropped the yield from the mid teens to about 9  today   Even at the reduced payout  France Telecom is one of the highest yielding stocks in the world  But it operates in a brutally competitive market  Telecom services are a commodity where the dominant factor to consider is price  Given that the mobile phone market is saturated in Europe  the only way a provider can grow is at the expense of a rival  This is a zero sum game  and it s not good for profits   And this says nothing of fixed line phone service  which is going the way of the dodo bird    Again  I m not saying that investors should always steer clear of telecom firms  I still own Telefonica because I consider it an attractive growth play in Latin America  But telecoms are no longer conservative utilities  They operate in a brutally competitive market  and investors should buy at their own risk   Disclosures  Sizemore Capital is long TWO  O and TEF  This article first appeared on InvestorPlace ,2012-12-04,Charles

125318,346833,CIM,What About REITs ,opinion,"I do not see many people talking about the mortgage REIT stocks lately  One that I have owned  Chimera   NYSE CIM   just went ex dividend today  The dividend yields have pulled in but this one still pays out over 11   The stock pulled back today but by only about 1 10 of the dividend  This could be your opportunity to get involved  The chart below shows rising trend support since July 2013  that may come into play at about 3 09  or 10 cents below  Notice that the 200 day SMA is right there as well  With the RSI and MACD falling you might want to set a buy stop near that level as an entry  Mortgage rates may be going up  but they do not appear to be doing so any time soon  And with a stop in the  3 area to be certain the trend has reversed  even if it pulls back on the dividend to 5 or 7  it will still be well above most stocks in the market  There are others to look at in this space as well  American Capital Agency  American Capital Agency Corp  NASDAQ AGNC  is another  See what you can find

125319,346834,CIM,Dividend Investing Like A Billionaire,opinion,"iBillionaire the creators of the index backing the Direxion iBillionaire Index ETF  NYSEArca    are at again  launching a new index that tracks the dividend stocks being bought by hedge fund masters of the universe and other financial billionaires 
The iBillionaire High Dividend Index     which was just launched today  is an equally weighted basket of 50 high dividend stocks held by high profile billionaires in the financial sector  iBillionaire currently tracks the trading moves of 25 billionaire investors  and recent additions include living legends like Stanley Druckenmiller  James Dinan and Nelson Peltz 
In a low yield world in which  high dividend  is something of a relative term  the iBillionaire High Dividend Index actually lives up to its name  Its dividend yield is a solid 5 34   
I ve written about iBillionaire and the Direxion iBillionaire ETF before  see      and I m a big fan of iBillionaire s methodology as well as those of competitor ETFs like the Global X Top Guru Holdings Index ETF  NYSE GURU  and the AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF  NYSE ALFA   I don t believe in mindlessly copying the trading moves of other investors  no matter how storied their careers  but I do consider guru following strategies to be a fantastic source of trading ideas 
The iBillionaire High Dividend Index comes along at an interesting time  The 30 year U S  Treasury is scraping along near all time lows  and most income focused investments have gotten prohibitively expensive  This is perhaps the trickiest market in history for income investors to navigate  so it s instructive to see what the big boys are buying 
Let s take a look at the top 10 holdings   Note  Though equally weighted  position weights will shift between rebalancings  hence the larger allocations you see here  

Interestingly  General Motors  NYSE GM  is a top ten holding of both the original iBillionaire Index and the new iBillionaire High Dividend Index 
At 24   the iBillionaire High Dividend Index has a high allocation to energy shares  Given the volatility in the sector  that very well might change once the next batch of 13F filings is released  But there are several high quality energy names in the index worth noting  such as Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI   Williams Companies  NYSE WMB  and BP  NYSE BP  
Also worth noting is that the index has a fairly high allocation to high yielding mortgage REITs  such as Northstar Realty  NYSE NRF   American Capital Agency  NASDAQ AGNC   and Chimera Investment Corp  NYSE CIM   Investors right now are scared to death of mortgage REITs  fearing that eventual tightening by the Fed will pinch their interest spread  It s interesting that the billionaire masters of the universe appear to see value   Incidentally  I noted that mortgage REITs were attractively priced earlier this month  
So  what are we to do with this information  There is no mutual fund or ETF that currently tracks this index  That s ok  In its current form  it gives us a  fishing pond  of good income investment ideas to research further
