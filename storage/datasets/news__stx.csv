14495,236010,STX,Stocks   Dow s Late Stage Rally Falls Short Amid Slump in U S  Job Gains,news,"Investing com   The Dow closed lower for a fifth straight day Friday as a late session rally proved too little too late following an earlier slide on data showing the U S  economy created fewer jobs than expected  adding to fears of a slowdown in global growth 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0 09  to close at 25 450 24 after recovering from a session low of 25 252 46  The S P 500 lost 0 21   while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0 18  
For the week  the Dow was off 2 2   its second weekly loss in a row  The S P 500 fell 2 15   The Nasdaq dropped 2 5   The Nasdaq s decline was its first after 10 straight weekly gains  The S P 500 snapped a five week winning streak 
The U S  Labor Department reported 20 000 jobs were created last month  well short of economists  estimates for around 181 000  raising fears the slowdown in global growth could be starting to make a dent on the U S  economy  But wage growth and the unemployment rate did offer some solace for investors and traders as both measures exceeded economists  estimates 
Analysts downplayed the report  saying weather related noise had weighed on job creation 
The slowing may reflect  some moderation  in the trend  but much of decline was likely caused by  weather effects   High Frequency Economics said   While the three month average of job gains is a still healthy 186 000  that is below what has been a 200K plus trend  
 The trend likely remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down over time   HFE added 
The slump in U S  job growth comes during a week in which signs of a slowdown in the global economy have been front and center 
China said Friday its exports slid the most in three years in February compared with a year earlier  A day earlier  the European Union launched a fresh stimulus measure to prop up lending after warning the slumber in euro area growth would likely continue into the current year 
Fears that oil demand growth could suffer in the wake of a wobble in the global economy  pressured U S  crude prices  sending energy stocks lower  Brent Oil Futures also fell 
In a sign of souring investor appetite on risk assets  defensive corners of the market were in favor as utilities  real estate and consumer staples ended the day higher 
Consumer staples were also boosted by a 5 1  surge in Costco Wholesale shares after the wholesale members club posted a fiscal second quarter profit that topped estimates from Investing com  The report prompted bullish calls from analysts on Wall Street 
RBC raised its price target on shares of Costco  NASDAQ COST  to  250 from  235 
Oppenheimer raised its price target on Costco s stock to  245 from  240  citing potential the retailer may declare a special dividend of as much as  10 that  could add more upside to the story as the year progresses  
In other corporate news  DowDuPont confirmed it would split into three separate companies   Dow  DuPont  NYSE DWDP  and Corteva Agriscience   starting April 1 
The new  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  should begin trading in early April followed later by the agricultural business  Corteva 
 Today s announcement marks a major milestone toward successfully separating Dow on April 1  to be followed by the expected separation of Corteva Agriscience from the new DuPont on June 1  that will bring about three independent companies  Ed Breen  chief executive officer of DowDuPont  said in a statement 
Dow will be an independent  publicly traded company that will list on the New York Stock Exchange on or about March 20 under the ticker symbol  DOW WI  and begin trading April 2 under the ticker symbol  DOW

The Moline  Illinois based company is part of a long and growing list of firms confronted with trade related challenges for their businesses  Cell phones  toys  game consoles and printers were included in a fresh tariffs list released on Monday  and the likes of Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL     Hasbro Inc   NASDAQ HAS   and  Western Digital  Corp  NASDAQ WDC   may be hurt  President Trump continued to tweet about trade on Tuesday morning  with statements including   When the time is right we will make a deal with China  
Deere is down 1 2  in pre market trading    but Apple is rising 1 2   and U S  equity futures are gaining alongside European stocks as investors assess the prospects for global trade and sift for potential winners  AGCO Corp  may be among those poised to advance  JPMorgan said in a note upgrading its recommendation  as it s got limited exposure to U S  row crops and a recent sell off is overdone 
Here s a look at some newly exposed U S  companies 
Mobile Phones
Apple tops the list of U S  companies that face the biggest impact  as it relies on Chinese labor for the production of nearly all of its devices  including iPhones  That product line alone contributed more than half of Apple s revenue in the quarter that ended on March 31 
A 25  tariff would cost Apple nearly a quarter of its estimated profit in fiscal 2020   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  said in a research note last week  If Apple chose to pass on the higher cost to customers the price of an iPhone XS would jump by about  160 and hurt demand  analysts led by Katy Huberty wrote 
According to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives  the current trade situation could result in Apple seeing production costs for the iPhone rise 2  3   given the impact that trade is having on input materials like lithium batteries  Under a  more draconian scenario   where additional tariffs are levied  expenses could escalate  by roughly 10   over time  
Any pressure on the Cupertino  California based company is likely to have a ripple effect throughout its vast global network of suppliers  which includes Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Inc   Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 
Here s a list of companies that rank among the highest exposed to Apple  according to Bloomberg supply chain data

Retailers
Retailers may face earnings per share declines of 10  30  or worse  Cowen s Oliver Chen wrote in a note  as they re  unlikely to be able to pass on all of potential cost of goods sold increases   He sees  faster turning  retailers as among the first casualties  while  slower turning retailers will have more time to figure out alternative strategies   Cowen flagged L Brands Inc  NYSE LB     American Eagle Outfitters   NYSE AEO  Inc   and Gap Inc  NYSE GPS   in the specialty space 
On the other hand  value oriented retailers may benefit from trade tension as shoppers get increasingly squeezed  That may help Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc   Costco Wholesale Corp  NASDAQ COST   and  Target  Corp   NYSE TGT   along with Burlington Stores Inc   TJX  NYSE TJX  Cos   and Ross Systems Inc  Planet Fitness Inc  may get a boost too with  more consumers preferring deep value given its affordable membership  
Goldman s Christopher Prykull reiterated buy ratings on  Dollar Tree Inc   NASDAQ DLTR   and Five Below Inc  as near term earnings per share impacts may be priced in  Ollie s Bargain Outlet Holdings  Inc  also got its buy rating reiterated  given limited negative impact from tariffs as well as an opportunity to capitalize on disruptions in other retailers  supply chains

14511,236026,STX,U S  widens blacklist to include China s top AI startups ahead of trade talks,news,"By David Shepardson and Josh Horwitz
WASHINGTON SHANGHAI  Reuters    The U S  government expanded its trade blacklist to include some of China s top artificial intelligence startups  punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities and ratcheting up tensions ahead of high level trade talks in Washington this week 
The decision  almost certain to draw a sharp response from Beijing  targets 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies including video surveillance firm Hikvision  as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology Ltd 
The action bars the firms from buying components from U S  companies without U S  government approval   a potentially crippling move  It follows the same blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for what it says are national security reasons 
U S  officials said the action was not tied to this week s resumption of trade talks with China  but it signals no let up in U S  President Donald Trump s hard line stance as the world s two biggest economies seek to end their 15 month trade war 
The Commerce Department said in a filing the  entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China s campaign of repression  mass arbitrary detention  and high technology surveillance against Uighurs  Kazakhs  and other members of Muslim minority groups  
 The U S  Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China   said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross 
China s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment 
Hikvision  with a market value of about  42 billion  calls itself the world s largest maker of video surveillance gear 
SenseTime  valued at around  4 5 billion in a May 2018 fundraising  is one of the world s most valuable AI unicorns while Megvii  backed by e commerce giant  Alibaba   NYSE BABA   is valued at around  4 billion and is preparing an IPO to raise at least  500 million in Hong Kong 
The other companies on the list are speech recognition firm iFlytek Co  surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology  digital data forensics products maker Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co and Yixin Science and Technology Co 
OVERSEAS REVENUE
A U S  Hikvision spokesman said the company  strongly opposes  the decision and noted that in January it retained a human rights expert and former U S  ambassador to advise the company on human rights compliance 
 Punishing Hikvision  despite these engagements  will deter global companies from communicating with the U S  government  hurt Hikvision s U S  businesses partners and negatively impact the U S  economy   the company added 
John Honovich  founder of surveillance video research company IPVM  said Hikvision and Dahua both use  Intel Corp   NASDAQ INTC   Nvidia Corp  Ambarella Inc   Western Digital   NASDAQ WDC  and Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  as suppliers and that the impact on the Chinese companies would be  devastating  
The blacklisting of Huawei has hurt many of its U S  suppliers that depended on the world s largest telecommunications company for revenue and made it difficult for Huawei to sell new products 
Reuters reported in August Hikvision receives nearly 30  of its 50 billion yuan   7 billion  in revenue from overseas 
SenseTime said in a statement it was deeply disappointed by the U S  move  that it abides by all relevant laws of the jurisdictions in which its operates and that it has been actively developing an AI code of ethics to ensure its technologies are used responsibly 
IFlytek said its placement on the blacklist would not affect its daily operations   We have already anticipated this situation and will continue to provide excellent products and services for our customers   it said 
Xiamen Meiya said its overseas revenue was less than 1  of total revenue and that most of its suppliers were domestic companies 
Hikvision and Xiamen Meiya were each down a relatively mild 1 6  in Tuesday trade  Shares in U S  supplier Ambarella fell 12  in after hours trading on the news 
China faces growing condemnation from Western capitals and rights groups for setting up facilities that U N  experts describe as mass detention centers holding more than 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims 
In April  a bipartisan group of U S  lawmakers urged the move against Chinese companies it called  complicit in human rights abuses  and specifically cited Hikvision and Dahua 
U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week at the Vatican that  when the state rules absolutely  it demands its citizens worship government  not God  That s why China has put more than one million Uighur Muslims     in internment camps and is why it throws Christian pastors in jail  
In August  the Trump administration released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies  including Huawei and Hikvision 
The ban was included in the National Defense Authorization Act passed last year  and restricted the use of federal money to purchase telecommunications equipment and services and video surveillance equipment from  covered  telecommunications companies  citing national security concerns

14515,236030,STX,China s Hikvision sees only limited impact from U S  blacklisting,news,"By Samuel Shen and Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI  Reuters    Chinese video surveillance company Hikvision will only suffer a limited  short term hit after being blacklisted by the U S  government and will strive to get the ban lifted  its general manager said on Wednesday 
Hikvision was one of eight Chinese firms put on an expanded U S  blacklist on Monday to punish Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities  in a move that has escalated tensions ahead of Sino U S  trade talks in Washington this week 
Hikvision has come under fire for allegedly supplying surveillance equipment across the province of Xinjiang  where Uighur Muslims are being held captive in detention centers 
The company  which calls itself the world s biggest maker of video surveillance equipment  has already been banned since August from selling to U S  federal government agencies on the grounds its products could pose a threat to security 
The new U S  measures  also directed at top Chinese artificial intelligence  AI  startups SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology Ltd  bar Hikvision from buying components from U S  companies without Washington s approval 
General Manager Hu Yangzhong told reporters on Wednesday it had been preparing for a possible U S  ban for more than a year and its overall reliance on U S  components was  extremely low  
He said the company remained confident about its long term business prospects despite being added to the U S  blacklist 
The U S  dominates the market for graphics processing units  GPUs  which are critical for image processing but Hu said reliance on GPUs will decrease as the AI sector advances 
 All Hikvision clients can rest assured Hikvision has the ability to guarantee continued  stable supply of products   said board secretary Huang Fanghong  adding that the company would continue to expand in the United States and other markets 
John Honovich  founder of surveillance video research company IPVM  has said Hikvision uses  Intel Corp   NASDAQ INTC   Nvidia Corp  Ambarella Inc   Western Digital   NASDAQ WDC  and Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  as suppliers 
The company  which has a market value of about  42 billion  is 42  owned by Chinese state investors and its two main founders  It pulls in nearly 30  of its 50 billion yuan   7 billion  in annual revenue from abroad 
Hikvision temporarily suspended trading in its shares on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Tuesday after the U S  announcement 
Hu said the company had been communicating with various branches of the U S  government about the situation in Xinjiang  and had hired human rights lawyers to defend itself 
 The U S  government doesn t care at all about the things Hikvision is doing in Xinjiang   said Hu   The thing they care about is sanctions  ",2019-10-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/chinas-hikvision-sees-only-limited-impact-from-us-blacklisting-1993808,1993808

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood morning  and welcome to the Seagate Technology Fiscal Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call  My name is Josh  and I ll be your coordinator for today   Operator Instructions  Following the prepared remarks  there will be a question and answer session   Operator Instructions At this time  I would like to turn the call over to Shanye Hudson  Vice President  Investor Relations  Please proceed  Shanye Shanye Hudson    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Good afternoon  everyone and welcome to today s call  Joining me are Dave Mosley  Seagate s Chief Executive Officer  and Gianluca Romano  our Chief Financial Officer  We ve posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our December 2019 quarter on the Investors section of our website During today s call  we will refer to GAAP and non GAAP measures  Non GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures in the earnings press release posted on our website and Form 8 K that was filed with the SEC  We ve not reconciled certain non GAAP outlook measures because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and or cannot be reasonably predicted  Therefore  reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort As a reminder  this call contains forward looking statements  including our March quarter financial outlook and expectations about our financial performance  market demand  industry growth trends  planned product introductions  ability to ramp production  future growth opportunities and general market conditions  These statements are based on management s current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date Actual results may vary materially from today s statements  Information concerning our risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward looking statements are contained in our most recent Form 10 K filed with the SEC and the supplemental information posted on the Investors section of our website  Following our prepared remarks  we ll open the call for questions And with that  I ll turn the call over to you  Dave Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Shanye  Good afternoon  everyone and thanks for joining us  I ll begin today s call by highlighting a few key accomplishments for the December quarter  and then I ll share some perspectives on the market trends and their relevance to Seagate  Afterwards  I ll turn the call over to Gianluca to elaborate on our December quarter financial performance and present our March quarter outlook  Following the prepared remarks  we will open up the call for questions In the December quarter  we grew revenue to  2 7 billion and drove strong double digit profit growth on a sequential basis  with both non GAAP operating margin and non GAAP EPS coming in at the upper end of our guided ranges  Importantly  we have generated nearly  1 2 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months underscoring our consistent operational execution  In addition to delivering solid financial results  we achieved record exabyte shipments in the December quarter  supported by strong demand for mass capacity storage and the continued successful ramp of our 16 terabyte products Consistent with our expectations  we shipped 1 million 16 terabyte drives during the quarter to support strong customer demand  We also strengthened our product portfolio  announcing Seagate Lyve Drive Mobile System  a series of seamlessly integrated storage solutions to address the burgeoning need to move data between endpoints edge and core cloud environments in an efficient secure and cost effective way  Lyve Drive was one of many products we showcased during the Consumer Electronics Show this past January  which I ll discuss shortly First  let me comment on some of the trends we re seeing in the market  Our December quarter results highlight the increasing demand for mass capacity storage  which includes nearline  video and image applications and Network Attached Storage or NAS  Revenue from Mass Capacity Storage increased 9  quarter over quarter and 25  year over year driven by growth across each of these markets  This positive trajectory reflects both ongoing demand recovery  as well as secular growth for Mass Capacity Storage In nearline  we are leading the industry s transition to 16 terabytes  which is the largest capacity drive available in mass volume today  offering the best total cost of ownership opportunity for our customers  In the December quarter  these products represented the highest revenue and highest exabyte shipments of any of our drives  We achieved these results while still at the very early stages of this industry transition  Nearline demand has been on a positive trajectory that we expect will continue through at least the rest of the fiscal year We are well positioned to address this growing demand  as we continue to ramp our 16 terabyte production and launch our 18 terabyte drives  which are based on the same platform  simplifying the manufacturing and qualification processes  The 18 terabyte launch is progressing to plan and we remain on track to begin shipments in the first half of the calendar year 2020  We expect to align our production to meet customers  demand In video and image applications  we achieved record revenue in the December quarter  driven by strong demand for surveillance drives  As we ve shared for multiple quarters now  global uncertainty has created some disruption in typical customer buying patterns within certain markets including surveillance  However  the underlying demand drivers remain intact and inventory levels appear to be relatively healthy supporting our positive view of demand over the long term Security surveillance is just one of a growing number of applications adopting high definition video and image processing  which require Mass Capacity Storage at the edge and in the cloud  A few weeks ago at CES  we demonstrated how video and imaging sensors are being deployed in smart cities and smart factories to collect and analyze massive amounts of data used to improve traffic flow  hasten emergency response times  lower production costs  and improve worker safety These are real world use cases spun by the emergence of IT 4 0  which illustrate how organizations are unlocking value from the data being created by sensors  cameras and other endpoint devices  The transition to IT 4 0 and trend toward a multi cloud world create meaningful opportunities for Seagate  We project a typical smart factory can create 5 petabytes of video per day and a smart city could generate 200 petabytes each day  To fully realize the data potential  compute and storage must move closer to the source of creation  closer to the edge At CES  we also showcased how Seagate storage solutions are enabling IT 4 0 and hybrid cloud environments by leveraging our innovative technologies and expertise in systems architectures  We featured our high density scalable systems which offer enterprise customers a cost effective petabyte solution ideal for data rich cloud applications  The unit we displayed at CES was configured with 106 HDDs  including multiple HAMR drives working in real time We are on track to release the industry s first commercially available HAMR drives in late calendar 2020 at the 20 terabyte capacity point  Each year  Technical Issues OperatorLadies and gentlemen  this is the operator  Please remain in the line  We were experiencing technical difficulty The call will resume momentarily  Thank you very much Shanye Hudson    Vice President  Investor RelationsYou have been rejoined to t he conference  Please proceed Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerSorry about the delay  These are real world use cases spun the emergence of IT 4 0  which illustrate how organizations are unlocking value from the data

2020 at the 20 terabyte capacity point  Each year  I look forward to the Consumer Electronics Show for the opportunity to interact directly with customers  partners  suppliers and loyal enthusiasts of Seagate products and hear their feedback firsthand The consumer market remains a very good business for Seagate  In fact  in the December quarter alone  we shipped 12 exabytes in portable external drives trusted by our user community to move their data  The media and entertainment professionals  gamers and prosumers the Seagate brand of storage solutions represents quality  reliability and simplicity  We designed our Lyve Drive Mobile solutions with these same principles in mind  As I mentioned earlier  Lyve Drive offers enterprise CIOs a solution for efficiently and cost effectively managing data between endpoints  edge and core cloud Even with the dedicated 10 gigabit per second connection  it would take at least 12 days to upload a petabyte of data to the cloud  The cost for sending large amounts of data over a network can be an order of magnitude more expensive than simply physically transporting it  With Lyve Drive  customers can securely transfer data and adjust it into their data centers more quickly and affordably than other available options  Our integrated approach is a first key step toward a unified data experience Overall  we are excited by the momentum of our 16 terabyte drives  the competitive strength of our technology roadmap and the breadth of our product portfolio  all of which we believe position Seagate to address well the growing demand for Mass Capacity Storage and the need for data management solutions With that  I ll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our December quarter results  and share our outlook for the March quarter Gianluca Romano    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Dave  The December quarter represented another period of solid financial performance and strong free cash flow  On a sequential basis  revenue increased 5  to  2 7 billion  Non GAAP operating income increased 29   translating to a non GAAP operating margin of nearly 16  of revenue  And non GAAP earnings per share increased 31  to  1 35  Our results demonstrate strong operating leverage  supported by ongoing expense discipline and a regional revenue mix of Mass Capacity Storage Mass Capacity Storage  which includes Nearline  video and image application and NAS drives represented 49  of total December quarter revenue  up from 47  in the prior quarter  and 39  in the prior year  Exabyte shipment into this market increased 12  sequentially to 71 exabytes  This strong sequential growth was underpinned by demand for our mass capacity drives  As we shared during our Analyst Event  we expect that Mass Capacity revenue will continue to grow quickly over the next several years  Our product portfolio and technology roadmap are well aligned to capture these growth opportunities Revenue from 16 terabyte drives nearly tripled quarter over quarter  making them our highest revenue product during the quarter  a trend we expect to persist through the rest of the fiscal year as we continue to ramp these products to support a broadening of customer demand  Increased demand for mid capacity Nearline drives was another highlight for the quarter  Sales of our 4  6  and 8 terabyte drives moved higher to support enterprise and OEM customers as they build out their on prem and private cloud storage needs Our cost reduced mid capacity products continued to gain momentum  offering customers a better TCO relative to prior generation products  In addition to healthy Nearline demand  we also realized double digit revenue and exabyte growth for video and image applications reflecting above seasonal demand  which we expect to normalize moving into the second half of the fiscal year  As Dave said earlier  with advance of IT 4 0 and the adoption of video and image sensors across the growing number of applications  we foresee meaningful growth opportunities for our Mass Capacity Storage Solutions in this market Revenue from the legacy market remained fairly flat on a sequential basis and represented 43  of December quarter revenue compared with 46  in the September quarter  Exabyte shipment into the legacy market increased 3  sequentially to 36 exabyte  We continued customer and consumer support for our legacy products  which include mission critical  desktop  notebook  DVR and external consumer drives Seasonal demand for consumer drives combined with higher mission critical sales largely offset as expected decline in gaming consoles and notebooks  Overall  our total HDD average capacity per drive increased 11  sequentially and we expect average drive capacity to further increase as demand for Mass Capacity Storage continue to grow  The remaining 8  of the December quarter revenue was derived from our non HDD business in which revenue increased 14  sequentially driven by growth in both systems and SSD  We are continuing to build momentum with our systems solutions driven by increasing demand for data and edge and adoption of private cloud  Enterprise customers are seeking denser storage solutions driving higher system content  This dynamic reported a new exabyte shipment record for systems in the December quarter Non GAAP gross margin was 28 7   up 200 basis points sequentially reflecting a more favorable product mix with a higher contribution from Mass Capacity drives  Non GAAP operating expenses were  350 million  down 3  sequentially and slightly below our prior estimates  due mainly to lower discretionary spending  We are evaluating opportunities to drive further operational efficiencies while continuing to invest in areas that support future growth Through the combination of higher gross margin and controlled spending  we delivered non GAAP operating income of  424 million  up 29  quarter over quarter  This translates to non GAAP operating margin of approximately 16  of revenue  at the top end of our long term financial model range  Based on a share count of approximately 265 million shares  non GAAP EPS for the December quarter was  1 35  which surpassed our guidance midpoint Consistent with our expectations  capital expenditure increased to  194 million to support growing demand for mass capacity storage  We project fiscal year capex to be toward the middle of our long term range of 6  to 8  of revenue  We generated strong free cash flow in the December quarter  fairly stable with the past several quarters and we continue to deploy capital to reward shareholders through our long standing capital return product  We utilized  150 million to retire 2 5 million ordinary shares exiting the quarter with 261 million shares outstanding  And we used  165 million to fund our dividend  Our Board also approved a quarterly dividend payment of  0 65 per share payable on April 8  2020 As of the end of the quarter  cash and cash equivalents were  1 7 billion and we have access to an additional  1 5 billion through our revolver  Gross debt was  4 1 billion with a net debt of  2 4 billion  both fairly flat with the prior quarter  Adjusted EBITDA increased 23  sequentially to approximately  500 million and we expect our gross debt leverage ratio to be at or below 2 times within the next few quarters Looking ahead to our outlook for the March quarter  as the Coronavirus outbreak continues  we have made our first priority the health and well being of our employees and partners  We are also working with our suppliers to meet customer demand and mitigate risk to production  While we currently do not expect any material financial impact in the March quarter  but it s still a lot of uncertainty and therefore we are widening our revenue and EPS guidance ranges  With this in mind  we expect revenue to be in the range of  2 7 billion plus or minus 7   At the midpoint of our revenue guidance  we expect non GAAP operating margin to be at the high end of our long term target range of 13  to 16  of revenue  And non GAAP EPS is expected to be  1 35 plus or minus 7  In general  we are seeing a change in typical seasonality as HDD demand shift their way from consumer oriented legacy markets and toward Mass Capacity Storage driven by data growth in the cloud  and at the edge  The demand environment has continued to steadily improve  particularly for the high capacity Nearline drives  With the positive customer momentum we have established for our 16 terabyte product  we continue to expect both revenue and profitability to grow in fiscal 2020  with the second half revenue slightly higher than the first half of this fiscal year I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Gianluca  In summary  our performance demonstrates our ability to deliver solid financial results and drive cash generation throughout industry cycles  We are continuing to identify ways to drive further operational efficiencies to optimize profitability  We are also leveraging our strong technology roadmap  broad product portfolio  deep customer relationships and systems architecture expertise to address secular demand for mass capacity storage and emerging opportunities to provide cost effective data management solutions I m confident that Seagate is well positioned to fully capitalize on these growth opportunities while enhancing value for our customers and shareholders  Before opening the call for questions  I would like to take a moment to thank our customers  suppliers  business partners and employees for their contributions to the ongoing success of our business Josh  I ll hand it back to you to lead through the Q A Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead  Your line is open Jeff    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHi  This is Jeff  Phonetic  on for Sidney  Gross margins were good in the quarter  Can you talk a little bit about any pricing pressure that you are seeing related to high capacity drives Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerI think I would say that the market for on a dollars per terabyte basis  as if I look back over the last couple of years  hi Jeff  by the way  I would say that you can    is reflecting a pretty competitive space and I expect that over the long haul  we re all going to have to make investments to answer the call in that growth space  So I think at some point  We have to continue to work our costs down  which we re doing  We have to work through product transitions  which we re doing  But we ll also have to install capital and I expect at some point we re going to have to focus more on rather than chasing share  we re going to focus more on making those investments Jeff    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  And then just as a follow up  You mentioned an increased demand for mid line capacity drives as enterprise and OEMs build out their own storage needs  Can you talk a little more about this opportunity and does this potentially lead to less reliance on the cloud service providers in the future Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerNo  I would say  if I go back a year and a half to the peak of the last cycle  thereabouts  the market was very strong across the portfolio  I think the highest capacity points typically go to the bigger customers  but I think there are many small customers globally  which are still not as fully represented as they were in the peak of the last cycle  frankly  that are taking all kinds of different capacity points and so therefore  it s important to have a broad product portfolio and address them with the right products Jeff    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  thank you very much Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerYeah OperatorYour next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead  Your line is open Katy Huberty    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThank you  Good afternoon  Can you just talk about how you see 16 terabyte ramping  In which quarter  do you expect the biggest sequential ramp in volume  And then  is there any reason that as 16 terabyte volumes ramp that gross margins wouldn t improve in a fairly linear fashion Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerI think we can both take it Katy  I ll pass it over to Gianluca for the gross margin part  We ve said that this is one of the biggest ramps we ve ever done  If not the biggest ramp we ve ever done at heads and media  and we re in the middle of it  and to the point of just saying this quarter we would do a million and then having done a million  that s    that is indicative of the strength of that ramp  The ramp is not over  It s going to keep going in  The way we look at it is  there is many products in our portfolio before  but this platform is the one that s going to take us from 16 to 18 to 20 and beyond our ability to leverage cost and other technology pieces that we have to put in there is great now that we don t have to keep transitioning products  we get a lot of leverage from that  we talked about that in the prepared remarks  So from my perspective  we have that strong portfolio to take us forward  I think Gianluca can speak about gross margins in particular Gianluca Romano    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I would say in fiscal Q2  the improvement in gross margin is coming partially from the 16 terabyte  that as we said actually triple the volume during the quarter  but also from an overall cost reduction on several other drives  So looking at Q3  we will have for sure an higher volume in 16 terabyte that will help our gross margin  But of course  depends on the overall mix of the entire volume that we move into the quarter Katy Huberty    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThank you  And if I can just follow up  Dave  going back to your comments about the difficulty of ramping heads and media that you executed on for 16 terabyte  there  if you take the demand side there  then some questions around whether the qualifications are coming in  Can you just talk about kind of US versus China and any general numbers around how many of your big customers have qualified and are actually purchasing that product at this point Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerWe re fairly happy with the breadth of the qualification  I mean if you get down to very specific customers  they may be ready to take 16  Some of them may be back on 8 for example  Globally  there is people that for various reasons they aren t ready to move there in the architecture and we get that  In general  we re on plan with our ramp and I think our ramp is going to continue from here  The qualifications are going quite well  So I m not worried about it at all I think that  as I look across the customer base  Katy  what we ve talked about in the past was everybody adopting the highest capacity point quickly  I think that s happening less and less  frankly because I think there s a lot of    as we ve talked in the past  there s a lot of diverse needs even within one customer set  even one customer  and then each customer may have their own different specific needs  So I think as the cloud grows bigger  certainly some of the scale people have diverse needs that they have to make sure that we continue to service  it s not just about the build out of the new stuff  And it s a growing world  So we have to work with all those customers to get them exactly what they need  16 is doing quite well against that Katy Huberty    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  thank you for the color Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorYour next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital  Please go ahead  Your line is open Ananda Baruah    Loop Capital    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  guys  Thanks for taking the question  A couple from me  if I could  just sticking on gross margin  I may have missed it  but did you make remarks about what we should expect for gross margin in the March quarter  And then just as a follow up to that  philosophically  as you continue to improve the yields on 16s  and as Dave to your point about the platform transition to 18  same platform  why wouldn t the gross margin level up nicely once you get the 16 yields to normalize and then as you transition onto 18s from there  once you have the cost situation    yield situation handled Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerRight  I think if the portfolio    if the market continues to grow  so the supply and demand is probably the first driver of all those discussions  so if the supply and demand picture continues to grow in the favor of more demand and not as much supply  I think we can start asking those questions  So that gets into cloud cyclicality  and I ll let Gianluca specifically say about how he thinks about gross margin Gianluca Romano    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi  Ananda  You know  we don t really guide gross margin  but if you look at our revenue and our EPS are fairly well aligned quarter over quarter  So I ll let you to take your assumption  But I would not see a major change sequentially Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerI think  if we see a big demand then in the 16 terabyte  the 18 terabyte once we get there is in high demand  I think we should be able to manage it  I think we talked about that a little bit last quarter as well  And what you described may happen  but I think the broader portfolio  from our perspective  and we ve said this before  we re really managing for things closer to the bottom line like  operating income and now that we re at the top end of our range again  we re quite happy with that Ananda Baruah    Loop Capital    AnalystGreat  And Dave  you mentioned positive trajectory for hyperscale from here  Do you expect June to be up from March as well  I mean I know things could change  but just in your base case from an exabyte perspective Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We ve talked at the end of the fiscal year that I don t see any reason for the cycle to slow down by the end of the fiscal year  At the back end of the calendar year  we re not really ready to talk about that yet  given all the disruptions that are going on the market  but I will say this  I m very happy with our product portfolio going into this next cycle whenever it comes Ananda Baruah    Loop Capital    AnalystOkay  great  thanks so much guys OperatorYour next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo  Please go ahead  Your line is open Aaron Rakers    Wells Fargo    AnalystYeah  Thanks for taking the question  I ll try and get two in here as well  Just on a final comment on the product cycle setup  I know that you mentioned during a call that you d have 18 TB shipping in the first half of the year  Just    sorry about the nuance here  But when you say that  do you mean that you expect to see shipments in volume in the first half of the calendar year  or is that just shipments in the qualification  I m just trying to understand the timing of those relative to your competitor Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerWell  yeah  I don t really want to get into that too much  Aaron  but I would say that in my opinion  qualification is volume  I mean it s not one  the qualification test beds  if you will  are fairly big volume and so it s not 1 million per quarter  like  we just talked about  a few quarters into the ramp of the 16s  but no that  yeah  that kind of goes hand in glove Aaron Rakers    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  Fair enough  And then as we think about the trajectory of the business  I m just curious now that you re breaking it out a little bit differently between mass capacity versus legacy  as we model going forward  we talk a lot about Nearline  but I m curious of how you think about the rate of decline in the legacy business  as we move out over the next couple of quarters or if you want to take a stab longer term Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerVery interesting  If I think about some of the legacy businesses  the way we re thinking about them is we re not really investing much opex into them in anymore  but we have a very broad customer portfolio that actually needs those products to go make whatever pivot they re going to make from the old world Client Server  IT 2 0 to the new world IT 4 0  right  So we have to continue to support those customers and foster those relationships with what they need  In some cases  we see surprise downsides  and in other cases  we see surprise upsides based on how they re driving their markets and we react to them I would say across most of the legacy space  there is a mix up going on  So even if the units are coming down  the mix is going up  the use cases are still relevant  in the cases of some  there are already    as you know  there are hundreds of millions of slots for these form factors out in the world  And just to support business for that is a long tail and that s the way I think about it is probably as it mixes up  it becomes more stable relatively  So it s not going away very soon  but we re not investing in it either  we re just continuing to service it predictably Gianluca Romano    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think  he is raising a very good point  If you look at the importance of the legacy business in terms of free cash flow considering that the opex and the capex is fairly low in that area  it s still a good contributor to our free cash flow in general  So it s still very important to us Aaron Rakers    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research  Please go ahead  Your line is open Steven Fox    Cross Research    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  Hope this question was unanswered  I got disconnected a couple of times  but in terms of looking at the competitive environment  your largest competitor has talked about maybe regaining some market share down the road this year as they launch 16 TB products and above suggesting that maybe you re over performing on market share right now  But at the same time  you re talking about ramping more 16 terabyte volume and 18 TB is ramping  So I guess without throwing too many stores  I m just curious what you would say about just your relative market share potential for the rest of the year Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I would say  market share is not exactly an outcome    or sorry is an outcome  but it s not exactly our objective  So we made a conscious decision  If you remember  Steven  three quarters  four quarters ago  start pivoting from some of the lower capacity points into the 16 platform and we were very open about that  just because we knew we would get the leverage into the 18s and 20s like we ve talked about  I think as some of that happens  customers will drive us for more and more of that demand  And I think some of the puts and takes you ve seen in share may change a little bit  but again  we re trying to be predictable for those customers to get them exactly what they need  I like our plans because we happen to have the drive up the ramp up already  So it s very predictable Steven Fox    Cross Research    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  Just on a couple of follow ups  First on what you just said about pivoting away from lower capacity points  I guess I was under the impression that a lot of that was in the rear view mirror  But you re saying you still may do more of that as we look out over the next 12 months to 18 months  and then I had a quick follow up Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerNo  sorry  Well  there are still our customers that need those products for various reasons  right  because of their architectures or what have you  but no  what I said in particular is if I go back nine months  we were very vocal about we re moving to 16s to these new platforms  And we ve been focusing all of our operational resources and heads and media and things like that on those new platforms Steven Fox    Cross Research    AnalystOkay  I understand now  And then in terms of gross margins  I understand you don t want to guide the gross margins  but you ve mentioned several    without getting into detail  you ve mentioned several drivers that would seem to improve your gross margins considerably over the next few quarters or at least a little bit  what are the drags that we should worry about outside of macro that could be pressure on the gross margins Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerI ll let Gianluca answer  but you re hitting the right theme  which it comes down to supply and demand  So for specific products or for the cloud cyclicality  as we ve talked about before  if we ve got supply and demand pretty well balanced  we should be able to manage exactly like you described  but go ahead  Gianluca Gianluca Romano    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  I would say that we expect high volume from our 16 terabyte and the Mass Capacity Storage drives in general  We think our cost is declining fairly well  Of course  when you talk about gross margin  the other variable is pricing and now we will have to wait and see how the pricing will be during the quarter and that will determine our gross margin at the end Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerI think we ve said before that    especially in the down cycle like we were in early calendar  19 that we re managing for free cash flow in operating income is the way we re focused  As the cloud comes back to a more of a peak cycle  then we can figure out exactly how we re going to balance our portfolio  But it starts with what the customers need and making sure we get them what they need to go achieve their business objectives and we re always mindful of the demand cyclicality as well Steven Fox    Cross Research    AnalystUnderstood  Thank you so much OperatorYour next question comes from Jim Suva  Citigroup  Please go ahead  Your line is open Jim Suva    Citigroup    AnalystThank you very much  If I understand it correctly  your 18 platform is going to be on the same platform as 16  And if so  when we think about that  I would assume that means that there is lower yield issues  lower risk and things like that or is there additional complexity you should be aware of  And when we think about once it s ramping and more volume  would the profitability be similar or why wouldn t it actually be higher  just kind of talking kind of longer term Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerSo  in theory  you re right  I would say  if we look back over multiple generations in the industry  all the way back to 2 terabytes or 3 terabytes  we were changing platforms quite frequently  more heads and media  more different technologies being brought to bear and things like that  It s a new mechanical platform  so a lot of parts we re changing  Exactly to your point  we ve been talking about this with the 16  We think it s a highly leverageable platform for many years  There will be subtle changes  but I think that most of the parts are not changing and that helps our ability to ramp  our ability to yield and our ability to scale for the customers  be more flexible actually if we can move most of our product portfolio over there  So it does provide opportunities  but again  supply and demand is the key driver there  Gianluca  do you have something to add there Gianluca Romano    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I think you made the point Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Does that make sense  Jim Jim Suva    Citigroup    AnalystIt does  Lastly  anything on tax rate we should be aware of for kind of longer term modeling for tax rate Gianluca Romano    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I don t expect any change in our tax rate Jim Suva    Citigroup    AnalystThank you so much for the details Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerRight Gianluca Romano    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel  Please go ahead  Your line is open Patrick Ho    Stifel    AnalystThank you very much  Dave  maybe first off  in terms of the transition from 16 terabytes to 18 terabytes  you mentioned some of the ease of the customers  How do we look at it from a new customer or share win standpoint  given that the transition to existing customers probably is easy  But how do you look at it from a new customer win standpoint  Does the success of 16 terabyte help validate it for the new customers Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerIn some cases  because of the leverage  especially on firmware basis and things like that  the feature sets  things like that  But no  in general  most customers are going to every new qualification with a discerning eye  They want to make sure that they do all the things right to integrate it into their data center  And again  it s    data centers are not one size fits all  there is many different applications  some of the big customers have so many different applications  they have to worry about being able to plug this into legacy architectures or new architectures or things like that and globally  There s many different biases being used  chipsets being used so on and you get it  So there is some leverage for sure  people know the family now  they re already comfortable with the family  There is some leverage  and then there is some element of a new customer  you have to go through the same amount of work Patrick Ho    Stifel    AnalystGreat  And maybe as my follow up question to Gianluca  in terms of the gross margins  you ve given a lot of color on the call so far  in terms of the cost reduction impact versus the change in product mix  on a going forward basis  is it more of a mix issue at where you could say that the cost reductions are already in place and it s now just the mix turning more favorable Gianluca Romano    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Probably  the mix is a major driver in the cost reduction at this point Patrick Ho    Stifel    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much OperatorYour next question comes from Munjal Shah with UBS  Please go ahead  Your line is open Munjal Shah    UBS    AnalystThank you for taking my question  I had two  One on  could you comment on the surveillance demand  Is there anything going on with the large customers you think that there is all in or any thoughts for trend in the quarter  And then I have another one for Gianluca  you said    your comments suggest that gross margin should improve sequentially and your EPS guidance it s flat sequentially  I was just wondering if there is anything that s an offset in here Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think relative to surveillance  we have over the years seen some  I ll call it  seasonality around government buying cycles at the end of the calendar year  And as the market moves toward some smart city applications especially globally  I think there are markets that we re seeing now that people are investing quite a bit for smart cities  you do see that cyclicality  The market is growing  I would argue that from a units perspective  it s probably  there have been peaks that are bigger than the one we re in from an exabyte perspective  obviously we are in a growth period  in this one with a record exabytes  So the way I look at it every year gets a little bit stronger  but there is still some seasonality  cyclicality Shanye Hudson    Vice President  Investor RelationsAnd then  Munjal  just to clarify on your second question  I got the second part  you were saying guidance on the EPS side is flat  Could you repeat the first part of your question Munjal Shah    UBS    AnalystRight  and then the comments suggest that  I mean  comments generally suggest that gross margin should improve because your 16 terabyte mix will probably be higher in March  So is there an offset below the gross margin line Gianluca Romano    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  as I said before  we have an assumption on pricing of course  and can be different and when we go through the quarter  but with a fairly flat revenue  we expect a fairly flat EPS quarter over quarter Munjal Shah    UBS    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group  Please go ahead  Your line is open Nehal Chokshi    Maxim Group    AnalystYeah  Thank you  Recognizing that you re still in the growth mode on the hyperscale demand on Nearline growth  That being said  the exabytes currently relative to the last peak is up only 10  versus prior peaks    peak to peak it s around 2x  And with the potential that you re going to be hitting  digestion phase going into calendar 2H  20  I was wondering if you had some thoughts on why not as much potential peak to peak growth as in prior peaks  any thoughts there Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  It s quite interesting  I didn t say that we were in a digestion phase then  but you know I think we ve seen that cyclicality before  it s dangerous to say that will happen exactly again  because there has been a different reason for the cyclicality every time it hits  That said  I do think that the demand is growing  I think that the customers are broadening  And I also think that their ability to use higher and higher capacity points is actually getting bigger  So once upon a time  people couldn t use more than 4 terabytes and while most of the market was on 8s and you re starting to see people get shifting over to bigger capacity points as well  So I do think exabyte growth is still going to continue  I don t think I m calling the top of the peak at 10  yet Nehal Chokshi    Maxim Group    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorYour last question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen  Please go ahead  Your line is open Karl Ackerman    Cowen    AnalystHey  Thanks for letting me ask a question  I wanted to maybe shift gears a little bit and talk about something that hasn t been asked yet  but just on the systems business that was up 14  sequentially  pretty good performance  I m guessing that segment also performed well from systems revenue  selling your high capacity offerings  but maybe you could just discuss some of the traction you re seeing in SSDs and kind of what you re seeing for that broad segment  how we should think about that in the March quarter Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I would say on this from a systems perspective  we re happy with what we ve done with the portfolio  which is  you know  we re not making boxes that don t have any Seagate products in them any more  Now we re making boxes full of    chalk full of Seagate products right  with lots of drives  100 drives or plus in some of the boxes  And that s a great vehicle to go move higher capacity drives into the market quickly  So I m happy with the pivot the team has made  I think there s some opportunity to go grow it as well  On the SSD side  I think customers are very happy with our products  we continue to service those customers and I think as I m not the first one to be saying this  the market seems to be stabilizing vis a vis what it was a year ago  So we ll continue to service those customers in a meaningful way I think Karl Ackerman    Cowen    AnalystJust maybe one last one if I may  capex did spike up a little bit this quarter  When we think about the forward trajectory  are you adding capacity for 16 and 18 terabyte that speaks to what s to come in the back half of the calendar year  or are you suggesting a breadth of SKUs is needed as enterprise customers capacity needs are bifurcating between high and mid range SKUs  Thanks Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerActually interesting  I think the first one and it s not just that it s also the transition that we have to make to HAMR  we think that long lead time capital is the important stuff  the heads and media to get it online for the growth that we see in the cloud  and we re investing for it  So we are confident in our 16  18  20 terabyte ramps  same platform like we ve been talking about  we need to make the heads and media investments to make sure that we have enough in the market when the demand is out there Gianluca Romano    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Let me add that we are still focusing on keeping the capex in the range that we gave at the Analyst Day  so between 6  and 8  of our revenue  We don t expect to go above this range in any quarter Karl Ackerman    Cowen    AnalystThank you very much Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Karl OperatorThere are no further questions  I ll turn the call back to management for closing remarks Dave Mosley    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thanks  Josh  To summarize  we re continuing to manage the business well optimizing profitability and generating cash to fund our future growth and deliver value to our customers and our shareholders  And the world is just creating data at a breakneck pace  which in turn drives secular growth for mass capacity storage and needs for cost effective data management solutions and I believe in our technology roadmap  our product portfolio  I think Seagate is very well positioned to capitalize on all these trends  So I d like to once again thank all our customers  suppliers  business partners  employees for their contributions to our performance and also like to thank the shareholders for their ongoing support  Thank you Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  53 minutesCall participants Shanye Hudson    Vice President  Investor RelationsDave Mosley

172006,393522,STX,Seagate Slumps as Analyst Questions  Aggressive  Outlook,news,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing com   Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  plunged Wednesday as its sunnier outlook was called into question amid worries over supply chain disruption in China in the wake of coronavirus outbreak 
Shares fell 6  
The company reported second quarter earnings of  1 35 a share  above consensus estimates of  1 31 a share  but revenue of  2 7 billion fell just short of Wall Street s call for  2 72 billion 
Seagate guided third quarter earnings of  1 35 a share on revenue of  2 7 billion  above estimates for earnings of  1 27 a share on revenue of  2 59 billion 
The stronger results  however  were primarily driven by higher sales of surveillance drives  a category that has shown  somewhat lumpy  demand characteristics in the past  Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson said   
Bryson also questioned whether Seagate is setting itself up to fail by offering up aggressive growth expectations at a time when the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted operations in China 
 We remain concerned that near term expectations are perhaps a bit too aggressive particularly in light of our belief that potential supply chain disruption tied to the coronavirus creates more risk than reward this quarter and next   Bryson added 
Wedbush also flagged concerns about visibility after Seagate shifted its hard drive product segments to mass capacity and legacy 
 The shift also leads to some loss of granularity as well as limiting our ability to compare historical results with current performance  
RBC agrees  highlighting concerns about uncertainty over performance in the back of half of the year 
 While the first half should see notable demand for near line and data center centric products  back half revenues may be lighter than normal seasonality   RBC said ",2020-02-05,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/seagate-slumps-as-analyst-questions-aggressive-outlook-2077165,2077165
172013,393529,STX,Seagate Technology Revenue Returns to Growth  Making This Dividend Play a Buy,news,"Memory chip sales have been down for the last year  but as is usually the case during the industry s cyclical downturns  the shares of many memory chipmakers rose on the expectation that demand will eventually rebound  Such was the case with Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  in 2019  After the stock s price was cut in half in 2018 due to mounting fears that chip sales were petering out  it recovered in dramatic fashion as the downturn showed signs of bottoming out 

Data by YCharts 
As predicted  Seagate s year over year results did bottom during its fiscal 2020 second quarter  which ended Jan  3  2020   and a return to growth is now on the table for the balance of the year  After last year s big share price rally  those forecasts of rising sales are partially priced in  But with the stock trading at a fair valuation and paying a hefty dividend  it s definitely worth a look 
The quarter in review
Revenue and adjusted earnings fell 7  and 13   respectively in fiscal 2019  and sales of Seagate s hard disk drives  HDD  are down another 8  through the first half of fiscal 2020  Profit margins on product sold are also down as sluggish demand for digital memory has put downward pressure on pricing across the industry   

Seagate s fiscal 2020 first half ended Jan  3  2020  Seagate s fiscal 2019 first half ended Dec  28  2018   Pp   percentage point  Data source  Seagate Technology   
The numbers look ugly  but it s important to bear in mind that Seagate notched a sequential increase from Q1 to Q2    an important development as its results start climbing again  Quarter over quarter  revenue and adjusted earnings were up 5  and 35   respectively    especially impressive results as the three month period that includes the holidays has historically been a sleepy one for Seagate   
Plus  the third quarter is looking good too  with management anticipating a return to year over year growth  At the midpoint of guidance  revenues and adjusted earnings should notch gains of 17  and 63     although the unpredictability of global economic conditions led management to stick error bars of plus or minus 7  on both metrics  Either way  though  it looks like a big rebound is in store in Q3  in sharp contrast to the glum report delivered in the prior year period 

Data centers  smart facilities  and smart cities on the rise
With its old HDD technology  Seagate is often seen as lagging behind memory tech leaders like Micron  but there is still plenty of room for it to grow its sales  HDDs are cheaper than newer types of digital memory  which makes them a compelling alternative for companies looking to expand their mass storage capabilities on a budget 
Specifically  Seagate management said it is seeing data center construction start to come back  supporting the ongoing global shift to cloud computing  Its sales into new markets addressing smart facilities  like network connected manufacturing plants  and smart cities  tech like traffic surveillance systems  are also gaining traction  These markets are making use of high definition video  which requires a massive amount of on premises back end storage  and Seagate s HDDs are a good fit to provide it

172036,393552,STX,Seagate Technology Hopes to Profit From a Growing Shortage of Data Storage,news,"Technological integrations have become a vital part of almost every industry these days  Common everyday items    including washers  watches  and even clothing    have become advanced enough to collect data about our personal lives for storage and later analysis  With all this new data being generated  through a trend often referred to as the Internet of Things   a growing demand has arisen for a place to store it all  That is where Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  hopes to benefit 
Seagate researches  manufactures  and distributes data storage technology and storage solutions to a wide variety of customers  Because of a widespread and growing need for data storage  Seagate has developed into a huge player in the data storage industry  As it continues to grow its bottom line in line with this growing demand  is now the time to add this stock to your investment portfolio  Let s take a closer look 

Worldwide data storage shortage is only growing
It isn t widely publicized but  for the last decade or so  global data storage manufacturers have not been able to meet the overall demand for storage 
In 2019 alone  there was a demand for 30 800 exabytes  1 exabyte   1 million terabytes  worth of data storage and only 19 800 exabytes were supplied  That translates to a 43  gap between supply and demand  In 2020  the supply gap is expected to rise to 53   leaving a storage shortage of 17 900 exabytes of data  
For Seagate  this shortage is a huge advantage thanks to its cost effective and durable solutions for both commercial and consumer products  Current customers in the server industry will continue to purchase enterprise level capacity drives  while regular consumers will see lower hard drive prices    both of which Seagate specializes in  In the very large hard drive segment  for example  Seagate has a respectable market share of about 41   This is only 5 percentage points less than the leading competitor Western Digital s 46  share of all hard drives sold  Toshiba is the  distant  third competitor in this field  with a 13 3  share  
Assuming that Seagate can maintain its current market share  just the organic growth in storage demand shown by the supply gap data should result in a substantial increase in data capacity sold  This is helped by the fact that Seagate has four different enterprise level data storage solutions that make up the bulk of its data capacity sales  What makes these enterprise level hard drives such a hot seller is that each of the four is engineered for a specific type of data storage management  So with Seagate hard drives  businesses have the flexibility to choose between versatile  speed optimized  durable  and smart secured storage options  Most of Seagate s competitors do not offer as many data specific enterprise storage solutions  with the closest competitor being Western Digital s Enterprise Gold and Ultrastar DC HC600 series drives 
One would think that this increase in data capacity sales would lead to higher revenue  The issue with this theory is that increased efficiency and competition within the data storage industry has actually resulted in falling prices  Basically  more sales being made but at reduced prices that don t necessarily translate to increased revenue  Although Seagate may not be able to take additional advantage of the hard drive market  it may be able to increase exposure in newer markets  such as solid state storage  to make up for revenue stagnation in the hard drive sector 
Flat revenue  but a better bottom line for Seagate
Despite revenue being relatively flat over the past four years  Seagate has posted larger net profits each and every year  It has done this  in part  by getting research and development  R D  costs under control as well as lowering selling  general and administrative expenses  SG A   Here is how Seagate has benefited since 2016 

Data source  Seagate Technology
Of course  other factors affect net income like other operating expenses and income tax expenses  For the most part  though  operating expenses at Seagate have fallen considerably  Investors should look for Seagate to continue lowering costs as certain storage technologies become cheaper and more efficient to produce 
Where is all the net income going 
Seagate issued its first dividend back in 2004  It paused dividend payouts during the worst of the Great Recession  between 2009 and 2011  but has kept the dividend payments steady and growing ever since  Its latest annualized payout was  2 54 a share and represented a yearly dividend yield of 4 27   
That relatively high dividend yield is even at a time when the stock is just  8 short of its all time high of  66 per share  Some of the price rally from December 2018 lows of  38 59 a share can be traced back to a  2 8 billion stock buyback program launched in November 2018  Throughout 2019  the buyback program was still ongoing and Seagate has repurchased  894 million so far  There is still about  2 billion worth of stock repurchases still planned  according to management  
So is Seagate Technologies a buy 
Buying this stock at the moment comes down to your investing philosophy  For long term investors  Seagate is a definite buy  It has a generous and generally reliable dividend  a stable balance sheet  and a chance for continued growth 
If you are someone looking for a short or mid term investment  Seagate may not be the answer  Seagate stock is already trading just shy of its all time high and its price tends to fluctuate heavily on any U S  China trade war news  Any escalation in the trade war is bound to harm Seagate s share prices in the short term  If you currently have any Seagate shares  it is still a good idea to hold on to them as there is room for price appreciation ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pibm4,2059939
172037,393553,STX,Why Seagate Technology Is My Favorite Dividend Stock for 2020,news,"Shares of digital memory manufacturer Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  roared 54  higher in 2019  paying investors  0 63 per share each quarter along the way  To kick off 2020  that payout was raised to  0 65 a share  good for an annual yield of 4 4  as of this writing  
Though the stock s rally has priced in an expected rebound in demand for Seagate s wares this year  there are plenty of reasons to still like the stock  Shares are priced reasonably  the next wave of electronics and digital business operation upgrades are coming  and that dividend is a generous bonus along the way  Thus  Seagate is my favorite dividend stock for 2020 

Early innings of sales recovery
Manufacturing is a cyclical industry  and digital memory is no exception  Though Seagate s older but cheaper hard disk drive  HDD  technology has helped it avoid the sharper declines of peers like Micron  NASDAQ MU  and Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC   the slump in sales brought on by last year s slowdown in data center construction and economic uncertainty due to trade wars has taken a toll 

Data source  Seagate Technology  YOY   year over year   
However  things are back on the mend and Seagate could return to year over year sales growth during its fiscal 2020 second quarter and be close to even on the bottom line when compared to the same period a year ago  The company has seen an uptick in demand for data center HDDs with its high storage capacity 16 terabyte drives  and new 18 terabyte and 20 terabyte HDDs will begin shipping in early and late 2020  respectively  In addition to data centers  upgrades to laptops  gaming devices  and other consumer products could provide a bump this year  A truce in the trade war between the U S  and China is also welcome news for the technologist   
And then there s the longer term  with edge computing just getting started  Applications like AI based video surveillance and smart factories are only just beginning to be built  and the intense amount of data that needs to be processed and stored bodes well for digital memory makers like Seagate   
Low valuation and a generous yield
That all bodes well for the long term for Seagate  but I think it s an especially timely buy right now    even after last year s big rebound  Sales growth is just beginning to show renewed signs of life  which should equate to higher earnings per share  While some of that rebound in the next year is priced in  not all of it is  Seagate s price to trailing 12 month free cash flow  money left over after operating and capital expenses are paid  is at 16  while expected one year forward price to earnings is only 11 5  That valuation implies little expansion in earnings in the next year  an unlikely scenario if revenue does start to increase once again   
Additionally  the company continues to fund share repurchases  270 million shares outstanding at the end of Q1 versus 292 million a year ago  which boosts earnings per share  and the recent dividend payout raise is easily covered by free cash flow  Since digital memory tends to be cyclical  it often pays to scoop up shares of a company like Seagate near the bottom of the sales trough   
Of course  new demand may not materialize in 2020  which will undoubtedly limit the upside for the stock  However  with the cash flowing to fund share repurchases and a 4 4  dividend yield  even a flat sales performance in the new year could still end up positive for Seagate owners  Thus  the stock is my favorite addition for 2020 for investors looking for juicy dividend payers  I m a buyer right now ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pidxv,2060126
172038,393554,STX,Better Buy  Seagate Technology vs  Western Digital Corporation,news,"Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  and Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC  are the world s two largest hard drive makers  Both companies struggled with declining sales and contracting margins over the past year due to sluggish PC sales and soft demand from enterprise customers 
However  signs of a cyclical turnaround lifted shares of Seagate and WD 40  and 60   respectively  over the past 12 months  Does either stock have more room to run in 2020  Let s dig deeper into their core businesses to decide 
The differences between Seagate and WD
Seagate and WD both sell platter based HDDs  hard disk drives   Seagate controlled 40  of the HDD market in the third quarter of 2019  according to Coughlin Associates  while WD held a 36  share  Toshiba  OTC TOSBF  held the remaining 24  

Seagate mainly sells HDDs  while WD expanded into SSDs  solid state drives  with its acquisition of SanDisk in 2016  SSDs  which store data on flash  NAND  memory chips instead of platters  are smaller  faster  more power efficient  and less prone to damage than HDDs    but they re significantly pricier 
Seagate generated 92  of its revenue from HDDs last quarter  The rest came from SSDs and other data storage solutions  WD generated 60  of its revenue from HDDs and 40  from SSDs and flash memory chips last quarter 
Instead of worrying about SSDs  Seagate pivoted away from lower capacity HDDs  which compete against SSDs in consumer electronics  and sold higher capacity HDDs to cost conscious data center customers  It also gradually expanded into the SSD market by joining Bain Capital in a joint acquisition of Toshiba s memory chip business in 2018  which allowed to it sell more enterprise and gaming SSDs 
Meanwhile  WD s ownership of SanDisk fully exposed it to the global glut in NAND chips  which crushed market prices over the past two years  That decline reduced its SSD and flash memory revenue as cheaper SSDs cannibalized its HDD business  Seagate s business model is less capital intensive than WD s  so its free cash flow  FCF  has remained more stable over the past three years 

Source  YCharts
Seagate consistently repurchases its shares with its FCF  but WD hasn t bought back any shares over the past four quarters  Both companies still consistently pay dividends    Seagate pays a forward dividend yield of 4 1   compared to WD s yield of 2 9  
However  Seagate only spent 66  of its FCF on its dividend over the past 12 months  while WD s dividend gobbled up 166  of its FCF  Those ratios suggest that Seagate s slow and steady approach is more sustainable than WD s aggressive assault on the SSD market 
Growth rates and valuations
Seagate and WD both experienced sharp revenue declines over the past year 

YOY   Year over year  Source  Company quarterly reports 
Yet both companies are improving on a sequential basis  Seagate s revenue grew sequentially over the past two quarters  and it expects its revenue to stay flat annually and rise nearly 6  sequentially in the second quarter as the cyclical headwinds fade 
WD expects its revenue to stay flat annually and grow 4  sequentially in the second quarter  During last quarter s conference call  CEO Steve Milligan declared that the NAND market had  passed a cyclical trough  
Both companies expect their gross margins to expand sequentially in the second quarter  Seagate attributes that recovery to stronger sales of its higher margin 16TB HDDs  while WD cites rising NAND prices as its main tailwind 
Analysts expect Seagate s earnings to grow 2  this year and 7  next year  which are stable growth rates for a stock that trades at 12 times forward earnings  WD s earnings are expected to tumble 44  this year but rebound 153  next year  which are also impressive growth rates relative to its forward P E of 10 
The winner  Seagate
Seagate and WD both have room to run  but Seagate s less capital intensive model  its low exposure to volatile memory prices  its generous buybacks  and its bigger  and more sustainable  dividend all make it a better buy than WD at these prices ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnyw4,2069549

Traders almost all use stops  automatically exiting a position after a specified loss  The placement of stops is a great topic which we will soon take up  Today we want to compare the stop to a hedge  The stop locks in the current price  usually at a loss but sometimes preserving part of a gain  the trailing stop   It costs nothing to put in place 
A hedge is something you add to your trading position to limit the loss without the need to sell  It is a financial instrument that is likely to appreciate if you are losing on your main trade  Sometimes there is a direct cost  such as when you are buying an option  On other occasions the cost is implicit  a reduction in your gain when you have a winning trade 
Tom Basso  
Why do you hedge 
I hedge to drastically reduce the risk of loss to my portfolios from a potential 50  or move down in the stock market   Hedging is not designed to increase my returns  It is meant to preserve the value of my portfolios  The benefits  Preservation of capital in my retirement accounts and peace of mind knowing that I have less risk than the general market  I must protect my  Mr  Serenity  moniker 
For what kind of risks do you hedge 
I hedge my stock and ETF portfolios for the market risk associated with owning a long stock portfolio during severe down moves of the market 
 Todd   Is this really a time for stops rather than hedging  
Trading Strategy Guides clarifies the possible advantage of a hedge 
Basically  hedging is when you open trades to offset another trade that you have already opened  The hedging methods require using a second instrument or financial asset to implement risk hedging strategies 
In essence  by opening this trade you re offsetting the risk  Secondly  before opening a hedge trade you need to make sure that there is some sort of negative correlation between the two opened trades 
In other words  the hedging strategies give you the chance to limit your losses without using a  
Our Take
We prefer stops in our favored environment   a strong trend  A stock that has been rising for some time in the past is likely to continue  Verify that the trend is on your side and consider the historical trend persistence of the stock in question 
In today s Stock Exchange  you ll notice the chart patterns of the two model selected stocks are very similar  They rose with the broader market early in the year  moved sideways over the summer  and have continued to new highs over the past few months  Stocks are heavily influenced by the broader market but also move on the characteristics of their respective sector  Stocks at or near their annual high prices have less potential overhead resistance  In other words  most holders of the stock are holding a profit and have less urgency to sell 
Despite the excitement surrounding cannabis  the trend has clearly been down for much of 2019  Following the long term trend would have kept you clear from the wealth destroyed by the cannabis sector this year 






In general  our models all use some form of stop  If  as managers  we decide to hedge  it is part of an overall portfolio strategy

172083,393599,STX,IBM  IBM  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 15 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  157 44 in the previous session  International Business Machines has gained 16 6  since the start of the year compared to the 6 5  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 12 9  return for the Zacks Computer   Integrated Systems industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on January 21  2020  IBM reported EPS of  4 71 versus consensus estimate of  4 69 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 38  
For the current fiscal year  IBM is expected to post earnings of  13 36 per share on  78 61 billion in revenues  This represents a 4 29  change in EPS on a 1 89  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  14 16 per share on  79 59 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 6  and 1 25   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
IBM may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
IBM has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are D and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 8 3X versus its peer group s average of 10 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 14  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  IBM currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if IBM meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though IBM shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does IBM Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of IBM have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Logitech International  LOGI   Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX   and Apple  AAPL   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 44  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for IBM  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2020-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibm-ibm-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200505421,200505421

172101,393617,STX, Bitcoin   Betamax  Maybe  Says Tech Investor Glenn Hutchins ,news,"Bitcoin could go the way of Sony s Betamax videotape and flop compared to its competitors  Glenn Hutchins  a tech investor who sits on boards of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the NASDAQ OMX Group as well as being a major tech investor  made the claim in an  on CNBC on May 9 
Hutchins sees one of Bitcoin s competitors coming out on top  much as the JVC led VHS format eventually beat out Betamax in the 1980s  In drawing out the parallel to the videotape format wars  the former Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  and Gartner board member sees different coins filling specific functions and carving out their niches in that manner  

 The token of exchange at the heart of the math solution that leads the technology will be there   Hutchins said   Different tokens will be used for different applications  

The reference fits as Betamax had slight technological edges in playback and audio specifications and VHS was both cheaper and had longer recording times  Consumers generally voted with their pockets and Betamax eventually became a niche product for videophiles 

While cryptocurrencies have been compared to gold in recent months  especially during the late 2017 price surge  Hutchins sees things in a utilitarian light   I think it s more like copper  like an industrial metal that s used for a purpose to drive an outcome   He also sees that   There will be a token that s used just like there s an industrial metal that s used for wiring  

Currently  bitcoin still accounts for over 36  of the world s cryptocurrency market  as per CMC  Ethereum is placed second at 17  of the market and XRP had a 7  market share  New coins continue to appear on the market and are designed to remedy shortcomings seen in Bitcoin  So far  however  they have not succeeded in replacing it ",2018-05-10,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin--betamax-maybe-says-tech-investor-glenn-hutchins-1441215,1441215
172114,393630,STX,Is Seagate Technology  STX  A Suitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Seagate Technology plc    NASDAQ STX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Seagate Technology has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 82  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 52  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Seagate Technology s current PE ratio which is slightly above its midpoint  which is 10 52  over the past five years Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks  Computer Storage Devices Industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 31  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Seagate Technology has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 03  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Seagate Technology has a P S ratio of about 1 52  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 26 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Seagate Technology currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes STX a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio for the company is just 7 87  a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 11 18  Clearly  STX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Seagate Technology might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D  This gives STX a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days and none higher  while the current year has seen five downward and no upward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 15 2  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has fallen 8 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSeagate Technology is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 28  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to Double Each was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector

172116,393632,STX,How Seagate Technology  STX  Stock Stands Out In A Strong Industry ,opinion,One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Seagate Technology plc   NASDAQ STX    This is because this security in the Computer  Storage Devices space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity  and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  This is arguably taking place in the Computer  Storage Devices space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 30 out of more than 250 industries  suggesting it is well positioned from this perspective  especially when compared to other segments out there Meanwhile  Seagate Technology is actually looking pretty good on its own too  The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month  suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm s prospects in both the short and long term Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus   In fact  over the past month  current quarter estimates have risen from 88 cents per share to  1 00 per share  while current year estimates have risen from  4 30 per share to  4 63 per share  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is also a favorable signal  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here So  if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry  consider Seagate Technology  Not only is its industry currently in the top third  but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late  suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit Potential The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance  Our recent biotech recommendations have produced gains of  98    119  and  164  in as little as 1 month  The stocks in this report could perform even better ,2019-10-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-seagate-technology-stx-stock-stands-out-in-a-strong-industry-200473163,200473163
172117,393633,STX,Why Seagate  STX  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Seagate  STX   which belongs to the Zacks Computer  Storage Devices industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This electronic storage maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9 45  
For the last reported quarter  Seagate came out with earnings of  0 86 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 83 per share  representing a surprise of 3 61   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 72 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 83 per share  delivering a surprise of 15 28  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Seagate lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Seagate has an Earnings ESP of  0 17  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on November 1  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-seagate-stx-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200475825,200475825

slightly outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 311 billion  However  the figure declined 17 5  from the year ago quarter and 14 8  sequentially Both the top and bottom line witnessed year over year decline  owing to uncertain macroeconomic environment  CPU shortages and declining PC shipments  Further  soft demand witnessed from cloud service providers  CSPs  and OEM enterprise customers

Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  is the featured stock in May s Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio 
Since 2016  STX has grown after tax operating profit  NOPAT  by an impressive 68  compounded annually  Over the trailing twelve months  TTM   NOPAT has grown 16  year over year  NOPAT margin has increased from 5  in 2016 to 15  TTM while return on invested capital  ROIC  has improved from 8  to a top quintile 23  over the same time

STX s Free Cash Flow Supports Dividend Payments
Over the past five years  STX has increased its annual dividend from  1 67 share to  2 52 share  or 11  compounded annually  This dividend payment has been supported by STX s cumulative free cash flow  Despite lower FCF in the TTM period  STX generated cumulative  6 3 billion  53  of market cap  in FCF since 2014 while paying  3 2 billion in dividends 
Companies with strong free cash flow provide higher quality dividend yields because we know the firm has the cash to support its dividend  On the flip side  dividends from companies with low or negative free cash flow cannot be trusted as much because the company may not be able to sustain paying dividends

STX s Valuation Implies Permanent Profit Decline
At its current price of  43 share  STX has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 7  This ratio means the market expects STX s NOPAT to permanently decline by 30   This expectation seems pessimistic given that STX has grown NOPAT by 7  compounded annually since 2003 
If STX can maintain TTM NOPAT margins  15   and grow NOPAT by just 1  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  57 share today   a 33  upside

172163,393679,STX,Earnings Preview  Seagate  STX  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Seagate  STX  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 2  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This electronic storage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 83 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  48 8  
Revenues are expected to be  2 31 billion  down 18 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 07  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Seagate 
For Seagate  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 05  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Seagate will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Seagate would post earnings of  0 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 83  delivering a surprise of  15 28  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Seagate doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-seagate-stx-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200445732,200445732

172188,393704,STX,Analysts Estimate Seagate  STX  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Seagate  STX  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This electronic storage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 71 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  51 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 31 billion  down 17 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Seagate 
For Seagate  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Seagate will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Seagate would post earnings of  1 27 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 41  delivering a surprise of  11 02  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Seagate doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-seagate-stx-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200409430,200409430
172189,393705,STX,Should Value Investors Buy Seagate  STX  Stock ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use tried and true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One stock to keep an eye on is Seagate  STX   STX is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 9 96  which compares to its industry s average of 14 56  Over the last 12 months  STX s Forward P E has been as high as 11 78 and as low as 6  with a median of 9 03 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  STX has a P S ratio of 1 13  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 64 
Finally  we should also recognize that STX has a P CF ratio of 6 05  This data point considers a firm s operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 8 72  Over the past 52 weeks  STX s P CF has been as high as 11 77 and as low as 4 70  with a median of 6 40

growing media and regulatory compliance has resulted in data explosion for enterprises  This in turn has bolstered the deployment of high capacity mass storage products  which is a positive for the industry participants  Notably  effective storage is essential for proper harnessing of data  However  declining PC shipments is detrimental for industry participants  That is because the demand for HDDs in manufacturing PCs is the highest and companies in this industry still derive the bulk of their revenues from the sale of such devices  According to the recently released worldwide PC shipment data by Gartner and IDC even the back to school season failed to lift the PC market  Per Gartner s preliminary data  PC shipments in the fourth quarter of 2018 fell 4 3  year over year to 68 6 million units  Going by IDC  worldwide PC shipment also dipped 3 7  on a year over year basis and totaled 68 1 million in the final quarter  Moreover  the Computer   Storage Devices industry is facing

STX Valuation Still Provides Significant Upside
Even after outperforming the market since we originally featured the stock in 2010  STX remains very cheap  At its current price of  39 share  STX has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 6  This ratio means the market expects STX s NOPAT to permanently decline by 40   This expectation seems pessimistic given that STX has grown NOPAT by 7  compounded annually since 2003 and much faster in recent years 
If STX can maintain TTM NOPAT margins  16   and grow NOPAT by just 5  compounded annually for the next five years  the stock is worth  74 share today   a 90  upside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario

Despite consistent revenue growth  6  compounded annually since 2013   LOCO s NOPAT has fallen by 8  compounded annually since 2013  TTM NOPAT is down 28   LOCO s falling profits have been driven by margins declining from 16  in 2013 to just 6  TTM  The company s ROIC has also fallen from 10  in 2013 to a bottom quintile 4  TTM

LOCO Provides Poor Risk Reward
Despite the deterioration in fundamentals  LOCO is up 45  over the past year  which has left shares significantly overvalued 
To justify its current price of  16 share  LOCO must maintain TTM NOPAT margins  6   and grow NOPAT by 9  compounded annually for the next 11 years  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario  This expectation seems lofty given LOCO s declining margins and inability to grow NOPAT in recent years

172239,393755,STX,Earnings Preview  Seagate  STX  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Seagate  STX  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This electronic storage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 27 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 74 billion  down 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 07  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Seagate 
For Seagate  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 15  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Seagate will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Seagate would post earnings of  1 55 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 70  delivering a surprise of  9 68  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Seagate doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-seagate-stx-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200380069,200380069

Seagate shares have added about 2 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 5  
What s Next for Seagate 
While Seagate has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Seagate was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Evercore identified declining pricing for flash memory using  NAND  technology  which is a core product for Seagate  Analysts at Baird also expect lower memory prices  Given this  Evercore forecasts flat revenue for STX as well lower gross margins 
 The market has gotten a bit complacent  especially with respect to demand elasticity for NAND   explained analyst CJ Muse  who also downgraded Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC  with a similar rationale  WDC was trading 5  lower on Tuesday morning  
In looking at the market cycles for STX  we can see that the stock is in the declining phase of its current cycle  The chart illustrates that a  head and shoulders  top occurred earlier this year  Given this  our projection is around  46 by early October  
With regard to WDC  we believe the stock is likely completing the declining phase of its current cycle  As the new cycle begins  the stock is now due for a bounce  which will be short lived  Our forecast is for WDC to hit  50 by the end of the year

NASDAQ MEET   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Ultra Cheap PEG Stocks Value Investors Will LoveValue investing is gaining popularity by the day  The success of value investors like Warren Buffett further underscores this Buffett believes that proper understanding of the  intrinsic value  of a stock makes the task easier  Yardsticks such as dividend yield  the ratio of price to earnings or to book value are the most common forms of intrinsic value calculation  which can easily single out stocks that the market is currently undervaluing However  these ratios  while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock  may end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show  This may often lead to  value traps    a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems  which once affected the share price  turn out to be persistent In such a case  even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value  you might end up paying more  And here comes the importance of this not so popular but crucial value investing metric  the PEG ratio The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps determine the intrinsic value of a stock There are some drawbacks of using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and

172318,393834,STX,Global Dividends Hit Record In Q1  5 Top Ranked Picks ,opinion,"Global dividends reached a first quarter record of  244 7 billion  marking a 10  rise from the prior year quarter  per the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index  The growth was driven by record payouts in the United States and Canada 
U S  dividend hit a high  in the first quarter as almost 80  of companies augmented their payouts from the year earlier period  A favorable currency translation  tailwinds from the tax reform and an overall strong first quarter earnings season led to the surge 
The move was no surprise for the United States  The one time repatriation tax on about  2 5 trillion in offshore earnings and lower tax rates were long expected to beef up dividends under the new tax scheme enacted at the start of the year  The magnitude of Q1 dividend payments at U S  companies is showing signs of managements  confidence in the new tax system 
In Europe  excluding the UK  dividends grew 3 9  on an underlying basis  while Asia Pacific  which excludes Japan  was an underperformer with a 3 1  decline in payouts  In the UK  underlying payouts   Emerging markets saw enhanced payouts thanks mainly to  
Guidance for 2018
Janus Henderson projects global payouts to touch a record  in 2018  representing year on year growth of 6  in underlying terms  Though Australia gave a downbeat performance in Q1 due to s  the region should rebound on a full year basis  Janus Henderson is optimistic on emerging markets and Asia too 
A senior Index Analyst at S P Dow Jones Indices expects 2018 to see a  year over year uptick of dividend payouts  on the basis of the ongoing declared dividend rates for the S P 500   up from 2 3  at year end 2017 
Things are expected to pick up in Europe too  The second quarter is seasonally crucial and stockholders may see a much wider range of industries and European countries adding to global dividend payments in Q2 than Q1

172319,393835,STX,Is Seagate Technology  STX  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Seagate Technology plc   NASDAQ STX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Seagate Technology has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 9  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Seagate Technology s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 10 8  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Seagate Technology has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Seagate Technology s stock in the near term too     P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Seagate Technology has a P S ratio of about 1 6  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Seagate Technology currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes STX a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Seagate Technology is just 0 6  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 3  which is considerably better than the industry average of 16 4  Clearly  STX is a solid choice on the value front from

172320,393836,STX,5 Excellent GARP Stocks Based On Discounted PEG,opinion,In the course of strict screening to determine the intrinsic value of a company  investors often miss the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects  The same way  growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks If we keenly observe the investment track of the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha  Warren Buffett  we can see how  in quest of eliminating these hazards  this pure play value investor has gradually shifted to a mixed investment strategy or more precisely GARP  growth at a reasonable price  strategy This strategy combines both growth and value investing principles and has a proven track record of success  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  Here lies the importance of a not so popular fundamental metric  the price earnings growth  PEG  ratio  Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives the idea of stocks  which are trading at a discount  PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it  helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rates followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose  Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  or  2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 23 stocks that qualified the screening The

172321,393837,STX,Seagate Technology  STX  Up 5 6  Since Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Seagate Technology PLC   NASDAQ STX    Shares have added about 5 6  in that time frame 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is STX due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts 
Recent EarningsSeagate delivered impressive fiscal third quarter 2018 results  Non GAAP earnings per share came in at  1 46 per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 36 per share  surging 32 7  on a year over year basis  However  the figure declined 1 4  sequentially Revenues of  2 80 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 76 billion and also grew 4 8  from the year ago quarter but declined 3 6  sequentially Both the top and bottom lines witnessed year over year improvement  owing to robust adoption driven by strong demand of Seagate s storage drives  Moreover  increasing traction for mass storage solutions across company s edge and enterprise markets remained a tailwind Performance in DetailDuring the reported quarter  Seagate shipped 87 4 exabytes of hard disk drive  HDD  storage  with an average capacity of record 2 4 terabytes per drive The company shipped 43 8 exabytes for the enterprise HDD market  each with an average capacity of 4 8 terabytes Total HDD revenues went up 6 7  year over year to  2 59 billion during the quarter primarily due to advancement and accelerated growth of cloud storage technologies  Management believes that the HDD product suite is ready to cater to the demands of the market In the nearline market  the company shipped 41 3 exabytes of HDD  nearline products  average capacity per drive reached 6 5 terabytes  Management noted that the company s 10 terabyte helium nearline product was one of the top revenue generators in the quarter  Growth in the 12 terabyte helium nearline product line was also encouraging  Given the impressive customer feedback  Seagate anticipates capitalizing on the market adoption of these products Within the edge and customer verticals  the company witnessed year over year exabyte growth in all end markets  including PC compute  consumer  surveillance  gaming  and NAS markets Non HDD segment  cloud systems and silicon group  revenues declined 13 2  year over year but gained 1 9  sequentially to  217 million  Per management  year over year decrease was  primarily due to the planned end of life of some legacy OEM cloud systems products and the divestiture of high performance computing assets  Margin DetailsNon GAAP gross margin which came in at 30 8  declined 60 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis but expanded 40 bps sequentially Non GAAP operating expenses were down 13  on a year over year basis to  385 million  This decrease in expenses can be attributed to certain cost improvement initiatives undertaken since past two years Balance Sheet and Cash FlowSeagate ended the March quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  2 93 billion up from  2 56 billion in the quarter ending December  At the end of the quarter  the company had a long term debt  excluding current portion  of  4 34 billion compared with  5 02 billion in the previous quarter The company s board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of 63 cents for the March quarter to be paid on Jul 5  2018  Further  in the quarter  Seagate redeemed senior notes due November 2018 for  57 million Cash flow from operations was  558 million for the third quarter and was  1 65 billion for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018  Free cash flow for the quarter and first nine months of the fiscal came at  489 million and  1 4 billion  respectively GuidanceManagement anticipates fourth quarter revenues to grow approximately 17  on a year over year basis due to strong cloud demand and seasonality in other markets  However  the company projects revenues to remain flat sequentially  The company notifies that Exabyte demand is increasing on a year over year basis across most of the markets it caters Seagate projects gross margins to be flat on a sequentially basis and come within the company s long term range of 29 33   It projects to generate an operating cash flow of at least  500 million in the fourth quarter Seagate anticipates additional variable compensation for its employees in the fourth quarter  However  management believes that its ongoing cost management initiatives operational efficiency will enable the company to reduce non GAAP operating expenses by 1 2  from the prior quarter For fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to grow 4  and the company envisions generating an operating cash flow greater than  2 billion For second half of 2018  the company expects solid capacity demand  robust exabyte growth in its edge markets along with seasonal strength in other markets to boost the top line ConclusionWith the huge transformations in the storage industry  mobile cloud is taking the center stage  This in turn has bolstered the deployment of high capacity mass storage products which is beneficial for Seagate In January this year  Seagate entered into a long term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba  The agreement will help the company in its innovation of HDD  solid state drives  SSD  and hybrid solutions  consequently expanding its product portfolio The company is trying to focus less on the mission critical 15K and sub 1 terabyte client consumer markets  Management anticipates these markets to eventually converge with either silicon based memory or cloud storage  where it is already expanding footprint  Notably  as a percentage of total revenues  the products accounted for lesser than 8  Favorable macroeconomic environment and rising global investments in cloud will continue to work as key catalysts  Further  hints of PC market stabilization as reflected in the latest reports from Gartner and IDC are a positive The company s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording   HAMR   technology  which is expected be shipped in 2019  is yet another positive  This move will not only reinforce company s leadership in areal density but also boost nearline drive capacity points by at least 24 terabytes per drive

 By Supantha Mukherjee	
 BANGALORE  April 20  Reuters    Western Digital Corp 
posted lower third quarter results as higher sales of tablet
devices led to lower demand for its hard disk drive from PC
makers  and forecast fourth quarter adjusted profit below Wall
Street view 	
 Computer sales in the first quarter of 2011 fell for the
first time since 2009 as tablet devices attracted buyers in
droves and Japan focused on recovering from the earthquake and
tsunami  according to research firm Gartner 	
 The company forecast fourth quarter adjusted profit of 60 65
cents a share  on revenue of  2 2  2 25 billion 	
 Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 66 cents a
share  excluding items  on revenue of  2 24 billion  for the
fourth quarter  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 	
 Western Digital  which counts companies like Hewlett Packard
 and Dell Inc among its customers  said
hard drive shipments fell 4 percent sequentially to 50 million
units for the quarter ended April 1 	
  The weakness is in the consumer PC segment  not so much in
the commercial segment   Wedbush Securities analyst Kaushik Roy
said  	
  Also  it appears Western Digital has lost market share to
Seagate  	
 On Tuesday  rival Seagate Technology Plc posted a
third quarter profit below market expectations on lower
hard drive shipments   ID nL3E7FJ1PI     	
  The March quarter in the hard drive industry was impacted
by two significant developments  the delayed supply of industry
central processing units to PC makers and the tragic events in
Japan   Western Digital Chief Executive John Coyne said 	
 In February  shipments of Intel s new Sandy Bridge
processors were interrupted after a flaw was discovered in a
chipset used alongside them  Intel said the defect would mean
 300 million less in first quarter revenue   ID nN19291560     	
 However  after the March 11 Japan earthquake  the situation
began to change for Western Digital 	
 In the last couple of weeks of March  some of the PC vendors
scrambled fearing component shortages and pulled in more orders
and pushed up the prices  analyst Roy said 	
  While demand for hard drives in the quarter got off to a
slow start  it later picked up as availability of CPUs improved
and as fears took hold of component shortages related to the
events in Japan   CEO Coyne said in a statement 	
  The reported gross margins are better than what they had
thought about  Western Digital had guided 17 8 percent and it
came in at 18 2 percent   Roy said  	
 The company reported a third quarter profit fell to  146
million  or 62 cents a share  from  400 million  or  1 71 a
share  a year ago 	
 Revenue fell 15 percent to  2 25 billion 	
 Analysts on average had expected earnings of 66 cents a
share  excluding items  on revenue of  2 26 billion 	
 In March   Western Digital proposed to buy Hitachi Ltd s
 hard disk drive business to create a global leader with
the resources to develop costly next generation storage
technology   ID nL3E7E717G 	
 Shares of the Lake Forest  California based company fell
about 2 percent to  40 in trading after the bell  The stock

Free Cash Flow Supports Dividend Payments
Since 2014  NRCIB s quarterly dividend has increased from  0 36 share to  0 60 share  or 19  compounded annually  The consistent dividend payment  and growth  has been supported by NRCIB s strong free cash flow  Since 2013  NRCIB has generated a cumulative  62 million  18  of market cap  in FCF while paying  55 million in dividends 
Companies with strong free cash flow provide higher quality dividend yields because we know the firm has the cash to support its dividend  On the flip side  dividends from companies with low or negative free cash flow cannot be trusted as much because the company may not be able to sustain paying dividends 
NRCIB Remains Undervalued
At its current price of  50 share  NRCIB has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 7  this ratio means the market expects NRCIB s NOPAT to permanently decline by 30   This expectation seems rather pessimistic for a firm that has grown NOPAT 12  compounded annually over the past decade and 15  compounded annually since 1998 
If NRCIB can maintain 2017 NOPAT margins  19   and grow NOPAT by just 3  compounded annually for the next five years  the stock is worth  86 share today   a 72  upside

172390,393906,STX,UPDATE 2 Samsung eyes sale of hard disk drive unit   WSJ,news,"  Samsung eyes HDD unit sale for around  1 5 bln   WSJ
   Seagate may be a potential buyer   WSJ
   Samsung says reviewing various opportunities  no comment
on speculation
   Samsung shares down 1 pct in flat wider market

  Adds details  analysts comments 	
 SEOUL NEW YORK  April 18  Reuters    Samsung Electronics Co
 may be looking to sell its hard disk drive business
for  1 5 billion and Seagate Technology is one potential
buyer  the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday 	
 Samsung would use proceeds from the sale to invest in new 
higher growth areas  the newspaper reported citing a person
familiar with the situation 	
 While it would likely seek  1 5 billion  it might consider
selling the money losing division for  1 billion  according to
the report 	
  We are reviewing various business opportunities but we
don t comment on market speculation   a Samsung spokesman in
Seoul said  Seagate declined to comment on the report 	
 South Korea s Samsung is the world s top maker of memory
chips and flat screen  but it has struggled in the
hard disk drive  HDD  business  where it is one of the smallest
players in the market 	
 The industry is due to become even more competitive with
Western Digital Corp s plan to buy Hitachi Ltd s
 hard disk drive unit for  4 3 billion  a deal that
would create global leader with deep resources  ID nL3E7E717G 	
 Samsung s reported sales plan raises prospects for further
consolidation of the beleaguered industry  which is facing
declining sales growth and a longer term threat from wireless
devices such as Apple s iPad  which use faster  less
power hungry flash or solid state drives  SSD  	
 For Seagate  the world s largest maker of hard drives  the
deal will help it better compete with the enlarged rival 
Western Digital 	
 For Samsung  the potential sale would give the
world s largest technology firm by revenue more firepower for
acquisitions and expansion into new business areas such as
healthcare and green energy   	
 It would also help the company focus on the competing SSD
sector  which it dominates along with Intel Corp and
Micron Technology  	
 In February  Samsung Group said it would partner
with bio and pharmaceutical services firm Quintiles to create a
 264 million contract manufacturer that will produce treatments
for cancer and arthritis  just a few months after Samsung
Electronics acquired a majority stake in local medical equipment
firm Medison  ID nTOE71O01N   ID nTOE6BD01H 	
  HDD is not one of Samsung s core businesses  but it has
kept the operation in its semiconductor portfolio as there are
some technological synergies to be gained between HDD and SSD
businesses   said Seo Won seok  an analyst at NH Investment  
Securities 	
  On the flip side  the cost of keeping the business is now
outweighing the benefits due to weak profitability and its
relatively small market share  	
 Shares in Samsung  Asia s most valuable technology firm with
 a market value of  134 billion  were down 1 2 percent in a flat
wider market

172403,393919,STX,Are MDU And Seagate Technology Growth   Income Investments  ,opinion,"This week I discuss  MDU Resources Group  MDU   and Seagate Technology  STX  both of whom recently reported earnings where they beat top and bottom line expectations 
MDU Resources Group   NYSE MDU   provides value added natural resource products and related services that are essential to energy and transportation infrastructure  including regulated businesses  an exploration and production company and construction companies  MDU Resources includes regulated electric and natural gas utilities and regulated natural gas pipelines and energy services  natural gas and oil production  construction materials and contracting  and construction services 
MDU is not just a Utility company as more than half of their profits come from its construction segment   But the Utility side is doing very well as the electric and natural gas segment earned  17 8  more than the year ago quarter as the company sold more electric and gas during the quarter while increasing its customer base   2     Further  the company is expecting to purchase a wind farm in southwestern North Dakota in late 2018  further expanding its production and customer base   On the natural gas side  management expects its new 21 mile natural gas pipeline to be completed this year to attract new customers  
The construction segment  which consists of two divisions  construction services  and construction materials  both saw strong revenues and earnings in its most recent reported quarter   The continued economic growth in the U S  has been one of the big drivers behind the construction segments success   The segments performs infrastructure work for other utility companies  builds powerlines  electric substations  and underground natural gas pipelines   Moreover  the President s recent announcement of his 10 year trillion dollar infrastructure plan is viewed as a big positive going forward for MDU Resources   But even before this infrastructure boom hits  the company s construction services segment posted record revenues in 2017   1 37 billion  and saw earnings grow by  57 2    The record year was attributed to higher workloads  specialty contracting work in high tech manufacturing and retail areas  and equipment sales and rentals   The construction materials business saw earnings grow by  20 2  in 2017 due to increased total projects  and the entrance into new markets   Lastly  both segments saw significant increases in their backlog of projects  
Due to the strong backlogs of projects  and management guiding FY 2018 EPS in the high range of the previous consensus earnings which caused analyst estimates to improve from   1 29 to  1 38   Further  the company had recently increased its quarterly dividend payment by  2 6  for an annual dividend yield of  2 9  
Seagate Technology   NASDAQ STX   offers a portfolio of hard disc drives  solid state drives and solid state hybrid drives  It offers a range of disk drive products for the enterprise  client compute and client non compute market applications  The Company also provides data storage services for businesses  including online backup  data protection and recovery solutions 
The company recently reported earnings where they beat the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the second consecutive quarter   The company saw both earnings and revenues increase year over year   7 2   and  0 7  respectively  The big driver behind the recent beats has been the growth in the cloud segment   In the earnings report  management commented that they expect demand for drive capacity and applications to remain strong through 2018 
The company has also made two large investments recently  a  1 25 billion investment in Toshiba Memory  and another in Ripple   The Toshiba move is expected to drive NAND revenue  and help gain more of a market share in the hard disk drive segment   The Ripple move is an investment in the company s underlying blockchain use cases  and distributed ledger   This is expected to help Seagate s data storage  and data generation areas  
During the earnings report  management also guided next quarter s revenue estimates above expectations  and revealed that their free cash flow levels were the strongest since Q1 13   This news caused analyst s earnings estimates to increase for the next two quarters  and next two fiscal years as you can see in the table below 

To add to this positive news  the company also pays a large  4 91  annual dividend yield

Personal Consumption Expenditure in Ireland grew 1 9   which alleviates worries regarding subdued inflation  Consumer spending on goods rose 4 6  while industrial output jumped 8 9   However  growth was mainly driven by the all important ICT sector which marked a substantial  growth  Ireland has remarkably lowered its debt to GDP ratio from 89 4  in 2013 to just 66  in 2016 
Employment grew 3 1  year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017  This is just  jobs short of the all time employment high  The employment rate nudged up to 68 3  in the fourth quarter of 2017  up from 67 1  in the year ago quarter and was at the highest level since the second quarter of 2008 
With this  the country became the European Union s fastest growing economy for four successive years  Notably  the Eurozone growth rate was 2 3  last year  Several  are bullish on the Irish economy  thanks to solid jobs data  strong consumer spending and a pickup in global growth  read    
However  the CSO issued a warning that the headline rate was   and could not be relied upon as an accurate gauge of activity  Instead  it pointed to a 3 9 per cent increase in  modified  domestic demand  which strips out the impact of aircraft leasing and intellectual property imports  as a more reliable indicator  
Notably  gross national product  GNP   which eliminates cross border flows by multinationals  grew 6 6   Against this backdrop  a look at some top ranked Irish stocks makes sense

172441,393957,STX,Seagate  STX  Surpasses Q1 Earnings   Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Seagate Technology PLC   NASDAQ STX   reported impressive fiscal first quarter 2018 results  Non GAAP earnings per share came in at 96 cents  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents per share  However  the figure declined 3  on a year over year basis 
Revenues of  2 63 billion also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 56 billion but decreased 5 9  from the year ago quarter  Nevertheless  both the top and bottom line figures witnessed a sequential improvement  primarily attributed to strong demand and adoption of Seagate s storage drives 
At the end of the quarter  the company participated in a Bain Capital led consortium  The consortium has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation for the acquisition of Toshiba Memory Corporation  Seagate has committed  1 25 billion for the takeover  which is scheduled for March 2018 
This participation will enable Seagate to enter into an agreement with Toshiba  per which the latter will provide Seagate with NAND supply  thereby helping in its innovation of hard disk drives  HDD   solid state drives  SSD  and hybrid solutions 
Performance in Detail
During the quarter  Seagate shipped a record 70 3 exabytes of HDD storage  with an average capacity of 1 9 terabytes per drive  The company shipped 27 2 exabytes for the enterprise HDD market  each with an average capacity of 3 9 terabytes 
Notably  the advancement and accelerated growth of cloud storage technologies are tailwinds for Seagate s performance  Management believes that the HDD product suite is ready to cater to the demands of the market 
Nearline products  average capacity per drive crossed 5 4 terabytes  Management noted that the company s 10 terabyte helium nearline product was one of the top revenue generators in the quarter  Around 1 million units were shipped  which was thrice as much as in the previous quarter  Growth in the 12 terabyte helium nearline product line was also encouraging  Given the impressive customer feedback  the company expects to bank on the market adoption of these products 
Within the edge and customer verticals  the notebook compute segment saw 37  year over year growth with exabytes increasing 75  from the year ago quarter  Gaming business revenues were up 13  sequentially 
Non HDD segment revenues witnessed a 17  year on year increase and a 30  improvement sequentially to  242 million Seagate Technology PLC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Margin Details
Non GAAP gross margin was 29   Non GAAP operating expenses were down 17  on a year over year basis to  408 million  This decrease in expenses was primarily due to certain cost improvement initiatives 
The company divested a major portion of its high performance computing assets  which is anticipated to result in a savings of approximately 20 million a year 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
Seagate ended the September quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  2 3 billion and 289 million ordinary shares outstanding  The company s board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of 63 cents for the September quarter to be paid on Jan 3  2018 
During the quarter  cash flow from operations was  237 million and free cash flow was  113 million 
Guidance
Management anticipates  in an era of advancement of cloud solutions and growing cloud and silicon storage business segments  second quarter revenues to increase 3  to 5  compared to the first quarter  backed by a strong growth in exabyte demand 
Non GAAP operating expenses are expected to decrease 2  to 3  from the prior quarter with further cost stringent approaches 
Conclusion
Notably  with the huge transformations in the storage industry mobile cloud is taking the center stage  This in turn has boosted the deployment of high capacity mass storage products  which is beneficial for Seagate 
The company s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording  HAMR  technology  which is expected be shipped in 2019  is yet another positive for the company

172446,393962,STX,What s In Store For Western Digital s  WDC  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Western Digital Corp    NASDAQ WDC   is scheduled to release fiscal first quarter 2018 results on Oct 26  Notably  the company has a decent record of earnings surprises with an average positive surprise of 9 55  in the trailing four quarters  Last quarter  the company came up with a positive surprise of 3 53  
In fiscal fourth quarter 2017  the company reported non GAAP earnings of  2 93 per share compared with  1 03 reported in the year ago quarter  Revenues increased 38 5  year over year to  4 84 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 80 billion  Both the top and bottom line figures were better than the guided range 
Let s take a look at the factors that are expected to influence the first quarter 2018 earnings 
Key Growth Drivers
We believe Western Digital will benefit from positive synergies derived from the SanDisk acquisition  The latter s product portfolio is aiding the company s expansion in the solid state drive  SSD  market  This is also anticipated to provide Western Digital with a competitive advantage against peers like Seagate Technology   NASDAQ STX   
Further  the continuous enhancement of the company s product suite is a positive  The development of the industry s first 3D NAND technology with 96 layers of storage capability in June was significant  The company s growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is a major tailwind Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

   Notably  the company completed the acquisition of   an app based cloud storage startup during the quarter  The company also entered into a definitive agreement to buy  Systems  a provider of flash driven storage arrays for database  We believe these acquisitions will help the company in expanding its presence with a wider range of products and solutions 
However  the ongoing legal tussle with Toshiba regarding the memory unit in Japan remains a concern  Nevertheless  strong demand for NAND flash memory chips is anticipated to be a key catalyst 
Guidance   Estimates
For fiscal first quarter 2018  revenues are expected to be approximately  5 10 billion  which is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 12 billion 
Management expects non GAAP earnings to be in the range of  3 25  3 35 per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 30 per share is in line with the mid point of the guided range 
Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  non computable unit shipments are anticipated to amount to  16 7 million  while the computable unit shipments are projected to total  19 million 
Zacks Rank and Key Picks
Western Digital currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials  Inc    NASDAQ AMAT   and NVIDIA Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA    both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

172583,394099,STX,Use Relative Price Strength To Land Up On 5 Winning Stocks,opinion,Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average If the stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 4 Stocks with High Earnings Yield to Power Your Portfolio 

	Price to earnings  P E  ratio is often used by investors to pick undervalued stocks  However  it is difficult to use the P E ratio to compare stocks with fixed income securities  This is where the inverse strategy   Earnings Yield   comes handy 

	Earnings yield is calculated as  Annual Earnings per Share Market Price  x 100  While comparing similar stocks  the one with the higher earnings yield has the potential to provide comparatively greater returns 

	This metric is often used to compare the performance of a market index with the 10 year Treasury yield as well  For instance  if the yield of the market index is more than the 10 year Treasury  stocks can be considered as undervalued in comparison to bonds  In such a case  investing in the stock market would be a better option for a value investor 

	However  you need to keep in mind that T bills are safe bets while stock investments always have an element of risk  Hence  it would be prudent to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing it with the earnings yield of a stock or the overall market 

The Winning Strategy

	We have set Earnings Yield greater than 10  as our primary screening criterion  but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns  So  we have added the following parameters to the screen 

Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S P 500  This metric compares the 12 month forward EPS estimate with the 12 month actual EPS 

Average Daily Volume  20 Day  greater than or equal to 100 000   High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity 

Current Price greater than or equal to  5 

Buy Rated Stocks   Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment 

	Here are four of the 13 stocks that made it through the screen

Bulls Know You Save Files  They Buy Storage Shares

	The Computer Storage Device industry is red hot  according to the latest Zacks Industry Ranks 

	This 11 company strong group scored a  29 out of 265 rank  up  18 spots in recent weeks  Covering analysts granted 13 EPS upgrades and just 2 downgrades  The average size of EPS revisions was  13  

	Bulls have a compelling long term growth case  Underlying EPS fundamentals for consistent computer storage growth remain excellent  Information storage needs have doubled roughly every 3 years  A study in Science estimated the world s technological capacity to store information in analog and digital devices grew from less than 3  optimally compressed  exabytes in 1986  to 295  optimally compressed  exabytes in 2007 

	Imagine where that is now  and where it is going 

	In 2014  IDC said that the amount of data would grow to 2 16 zettabytes worldwide  By 2016  it will have grown to 3 77 zettabytes 

	Moving from exabytes to zettabytes   you ve got to love this exotic language  As remarkable as we are at creating data  storage technology has kept up 

	Data storage is the fastest growing semiconductor technology  Tape storage  hard disk drives and solid state storage have doubled about every 12 to 18 months 

	According to Techopedia  storage devices form one of the core components in any computing device  Computer Storage Devices store virtually all the data and applications on a computer  except hardware firmware 

	Two types of Computer Storage Devices exist 

	1  Primary Storage Devices Generally smaller in size  these are designed to hold data temporarily and are internal to the computer  They have the fastest data access speed  and include RAM and cache memory 

	2  Secondary Storage Devices These usually have large storage capacity  and they store data permanently  They can be both internal and external to the computer  and they include the hard disk  compact disk drive and USB storage device 

	I list the top 3 Zacks Ranked Computer Storage Device companies  in order of market capitalization  large cap first  mid cap next  and small cap last

term Further  Western Digital s entry into the wireless devices market comes at a time when storage services related to smartphones and tablets are witnessing large scale adoption  These factors are anticipated to be growth catalysts  going forward Further  the SanDisk acquisition will open growth avenues for Western Digital and help it to gain market traction in advanced storage technology and

STX opened trading yesterday at  24 14 which was up from the previous days trading of  24 01  STX closed trading yesterday at  24 09 and spiked up after market to  27 05  equivalent to a 12  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time STX traded above these levels was on April 27th when it traded at  27 34  Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that STX has been on an overall upward trend dating back to May 12th when it traded at its 52 week low price of  18 42  STX has a float of 294 98 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Monday  For trading purposes  I would like to see STX open trading on Tuesday above  26 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 25 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

172765,394281,STX,Is Seagate  STX  In Trouble This Quarter ,opinion,"Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  Information Technology   Computers   Peripherals   Reports April 29  Before Market Opens
Key Takeaways
The Estimize community is calling for EPS of  0 54 on  2 66 billion in revenue  14 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  60 million on top
Weakness in the PC industry has put pressure on hard disk and solid state drive sales
Seagate s propensity to cut costs while still offering a generous dividend yield should appease investors until it turns itself around
The recent volatility in the PC industry has proven to be quite detrimental for Seagate Technologies  Seagate  along with Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC   is the industry leader in hard drive and data storage solutions for personal computers  As the market views hard drives as a distant memory  the stock has slipped 53 1  in the past 12 months  Unfortunately  earnings have tracked this trend  and despite a slight beat last quarter  earnings have plunged from highs of  1 34 at the start of fiscal 2015  
Since its last report  Seagate is seeing unfavorable revisions activity  with per share estimates cut 24  in the past 3 months  Consequently  the Estimize community is calling for EPS of  0 54 on  2 66 billion in revenue  14 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  60 million on top  Compared to a year earlier  profits are predicted to decline 46  while sales could fall as much as 20   On average  the stock does well leading up and through earnings seasons  Shares maintain a 3  gain 30 days ahead of earnings through 30 days following earnings  with small ups and downs in between  As PC sales continue to wane  Seagate has witnessed meager growth in its core hard disk and solid state drives  Physical data storage solutions are slowly being phased out in favor of cloud storage  As a result  Seagate and its peers have had to discount traditional storage units  placing pressure on earnings and margins  Thankfully  cloud storage requires data centers with massive hard drives to store its information  This should partially offset the losses Seagate is seeing in its other retail storage units  However  given Seagate s propensity to cut costs and provide substantial dividend yields  it won t be long before investors benefit from this stock ",2016-04-29,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-seagate-in-trouble-this-quarter-200126816,200126816
172766,394282,STX,What Falling Estimates   Price Mean For Seagate  STX  ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Seagate Technology plc   NASDAQ STX    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  further confirms weakness in STX A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen 10 estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared to no upward revision  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from  2 77 per share a month ago to its current level of  2 31 per share Also  for the current quarter  Seagate has seen 8 downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to 57 cents a share from 77 cents over the past 30 days    The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 36 8  in the past month So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Computer Storage Devices industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Qumu Corporation   NASDAQ QUMU    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be better selection at this time Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ,2016-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-falling-estimates---price-mean-for-seagate-(stx)-200127274,200127274
172767,394283,STX,Western Digital Closes SanDisk Buyout  Good Deal ,opinion,"Last week Western Digital Corp    NASDAQ WDC   completed the acquisition of SanDisk Corp  NASDAQ SNDK   The two companies had entered into a definitive agreement on Oct 21  2015  Per the agreement  Western Digital had to pay  86 50 per share for acquiring all the outstanding shares of SanDisk  The total transaction value comes to  19 billion 
However  Western Digital and SanDisk made a few changes to the deal price on Feb 23  Per the new agreement  Western Digital paid  78 50 in cash and 0 24 in stock for every SanDisk share  totaling  15 78 billion 
Western Digital also closed its earlier announced secured and unsecured notes offerings related to this merger  The net proceeds  totaling  5 225 billion   which had been earlier deposited into an escrow account  are now out from escrow and available to Western Digital  The proceeds were used to fund the SanDisk merger  refinance its indebtedness and that of SanDisk  and pay the related fees and expenses  This move is expected to lend flexibility to the company s balance sheet position  going forward 
Synergies from the Acquisition
SanDisk is the largest supplier of NAND flash storage cards for data storage in a compact removable format  These are used in digital cameras  multimedia cellular phones  USB flash drives  gaming devices  laptop computers  personal computers  audio players and video players 
On the other hand  Western Digital derives the bulk of its revenues from the sale of hard disk drives  HDDs   mainly used by PC manufacturers  The company is the largest U S  manufacturer of HDDs with 44  market share  closely followed by Seagate Technologies    NASDAQ STX   40   However  the persistent decline in PC sales has been hurting Western Digital s HDD shipments over the past several quarters  which in turn dented revenues 
Therefore  the world s leading HDD manufacturer is trying to lower its dependency on PC storage and focus on the rapidly growing flash and cloud storage businesses to boost its top line 
The acquisition of SanDisk will open newer growth avenues for Western Digital and help in capturing market traction in the newer storage technology  Solid State Drive  SSD  segment  The merger will lead to economies of scale  lower costs  increase market reach and improve product breadth  among other things  The company will also be able to offer competitive solutions in cloud based computing  which has taken the digital storage solution space by storm over the past couple of years 
Last Words
The acquisition is a reflection of Western Digital s commitment to launch a string of storage devices under the mobile and cloud segment and add value for its customers 
Going forward  we believe that strategic acquisitions to expand its offerings in the SSD segment should position Western Digital better than peers like Seagate Technologies and EMC Corporation   NYSE EMC  
Currently  Western Digital has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Besides Western Digital  investors may consider TiVo Inc    NASDAQ TIVO     another Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ",2016-05-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/western-digital-closes-sandisk-buyout:-good-deal-200130226,200130226

Economic reports due out  all times are eastern   Consumer Credit  3 
Technical Outlook  SPX  
One of the more detrimental days in the stock market over the past year took place on Friday  particularly in the Nasdaq which plunged 2 6  and made new lower lows  
10 day and 20 day moving averages on SPX were breached on Friday  
More importantly the resistance level at 1873 that the bulls fought hard to break through was lost yet again  
Overall  Friday saw  a 32 point drop from its high print of the day to the closing price  
Above average volume  but the VIX only bounced 4  to 13 96 which is a bit strange to me  I would ve expected a much strong pop in the VIX for the kind of sell off that was seen  
Heading into the new week stocks are definitely tilting bearish  However  like what we ve seen over the past five years  this market proven to be plenty resilient  Respect that  
The biggest technical support level is the strength SPX found from the trend line that started off of the August  13 lows  
The Market doesn t care about the economy nor earnings  That is not what is driving them  The markets only care about what the Fed is doing to keep equities propped up  
My Opinions And Trades 
Sold Axiall Corporation  AXLL K  on Friday at  48 34 for a 6 5  gain  
Sold Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  on Friday at  56 27 for a 0 1  gain

172827,394343,STX,Trader s Hedge  Approach Market With Caution,opinion,I hope all of you have a Valentine and already know what love is on a personal level  At 48  I am still searching but  can t stop now  I ve traveled so far  to change this lonely life   And that is all the mush allowed in this article about stocks   There is a good lesson to be shared here about investment  No good comes from expressing love when it comes to successful investing because  if you do  there will only be  heartache and pain   Investors have to analyze and reanalyze the reason to be in or out of a position almost daily  and yet  never fall in love with the company   This mountain I must climb  of not falling in love with any stock should be one of your top investing rules  The best advice I can give any investor is  gotta read between the lines  and leave love for your personal life   I am more cautious on the overall market than I was last fall  October 9  2012  when we began adding long positions to participate in the expected fall rally  January 2013 delivered several new highs on major indexes  and February has mostly been flat ahead of the March 1 deadline for sequestration  The bulls are clearly in charge of the market right now  but that is always subject to change without notice  The looming debate on sequestration could impact US GDP growth enough to make me cautious on that item alone  Of course  there are many other concerns to consider as well  Europe has presented some new printing opportunities for America and continues to be a concern on the global front  Suffice to say that the preponderance of evidence  which I refer to often  are tilted in the favor of caution right now  and therefore  I am recommending caution in the short term   As always  we should now turn our attention to the DHTH portfolio and evaluate what to do with the portfolio  Cooper Tire and Rubber Co   CTB  was added on October 9  2012 and will quietly exit on February 15  2013 with a  23 1  return  CTB did pretty much exactly what we hoped for when acquiring the stock at  19 13  Recall that we recommended acquiring   the desired shares and at the same time sell the Feb 13  20 call and put    3 55   CTB is trading today at  26 05 so the   shares will be called away at  20 and the put will expire  We also picked up a   10 dividend on November 29  2012  I still like CTB and if the market corrects will continue to review for re entry   I would like to add a yield stock and a short hedge given my cautionary view on the overall market  I have recommended Seagate Technology  STX  twice in 2012  We took positions on January 27  2012   14   and June 6  2012   26   using stock and options  This time around  I prefer to simply buy to own STX for the yield and potential gains in price appreciation   Seagate Technology designs  manufactures  markets  and sells hard disk drives for enterprise storage  client compute  and client non compute market applications worldwide  The company s products are used in enterprise servers  mainframes  and workstations  desktop and notebook computers  and digital video recorders  gaming consoles  personal data backup systems  portable external storage systems  and digital media systems  It also provides data storage services  including online backup  data protection  and recovery solutions for small and medium sized businesses  Seagate is a leader in the hard drive industry   Reason for Selection  STX can still be picked up for a great price with great earnings growth  STX is projected to grow EPS from  5 18 to  5 49 in 2013  6  EPS growth all for 5 times earnings  And that growth is built on not only recent upward analyst projections but also on a 4 4  yearly dividend yield  As we have discussed before  the levered free cash flow for STX is  2 55B   I believe it is prudent to add a short  hedge  position at this time  Avis Budget Group  Inc   CAR  is one of the stocks that appears overbought to me at  24 30  CAR has nearly doubled since May 2012 with levered free cash flow of   1 15B  The Sabrient Earnings Quality Rank on a 1 99 basis is 2  In layman terms this means that investors are paying 15x on earnings that have serious concerns about the sustainability and quality of the earnings being reported  Quite predictably  insiders have been lining up at the sale door in 2013  CAR insider activity   CAR provided us the golden opportunity to open a short position today by announcing a narrowing of their loss  driving the stock up  5 38  today  This has set the stage for the perfect storm  CAR is overbought technically  using Wilder s RSI 14   insiders are rushing to sell in mass  earnings quality and cash flow are very poor but someone is pushing the stock higher   Again  I hope everyone knows what love is personally and has a wonderful Valentine s Day  Remember not to fall in love with any investment or stock position  When it comes to stocks  Got to read between the lines  in case I need it when I m older   Trust me when I say that we will need the money when we re older   Recommendations   Buy to open STX at the market  Sell to open CAR at the market  Allow CTB to expire and enjoy the gain,2013-02-14,David Brown,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trader's-hedge:-approach-market-with-caution-155416,155416
172830,394346,STX,Market Trying To Go Higher,opinion,After a bullish performance last week  the market began the day a little off but managed to fight its way into increases across the major indices with S P 500 closing at 1556  just 9 points shy of its record closing high in 2007  The Nasdaq was also up  but still well off its 2000 high  Slight concerns over the possibility of rising interest rates drove more money from bond funds to the equity markets  That trend is likely to continue for some time as interest rates are likely to continue to inch higher fueled by steadily better economic releases  albeit slower than the administration might wish Financials  Health Care  Technology and Basic Materials continued as the leading sectors  This week s economic releases are sparse with the Treasury budget due tomorrow  Retail Sales on Wednesday along with Pricing Data and Business Inventories  No real concerns there  Initial Jobless Claims are expected to continue at current levels on Thursday  and the week ends with Industrial Production and the first glance at this month s Michigan Sentiment on Friday  The latter two are each expected to be better than last month Rumors continue that Congress and the Administration are slowly getting closer to agreements on key sequestration issues  If so  it is likely that the flow of funds from bonds to equities will fuel higher equity markets especially with valuations at moderate levels and corporate cash at all time highs 4 Stock Ideas for this Market This week I selected four highly ranked stocks from our universe  MPC  Marathon Petroleum Corp Trading at 8x current and forward earningsOver half of analysts covering have revised estimates upward3  projected EPS growth in 2013  and 9  over the next five yearsCTB  Cooper Tire   Rubber Co  Trading at 7 5x current earnings and 7x forward earningsAnalysts covering the stock are undecided on the current quarter  but overwhelming bullish on the following quarters and year  as they have revised EPS estimates upward in last 30 days105  projected EPS for current quarter and 30 7  next quarterGNW  Genworth Financial Inc  Trading for 16x current earnings  and 7x forward earningsOur top stock for the 2013 calendar yearUp over 6  today on a credit rating upgrade40  projected EPS growth rate for 2013STX  Seagate Technology 4 7  Dividend yieldTrading for 4x current earnings  and 6x forward earningsNot expected to deliver spectacular earnings growth  but it is solid  financially sound  well run company with excellent free cash flow,2013-03-12,David Brown,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-trying-to-go-higher-158556,158556
172854,394370,STX,Seagate Stock Analysis Before Earnings  OCZ Speculation,opinion,Rumors say that Seagate  STX  might provide a surprise with today s Q4 2012 earnings report by announcing the acquisition of OCZ  Speculation about Seagate matching with OCZ has been around for quite few weeks and there is no better time to surprise the market other than the earnings season  Seagate consensus EPS of the 4th fiscal quarter is the highest ever predicted by analysts at  2 51  Seagate beat the estimates 3 months ago regarding the Q3 2012 earnings report  when they reported  2 64 earnings per share compared to  2 11 estimate  The rumors of OZC acquisition has also boosted OCZ stock price but I m much more interested in the Fibonacci retracement of STX stock found at the monthly chart Technical Analysis  Seagate StockSeagate stock price has confirmed the 61 8  Fibonacci retracement level in 2010 and 2011 and the breakout above the resistance level of  21 was another proof of the long term uptrend that is developing  Thailand floods have affected many stocks of companies manufacturing hard disks in 2011  The past weeks though many of those companies reported their latest financial data and their shares skyrocketed  like the 30  surge of Western Digital  OCZ stock also printed new 3 month highs on Friday  although that was due to the acquisition speculation  OCZ earnings report back on July 10th wasn t exactly the ideal one Going back to the Seagate monthly stock chart  we see that there was another hidden support level confirmation that is again a Fibonacci retracement level  only this time it was the 38 2  level  Some traders including me would consider that an acceleration of the established trend  The breakout above  32 and the gap fill are both signals that favor the resume of the uptrend The retracement is even more pronounced on the weekly chart STX Stock Trading On Earnings DayThis is going to be interesting  Increased popularity will probably lead to more than average volume and important news will provide the necessary volatility for day trading  And it s not just news about earnings  as investors of OCZ and Seagate companies will be sitting on their seats  end  I suppose Seagate news will be all over the internet during the day  no matter the report  Yet  if Seagate reports better than expected results  I strongly believe STX stock price will soar much like Western Digital Disclosure  No positions at time of writing ,2012-07-30,Jim Makos,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/seagate-stock-analysis-before-earnings,-ocz-speculation-131324",131324

Western Digital  WDC  is highly undervalued at anything below  70 share as this company stands to benefit more from cloud computing than it will suffer Not since the United States developed a national power grid for the delivery of electricity have we seen a movement as impactful to our daily lives as cloud computing may be  The national power grid effectively opened access to electricity to the entire country  And since that time have we seen a decline in the amount of electricity consumed or the number of devices that consume electricity  Not at all  In retrospect  the national power grid removed the bottleneck of proximity to the use of electricity as it allowed people and businesses most anywhere to access electricity in almost unlimited amounts Cloud computing does the same for the storage and analysis of data as the power grid did for electricity As my great friend Brad Little of Capgemini explains  we should look at cloud computing services like a public utility for the cheap provision of storage and computing capacity  His analogy to the power grid resonates well as he explains the enormous benefits of the scale of centralizing cloud computing services First  the speed and cheapness of getting data storage and computing capacity from the major cloud providers makes building one s own impractical  Armed with a credit card and a few minutes  businesses can add unheard of levels of data storage and computing capacity  That beats the pants off the time and resources required to procure  build out and manage one s own data center The biggest myth about cloud providers is the lack of security compared to managing one s own data  That s like saying that Wal Mart  WMT  has worse security in its stores than most have in their homes  In reality  the cloud providers have the best  most cutting edge security because the scale of their operations allows them to  1  afford the best security   2  gain more experience and expertise with security issues and  3  make security a major priority because it is core to their business In other words  cloud providers can offer businesses more security than they can afford on their own Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsSo  what does this mean for Western Digital s business  It means that cloud services will unlock currently unforeseen demand for data storage and computing  By making the storage so cheap and the computing speeds so fast while also providing best in market security  cloud services open a brave new world in data and analytics Currently  most businesses have more data than they know what to do with  Most businesses are only scratching the surface of the analytical potential of all the data that enterprise software solutions like SAP AG  SAP  provide  The more businesses learn how to use their data  the more analytics they will apply  the results of which produce more data  which  in turn  will be analyzed  And the cycle continues That means the demand for storage and computing capacity will grow  not decline  in the future  And WDC is well positioned to benefit from that growth  With a top quintile return on invested capital  ROIC  in 2012 at 40   WDC is one of the most profitable businesses in its industry  Only Seagate  STX  at 44 5  and Synaptics  SYNA  at 42  have higher ROICs  A high ROIC means that WDC is positioned to turn growth into profits at a high rate  It also means the business is managed intelligently  has an impressive ability to innovate and a focus on shareholder value creation  From an operational perspective  it is hard to ask for much more ValuationThe valuation of WDC is also compelling First  I want to point out that putting data and computing power in the cloud does not obviate the need for storage and computing capacity  It only moves it from a fragmented customer base to a more concentrated customer base  namely the cloud service providers Concentration of the customer base is going to hurt WDC s margins  no doubt  as large scale buyers demand lower prices than smaller scale buyers such as consumers or small businesses Consequently  I do not expect WDC s ROIC to remain at 40   but neither does stock price  Indeed  WDC s current valuation    34  share  implies its ROIC will drop from 40  to 12  and never rise from that level  In terms of after tax cash flows  NOPAT   the current stock price implies they will permanently decline by 70   Essentially  the market price suggests that WDC will just about go out of business Market expectations are unduly pessimistic  The stock is too cheap Figure 2 plots a comparison of the WDC stock to its economic book value  EBV   which is currently  105 share  The current EBV is the value of the stock if its NOPAT never grows beyond its 2012 level  I d say that is a rather health margin of safety Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsWDC gets my  Attractive  rating because of its rising profitability and cheap valuation  The risk reward of this stock is also compelling because of its 2 2  dividend Relevant ETFs And Mutual FundsMy regular readers know that I also cover 400  ETFs and 7000  mutual funds  and I like to point out the ETFs and mutual funds that allocate most to the stocks I recommend to buy or sell For WDC  there are only two mutual funds  and zero ETFs  that allocate significantly to WDC and get an Attractive or better rating   1  Aston Funds  ASTON Cornerstone Large Cap Value Fund  AVIX  and  RVALX  and  2  Oak Associates Funds  Red Oak Technology Select Fund  ROGSX   This finding is a bit unfortunate given the attractiveness of this stock and the Technology Sector s  per my  report  You can  here Disclosure  I own WDC  STX and SYNA  I receive no compensation to write about any specific stock or theme ,2012-12-04,David

challenges presented by managing inventory  orders and planning are similar across many industries which makes its solutions applicable to a wide array of industry verticals  EOPN intends to leverage its experience  expertise and proven customer success within current key verticals to accelerate entry into and delivery of solutions to new vertical markets CUSTOMERSEOPON s customer base includes companies that represent seven of the top ten supply chains in the world  according to Gartner  Inc   and spans several industries including many large multinational companies such as Boeing  Cisco  Dell  the Gap  GE  Flextronics  IBM  Lab126  part of the Amazon com  Inc  group of companies   Motorola and Vodafone  To date  target markets have been Technology  Telecommunications  Aerospace and Defense  and Consumer Products As of May 31  2012  EOPN had 248 customers  of which 58 were Enterprise Customers  For fiscal 2012  Enterprise Customers represented 99 3  of total revenue  During fiscal 2012  the average annual billing for Enterprise Customers was  1 1 million  Customers represent a wide range of industries and include many of the Fortune 500  among them seven of the top ten

CUSTOMER RETENTIONDuring the year ended February 29  2012  EOPN retained 97 7  of its Enterprise Customers and the total dollars billed to these customers was over 100  of the dollars billed to the same customers for the prior year  This reflects EOPN s ability to both retain and increase the revenue generated from existing customers  EOPN believes it has yet to significantly penetrate its customer base and has a significant opportunity to up sell additional solutions to existing customers  CUSTOMER AGREEMENTSEOPN s agreements with customers are typically three years in length with annual billings in advance  The annual contract value for each customer agreement is largely related to the size of the customer  the number of solutions the customer has purchased  the number of the customer s unique registered users  and the maturity of EOPN s relationship with the customer  The average annual contract value can therefore fluctuate period to period depending upon the size of new customers and the pace at which EOPN up sells additional solutions and services to existing customers  New and up sell customer agreements can create significant variability in the aggregate annual contract value of agreements signed in any given fiscal quarter INTERNATIONALEOPN is headquartered in Foster City  California and continues to expand operations internationally  EOPN currently generates a portion of our revenue outside the United States  including through offices in the United Kingdom  Germany  China  Malaysia and Taiwan  For fiscal 2010  fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012  the percentage of revenue generated from customers outside the United States was 22 9   36 9  and 38 2   respectively  As part of the growth strategy  EOPN expects the percentage of revenue generated outside of the United States to continue to increase In 2011  EOPN grew its sales team in Europe  and intends to hire additional sales personnel in Germany  France and the Nordic countries  In fiscal 2012  EOPN opened an office and established a direct sales force and a sales  hosting and distribution alliance with a local partner in China  LONG SALES CYCLEEOPN s products have lengthy sales cycles  which typically extend from four to 12 months and may in some instances take longer than one year  Sources of Revenue  p47INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYAs of May 31  2012  EOPN had eight U S  and one foreign issued patents and had one U S  patent application pending  COMPETITIONEOPN faces competition from the following types of companies ERP vendors  Companies such as Infor  Oracle and SAP offer ERP extension solutions that provide features similar to a limited subset of EOPN s offerings in the area of trading partner portals  These companies may include those solutions as part of their larger ERP or business application offerings  As each trading partner is likely to have some form of existing ERP system  EOPN is are able to providea common platform tying these disparate systems together as a business network  EOPN s solutions generally do not replace the current functionality of existing ERP systems and therefore tend not to undermine customers  investments in their existing business applications EOPN s customers have found that its solutions extend and enhance the value of their existing ERP systems by adding integration  multi enterprise processes  and real time collaboration capabilities  Therefore  EOPN does not believe traditional ERP vendors view EOPN s solutions as a competitive alternative to their own offerings Multi enterprise B2B infrastructure vendors  Companies like GXS Corporation  IBM Sterling Commerce and SPS Commerce provide point solutions in the B2B integration space  EOPN does not view these offerings as competitive with EOPN s solutions  Niche applications vendors  Companies like JDA Software Group  Inc  have specialized functionality for specific process areas such as transportation management  demand planning or network design  Niche applications may provide important functionality for enterprises  but they typically are not built for multi enterprise process management or a multi tier environment Internally developed solutions  Potential customers with large in house IT departments are capable of developing applications customized for their businesses and many have  Typically  these applications lack complete functionality
