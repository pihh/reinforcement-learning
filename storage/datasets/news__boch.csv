6156,227671,BOCH,LendingClub  LC  Stock Tanks 17 4  On Lower Q4 Guidance,opinion,Shares of LendingClub Corporation   NYSE LC   plunged 17 4  since its Investors Day conference last week  Investors turned bearish as the company lowered its fourth quarter 2017 outlook within a month What s the New Q4 Guidance   Why was it Lowered LendingClub provided the details related to its new outlook in the Investors Day presentation  The company now expects fourth quarter 2017 revenues  GAAP net income and adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  EBITDA  to be nearly  3 million lower than what it guided in November LendingClub now projects net revenues to be in the range of  155  160 million  down from previous outlook of  158  163 million  Additionally  adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net loss are expected to be in the range of  16  20 million  lower from  19  23 million  and  10  6 million  wider than prior loss estimate of  7  3 million   respectively Further  LendingClub s 2017 revenues are projected to be approximately in the  573  578 million range and adjusted EBITDA between  42 million and  46 million  Notably  the company is expected to report a net loss of  72  68 on GAAP basis The main reason for reduced fourth quarter outlook is related to the  timing impact  of holding residual from the company s recent securitization deal  While securitizations help LendingClub in originating more loans and thus earn additional origination and servicing fees  they expose the company to more risk as it has to retain part of securitization deals on the balance sheet 2018 OutlookLendingClub s 2018 guidance includes  25 million operating expenses related to investments in automotive refinancing platform and technology upgrades while not taking into consideration any legal costs Further  LendingClub s 2018 revenues are projected to be approximately in the  680 705 million range  up 18 22  year over year   This shows that the company is on track for its long term revenue target of 15 20  rise year over year Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between  42 million and  46 million  rising 87 5  at the mid point   Notably  LendingClub is expected to report a net loss of  53  38 on GAAP basis  reflecting a year over year improvement Road Ahead Expected to be BumpyLendingClub grew rapidly in the last few years  But the company s asset quality deteriorated as high risk borrowers defaulted  This  in turn  led to some of the investors moving away from the company Nonetheless  LendingClub tightened its underwriting methods earlier this year  Therefore  the company was now expected to meet its financial targets  So  this reduced outlook made the investors apprehensive LendingClub s shares have plunged 33 1  so far this year against  s growth of 17 8  Currently  LendingClub carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Stocks Worth ConsideringSome stocks in the finance space worth a look include Moody s Corporation   NYSE MCO    FS Bancorp   NASDAQ FSBW   and Bank of Commerce Holdings   NASDAQ BOCH   Moody s has witnessed a positive earnings estimate revision of 5  for the current year over the last 60 days  Its share price has rallied 30  in the past six months  The company sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  FS Bancorp has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 2 4  upward over the last 60 days  The company s share price has increased 27 3  in the past six months  The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 2 Bank of Commerce has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 9 5  for the current year over the last 60 days  Its share price has risen 7 8  in the past six months  The company is a Zacks  2 Ranked player Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2017-12-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lendingclub-lc-stock-tanks-174-on-lower-q4-guidance-200272187,200272187
6157,227672,BOCH,Should Value Investors Pick Bank Of Commerce  BOCH  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Bank of Commerce Holdings   NASDAQ BOCH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Bank of Commerce has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 2  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Bank of Commerce s current PE ratio considerably above its midpoint  which is 12 2  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Bank of Commerce has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Bank of Commerce s stock in the near term too   P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Bank of Commerce s P CF ratio of 13 6 is slightly lower than the industry average of 15 9  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Bank of Commerce currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BOCH a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Bank of Commerce might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of D  This gives BOCH a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has climbed nearly 18 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen about 9 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Bank of Commerce Holdings  CA  Price and Consensus    This favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBank of Commerce is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a decent industry rank  top 43  out of more than 250 industries  and a strong Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  However  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite positive estimate revision activity  investors should wait for industry trends to turn around first   When it does  this stock could be a compelling value pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020

6169,227684,BOCH,Snap The Market Slumber With These 5 Winning Financial Picks,opinion,Fresh rhetoric on North Korea ruined market gains on Tuesday as the Dow s record run of wins finally came to a close  Despite the day s gyrations between loss and advances  trading retained a muted tone  with the S P 500 losing only 0 2  to end near session lows Such a finish was in keeping with the market s mood over most of the year  with the broadest benchmark hovering within an extremely narrow corridor  And despite losing out on early gains to end the day 0 2  lower  financials may hold the key to gains in the days ahead  A variety of factors have investors rooting for the group and you would be missing out on some neat profits if you don t pick up these five great financials picks  Trading Within a Tight BandBy all accounts  this has been the quietest stretch of trading since 1965  One estimate puts the current level of volatility at the lowest in 52 years  Since Jul 19  the S P 500 has not gained or lost 0 5  over a single session  In fact  the index has swung 1  either way only four times year to date  The only exception to such placid behavior has been the Nasdaq  which has moved 1  over 11 trading days To put things in perspective  the market s so called  fear gauge   the VIX  continues to linger near its lowest point in 23 years and more  The popular measure of market volatility had plummeted to this level on May 8  within striking distance of where the market stands  Of course  this has translated into strong gains for the average investor  with the S P 500 up more than 9  year to date Not just that  indexes have continued to notch up record levels during this abnormally quiet stretch of trading  The calm has been broken only seldom  primarily by the valuation fears which stalked tech stocks before their fabulous second quarter results Could a Dip be Around the Corner But growing voices within the investment community believe that such a state of affairs might not last long  Even as friction with North Korea rises  central banks across the world are taking a hawkish stance on monetary policy  Meanwhile  there are growing signs that the projected step up in GDP  to 3   is unlikely to happen during a likely lackluster second half  This is another reason why upside has been limited for stocks till now this year as investors continue to steel themselves for the drop that is likely to come sooner or later Even as the future looks uncertain for markets  investors are becoming increasingly partial to a few select sectors and to financials in particular  According to Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC    this is one of the sectors presently positioned  for the biggest outperformance  Why Financials are Set to WinA bunch of fundamental and technical factors have been working in the sector s favor  Investment firm Oppenheimer has underlined the fact that finance has remained the leading sector in terms of performance since May  even as interest rates plummeted and Treasury yields touched peak levels  Strong performance in the face of such adverse conditions was a sign that downsides had been priced in and the sector was set to rally  the firm said Additionally  the sector remains relatively undervalued at a time when prospects of further deregulation look bright  The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    NYSE GS   strongly believes share buybacks and dividends for the sector are likely to rise thrice as much as that of the S P 500  Further  the investment bank thinks even though finance has gained more than 30  over the last year  emerging as the best performing sector  room for further upside still exist Our ChoicesStocks have traded within a narrow channel so far this year  continuing to create multiple milestones  But such tight trading hints at futher downside  In such a scenario  a few favored sectors have emerged and finance is likely the most promising of them all Picking financials  the leading performer over the last one year period  will help you reap rich profits even in the near term  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score LPL Financial Holdings Inc    NASDAQ LPLA   is engaged in providing an integrated platform of brokerage and investment advisory services to independent financial advisors and financial advisors at financial institutions in the U S LPL Financial has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a VGM Score of A  The company has expected earnings growth of 23 2  for the current year  Its earnings estimate

gradual rate hike policy with the strong likelihood of a fourth rise this year in December  At the same time  U S  products are losing competitiveness in the international market due to strong dollar Moreover  plummeting crude oil prices and concerns about emerging markets  ability to service their external debt have raised the possibility of global slowdown  Consequently  it will be prudent to invest in domestic business focused stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank US Dollar Index Hits 16 Month HighOn Nov 12  the ICE  NYSE ICE  U S  Dollar Index  DXY   which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  touched 97 28  its highest level since Jun 23  2017  Demand for the dollar intensified after the Fed signaled a possible rate hike in December and again in early 2019  last week  Moreover  geopolitical conflicts in the U K  and Italy resulted in lowered values of Pound and Euro compared with the U S  dollar Crude Oil Price PlungesOn Nov 8  the U S  benchmark West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude oil future price entered in bear market territory  On Nov 13  international benchmark of Brent crude oil also entered in the bear market  Notably  both benchmarks are currently on bear market territory Recent nosedive of crude prices has raised eyebrows about an impending global economic slowdown  A surge in global oil supply and significantly weak global demand for oil are the primary reasons behind oil price plunge  High dollar price also inflated oil prices resulting in weak demand  Crude oil is priced in the U S  dollar term in the international markets    Concerns Relating to Emerging MarketsEmerging markets are characterized as major borrower of international debts  external commercial borrowing   Since the debts have to be repaid in dollar terms  servicing these debts while managing fiscal discipline will be very difficult for these countries  Moreover  refinancing of debts which are on the verge of maturity will also become problematic owing to soaring interest costs These negatives may lead to economic slowdown in emerging markets leading toward global economic slump  Emerging markets contagions will certainly create disturbances in the U S  stock Markets Why Domestic Stocks Investors are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt sales of U S  multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets  Notably  in 2017  S P 500 companies had derived 43 6  of their total revenues from international markets Domestic business oriented companies are mostly immune to any external shocks since the United States is the lone market of their products  This will help them to outperform the broader market defying extreme volatility Our Top PicksAt this juncture  investment
