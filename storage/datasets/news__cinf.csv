14225,235740,CINF,MarketPulse  Regional Banks Rally as SunTrust  BB T Seal Major Merger,news,"Investing com   Suntrust Banks soared Thursday after agreeing to be bought by BB T in a deal valued at about  66 billion  creating the sixth largest U S  bank 
Other regional banks  including Citizens Financial  NYSE CFG   up 2 8   Cincinnati Financial  NASDAQ CINF   up 3 1   and Comerica  NYSE CMA   up 5 2   rallied on the news  keeping lid on losses in financials 
The S P 500 Financial sector was down 1 3  for the day 
Under the terms of the deal  BB T  NYSE BBT  shareholders will own about 57  of the newly formed company while SunTrust Banks  NYSE STI  shareholders will own the remaining 43  
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and generate  1 6 billion in cost synergies by 2022 for the combined bank  according to the companies 
Both stocks have been trading at heavy discounts to historical price to earnings averages since November  with the market concerned about the lack of meaningful catalysts  But the merger opens the door to lower costs and higher profits  analysts said 
 This merger shows how banks can reduce expenses and increase profitability in what many consider to be a lackluster operating environment   Piper Jaffrary said 
The deal  the largest big bank deal since the financial crisis  cranked up the rumor mill with many speculating the decade long slumber in merger activity within the regional banking sector may be coming to an end 
 We expect the market to cheer the news of the merger and all regional bank stocks to rally as we sort out who might be next   Piper Jaffray added ",2019-02-07,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/marketpulse-regional-banks-rally-as-suntrust-bbt-seal-major-merger-1772525,1772525

31290,252805,CINF,Retirees Should Know These 3 Facts About Required Minimum Distributions   December 23  2019,opinion,"If you do not make a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the specified deadline  the IRS could hit you with a big penalty   50   For example  if you were required to withdraw a minimum of  4 000 and you did not  you would be obliged to pay  2 000 
Like the majority of investors  you re most likely working on a retirement portfolio that will provide a large enough nest egg to give you a comfortable retirement  Retirement financial planners refer to this as the  accumulation phase   Your goal in this phase is to choose investments with long term growth potential   for example  a current top ranked dividend stock like Cincinnati Financial  CINF  
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Planning for the distribution phase is the time where you may make decisions about where you ll want to live in retirement  whether you ll want to travel  hobbies you may pursue  and other decisions that will affect your retirement spending 
Along with those choices  you need to be mindful of the required minimum distribution  RMD   because it applies to the majority of retirement accounts  This IRS rule requires you to withdraw a specific minimum amount from any qualified accounts you have when you reach age 72 
Why does the IRS requires you to start taking your money out  It s simple   they want to make sure they get their tax  If this rule didn t exist  people could live off other income and never pay tax on their retirement investment gains  Then  that money could be left to family or friends as an inheritance without the IRS collecting any taxes from you 
What You Need to Know About RMDs
What types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I need to begin withdrawals  For most accounts  you should take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you arrive at age 72 
For each subsequent year after your required beginning date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you do not have to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you paid taxes prior to contributing  Other types of Roth accounts require RMDs  However  there are ways to avoid them  For example  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What happens if don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or if the distribution is not large enough  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the amount  Ann is 70 and will take her first RMD in the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance at the end of the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is how much Ann is required to withdraw for the calendar year in which she turns 72

31291,252806,CINF,Can You Spot The Next 830  Dividend Grower ,opinion,"I don t blame you if you think stock picking boils down to a choice between income or growth  That s how the financial media has framed it for years 
But it s not  Not by a long shot  In fact  for years   has shown investors that rapidly growing dividends are something of an  early alert system  for red hot price appreciation  That s why I always keep an eye out on regular dividend growers  like the list of 56 stocks whose names and tickers I ll share with you momentarily 
In fact  if patient investors sniff out the right dividend stocks  they ll hit the trifecta  income growth  higher prices and big  fat yields 
Don t believe me  Consider this  Right now  one of Wall Street s most popular blue chip growth stocks is also paying out a mind blowing 12 9  yield to some very lucky investors 
Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  is a telecommunications semiconductor specialist that s shaping up to be a major player in the rollout of 5G technology  At the moment  it yields a plenty respectable 4 1  yield at current prices   but shareholders who got in just five years ago  after the company showed plenty of evidence that it planned to be a serious  serial dividend grower  are enjoying so much more 






Since late 2014  Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  has sent its payout to the moon  with nearly 830  worth of increases  The reason why its current yield is so relatively modest is because shares have more than tripled during the same time frame  But the yield on cost for anyone who bought in around  101 per share a half decade ago is nearly 13  
You can find similar breakout stories all across the market 
That s because aggressive dividend hikes act like a magnet for new money  Any company can announce a token improvement to the payout  but when investors see a double digit raise  they know there s an overwhelming chance that there s a legitimate growth story and real financial strength backing it 
It s so easy to overlook these kinds of stocks because they often sport modest current yields  Go back to the Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  example it offered a paltry 1 4  five years ago  But today  AVGO is a  125 billion semiconductor behemoth that yields like a third world bond 
So check out these 56 dividend growers that I ve divided into four categories  Dividend Aristocrats  MLPs  noteworthy stocks and REITs that habitually improve their dividends during the first quarter of the year 
If you want to land the next dividend trifecta  this is where you should start your search 
Dividend Aristocrats
A refresher on the Dividend Aristocrats  At the moment  this is a group of 57 stocks in the S P 500 that have raised their dividends at least once annually  without interruption  for at least 25 years  That said  many stocks have far longer streaks  such as Genuine Parts Company  NYSE GPC   which has been upping the ante for more than six decades 
Fair warning  though  Dividend Aristocrats are like any other group of stocks  
Dividend Spotlight  Walmart  NYSE WMT  enjoyed a renaissance in 2019  outperforming the market with 29  gains extremely late into the year  The company s e commerce answers to Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  have surpassed even some of the wildest dreams  leading some analysts and former retail chiefs to believe that Walmart actually poses a threat to Jeff Bezos   Co 
The one thing that might grate shareholders  however  is its quarterly cash payment  While WMT has compiled 46 consecutive years of payout increases  it is averaging 2  dividend growth annually over the past half decade a pace nestled tightly between  slug  and  snail  
It d be nice to see a little something extra out of Walmart  NYSE WMT  come late February 
MLPs
Master limited partnerships  MLPs  have a mixed reputation among income investors  They love the sky high distributions  MLPs  dividend esque payments   but they hate  
That said  I m highlighting a few of the industry s bigger names that have adopted a healthy habit  padding their payouts quarterly  not annually like most stocks 
Dividend Spotlight  Enterprise Products Partners  EPD  is one of the most prolific dividend growers on this entire list 
This MLP is a whale of a  midstream  operator  which means that it tackles the transportation storage part of fossil fuels  journey from the ground to consumers  Specifically  the company boasts a mammoth 49 200 mile network of pipelines transporting natural gas  natural gas liquids  NGL   crude oil and other products  storage operations  natural gas processing plans  NGL and propylene fractionators  and a few import export terminals 
This business is less sensitive to fluctuations energy prices  because what matters most is that energy is simply flowing through its infrastructure  That has allowed EPD to put together an impressive string of 61 consecutive quarterly distribution hikes  not to mention double up the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund s  XLE  NYSE XLE   performance in what was a lousy 2019 for traditional energy stocks 
Noteworthy Stocks
We ll move on to the biggest chunk of expected dividend raises from real estate investment trusts  REITs  in a moment  But first  here are some of the more interesting companies that could add to their payouts over the next three months 
Dividend Spotlight  This might be your first time coming across the name Albemarle  ALB   so here s the skinny  This specialty chemicals company joined the S P 500 just a few years ago  in 2016  It leads the world in lithium  bromine and refining catalysts ingredients that contribute to fascinating and or vital end products such as lithium ion batteries powering tomorrow s electric vehicles  or systems that keep mercury out of our water 
But the business itself would put a can of Red Bull to sleep 
That s OK  I always say  when it comes to dividend investing  And so it goes with ALB  which in 2019 notched its 25th consecutive year of higher payouts  That means that by the time it announces No  26 in February  it should end up joining the Dividend Aristocrats 
Albemarle s pace of payout raises has been good albeit not great  at roughly 6  annually over the past half decade  That included a nearly 10  bump higher in 2019 
REITs
 up until a couple months ago  though it cooled down over the home stretch while most of the rest of the market kept marching higher 
That s no worry  REITs should end 2019 up by roughly 25  including dividends  which is a successful year in just about any investor s book 
REITs often aren t a source of breakneck dividend growth  which is why it s especially important to keep watch for rapidly raising outliers  REITs by rule are required to distribute at least 90  of their profits as dividends  Thus  a big jump in the payout often means business is hopping 
Dividend Spotlight  Equity LifeStyle Properties  ELS  is exactly the kind of stock that gets me excited about the potential of dividend growth 
Equity LifeStyle Properties  ELS  Is Due for a Big Hike






ELS owns and operates manufactured home communities  RV resorts and campgrounds across North America  While I typically like plays that cater to the more affluent  Equity LifeStyle Properties meets a booming need that s likely to continue going gangbusters for both economic and demographic reasons 
The company s payout has already exploded by 90  in the past five years  which is particularly impressive for a REIT  But that progress is  hidden  by a tripling in the stock that has muted its yield to a mere 1 8  
Equity LifeStyle Properties has reported an 8  plus improvement in funds from operations  FFO  a profitability measure for REITs  through the first nine months of 2019  That kind of improvement bodes well for another healthy hike come mid February 
Yours Now  7 Recession Proof  Hidden Yield  Stocks for 2020
Are you licking your chops thinking about stuffing some of these dividend growers into your portfolio 
Good  Because the time for getting your retirement house into order is now  before you suffer yet another year of underperforming the market and collecting mediocre income checks 
I mentioned earlier about how dividend growth has powered my Hidden Yields service  Now  I want to show you   rain or shine 
Bull markets  They average 20  or more in total returns  Bear markets  About 12  in gains  not losses  And yet  you never see these stocks touted on CNBC  Fox Business or any of the other major outlets 
They re not risky  They re not dangerous 
Their only sin is being too boring for the media to care 
But media time doesn t put money in your pocket  High quality  established businesses with investor friendly leaders do  And those are the kind of companies I recommend in my  service 
So ask yourself  Are my stocks  
Paying generous and ever growing dividends Built to keep paying me even if the market crashes Cash rich  free from major debt  and profitable Calm even when the market is spastic Safe from new competitors Most stocks don t check off all these boxes  They cross off a few  then skate by on their reputations 
But this seven pack of undervalued  overlooked and often outright ignored stocks can safeguard your portfolio from even some of the most dire recessionary scenarios  They can deliver 20  returns annually in bull markets  but even 12  annually in bear markets 
And you can buy some of them for pennies on the dollar 
The risks are piling up as we enter a contentious election year  as China and the U S  are only on  Phase One   and as the Federal Reserve says it will stay put   even though we ve heard that story before 
The time to take action is now

31379,252894,CINF,All You Need To Know About Cincinnati Financial  CINF  Rating Upgrade To Strong Buy,opinion,"Cincinnati Financial  CINF  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cincinnati Financial basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Cincinnati Financial imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Cincinnati Financial
This insurer is expected to earn  4 04 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 20 6  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cincinnati Financial  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 7 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Cincinnati Financial to a Zacks Rank  1 positions it in the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-12-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/all-you-need-to-know-about-cincinnati-financial-cinf-rating-upgrade-to-strong-buy-200489351,200489351

31452,252967,CINF,P C Insurance Industry s Near Term Prospects Encouraging,opinion,The Zacks   P C  industry comprises companies that provide commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products and services  Such insurance coverage helps to safeguard property in case of any natural or man made disaster  Liability coverages are also provided by some industry players Insurance coverages provided by the companies include commercial and personal properties  automobiles  professional risk  marine  excess casualty  aviation  personal accident  commercial multi peril  professional indemnity and surety  among others Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers  These companies invest a portion of premiums collected to meet their commitments to policyholders  Thus  a rising rate environment is a boon for P C insurers Here are the industry s three major themes The industry is witnessing an increase in premium pricing after having suffered due to low prices for several years  In the second quarter of 2019  U S  commercial insurance prices increased about 4   Property  excess umbrella  and directors and officers saw near double digit rate increase  Commercial Auto saw a near or above double digits rate increase  per Willis Towers Watson s Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey  A rise in premium rates should lead to top line growth   Per Willis Towers Watson  NASDAQ WLTW  Insurance Marketplace Realities  14 commercial lines should see rate increase while two are expected to see rate decline  However  two rate cuts by the Fed of 25 basis points each and expectations of one more by 2019 end might put pressure on insurers  net investment income  another important component of total revenues  The property and casualty insurance industry boasts good policyholders  surplus   779 5 billion at first quarter 2019 end  up 5  year over year   which is insurers  excess of assets over liabilities  The ratio of new premiums written to surplus was 0 83 and 0 78 at year end 2018 and end of first quarter 2019  respectively  lower numbers are stronger   per a report from Insurance Information Institute  In the second quarter of 2019 too  policyholders  surplus remained strong  This indicates that the industry remains well capitalized and financially prepared to pay for large scale losses in 2019 and beyond  This surplus capital should also fuel increased consolidation in the industry as players seek to increase market share  achieve geographical diversification  change product mix and grow in niche areas  The industry is witnessing increased use of technology  like blockchain  artificial intelligence  advanced analytics  telematics  cloud computing and robotic process automation  to expedite business operations and save cost   The industry has also witnessed the emergence of insurtech   technology led insurers   creating competition for incumbent players  The focus of insurtech is mainly on the property and casualty insurance industry  As insurtechs use latest technologies and concepts that the incumbents are just beginning to experiment with  there remains huge market risk Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates solid prospects in the near term  The Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry  which is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  33  which places it in the top 13  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  In a year s time  the industry s earnings estimates for the current year have gone up 3 3  Before we present a few property and casualty stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Underperforms S P 500 and SectorThe Property and Casualty Insurance industry has underperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite and its own sector over the past year  The stocks in this industry have collectively decreased 3 6  in the past year while the Finance sector has dipped 3   Meanwhile  the Zacks S P 500 composite has increased 1 6  One Year Price PerformanceCurrent ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12 month price to book  P B   which is commonly

 as low as 1 25X and at the median of 1 48X Price to Book  P B  Ratio  TTM Price to Book  P B  Ratio  TTM Bottom LinePrudent underwriting practices  competitive pricing and a compelling product portfolio should continue to drive the bottom line for P C insurers  Moreover  a sturdy capital level should place insurers well to pursue mergers and acquisitions  invest in technologies and return

31487,253002,CINF,Y Or CINF  Which Property   Casualty Insurer Is A Better Buy ,opinion,The property and casualty  P C  insurance industry witnessed the adverse impact of Hurricane Dorian and lower

against the Zacks S P 500 composite s increase of 1 1   The  sector has also declined 1 2  in the said time frame  The property and casualty insurance industry is ranked  57 and housed within the top 22  of the  for 255 plus industries    Also  the industry is currently undervalued compared with the Zacks S P 500 composite  The industry s price to book value multiple of 1 39 is much lower than the Zacks S P 500 composite s reading of 4 02  Given the growth prospects and undervaluation  this space offers attractive investment opportunities Here we focus on two P C insurers  namely Alleghany Corporation   NYSE Y   and Cincinnati Financial Corporation   NASDAQ CINF  While Alleghany provides property and casualty reinsurance and insurance products in the United States and internationally  Cincinnati Financial provides property casualty insurance products in the United States  Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Factors Driving the Industry    The insurance industry is already into the hurricane season with Hurricane Dorian making landfall in the Bahamas   Per media reports  analysts at UBS Group AG estimate Hurricane Dorian to cause about  25 billion in losses in Bahamas  AccuWeather estimates the total damage and economic loss stemming from Hurricane Dorian to be in the range of  8 10 billion Nonetheless  property and casualty insurers are increasingly taking reinsurance covers to safeguard their profits Also  after suffering a soft pricing market for 19 consecutive quarters  insurers started raising prices from the fourth quarter of 2018  Improved pricing helps write more premiums to address huge claims arising due to calamities  Per Willis Towers Watson  NASDAQ WLTW  plc s Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey in 2019  most of the commercial insurance lines should witness rate increase Also  occurrence of natural disasters might lead to an accelerated rate of policy renewals and  new policy writings  thus driving premiums higher The Fed cut interest rate by 25 basis points at its July FOMC meeting and the rate currently stands at 2 25   Given slow employment growth rate  economic slowdown and trade war related uncertainties  the market expects another 25 basis points rate cut  Insurers  being one of the beneficiaries of an improved rate environment  are likely to feel the pinch of a lowered rate though a higher invested asset base should offer some respite A sturdy capital level widens scope for capital deployment to pursue growth initiatives as well as reward shareholders via dividend hikes  special dividends and share buybacks Increasing adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence  robotic process automation  cognitive intelligence or blockchain and cloud computing should help insurers control costs Let s see how these P C insurers fared in terms of some of the key metrics Price Performance    Alleghany has outperformed both Cincinnati Financial and the industry quarter to date  While shares of Alleghany have rallied 12 4   Cincinnati Financial has gained 7 5  ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing insurers  Compared with the property

Cincinnati Financial have lower debt to equity ratio than the industry average of 25 9  However  Cincinnati Financial with a reading of 9 7 betters Alleghany s leverage ratio of 19 7  Therefore  Cincinnati Financial has a clear edge over Alleghany on this front Interest Coverage RatioCincinnati Financial s interest coverage ratio of 28 1 is better the industry average of 10 7 and Alleghany s reading of 4 3  Interest coverage ratio is the measure of a company s ability to service its debt payments  Cincinnati Financial fares better than Alleghany in this round Return on Equity  ROE Cincinnati Financial with a return on equity of 7 1  exceeded the industry average of 6 8  as well as Alleghany s ROE of 2 9  Dividend YieldCincinnati Financial s dividend yield is 2   outperforming

Cincinnati Financial s 2019 earnings estimates have moved up 5 6  in the past 60 days  The bottom line is estimated to increase 11 9  in 2019 but decline 0 7  in 2020 To ConcludeWhile Cincinnati

31500,253015,CINF,What Makes Cincinnati Financial  CINF  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Cincinnati Financial  CINF   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cincinnati Financial currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CINF is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this insurer holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CINF  shares are up 3 5  over the past week while the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry is up 1 19  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 2 09  compares favorably with the industry s 0 27  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Cincinnati Financial have risen 10 56   and are up 45 7  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 0 97  and 3 76   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CINF s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CINF is currently averaging 726 970 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with CINF 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CINF s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 55 to  3 75 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that CINF is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Cincinnati Financial on your short list ",2019-08-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-cincinnati-financial-cinf-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200456389,200456389

Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cincinnati Financial basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Cincinnati Financial imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

provided by the companies include commercial and personal properties  automobiles  professional risk  marine  excess casualty  aviation  personal accident  commercial multi peril  professional indemnity and surety  among others Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers  These companies invest a portion of premiums collected to meet their commitments to policyholders  Thus  a rising rate environment is a boon for P C insurers Here are the industry s three major themes      The industry is witnessing an increase in premium pricing after suffering from low prices for several years  In the first quarter of 2019  in personal lines insurance homeowners  automobile and personal articles saw rate increase of 2   2 5  and 1   respectively  In Commercial lines  most of the lines saw premium rate increase of 2   while Commercial Auto saw a 7  rate increase  A rise in premium rates should lead to top line growth  However  still low interest rates  which might not see any increase  in 2019  due to Fed s dovish monetary policy  might put pressure on insurers  net investment income  another important component of total revenues       The property and casualty industry boasts good policy holders  surplus  which is insurers  excess of assets over liabilities  At year end 2018  the ratio of new premiums written to surplus was 0 83 to 1 0  lower numbers are stronger   In the first quarter of 2019  policyholders  surplus remained strong with the stock market s robust performance  This indicates that the industry remains well capitalized and financially prepared to pay for large scale losses in 2019 and beyond  This surplus capital should also fuel increased consolidation in the industry as players seek to increase market share  achieve geographical diversification  change product mix and growth in niche areas      The industry is witnessing increased use of technology  like blockchain  AI  advanced analytics  telematics  cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save unnecessary delay and cost   The industry is also experiencing the emergence of Insurtech   technology led insurers   creating competition for the incumbent players  It is to be noted that the focus for insurtech is mainly on the property and casualty insurance industry  Given that these insurtechs are already widely using

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 24  2019  Cincinnati Financial reported EPS of  1 05 versus consensus estimate of  0 94 
Valuation Metrics
Cincinnati Financial may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Cincinnati Financial has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 27 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 25 6X versus its peer group s average of 14 3X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Cincinnati Financial currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Cincinnati Financial passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Cincinnati Financial shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Cincinnati Financial Stack Up to the Competition

31577,253092,CINF,Analysts Estimate Cincinnati Financial  CINF  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Cincinnati Financial  CINF  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21  
Revenues are expected to be  1 53 billion  up 5 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 21 05  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cincinnati Financial 
For Cincinnati Financial  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  5 51  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cincinnati Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cincinnati Financial would post earnings of  0 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 05  delivering a surprise of  11 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cincinnati Financial doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-cincinnati-financial-cinf-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200443282,200443282
31578,253093,CINF,Cincinnati Financial  CINF  Beats Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Cincinnati Financial  CINF  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 85 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 64 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 81 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 32 81   A quarter ago  it was expected that this insurer would post earnings of  0 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 05  delivering a surprise of 11 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Cincinnati Financial  which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry  posted revenues of  1 55 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 39   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 45 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Cincinnati Financial shares have added about 37 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Cincinnati Financial 
While Cincinnati Financial has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cincinnati Financial was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 60 on  1 55 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 50 on  6 16 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Insurance   Property and Casualty is currently in the top 38  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cincinnati-financial-cinf-beats-q2-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200447552,200447552

31636,253151,CINF,Alleghany Vs  W R  Berkley  Which Is A Wealthier Stock ,opinion,Looking back at 2018  the property and casualty  P C  insurance industry s optimism was kept alive on the back of the rising interest rates  a growing gross domestic product  GDP   lower tax incidence and a modest underwriting performance In 2019  the P C insurers are expected to fall back on the improving economy  better employment scenario  net written premium growth and the ever expanding levels of alternative capital  These are enough reasons for such insurers to stay upbeat about the soon to be reported quarter However  catastrophic losses will persistently loom large on the insurers  posing a possible threat to their overall performance  Even though the P C insurance industry has not faced any massive level of catastrophe losses so far  the January winter storms and an extreme cold weather  Polar Vortex  cost the United States nearly a billion dollars per Aon plc s   NYSE AON   catastrophe report on Feb 13  2019 Additionally  according to the catastrophe loss estimate released by The Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL   on Mar 22  2019  the total estimated catastrophe losses for the January and February months stand at  299 million  pretax   236 million after tax   Although insurers will bear the brunt of such catastrophic events through their quarterly performances  the same is not expected to create a huge dent in their underwriting capabilities With respect to the pricing environment  after experiencing 19 back to back quarters of soft pricing market  insurers began to increase prices from the fourth quarter of 2017  According to the analysts at Moody s Investors Service  the pricing environment for this industry is likely to be modestly positive  Per the analysts  throughout 2019  rate increases are anticipated to exceed the loss cost trends in auto lines  roughly match the metric in the property lines and lag slightly in the commercial casualty lines Moreover  the insurers also built capital reserves owing to a not so active catastrophe in the past  which has been helping companies meet insurance claims  Also  the insurance industry boasts an all time high capital level that will not only back the players to counter their near term volatility and offset the impact of hostile occurrences but also sustain the industry s growth momentum Given the accelerated rate hikes in the past couple of years  the insurers have reaped the benefits of the benign interest rate environment that has led to better investment results  However  the FOMC meeting on Mar 20  2019 could not make investors rejoice about the future rate hikes as the Fed announced its decision to keep the interest rates unchanged and indicated that no more hikes will be coming this year unless conditions change significantly Nonetheless  with the current interest rate  ranging between 2 25  and 2 5    the insurers can expect investment income to improve  thereby boosting revenues In 2019  GDP growth will slow down to 2 1  from 3  in 2018  the projected slowdown in 2019 and beyond is mainly due to the trade war   Nonetheless  factors like unemployment rate  estimated at 3 7  in 2019  and the core inflation rate  expected at 2  through 2021  represent a bullish economic outlook The Property and Casualty Insurance industry is ranked at 101  representing the top 39  of the  for 250 plus industries  and has underperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite s rally of 14 3  year to date  While the industry has inched up 2 1  Here we focus on the two P C insurers  namely Alleghany Corporation   NYSE Y   and W R  Berkley Corporation   NYSE WRB    While Alleghany deals in the property and casualty reinsurance and insurance products in the United States and internationally  W R  Berkley operates as a commercial lines writer in the United States and globally  While the former has a market capitalization of  8 9 billion  the latter s metric records  10 3 billion It will be interesting to note which stock scores higher in terms of fundamentals Investors interested in the same space can also take a look at Cincinnati Financial Corporation   NASDAQ CINF   and Hallmark Financial Services  Inc    NASDAQ HALL    both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Zacks RankWhile Alleghany has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   W R  Berkley carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Price PerformanceShares of W R  Berkley have outpaced the  year to date while that of Alleghany has underperformed the same  The W R  Berkley stock has rallied 14 4  while the Alleghany stock has dipped 1 6   Thus  W R  Berkley emerges a clear winner here ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing insurers  Compared with the Property and Casualty Industry s P B ratio of 1 49  W R  Berkley is overvalued with a reading of 1 88  Meanwhile  Alleghany is much cheaper with a trailing 12 month P B multiple of 1 18  Thus  this round goes to Alleghany as its shares are underpriced than that of W R  Berkley Return on EquityW R  Berkley s 9 39  return on equity lies above the industry s average of 7 15  while Alleghany s 2 94  falls below the same  Return on equity   a profitability measure   reflects how efficiently the company utilizes its shareholders  funds  Therefore  between W R  Berkley and Alleghany  the former is comparatively better positioned Debt to EquityWhile W R  Berkley s debt to equity is higher than the industry average of 27 8   Alleghany scores lower in this regard  Therefore  Alleghany with a leverage ratio of 21 7  has a visible edge over W R  Berkley s 50 9  ratio Combined RatioCombined ratio  the percentage of premiums paid out as claims and expenses  determines the underwriting profitability of an insurer Alleghany s combined ratio was 103 2  in 2018 while W R  Berkley s came in at 95 3   Thus  W R  Berkley stays ahead in this round Growth ProjectionsFor Alleghany  the consensus mark for 2019 earnings per share is estimated to skyrocket 123 2  and for 2020  the company s earnings are expected to increase 7 9  For W R  Berkley  the consensus estimate for earnings per share in the current year is projected to decline 5 2  while for 2020  the bottom line is predicted to increase 9 7  In this case  Alleghany gains an edge over W R  Berkley To ConcludeAlleghany is better placed than W R  Berkley on the basis of rank  valuation  leverage ratio as well as growth projections  Whereas taking parameters like price performance  return on equity and the combined ratio into account  W R  Berkley seems a healthier choice than Alleghany as a stock  Per our comparative analysis  Alleghany thus seems a more rewarding investment pick than W R  Berkley Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling Your

31663,253178,CINF,What Makes Cincinnati Financial  CINF  A New Strong Buy Stock,opinion,"Cincinnati Financial  CINF  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cincinnati Financial is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Cincinnati Financial  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Cincinnati Financial
This insurer is expected to earn  3 53 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 5 4  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cincinnati Financial  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4 5  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Cincinnati Financial to a Zacks Rank  1 positions it in the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-cincinnati-financial-cinf-a-new-strong-buy-stock-200406762,200406762
31664,253179,CINF,Why Cincinnati Financial  CINF  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Cincinnati Financial  CINF   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry 
This insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 17 25  
For the most recent quarter  Cincinnati Financial was expected to post earnings of  0 80 per share  but it reported  0 98 per share instead  representing a surprise of 22 50   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 75 per share  while it actually produced  0 84 per share  a surprise of 12  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Cincinnati Financial  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Cincinnati Financial currently has an Earnings ESP of  4 26   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 24  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-cincinnati-financial-cinf-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200406850,200406850

31670,253185,CINF,5 Dividend Aristocrats For A Steady Income Stream,opinion,On Mar 22  long term treasury yields plunged  causing a yield curve inversion  To be precise  the return on the 10 year Treasury note slipped below the yield on the 3 month Treasury bill for the first time in 12 years  This caused panic among investors since such an inversion is considered to be a reliable indicator of a near term recession However  the decline in long term yields has been occurring since late 2018  With the Fed taking a decidedly dovish position  market watchers believe that long term bond returns will continue to remain low in the near term  In such a situation  dividend paying stocks would prove to be better alternatives This is particularly true for those stocks  which are part of the S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index  The index is made up of 57 stocks  which have raised dividend payouts for at least 25 straight years  Adding them to your portfolios would be prudent at this time Long Term Bond Yields Likely to Remain LowAs of Mar 25  yield on the one year Treasury Bill and its seven year counterpart stand at 2 41  and 2 32   respectively  This means an investor would actually be penalized for waiting for six more years  receiving a return which is nine basis points lower  And since the 10 year yield stands at 2 43   a 10 year long commitment would only yield two more basis points And with the Fed likely to maintain a dovish stance going forward  things are likely to remain pretty much the same  Fed Chair Powell now believes that the case for additional rate hikes has  weakened  Last week the central bank kept rates unchanged and revealed that it will soon end its attempts to reduce the size of its balance sheet  Economists think that the Fed may even become a net buyer of Treasury securities in the near future This clearly indicates that the Fed remains wary of an impending economic slowdown   This will likely continue to boost the demand for long term bonds  pushing their yields lower in the process Dividend Aristocrats Hold the EdgeIn such an environment  dividend paying equities are at an advantage  This is particularly true for those companies  which can increase their payouts substantially over time  The components of the S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index fit the bill perfectly  since they have raised dividends on common shares for 25 straight years Also  the index has outperformed the S P 500 by a wide margin over the past 15 years  In fact  the current dividend yield is of little consequence in this case since this is essentially a long term growth strategy  And if the current yield is indeed attractive  the return on stocks from the index will be much higher since dividends are also likely to rise consistently   Our ChoicesLast week s fall in long term bond yields is a clear sign that an economic slowdown is around the corner  The Fed s recent actions also indicate such an outcome  This has served to raise the demand for long term securities  pushing their yields lower In such circumstances  stocks paying an attractive dividend would make for a good choice  This is particularly true for members of the S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics Cincinnati Financial Corporation   NASDAQ CINF   markets property and

5 Dividend Aristocrats for a Steady Income Stream
On Mar 22  long term treasury yields plunged  causing a yield curve inversion  To be precise  the return on the 10 year Treasury note slipped below the yield on the 3 month Treasury bill for the first time in 12 years  This caused panic among investors since such an inversion is considered to be a reliable indicator of a near term recession 
However  the decline in long term yields has been occurring since late 2018  With the Fed taking a decidedly dovish position  market watchers believe that long term bond returns will continue to remain low in the near term  In such a situation  dividend paying stocks would prove to be better alternatives 
This is particularly true for those stocks  which are part of the S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index  The index is made up of 57 stocks  which have raised dividend payouts for at least 25 straight years  Adding them to your portfolios would be prudent at this time 
Long Term Bond Yields Likely to Remain Low
As of Mar 25  yield on the one year Treasury Bill and its seven year counterpart stand at 2 41  and 2 32   respectively  This means an investor would actually be penalized for waiting for six more years  receiving a return which is nine basis points lower  And since the 10 year yield stands at 2 43   a 10 year long commitment would only yield two more basis points 
And with the Fed likely to maintain a dovish stance going forward  things are likely to remain pretty much the same  Fed Chair Powell now believes that the case for additional rate hikes has  weakened  
Last week the central bank kept rates unchanged and revealed that it will soon end its attempts to reduce the size of its balance sheet  Economists think that the Fed may even become a net buyer of Treasury securities in the near future 
This clearly indicates that the Fed remains wary of an impending economic slowdown   This will likely continue to boost the demand for long term bonds  pushing their yields lower in the process 
Dividend Aristocrats Hold the Edge
In such an environment  dividend paying equities are at an advantage  This is particularly true for those companies  which can increase their payouts substantially over time  The components of the S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index fit the bill perfectly  since they have raised dividends on common shares for 25 straight years 
Also  the index has outperformed the S P 500 by a wide margin over the past 15 years  In fact  the current dividend yield is of little consequence in this case since this is essentially a long term growth strategy  And if the current yield is indeed attractive  the return on stocks from the index will be much higher since dividends are also likely to rise consistently   
Our Choices
Last week s fall in long term bond yields is a clear sign that an economic slowdown is around the corner  The Fed s recent actions also indicate such an outcome  This has served to raise the demand for long term securities  pushing their yields lower 
In such circumstances  stocks paying an attractive dividend would make for a good choice  This is particularly true for members of the S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics 
Cincinnati Financial Corp  markets property and casualty insurance as its main business 
Cincinnati Financial has increased its dividend payments for 58 consecutive years  It has a dividend yield of 2 7   while its five year average dividend yield is 3   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings has increased 6 1  in the past 60 days  It sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

31700,253215,CINF,Athene Holding s Scalable Platform Aids  High Costs Hurt,opinion,Athene Holding Ltd    NYSE ATH    a retirement services company  has been delivering adjusted operating income growth over a considerable period of time  The reason for this consistent success is the life insurer s ability to leverage its structural advantages and differentiated attributes to create value  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings is pegged at  7 39  reflecting a year over year increase of nearly 27  It is important to note here that one of the key ways to drive an excellent financial performance is through a highly scalable platform With respect to underwriting discipline  the company has been able to maintain a solid momentum by pricing its businesses to mid teen returns on an aggregate basis  To that end  the insurer s retail annuity business showed maximum growth in sales and this trend is expected to sustain in the future Moreover  the company s inorganic portfolio has been impressive and the three deals inked during the third quarter of 2018 will likely fortify its portfolio in times to come  The company anticipates its inorganic pipeline to further remain sturdy Riding on its robust businesses and prudent acquisition abilities  the company has been able to drive steady growth  The company has been successfully generating a significant amount of total organic and inorganic deposits  thereby leading to a substantial rise in retirement services reserve liabilities Coming to the top line  the company has been constantly witnessing higher revenues in the last few years  primarily owing to higher premiums  product charges and investment income  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 revenues stands at  5 2 billion  representing a 26 5  year over year increase When it comes to capital management  the company s approach to the same led to a significant equity value creation over a considerable period of time and we expect this to remain intact in the near term as well The insurer s capital position remains sound with  9 1 billion adjusted shareholders  equity  about  2 billion of excess capital and  2 billion of debt capacity  This  in turn  is estimated to contribute to its firm rating improvements over time The company s stable return on equity  ROE  performance led to consistent growth in adjusted book value  above the already attractive historical compound growth rate of 17  over the past nine years  more than four times the industry average  Shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  life insurer have gained 2 4  year to date  underperforming the  s rally of 18 5   However  we believe  the aforementioned upsides will push the stock up in the near term  Shares of the company are trading at a price to book multiple of 0 97  lower than the industry average of 3 28  Price to book value ratio is the best multiple for valuing life insurers because of large variations in earnings results from one quarter to the next  This ratio essentially measures a life insurer s current market value  relative to what it would be worth if it chooses to shut down  Underpriced shares with solid fundamentals are profitable picks However  the company has been experiencing escalating expenses since the past few years  which might restrict its margin expansion   Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in better

31766,253281,CINF,What Makes Allstate  ALL  An Attractive Investment Option,opinion,"Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL   is poised to grow on the back of its well performing property and liability segment  A number of initiatives undertaken by the company to improve profitability in the auto segment will also drive long term growth  A strong balance sheet and intelligent capital management are other positives for the stock  The acquisition of SquareTrade  PlumChoice and InfoArmor will provide diversification benefits

Year to date  the stock has rallied 12 8  compared with its  s growth of 0 54  

 
Factors That Make the Stock Lucrative
Strong Property Liability Business Performance  The company s property and liability business continues to be profitable owing to pricing discipline and a strong claims management  It is also benefiting from the past acquisitions and growth in the emerging businesses  evident from a consistent increase in premiums for the past many years 
This trend continued in 2017  reflecting a 3 2  rise in net written premium  Moreover  the metric grew 6  in 2018  We expect the segment to continue adding to its top line  given a number of strategic initiatives undertaken for growth  such as product enhancements and changes in business mix to focus on those that command a high return on equity 
Burgeoning Service Business   The company is making concerted efforts to amplify its Service business profile  which provides nice diversification benefits  In this vein  it acquired SquareTrade in 2017 a  provider of protection plans for mobile phones  consumer electronics and appliances  Premium written from SquareTrade soared 81  in 2018 
Allstate also acquired PlumChoice in 2018  a leading provider of cloud and technical support services to consumers and small businesses  This buyout is expected to expand the company s Service business  which generated 27  revenue growth in 2018 
Increasing Investment Income  After suffering a declining income in its investment portfolio for the past many years due to market volatility and low interest rates  the company is gradually gaining ground  Net investment income rose 11 8  in 2017 and 6 3  in 2018  The company has also lowered its exposure to growth sensitive assets  which is likely to improve its investment portfolio s risk profile 
Solid Balance Sheet and Efficient Capital Management  The company s cash flow has been rising over the years  Management s proactive risk mitigation and return optimization programs consistently raise the operating cash flow and add shareholder value 
Share Buyback and Dividend  Allstate s disciplined capital management by means of share buyback and dividend hike is also impressive  Last October  the company announced  3 billion of share repurchase  This February  Allstate increased its quarterly dividend by 24   Its current dividend yield of 2 2  is considerably higher than the industry s 0 53   We believe  the company s financial strength will continue to instill investors  confidence in the stock 
Strong ROE  The company s ROE of 14  has bettered over the past couple of years and is steadily much higher than the industry s 6 6  ROE  This in turn  reflects the company s tactical efficiency in ustilizng its shareholders  funds

31862,253377,CINF,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Cincinnati Financial  CINF ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Cincinnati Financial  CINF   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cincinnati Financial currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CINF is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this insurer holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CINF  shares are up 3 02  over the past week while the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry is up 0 22  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 32  compares favorably with the industry s 2 67  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Cincinnati Financial have increased 4 15  over the past quarter  and have gained 13 12  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  2 11  and 5 37   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CINF s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CINF is currently averaging 849 006 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CINF 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CINF s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 33 to  3 35 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that CINF is a  1  Strong Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Cincinnati Financial on your short list ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-cincinnati-financial-cinf-200386753,200386753

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Disney  DIS   Eli Lilly  LLY  and U S  Bancorp  USB   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Disney s shares have gained 5 1  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry s gain of 2 6  during the same period  Disney s first quarter fiscal 2019 results benefited from strong performance of Media Networks and Parks  Experiences   Consumer Products segments  
An increase in affiliate revenues and higher program sales at Cable Networks  and Broadcasting boosted Media revenues  Parks revenues benefited from increase in guest spending and average daily room rates at domestic parks  The Zacks analyst thinks Disney s content slate will likely get a significant boost following the completion of Fox transaction 
Notably  the combined entity received 37 nominations at this year s Golden Globes  However  higher programming costs at ESPN and heavy investments in streaming services continue to hurt profitability  Softness experienced in Chinese tourism negatively impacted Shanghai Disney Resort results

Shares of Eli Lily have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year   54 9  vs   6 2   Lilly missed Q4 earnings estimates while beating the same for sales   However  Lilly lowered its guidance for 2019   
The Zacks analyst thinks revenue growth in 2019 will likely be driven by higher demand for newer drugs including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio as well as new migraine drug  Emgality as some older drugs like Cialis face generic competition  In 2018  Lilly made significant pipeline progress with several positive late stage data readouts  multiple approvals and regulatory submissions  
Lilly also added promising new pipeline assets through business development deals  However  competitive pressure on Lilly s drugs is expected to rise in 2019  Generic competition for several drugs including Cialis  rising pricing pressure  currency headwinds and the impact of the failed Lartruvo study are expected to put pressure on the top line 
 You can   
U S  Bancorp s shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the past six months  losing  3 5  vs  10 5   The company possesses an impressive earnings surprise history  beating expectations in all the trailing four quarters  Fourth quarter 2018 results reflected higher revenues  aided by elevated fee income  However  reduced mortgage banking revenues and high expenses were on the downside  
The Zacks analyst thinks U S  Bancorp s prospects will likely get support from its solid business model  core franchise  lower tax rate  rising interest rate and diverse revenue streams  Also  its organic growth remains solid and will likely benefit from the improving economic scenario 
U S  Bancorp remains well poised to grow through acquisitions  However  escalating expenses due to its ongoing investments in technology and likely increase in legal expenses remain concerns

target rate range at 2 25 2 5  via a unanimous voting  In 2018  the fed funds rate was increased four times The Fed s dovish stance on interest rates harps on a number of factors such as Brexit uncertainty  China s economic slowdown  a rapid waning of fiscal policy stimulus  which included the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017  and a further tightening of financial market conditions While a rising interest rate environment is a positive for sectors such as banks and insurers  there are still some stocks that would be able to outperform by virtue of their strong business fundaments and solid balance sheets Against this backdrop  let s see the impact that a no interest hike scenario would have on the insurance sector  whose profitability is directly linked to interest rates No Interest Rate Hike to Hurt InsurersInsurers by virtue of the nature of their business  which requires them to pay claims and guaranteed returns on some kind of policies  are required to invest the premium received  less the expenses to run the business  in financial assets  The income generated from such investments called net investment income also forms one of the drivers of earnings Since insurers have an obligation to make good the claims and pay out the guaranteed returns  they play safe by investing in government bonds and high grade corporate bonds  Therefore  an insurer s investment income and profit depends on the prevailing interest rates Apart from impacting net investment income  interest rates also impact insurers  reserves  Insurers have future liability and are required to maintain capital in commensurate with these liabilities  These reserves are calculated by discounting the future outflows at a discount rate  which is mostly in line with interest rates  Therefore in a period of low interest rates  insurers are required to keep a greater amount of capital as reserves  which causes undue strain How Are the Players Dealing Having faced with very low interest rates for many years  insurers have made changes to business and product mix by emphasizing and promoting products that are less sensitive to interest rates and equity markets  and increasing focus on sale of products with variable returns  Also  players have sought alternative investments such as in private equity  hedge funds  managed futures  real estate  commodities and derivatives contracts  in order to increase their return on investments Moreover  the players are seeking an increase in insurance pricing by raising premiums  Recently  InsuranceNewsNet reported that premium for both Commercial and Personal Lines has increased by 2 2 5   This should aid revenue growth at a time when net investment income is expected to remain muted This aside  the huge surplus capital available in the insurance industry is being used for acquisitions and mergers  share buyback and dividend hikes  These should lead to long term growth Therefore  despite no upward interest rate movement  we believe insurers that have braced themselves for a dovish interest rate environment will be winners Our PicksWe have picked up some stocks with a Strong Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  that have witnessed an upward revision to their earnings estimates  expected earnings growth above industry and strong fundamentals   You can see  The Allstate Corp    NYSE ALL    carrying a

31902,253417,CINF,The Perfect Pullback Rx  These 28 Upcoming Dividend Hikes,opinion,"You can double your money in perfectly safe  well known dividend stocks  But only if you know the secret  Novice income investors gravitate toward higher current yields  but often that can result in hitching your sleigh to stagnant stocks with equally stagnant dividends 
For monster total returns  we want to pay attention to dividend increases  Because these hikes don t just bump up the yield on your initial investment   they also trigger stock price increases  too  If a stock is already paying out 3  but then juices its payout by 10   investors will see that new 3 3  yield and buy more shares  That buying will drive the stock s price up  and the yield back down  eventually toward 3  
Just consider Visa  NYSE V   which almost always sports a current yield of less than 1   Is it a dividend laggard  Hardly  As of November s 19  jolt to the payout  Visa stock now pays 150  more than what it did in early 2014   and shares have chased the dividend 175  higher 
Ignore Visa s Tiny Yield at Your Own Peril 
A laundry list of other dividend growers are about to shine  In fact  dozens of companies are expected to crank their payouts higher during the first month of the new year 
If you re looking for other dividend powerhouses  look no further  I m going to show you 28 stocks to put on your radar in January  including a close look at some of the more notable future raisers 
The LPs
Master limited partnerships  MLPs  can be a chore thanks to their onerous taxation rules and the additional K 1 form you have to fill out come tax time 
But many energy MLPs are outstanding distribution raisers that can keep the spigot on even when oil prices are in a slump  just like they are right now   That s because many of these companies are essentially just toll takers   they re fee based businesses such as pipelines that just collect money as oil and gas pass through their infrastructure 
This business is doing so well that several of them are hiking their distributions each and every quarter  Here s a quick look at 11 that are on tap for increases shortly after New Year s 

Dividend Spotlight  Enterprise Products Partners  EPD   EPD is one of the bluest blue chips of the MLP space  It has executed  38 billion in organic growth projects since it went public in 1998  tacked on an additional  26 billion in acquisitions in that time  and has another  6 billion in growth capital projects in the works 
Its operations are expansive  including 

Roughly 50 000 miles of natural gas  NGL  crude oil and other pipelines
260 million barrels of NGL  petro and other liquid storage capacity
14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity
28 natural gas processing plants
18 export facilities

It s also a distribution powerhouse  It has been hiking its payout for 20 consecutive years  which is outstanding enough  but what s truly impressive is that has come across 57 consecutive quarterly payout hikes  It s not explosive distribution growth   EPD has averaged about 5 6  expansion over the past half decade   but it s consistent and reliable 
Expect No  58 in a row to come sometime in the middle of January 2019 
The Aristocrats
The Dividend Aristocrats aren t always the best place to find lofty current income  unless you tap the High Yield Aristocrats   but there s literally no beating them for longevity 
As a reminder  Dividend Aristocrats are companies that have raised their annual payouts at least once a year for a minimum of 25 consecutive years  Right now  that s a list of 53 dividend stocks that have all maintained their payouts through at least the Great Recession  though many of them survived the 2000 02 bear market and other downturns  too  That s impressive   and at least six streaks will become a little more impressive in January 

Dividend Spotlight  Cincinnati Financial  NASDAQ CINF   OK  I ll be blunt  This company could bore the paint off a wall  Cincinnati Financial is a property and casualty insurance provider that operates via several subsidiaries  with roots dating back to 1950 
The stock  on the other hand   what it s doing is pretty exciting 
For one  CINF is one of just a handful of success stories for a beaten up financial sector  The broader Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  is off 12   led lower by miserable performances from the likes of Bank of America  NYSE BAC  and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   But Cincinnati Financial is beating it and the  lower  broader market with 5  returns  helped in part by a third quarter report that saw it grow profits by nearly 45  year over year 
Cincinnati Financial Is a Bright Spot in an Ugly Sector 
Also  Cincinnati Financial is just about a month away from its 58th consecutive dividend increase  expected to come in January  That s a stunningly resilient payout   one that has survived six bear markets 
The Best of the Rest
January in general is a big month for dividend increases  with dozens upon dozens of companies expected to bump up their payouts  That includes everything from small regional banks to REITs to big  blue chip companies 
The following set of likely dividend raisers covers several sectors  from tech to industrials to finance  as well as a couple of REITs 

Dividend Spotlight  BlackRock  NYSE BLK   I want to highlight BlackRock   the global investment management company that s responsible for the elite iShares ETF brand   for two reasons  including one that should interest every dividend growth investor reading this article 
First off  if you re a potential BlackRock investor  understand that the company has been working overtime on the income front  BLK s dividend has been juiced by 86  in the past five years alone  putting it in a rare class of quick dividend doublers  There s some price potential there  too  BlackRock s share price has been pretty good about chasing its dividend higher  but the recent broad market selloff has taken BLK with it and skewed this balance 
When BlackRock  BLK  Restores Order  Look Out Above  
Second is something every investor needs to pay attention to when chasing dividend growers in 2019 
Republicans  sweeping business tax cuts drove many companies to usher in major off schedule dividend hikes  including BlackRock  BLK kicked off the year with its regularly slotted hike  15   for the record   then announced in July that it would tack on another roughly 9  
It s possible  however unlikely  that some companies  especially non Aristocrats  that doubled up on increases in 2018 might not raise payouts at all in 2019  What seems more likely is that several of these firms may unleash more modest hikes next year 
Don t be discouraged  Companies felt incentivized  even pressured  to share the tax wealth in 2018  A lean 2019 might just be a natural counterweight  Look at the whole picture  or you risk overlooking some real income powerhouses

Many of the dividend growers on this list will deliver sizzling payouts   if you give them several years to build up momentum  Right now  though  many of them actually deliver some pretty lean yields 
That s fine by me  Because I ve recently discovered a way to take low paying and even non paying blue chips like Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and squeeze giant distributions out of them en route to nearly 30  in annual total returns 
I know it sounds crazy  But this is one of the best income opportunities I ve come across in years   so much so that I ve put my money where my mouth is and put my own personal accounts to work in it 
Even Wall Street s most growth first and income last blue chips such as Google parent Alphabet can become  double threat  holdings that put traditional dividend payers like Procter   Gamble  PG  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  to shame  But you and I really can take stocks like Visa  sub 1  dividend  and Alphabet  not a penny in dividends   and collect both double digit upsides and 8  plus dividends out of them 
That s the income generating genius behind my new discovery   Dividend Conversion Machines  
These stocks have specialized businesses that allow them to do what other stocks simply can t  They wring high single digit dividends from some of the most skinflint companies in America  One of my Dividend Conversion Machines takes Visa s 0 6  payouts and magnifies it to 9 2   Another one can take Google s 0  and produce a 9 4  yield out of thin air 
This isn t a complex options strategy  It s not high risk derivatives  It s certainly not the  next Bitcoin   This is a stunningly safe strategy that s essentially the same as buying traditional American blue chip stocks  In fact  I ll even show you the four steps you ll need right now

Instead of entering a buy order for  say  Disney by entering the stock s  DIS  symbol  enter the 3 letter code for one of my 4 Dividend Conversion Machines instead 
Instead of getting Disney s 1 6  dividend  start collecting an 8   income stream 

That s it 
The incredible investments I m going to show you in just a second are 100  as safe as investing in  stodgy  blue chips   except you get retirement enhancing dividends and BIG upside too  In fact  they even have another leg up on traditional blue chips  They pay out their dividends monthly  which is ideal for retirees who need that income to pay their bills   and ideal for investors planning for retirement because those dividends will compound even faster

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Disney  DIS   United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  and U S  Bancorp  USB   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Disney s shares have increased  0 1  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry s  1 2  decline in that same time period  The Zacks analyst thinks blockbuster performance of Disney movies at the box office is aiding Studio segment growth  
Moreover  the company s top line is expected to benefit from the solid line up of big budget movies slated to be released over the next 18 months  Solid content portfolio at ESPN  as well as impressive Disney  original content line up  expected to release in 2019  is also expected to win subscribers rapidly  However  Disney s ongoing investments in its technology platform are expected to keep margins under pressure  
Additionally  higher programming costs at ESPN remains a concern  Higher labor related costs and softness experienced in tourism and consumer confidence in China are likely to impact Parks   Resorts segment in the near term 
 You can   
Shares of United Parcel Service have outperformed the Zacks Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo industry over the past year  losing  27  vs   30 9   The Zacks analyst expects United Parcel Service s bottom line in the fourth quarter of 2018 to be hurt by high costs  Detailed results should be out on Jan 31  
UPS  high capital expenditures are pushing up costs  For 2018  capital expenditures are projected between  6 5 billion and  7 billion  representing an increase in excess of 100  from 2016 levels  With the company having Chinese exposure  trade disputes between United States and China also represent a headwind for UPS  
On the other hand  robust e commerce growth is a major tailwind for the company and should aid the top line in the fourth quarter  The company s efforts to reward investors through share buybacks and dividend payouts are also impressive  Additionally  the current tax law is a boon for U S  based transportation companies like UPS 
 You can   
U S  Bancorp s shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the past six months  losing  7 5  vs  13 5   The company possesses an impressive earnings surprise history  beating expectations in all the trailing four quarters  Earnings estimates have remained stable lately  ahead of the company s fourth quarter 2018 results  
The Zacks analyst thinks U S  Bancorp s prospects will likely get support from its solid business model  core franchise  lower tax rate  rising interest rate and diverse revenue streams  Also  its organic growth remains solid and will likely benefit from the improving economic scenario  
U S  Bancorp remains well poised to grow through acquisitions  However  escalating expenses due to its ongoing investments in technology and likely increase in legal expenses remain concerns

been maintaining a sustained operational performance over the past many years  The company s continued focus on conservative pricing and reservation practices has led to its overall profitability The Accident and Health insurer s growth trajectory pertaining to premium income can be primarily attributable to its steady improvement in the same across the company s line of businesses  With the metric witnessing a four year CAGR of 3 1   we expect the momentum to be alive in the near term on the back of the aforementioned driving factor Additionally  Unum s largest operating segments  namely Unum U S  and Colonial Life have been crucial in boosting the insurer s overall performance over a considerable period of time  Better than expected performance at these two business lines has been contributing to higher premiums Moreover  a constant persistency across the segment s business lines coupled with higher sales volumes benefited Unum U S  and Colonial Life to a large extent  thereby resulting in operating income growth Gradual improvement in interest rates has been driving the company s investment results and we expect better investment income in the future on the back of higher

adding shareholder value  the company has been indulging in shareholder friendly moves like share buybacks and dividend hikes  In relation to share repurchase  the insurer resumed to buying back

31979,253494,CINF,Mercury General s  MCY  Steady Premium Growth Is A Big Boost,opinion,Mercury General Corporation   NYSE MCY    which engages in writing personal automobile insurance in the United States  has been witnessing premium growth over a considerable period of time  This sustained improvement can be attributable to higher average premiums per policy arising from rate increases pertaining to the California private passenger automobile and homeowners lines of insurance business as well as growth in the number of private passenger automobile and homeowners policies written in the same region Further  direct premiums written at the company s line of insurance businesses on the basis of states  have been experiencing a growth trajectory and we expect this consistent increase to also contribute to total premium growth in the near term Riding on the strength of rising interest rates  the company has been witnessing better investment results over the last several quarters  We expect this momentum to remain on the back of higher short term interest rates  better yields obtained from specific classes of investments along  increased invested assets and a lower tax incidence Sustained growth in premiums along with solid investment results should continue to aid  witnessing a five year CAGR  2012 2017  of 4 2   In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year revenues is pegged at  3 5 billion  reflecting an increase of 5 5  on a year over year basis while for 2019  the consensus mark stands at  3 7 billion  representing a rise of 5 6  Additionally  top line growth coupled with expense management has been contributing to net margin expansion that has improved in the last few quarters Mercury General has been increasing rates in most states  which in turn  is driving improvement in the combined ratio  For a P C insurer  this metric is important as it is a measure for underwriting profitability and we expect underwriting results to fare modestly in the near term  The insurer s catastrophe reinsurance treaty provides for  205 million of coverage in excess of its  10 million retention However  the insurer expects combined ratio in the fourth quarter to be higher than other quarters of the year  given increased loss frequency and higher severities due weather related events Mercury General boasts a strong liquidity position with its cash flow from operations ensuring to satisfy its liquidity requirements without the forced sale of investments  Moreover  the insurer s debt to total capital ratio has been improving over the last couple of quarters Furthermore  return on equity  a measure of the profitability of a business in relation to the equity  has been improving over the last few quarters The company also has a strong capital management policy in place that enhances its shareholder value through dividend hikes  Currently  the insurer s dividend yield stands at 4 61   noticeably better than the industry s yield of 3 34  The stock also carries a favorable  of A  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum with the score being a weighted combination of all three factors  Back tested results have shown that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a top Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer best investment opportunities For this Zacks  1 Ranked P C insurer  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings is pegged at  2 80  indicating a year over year surge of 70 7  and for 2019  the consensus estimate for the same stands at  3 88  depicting a 38 4  year over year rise Shares

32047,253562,CINF,Hurricane Irma  These Insurance Stocks Have The Most Exposure To Florida,opinion,"On Thursday  Hurricane Irma continued its path of destruction through the Caribbean after hitting Barbuda  St  Barth lemy  St  Martin  Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands  as well as the U S  Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico yesterday 
Many industries have felt the impact of Irma already  and the storm has yet to make landfall here in the United States According to the National Weather Service  the storm is  to hit the central Bahamas by Friday  and then make landfall near Miami  Florida by Sunday morning as a Category 4 hurricane   bringing high winds  abundant rainfall and potentially dangerous storm surge  
From the greater travel industry to airlines and restaurants  companies that have broad exposure to Florida have seen their shares slide on anticipation of Irma s impending arrival  For more information  read Irma  as well as the aftermath of Harvey  has also taken a toll on the insurance market  and this past Tuesday marked one of the worst days of 2017 for insurance stocks  Today is no better  and the S P 500 Insurance Industry Index  IUX  is down over 2  in afternoon trading  on pace for what could be its worst daily performance since Brexit lows back in June 2016  The SPDR S P Insurance ETF   LON KIE   is down nearly 2 5

Experts are already predicting that Irma could be the biggest ever in insured damage in the U S   even surpassing the record held by Hurricane Katrina in 2005  According to Barclays  Jay Gelb   In a worst case scenario  catastrophe modelers AIR Worldwide and Karen Clark and Co  have estimated a repeat of the 1926 Miami hurricane could result in  125 130 billion of insured damage

represent an inconsistent and weak risk adjusted capital position of the group  Also  the ratings affirmations denote the group s sub par investment yields and the returns on its investment portfolio  besides the recent trajectory of recording adverse prior year loss reserve development However  gradual improvement in underwriting and operational performance over the past few years  along with management s substantial experience and competence in its niche market  serving the public s  for hire  auto market  might partially offset the aforementioned negative rating factors In future  ASI pool can expect to see a positive rating action on the back of its improving operational performance or additional improvement in the risk adjusted capitalization levels  However  a slump in the pool s underwriting and operational performance  declining risk adjusted capitalization level that cannot support the current ratings  along with a trend of recording material unfavorable loss reserve development  might result in negative rating action Details Behind the Ratings of Global Liberty InsuranceThe ratings affirmation of Global Liberty Insurance represents its experience within the New York City metropolitan area s for hire livery vehicle market and a robust capital position However  the unit s unstable underwriting and operational performance in recent years has partially offset the abovementioned positive rating factors Notably  the Global Liberty Insurance s negative outlook signifies the rating agency s distress relating to the adequacy of the unit s loss reserves as well as the current volatility in its underwriting and operational performance Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investor confidence plus

Casualty and Surety Company of America s constrained product diversification  together with the adverse effect that ongoing competitive property casualty markets and difficult macroeconomic conditions

32084,253599,CINF,Chubb  CB  And Subsidiaries  Ratings Reiterated By A M  Best,opinion,Chubb Limited   NYSE CB   and subsidiaries  ratings were retained by the credit rating giant  A M  Best  The rating agency has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating  FSR  of A    Superior  and the Long Term Issuer Credit Ratings  Long Term ICR  of  aa   for Chubb s North American property casualty arms  These units comprise members of the Chubb Bermuda Insurance Ltd   Chubb Tempest Reinsurance Ltd   ACE American Group  Chubb Group of Insurance Companies  Chubb Atlantic Indemnity Ltd  as well as Chubb Tempest Reinsurance Ltd  s parent company   Chubb Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd   At the same time  the rating agency has reiterated the FSR of A    Superior  and the Long Term ICR of  aa   of Chubb European Group Limited   Additionally  the rating agency has affirmed the FSR of A   Superior  and the Long Term ICRs of  aa   for Combined Insurance Company of America and Combined Life Insurance Company of New York  collectively known as the Combined companies  This apart  A M  Best has upgraded the Long Term ICR from  a  to  a   and also reiterated the FSR of A  Excellent  for Chubb Seguros Panama S A  Furthermore  ACE Life Insurance Company s FSR of A   Excellent  and its Long Term ICR of  a   were also affirmed by the credit rating giant   Finally  the rating agency has affirmed the ultimate parent company  Chubb s  Long Term ICR of  a   as well as the Long Term Issue Credit Ratings  Long Term IR  and the same of Chubb INA Holdings Inc  The outlook for these aforementioned credit ratings remained stable   Notably  following this news release  shares of Chubb had inched up 0 3  in the last trading session   Ratings Representation of the North American Property Casualty Subsidiaries The ratings of the core North American property casualty units represent each subsidiary s solid risk adjusted capitalization  outstanding underwriting and overall operational performances  along with continued competitive advantages within its broad standard and specialty commercial plus high net worth personal insurance businesses  The ratings also acknowledge the units  all inclusive and rooted enterprise risk management  strict underwriting standards  solid franchise recognition and accessibility to additional capital mechanisms offered by the property and casualty insurer  Chubb   However  intense competition within the market  exposure to catastrophe losses and a modest level of historical adverse loss reserve development  related to asbestos and environmental  A E  liabilities  can partially offset the abovementioned positive rating factors   The rating agency anticipates the catastrophe losses   following Hurricanes Harvey  Irma and Maria  along with the recent earthquakes in Mexico   to remain within Chubb s risk tolerance limits  Notably  the rating agency will continue to supervise the developments connected to such events and their apparent impact on the insurer itself   Details Behind the Ratings of Some Other Subsidiaries The ratings of another unit  Chubb Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd   represent its ownership of Chubb Tempest Reinsurance Ltd   forming the majority of the company s financial profile along with the benefit of being part of the Chubb organization   However  the abovementioned arm s limited stand alone business profile  its modest scale in comparison to subsidiaries and affiliates as well as the increased risk profile of variable annuity reinsurance business  might partially offset the positive rating factors   On the other hand  the ratings of ACE Life Insurance Company reflect benefits received by the unit for being part of the parent Chubb organization  together with the sufficient risk adjusted capital position  which supports the unit s risk profile   However  its narrow business profile and statutory losses that resulted in decreasing its absolute capital position in the past few years  have a possibility to offset the aforementioned positive rating factors  Additionally  the Combined companies  ratings represent the perks they receive for belonging to the Chubb organization and their continued revenue growth trajectory  to name a few   However  their current volatile earnings performance  an instable capital reserve and an elevated credit risk of the investment portfolio  are likely to offset the positive rating factors   Interestingly  the upgrade made to Chubb Seguros Panama S A  s Long Term ICR takes into account its consistent solid risk adjusted capitalization  extended business profile as well as the company s association with the parent entity  to name a few  However  the unit s recent thriving market share within its insurance industry and the stiff competition within its insurance sector  can lead to a rating downgrade in the future  Lastly  the ratings of Chubb European Group Limited consider its brilliant stand alone risk adjusted capitalization  sustained operational performance and an outstanding business profile as commendable positives  This apart  the unit s ratings derive benefits obtained from Chubb  the ultimate parent company   Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an instrumental role in retaining investor confidence plus maintaining a stock s credit worthiness  On the other hand  rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances  We believe such ratings to help Chubb retain investors  trust as well as write more businesses going forward   Zacks Rank and Share Price Movement Currently  Chubb carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Shares of the company have gained 10 6  year to date  underperforming the  s increase of 12 6   However  we expect sustained

Q1Earnings Scorecard  as ofThursday  April 20th 
Including all of this morning s releases  we now have Q1 results from 82 S P 500 members that combined account for 21  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 82 index members are up  15 4  on  4 9  higher revenues  with 72  beating EPS estimates and 59 8  beating revenue estimates 
This is better earnings and revenue growth performance than we have seen from this group of 82 S P 500 members in other recent periods  even after adjusting for the strong growth from the Finance sector which has a heavy presence in the results at this stage 
For the Finance sector  we now have Q1 results from 47 7  of the sector s market capitalization in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Finance companies are up  23 4  from the same period last year on  7 7  higher revenues  with 69 2  beating EPS estimates and 57 7  beating revenue estimates  This is better earnings and revenue growth rate for the Finance sector than we have seen in other recent periods  though most of these stocks have been struggling lately as a result of the downtrend in interest rates 
Excluding the Finance sector  total earnings for the rest of the S P 500 companies that have reported would be up  8 7  on  3 7  higher revenues from the year earlier level 
Looking at Q1 as a whole  combining the actual results from the 82 index members with estimates from the still to come 418 companies  total earnings are expected to be up  8 8  from the same period last year on  6 2  higher revenues  the best earnings and revenue growth pace in more than two years 
Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including IBM  IBM   Abbott  ABT  and Dow Chemical  DOW  
IBM shares did reasonably well this year  but the stock has lost ground following the disappointing quraterly report that appear to have raised fresh doubts about the company s ability to reposition itself for the changing technological landscape  Although IBM has been expanding product portfolio into newer technologies like Blockchain  Quantum computing and Containers through frequent acquisitions  these are still in a nascent stage and will take some time to contribute meaningfully towards top line growth  However  sluggish IT spending particularly on on premise and data center hardware and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns   You can  
Shares of Abbott have gained  8 1  over the last three months  outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharma sector which has gained  5 7  over the same period  Abbott exceeded expectations on both the earnings and sales fronts during the first quarter  The Zacks analyst likes how Abbott has been reshaping its portfolio through strategic acquisitions divestitures for long term growth  The St  Jude Medical buyout will complement its cardiovascular devices business  Also  the company s plans to focus on selling its portfolio in core therapeutic areas  Meanwhile  weakness in the nutrition business in China and sluggish growth in the Venezuelan market is a concern   You can  
Dow Chemical shares have gained  7 7  over the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry  up  3 6  over the same period   The Zacks analyst likes the planned merger with DuPont  NYSE DD   which is expected to create significant synergies  Dow should also gain from cost synergies associated with Dow Corning Silicones business and its strategic investments in the U S  Gulf Coast and the Middle East  Estimates for first quarter 2017 have also been stable of late  However  Dow s agriculture business remains affected by depressed crop commodity prices  The company also faces pricing headwinds  feedstock cost pressure as well as weak demand in the energy market  Earnings estimate for the first quarter 2017 has been stable of late   You can

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Disney  DIS   Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR   and Monsanto  MON  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Disney s shares have outperformed the Zacks Media Conglomerates sector over the last one year  gaining  10 3  vs   7 4   driven by the blockbuster performance of its movies and its vibrant Parks   Resorts division  The Zacks analyst likes its impressive lineup of big budget movies up to 2018  Further  it is focused on deploying capital towards expansion of the Parks and Resorts business to create long term growth opportunities  But over the last few quarters  Disney has been weighed down by concerns about ESPN whose future growth has been clouded by the evolving media landscape as a result of  cord cutting  and the steady migration of subscribers to online and digital platforms  Identical to performances in the past few quarters  ESPN disappointed in the second quarter again 
 You can  
Shares of Charter Communications outperformed the Zacks Cable TV industry over the past three months   1 7  vs   2 4    buoyed by the buyout of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks  The Zacks analyst is particularly optimistic about these acquisitions since they have boosted the company s fiber suite  bottom line and free cash flow  Following the buyouts  the company launched a new Spectrum TV app to unite the viewing experience of these two big cable companies on a single podium  Charter Communications is also planning to execute field trials for 5G wireless network and plans to enter the U S  wireless industry in collaboration with Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA   However  the company operates in the saturated and competitive multi channel U S  video market which  along with high debt levels  is a major concern 
 You can  
Monsanto s shares have outperformed the Zacks Agricultural Products industry over the last three months  gaining  3  vs   2 5   The company reported better than expected third quarter fiscal 2017 results  The Zacks analyst thinks increasing demand for crop yield enhancing products  stronger innovation and success of Bayer s buyout deal will bolster Monsanto s top  and bottom line performance in the quarters ahead  However  stiff rivalry within the seeds  traits and agricultural chemical industry exposes the company to risks of market share loss  Moreover  a stronger U S  dollar or weaker pricing conditions might weigh over the company s near term results

Boeing s shares have surged  56 9  over the past one year  outperforming the Zacks Aerospace   Defense sector  which gained  24 6  during the same time period  The Zacks analyst stresses that rising demand for its commercial airplanes on the back of steady improvement in passenger and freight traffic is the major factor behind the surge in Boeing shares 
Recently  the company released 20 year market outlook  as per which it forecasts jetliner demand will increase by 3 6  over this period  Further  the company s defense business stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs  strong order bookings and order backlog

32115,253630,CINF,NOBL  Pairing Dividend Aristocrats With Bank ETFs,opinion,"Income seeking investors know all about the dividend aristocrats  Those are the companies that have been raising their dividends for at least 25 straight years  They re ideal for retirees and just about anybody else looking for dividend income in their portfolio because of their predictability 
They re not necessarily the highest yielding stocks but their steadiness is their real appeal 
Not surprisingly  one sector of the market that is essentially absent from the list of aristocrats is the banks  Any dividends they were paying were essentially wiped out during the financial crisis  Consider for a moment my favorite dividend aristocrat fund  the ProShares S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF  NYSE NOBL   As of the end of the second quarter  it had roughly 10  of assets in the financial sector  But look at who that 10  is comprised of  T Rowe Price Group Inc  NASDAQ TROW   Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN  and Cincinnati Financial  NASDAQ CINF   That s two insurance companies and two asset managers  Not a single bank to be found 
If you ve followed the financial sector  you probably know that a month ago  the Federal Reserve  of all 34 banks that it was reviewing as part of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  CCAR   Following the announcement  many of the banks unleashed plans for dividend increases and share buybacks  Citigroup  NYSE C  doubled its dividend  while Bank of America  NYSE BAC  raised its by 60   Other big banks such as Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  and JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  all now have yields in the 2 3  range  Bottom line  Dividend seekers may have written off the banks  but it s now time to put them back on the radar 
Investors who focus primarily on the aristocrats for income are likely missing out on the dividend growth potential that now exists in the banking space  Dividend Aristocrats ETF shareholders who want to add exposure to the financial sector may wish to pair the fund up with a financials ETF  None of the biggest financials ETFs yields more than 2   so you won t be getting a yield boost  unless you want to venture into riskier areas such as foreign or small cap banks   The main benefit is a more diversified income stream 
The largest of the financial ETFs  of course  is the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF      It has about half of the fund invested in banks  but also has more than 40  of the fund invested in just five names   Citigroup  NYSE C   Bank of America  NYSE BAC   JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  and Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   The Vanguard Financials ETF  NYSE VFH  would be the low cost alternative  It has about 45  of the fund dedicated to both diversified and regional banks  The Fidelity MSCI Financials ETF  NYSE FNCL  is the cheapest option with an expense ratio of just 8 basis points  The iShares US Financials ETF  NYSE IYF  is another broad financial sector possibility 
Investors looking for more of a pure banking play will want to consider the SPDR S P Bank ETF  MX KBE   a fund which has over 85  of the fund dedicated to banks but also has a smattering of asset management firms  mortgage finance companies and diversified financial services businesses mixed in  The SPDR S P Regional Banking ETF  MX KRE  is completely invested in regional banking names  but omits the big banks 
Thanks to the financial crisis  there are virtually no banking names that meet the strict dividend aristocrat criteria  but the sector is looking more intriguing now as a dividend growth play than at any time over the past decade  Pairing a dividend aristocrat portfolio with a bank ETF could be a profitable combination for income seekers 
The ProShares S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF  NYSE NOBL  was unchanged in premarket trading Thursday  Year to date  NOBL has gained 8 86   versus a 11 72  rise in the benchmark S P 500 index during the same period 
NOBL currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A  Strong Buy   and is ranked  14 of 117 ETFs in the Large Cap Blend ETFs category ",2017-07-27,ETF Daily News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pairing-dividend-aristocrats-with-bank-etfs-(nobl)-200203831,200203831
32116,253631,CINF,The Week Ahead  Time To Raise Price Targets ,opinion,"With President Trump taking vacation at the same time as Congress and a light data calendar  what will the pundits feast upon  Corporate earnings results and new stock market records mean that the price targets at the start of the year are now obsolete  For many  the question will be 
Is it time to raise price targets 
Last Week Recap
Last week featured earnings news and generally positive economic data 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a chart of S P 500 market price moves 

The key feature is the lack of volatility  Prices moved only about 0 6  from top to bottom 
The Silver Bullet
As I indicated recently I am moving the Silver Bullet award to a standalone feature  rather than an item in WTWA  Last week s deserving   his second award   We also posted the list of all past winners  I have a great candidate for the coming week as well  I hope that readers and past winners will help me in giving special recognition to those who help to keep data honest  As always  nominations are welcome 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic news last week was generally positive  
The Good
ISM manufacturing improved and beat expectations  registering 56 3  Here is Scott Grannis s chart of this index versus the economy  He calls it one of his 

Corporate earnings remain strong 
 that a record percentage of companies are beating expectations on both earnings and sales   that references to the Trump Administration effect on earnings have declined dramatically   Contra    notes some weakness  


Brian Gilmartin reports the strength in forward earnings estimates 

Tracking the year over year growth in the forward estimate 


8 4 17   9 75 


7 7 17   9 58 


6 9 17   9 35 


5 5 17   9 80 


4 7 17   8 30 


The  forward 4 quarter EPS  has still not cracked 10  y y growth  and it may not  since the earnings compare s get tougher with the 3rd and 4th quarters since crude oil prices were less of a drag in the back half of 2016  but you also have Financials possibly to starting to enter a period where revenue and EPS growth could accelerate 


The forward estimate trends remain positive  For S P 500  it s one of the best leading indicators we have 


Pending home sales increased 1 5 
GDP estimates are higher  The  forecast is showing strength  Will it hold up this quarter 

Long leading indicators remain positive   has plenty of important data you probably do not see elsewhere 
Employment showed solid increases
ADP rose to 178K  slightly beating expectations for private employment  This is a good independent measure of private employment changes 
Initial jobless claims declined slightly to 240K   illustrate how dramatic this level really is 


Payroll employment showed a solid  if unspectacular  gain 
Unemployment declined
Hourly wages improved
More of the unemployed are longer term  Bob Dieli is an expert tracker of all things employment  He is concerned about the early shift in this ratio  and is monitoring the change 

The Bad
Construction spending declined 1 3  versus expectations of a gain of 0 5  
Rail Traffic was slightly lower     Contrary interpretation of the data from 
ISM non manufacturing declined to 53 9 missing expectations of 56 9  By my rules  this change in the diffusion index  showing growth at a slower pace than the month before  is  bad  
Personal income showed no growth versus an expected gain of 0 3    make the adjustments for inflation and transfer payments  The result is a bit less distressing 

Auto sales missed expectations for nearly all companies  The aggregate pace is now below 17 million vehicles per year   that cars are lasting longer  Fair enough  but still not good for the economy 
The Ugly
I am disturbed by the Pew survey report  Via Statista and   that most Republicans  58   see colleges and universities has having a negative effect on  the way things are going in the country   I confess my bias from many years of experience  but that experience also confers knowledge 

It was also an   where ratings continue to decline  It was their worst month in 22 years  with Fox Business taking the lead 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
It is a light economic calendar  Inflation data are still not very interesting  JOLTS provides information about labor market structure  but few use it for that purpose  There is not much FedSpeak 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
With President Trump joining Congress on vacation  one source of news  and volatility  might be absent  The light calendar leaves plenty of news time to fill  Expect the punditry to fill it  whether there is news or not 
Into the vacuum  I expect plenty of talk about stocks and markets setting new records  Analysts were  on Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  for example  after the positive earnings news and outlook  Or was it just because old targets were hit  I expect that scenario to be repeated  both for individual stocks and the market overall  Pundits will be asking 
Is it time to raise our price targets 
Here are some viewpoints 
Everything is over priced  My price targets will eventually be proven right 
I want to stay on the company s good side  Access is essential  I ll keep my  buy  rating and raise the target 
The market might be OK for a bit longer  but the twelve year outlook is poor 
Everything looks really good   just like we see before a big decline 
The rally is based upon dumb money  the Fed  Trump  blind ETF investing 
Stocks are due for a big correction 
Targets should change with the fundamentals   especially earnings expectations 
We monitor the stocks in our portfolio as well as those on our watch lists  We review price targets frequently  We sell when a stock reaches or approaches our target  Apple is a good example  We sold it after holding it for many profitable years  including times when many analysts hated the company and said the low multiple was deserved  What has changed  Adding debt  much higher enterprise value multiples  and the analyst lovefest are factors  You must choose companies and hold on when others are skeptical  Be willing to sell when they join in  Apple is still a great company with wonderful products  but it is much more expensive 
As usual  I ll have more in my Final Thought

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be this wonderful   describing what you would hear in an honest business news report  Here is an excerpt for the flavor  but you will enjoy the entire post 

Three dozen political pundits yelled at each other on TV in front of an audience of 75 million  Meanwhile  a couple hundred million people were reasonable and productive in front of an audience of zero

Market Outlook
I strongly recommend that investors read a variety of sources  This means a focus on those using objective data 
The  covers many topics in his excellent weekly updates  Of special note is his discussion of sentiment 

The fear of new highs that has been explained here in previous missives played out this week with the latest report from   The Dow 30 just crossed another 1 000 point threshold  most major U S  equity averages are at or near all time highs  and bearish sentiment spiked from 24 3  up to 32 1   That s the highest weekly reading since mid May  and the largest weekly increase since March  Bullish sentiment stands at 36   that makes 135 consecutive weeks below 50  

 has one of his typical chart packs  describing the no boom  no bust economy 
The 1000 point thresholds are falling rapidly     When I was  they asked for my current opinion  I said that the next 8 10  would be pretty easy  We are there  More on my take in the Final Thoughts  Bespoke points out that retracements to prior levels have become less frequent  despite the narrower percentage 

Personal Finance
Seeking Alpha Senior Editor Gil Weinreich has an interesting topic every day  This week I especially enjoyed  on cuts in employer retirement support  As he frequently does  Gil raises a topic of importance both to advisors and to individual investors  I read it daily  and you will enjoy it as well 
Final Thoughts
Risk  Before even considering price targets  there is an important first step  Risk Assessment 
Risks should be tangible and measurable   not a fuzzy prediction of danger or disaster  The most important risk is usually a peak and decline in the business cycle  the technical definition of a recession   I watch this closely  and so should you 
Risks are present in both directions  Upside risk happens when you exit a market which proceeds to rally without you  Most people find the re entry psychology to be impossible 
Reward  Changing your price target just because the old one was hit makes no sense  Targets should relate to the fundamental prospects for the stock  bond  or market  Here is a simple method 
Consider the expected return from the investment  a forward looking process
Compare this return to the expected rate of inflation  Most people would love to see a 5  CD rate  but no so much if inflation were 8  
Compare the return to other investments of similar risk 
Consider events which could add to profits or reduce inflation

32174,253689,CINF,Week In Review  USD Slumps  Stocks Stagnate  Commodities Rebound,opinion,"by Eli Wright
The US dollar correction continued last week and major Wall Street Indices  especially the S P 500 and Dow remained range bound  Additionally  markets were disappointed that President elect Trump s Wednesday press conference failed to provide any real clarity on his administrations platforms and policies 
Over the course of the week the dollar declined two percent  the Dow fell 0 4 percent  the S P 500 shed 0 12 percent  and the NASDAQ gained a mere one percent  while Bitcoin plummeted to its lowest prices in nearly a month before regaining some of its momentum at the end of the week 
Dollar dropped  commodities rose
In the immediate aftermath of Trump s speech  the dollar weakened yet further against most major currencies  This phase of the dollar s correction began in mid December  after the Fed hike  but in tandem with interest rates  it appears to be heading for a retracement 

The euro  pound  yen  yuan  and Swiss franc all ended the week up versus the USD  as did the Australian and Canadian dollars 
The Dollar Index fell 1 1  on the week  to 101 19 
The weaker dollar made commodities more affordable and in the case of precious metals  more desirable  Oil and natural gas  which had been slumping through the first half of the week  rebounded approximately three percent each  Copper prices finished the week more than six percent higher  And in precious metals  gold and silver each gained approximately 2  on the week 
Bitcoin loses steam
Just two weeks ago  Bitcoin seemed unstoppable  as traders especially in China and India sought to hedge against local government currency manipulation and demonetization by central banks  The crypto currency soared to  1 135  and many analysts expected it would break through its all time high of  1 216 
However  when Chinese regulators threatened to focus a microscope on Bitcoin exchanges  traders quickly returned to the yuan and the digital currency dropped 20   It lost close to another  100 last week  before reversing slightly  to close at  822 67  It appears that China quietly made some  regarding Bitcoin trading terms on Friday  though a formal announcement has not yet been forthcoming 

Last Week s Biggest Stock Market Gainers
The S P 500 ended last week down 0 12   However  its best performing sectors all finished the week higher  The Consumer Discretionary Index rose 0 82   Information Technology gained 0 74   Materials closed up 0 48   and Industrials rose 0 13  

Source  Fidelity com
Consumer discretionary gains were led by Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF   which rose 6 17  on the week 
In information technology  semiconductor company Qorvo  NASDAQ QRVO  jumped 8 74   First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  rose 7 29   and Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   a company that assists in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips  gained 5 46  
Despite the S P s healthcare sector declining 0 11  on the week  Biotech company Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  was the S P s biggest gainer  It soared 14 9  after raising its Q4 sales expectations and unveiling new genetic sequencing technology at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco 
Three other healthcare companies also landed in the top ten  Medical device companies Zimmer Biomet  NYSE ZBH  and Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX  gained 9 76  and 7 54   respectively  and Cerner  NASDAQ CERN   a supplier of health information technology solutions  rose 7 99  

Rounding out the biggest weekly gainers were two companies on the S P Industrials Index  power company NRG  NYSE NRG   which rose 9 28   and regional airline Alaska Air  NYSE ALK   which gained 8 44  
Last Week s Biggest Losers
The hardest hit sectors in the S P last week were real estate   2 28    energy   1 93    and telecom   1 11   
Among REITs  Extra Space Storage  NYSE EXR  and Public Storage  NYSE PSA  were two of the biggest weekly decliners  dropping 8 27  and 6 23   respectively 
Energy companies in particular suffered  prompted by the nearly three percent fall in oil prices from the previous week  Additionally  though natural gas rose four percent last week  the gains were not enough to completely erase the effects of the previous week s twelve percent decline  Most oil and gas companies weren t among the bottom ten market decliners  but gas pipeline company Williams  NYSE WMB  made the list  as shares declined 11 91  
Frontier Communications  NASDAQ FTR  fell 5 60  
Overall  the healthcare sector fell 0 11   after comments by Mr  Trump during his press conference made it clear he intends to focus on lowering drug prices  Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  declined 6 22   Perrigo  NYSE PRGO   which produces over the counter and prescription drugs  dipped 8 74   specialty pharma manufacturer Endo International  NASDAQ ENDP  was the hardest hit of any company on the S P last week  finishing down 20 25  
Property and casualty insurer Cincinnati Financial  NASDAQ CINF  released an 8 K filing this past Thursday  the company downgraded expectations for its Q4 2016 earnings to include pre tax  catastrophic losses of approximately  125 million to  135 million due to property damages sustained in Hurricane Matthew  and damages caused by wildfires and wind in the Gatlinburg  Tennessee  area  Shares dropped 7 55  on the week 
Rounding out the bottom ten  Signet Jewelers  NYSE SIG  and industrial lighting specialist  Acuity Brands  NYSE AYI  

Signet Jewelers fell 8 43  after it downgraded its Q4 2017 earnings expectations on guidance of weak holiday sales  Same store sales decreased 4 6  compared to an increase of 5 1  in the nine weeks ended January 2  2016   prior year    And total sales decreased 5 1  compared to an increase of 5 3  in the prior year 
Acuity Brands fell nearly 15  last Monday after reported Q1 2017 earnings per share of  2 00 on  851 2M in revenue  lower than the  2 16 EPS on  895M in revenue that Wall Street had expected 
As well on Friday  the December Retail Sales release came in softer than expected  adding to the disappointment surrounding holiday season 2016 
What to expect this coming week
Markets in the US will be closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr  holiday  When trading resumes on Tuesday it s likely all involved will be looking for reasons to keep the Trump Rally going  Perhaps Q4 earnings will help 
With stocks trading at price to earnings valuations well above historical averages  many investors believe further gains will depend on strong earnings report cards over the next several weeks  Three big banks offered possible reasons to be optimistic  On Friday Bank of America  NYSE BAC  JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   all posted quarterly profits that exceeded analysts  expectations  Investors will no doubt be watching to see if that trend continues 
This coming week s economic calendar is light 
British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to speak about Brexit plans on Tuesday
US Core CPI on Wednesday should provide an updated on inflation  or lack thereoff  and pricing trends
Building Permits and Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index figures will be announced on Thursday
Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th President of the US on Friday",2017-01-15,Investing.com,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/week-in-review:-trump-speaks;-usd,-bitcoin-fall;-stocks-stagnate-200172461",200172461
32175,253690,CINF,5 Trade Ideas For Monday  CINF  CX  DRI  PKI  VLO,opinion,"5 Trade ideas excerpted from the detailed analysis and plan for premium subscribers 
Cincinnati Financial  NASDAQ CINF 
Cincinnati Financial  CINF  had a strong move higher through early 2016 until reaching a plateau in July  It held there for nearly 4 months until dropping back to the 200 day SMA at the beginning of November  Since then it has had a wild ride with a fast move higher into early December followed by a quick down move into January and now a second strong bounce 
Into the new week it is at minor resistance with the RSI moving into the bullish range and the MACD crossed up and rising  both supporting more upside  Look for a break over resistance to participate higher   

Cemex SAB de CV  NYSE CX 
CEMEX  CX  moved up from a June 2016 low  stalling in August  Since then it has made a series of higher highs and higher lows  leading to the current consolidation since mid February  Friday saw the price back at resistance with the RSI moving up and bullish while the MACD has crossed up  Look for a push through resistance to participate to the upside   
Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI 
Darden Restaurants  DRI  rose out of consolidation in November and quickly moved higher to a peak in early December 25  higher  It pulled back from there into the end of the year and had a weak bounce before retesting the pullback low and reversing higher 
It made a higher high  confirming a double bottom and then made a shallow pull back  Last week it pushed higher out of the pullback and ended the week at resistance  The RSI is moving up in the bullish zone while the MACD is crossing up  Look for a push over resistance to participate higher   
PerkinElmer  NYSE PKI 
PerkinElmer  PKI  went through a strong trend higher from 2011 until starting a broad consolidation in 2015  That broke to the upside in June 2016  but did not move very far  stalling in late July  Just a new consolidation range slightly higher with support roughly below the 200 day SMA 
Since a bottom in November though it has been moving higher and ended last week at a new all time high close  and over resistance  The RSI is bullish and rising and the MACD is moving up as well  Look for continuation to participate higher   

Valero Energy  NYSE VLO 
Valero Energy  VLO  moved higher off of a low in July last year  reaching a top in December  Since then it has consolidated moving mostly sideways  But since February began it has made higher highs and higher lows  a possible change of character to the upside  The RSI is rising and bullish while the MACD is crossed up and rising  Look for continuation to participate higher   
Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with the March FOMC meeting and Options Expiration in the rear view mirror  sees the markets to have come through unscathed  although with a new leader 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its short term uptrend while Crude Oil bounces off of support  The US Dollar Index looks to continue lower while US Treasuries are back into consolidation in the downtrend  The Shanghai Composite continues to drift slowly higher and Emerging Markets are fire moving higher 
Volatility looks to remain at abnormally low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   The SPY and QQQ look to consolidate on the shorter timeframe just as the IWM is ready to take over leadership to the upside  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

incur an expected loss of  15 billion to over  20 billion due to 25 weather events that occurred in the quarter  These have weighed on the underwriting results of insurers  and hurt their underwriting

stayed away from raising the same due to weak employment data and Brexit induced uncertainties  Therefore  investment income  which forms a major component of insurers  revenues  remained under pressure  But a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes bring some respite Nonetheless  insurers in this well capitalized industry remain well poised on the back of their expanded

32268,253783,CINF,Cincinnati Financial Takes Steps To Grow Biggest Unit  revised ,opinion,"In an effort to expand and drive greater returns from its Commercial lines business  Cincinnati Financial Corp  NASDAQ CINF      has announced personnel changes at the unit 
Per the change  Stephen Spray   currently the Senior Vice President   will replace Charles  Bud  Stoneburner II 
Stoneburner is the acting senior vice president in charge of the Commercial Lines insurance segment of Cincinnati Financial s main subsidiary  Cincinnati Insurance Co 
The change in leadership marks the completion of the company s transition plan announced in Nov 2015 
These changes reflect management s focus on expanding its Commercial Line insurance segment  which is one of the most profitable units and generates the major portion of the company s revenues 
In the first half of 2016  the company s Commercial Lines business produced  1 5 billion in revenues  which constituted more than half of Cincinnati Financial s total revenue and about triple of the next biggest category 
Historically  the Commercial Lines segment of the company has been displaying stellar top line performance  with a three year CAGR  2012 2015  of 29 2   This improvement came on the back of several growth initiatives as well as a gradual increase in insurance rates  Further  the company has implemented the use of predictive analytics to boost its pricing precision  while leveraging local relationships with its agents  The gradual improvement in pricing has driven growth and the company anticipates a moderate increase in its top line in the future  as stiff competition will partially offset moderate price increases 
The P C insurer s commercial lines segment is not only thriving  but is also highly profitable  The unit generated  76 million in underwriting profit during the first half of the year  In the past  too  underwriting profit increased at a three year CAGR  2012 2015  of 28 7   thereby reflecting the company s profitability 
Effective Jan 1  2016  Stephen Spray transitioned to the company s commercial insurance operations  This change established the leadership perpetuation plan for the segment Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider
Currently  Cincinnati Financial holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Investors interested in other stocks from the same space can consider Allied World Assurance Company Holdings  AG     Argo Group International Holdings  Ltd     and National Interstate Corp      Each of these stocks sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake  The original article  issued yesterday  August 25  2016  should no longer be relied upon  ",2016-08-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cincinnati-financial-takes-steps-to-grow-biggest-unit-(revised)-200150306,200150306
32276,253791,CINF,U S  P C Insurance  Buyer s Market Continues,opinion,"Looking beyond the implications of the uncertainty surrounding the interest rate hike  it is market softening that characterizes the Property   Casualty  P C  insurance industry  In order to retain renewals and secure new business  carriers are aggressively reducing rates and making the market advantageous for buyers 
The softening was evident right through 2015 and continued in the first half of 2016  Pricing primarily remained soft in the areas of commercial property  workers  compensation  general liability and business interruption  On the other hand  the commercial auto line has been witnessing an increase in rates 
By its very nature  a soft market causes lower underwriting profitability for carriers  as they prioritize market share gain over making more from premiums to exist in the market 
With the increasing appetite of carriers  their willingness to negotiate on terms and conditions  and enhanced capital strength  the market is likely to remain highly competitive in the quarter ahead 
However  greater demand for insurance  particularly following the emergence new insurable risks including cyber threat and endemic disease  will keep the business of P C insurers afloat 
Is Rate Hike Uncertainty Too Much of a Concern 
P C insurers are less sensitive to Fed interest rates than life insurers  but the sensitivity has both positive and negative directions  Whether the upside offsets the downside is yet to be seen  as there hasn t been any palpable progress on the rate hike front so far 
A rising rate environment would boost investment earnings of P C insurers that have been declining in a prolonged low rate environment        However  the key downside is a significant amount of bonds in P C insurers  portfolio losing value if rates are hiked steadily  which is unlikely though   P C insurers  extreme sensitivity to asset inflation will aggravate the situation  And this could ultimately result in capital volatility In other words  the value of the properties insured by carriers will appreciate with an improving real estate market  increasing their potential liabilities from claims  This may outpace the rising yields on bonds they added to their portfolios for covering the claims  In fact  the bonds in their portfolios will lose value with rising interest rates           Addressing this concern would require P C insurers taking more risk to meet the rising liabilities from claims  And this would eventually increase their costs Fundamentals Look ReassuringIn addition to the continuation of a soft market environment  slowing reinsurance renewals across most lines due to less significant catastrophe in recent years should keep P C insurers  bottom lines stressed 
However  ample underwriting capacity  a strong liquidity profile and evolving coverage opportunity should help the carriers stand tall Concerns related to weak capital levels are now things of the past  as the industry s capital position has been building up on the back of improved earnings and policyholders  surpluses  The industry has also been witnessing continued inflow of alternative capital  which is one of the reasons for market softening   High capital levels on the other hand are positioning the industry to perform well 
Further  better preparation to withstand catastrophe losses should translate into higher underwriting profits and a lower combined ratio in the upcoming quarters  Conservative investment strategies should also work in favor As P C insurers hold about two thirds of the invested assets in the form of bonds  their capacity is highly sensitive to changes in credit market conditions  With the credit market showing resilience and almost no possibility of a sudden spike in interest rates  insurers are likely to incur lesser realized and unrealized capital losses in the quarters ahead     Moreover  insurance volume is expected to expand going forward with economic recovery  With improved employment in the private sector and recovery  though uneven  in the housing markets  a number of carriers have seen growth in insurance sales in recent quarters Though competition is cropping up both within the primary lines of the P C space and with reinsurers  expansion  proactive transformational measures  including adoption of technology solutions  will give a competitive advantage Also  for more enthusiasm in renewals and to meet evolving demands of policyholders  insurers are in the process of product reframing and innovation  This should help them expand their customer base for products that will offer higher margins  The emerging risks related to cyber threats are also giving P C insurers scope to capitalize on  This segment  though relatively small in size  has been witnessing continued growth in premium and policy count   How to Play the IndustryThe likely continuation of the buyer s market will typically hold insurers back from flourishing  In fact  stiff competition and reducing premium rates may pose significant challenges to bottom line growth for some carriers  As such  staying away from stocks with an unfavorable Zacks Rank should be the right strategy 
We strongly suggest staying away from or getting rid of stocks with a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  including White Mountains Insurance Group  Ltd   WTM   State Auto Financial Corp   STFC  and Mercury General Corp   MCY    
However  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about U S  P C insurers  long term prospects  The industry has been undertaking several structural changes that will make underwriting and pricing schemes even more attractive to consumers  If one can look past the near term clouds over the industry  buying some P C insurance stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank would be a prudent decision now We particularly recommend Allied World Assurance Co Holdings  AG   AWH  and National Interstate Corp   NATL  with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Stocks in our U S  P C insurance universe with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  currently include Cincinnati Financial Corp  NASDAQ CINF    CINF   First American Financial Corp   FAF  and ProAssurance Corp   PRA  Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in the overall insurance market ",2016-08-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-p-c-insurance:-buyer's-market-continues-200150524,200150524

Chicago  IL   May 23  2016   highlights Cincinnati Financial  NASDAQ CINF     as the Bull of the Day and  3D Systems Corp     as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Ford     Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL     and  General Motors Co  NYSE GM      

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  

  

It is time for investors to face the facts 

An interest rate hike is coming sooner rather than later  with some speculating that a hike could come as early as next month  While the market is still pricing a low chance of this happening  investors are starting to think that one could happen this summer  with recent readings of the  suggesting we are more likely than not to see a hike in July 

However  it has been a long time since we were in a rising rate environment  so some investors might not remember what the best sectors are in this scenario  One sector that tends to benefit is the financial space  with the insurance industry often leading the pack  That is why I am looking to a top ranked stock in this sector  Cincinnati Financial     as one to keep on your radar in the short term 

Why Insurance  

Cincinnati Financial  like other companies in the insurance segment  takes in premiums from clients and then invests that cash in securities  The idea here is that the income or return earned on the investment portfolio more than makes up for any losses from the insurance policies written  allowing companies to profit from the spread between the two 

CINF and others in the space usually invest a large portion of their portfolio in bonds  so a rate hike would be great news for companies in this space  After all  any future premiums invested in bonds will have higher payouts once rates start to rise  directly contributing to insurance companies  bottom line  This makes insurance a great place to be in a rising rate environment  but why look to CINF in particular 

Why CINF

Cincinnati Financial has been seeing rising earnings estimates as of late  for both the short term and the long term  In fact  we haven t witnessed any revisions lower for the current quarter or the current year in the past sixty days  while we see a similar trend for the next year too 

But it isn t just that we have been seeing rising estimates lately  the pace of these increases has also been impressive as well  In just the past month  the current quarter estimate has increased by over 12   while the full year and next year estimates have both moved higher by over 7 4

The next biggest thing ever comes around once every six months or so  These shifts in market sentiment can provide opportunities to profit in the short term for sure  but not many of them pan out to live up to the hype  Still  it s a blast trying to find the next  story stock  that s going to revolutionize an industry or change our daily lives 

Not too long ago  the hot topic was 3D printing  The technology was set to change manufacturing in the future  Rather than having to go to the store to pick something up  we d just download the instructions and print what we needed right there in the comfort of our own home  Personally  I understood the technology but I didn t really buy into the idea  It may change how manufacturing is done but I doubt it s going to change my daily life in any way 

So I ve never been very bullish on the consumer 3D printing market  Judging by the recent analyst earnings estimate revisions on today sBear of the Day it looks like I m not the only one to share the sentiment  3D Systems Corp    is a leading provider of 3D modeling  rapid prototyping and manufacturing solutions  Its systems and materials reduce the time and cost of designing products and facilitate direct and indirect manufacturing by creating actual parts directly from digital input  That s a fancy way of saying the company makes 3D printers 

Here at Zacks  we ve got a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  rating on the stock with Value and Momentum Style Scores of F  Negative earnings estimate revisions for the stock are coming on the heels of a disappointing earnings report where the company reported a 5 cent loss for the quarter versus consensus calling for a penny loss  Over the last 30 days  two analysts have dropped their earnings estimates for the current year  The revisions have dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimate from a 16 cent gain for the year down to just 7 cents  The current quarter  which analysts originally saw coming in at 2 cents looks to be a breakeven quarter now

Forget Lawsuits    Uber Drivers  Days Are Numbered

Ride sharing giant Uber Technologies Inc  recently settled a class action lawsuit by Uber drivers for  100 million  The suit was focused on whether or not to classify Uber drivers as full time workers  where they would be entitled to benefits  or freelancers  In addition to the monetary cost  it was decided that Uber drivers will not be classified as employees of Uber  nor would they be allowed to unionize 

Despite the significant amount of money settled upon  Douglas O Connor  the driver originally named in the lawsuit  believes the agreement is not in his interest or that of other drivers  and that he felt  utterly betrayed and sold out by an unjust settlement result that only benefits Uber  

O Connor s protest follows those from other drivers who also believe the settlement does not provide enough monetary compensation for mileage and other expenses  And they have a point  The  100 million is actually an initial payment of  84 million across 385 000 drivers  in addition to the likely cut the attorneys will take  the other  16 million will be paid in the event  or is acquired at a price 1 5 times higher than its most recent valuation  With these numbers  the settlement equals about  218 per driver  insert grimace emoji here  

No More Drivers

This is not the first lawsuit filed against Uber  nor is it likely to be the last  But the ride hailing company may have found the perfect way to combat any future lawsuits  just make its drivers disappear 

In Pittsburgh  Uber is testing a specially designed Ford    Fusion that will be on the streets collecting mapping data  and most importantly  practicing its self driving capabilities  The company said there will be a trained driver in the driver s seat keeping an eye on operations while the car is in self driving mode 

Uber partnered with Carnegie Mellon University to further develop its driverless car dreams  the two entities opened the Uber Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh  and are preparing to launch autonomous vehicles in to its fleet by 2020 

 While Uber is still in the early days of our self driving efforts  every day of testing leads to improvements   the company said in a    Right now we re focused on getting the technology right and ensuring it s safe for everyone on the road   pedestrians  cyclists and other drivers  

Self driving and autonomous vehicles are not new concepts  Alphabet s     Google division has been designing and testing driverless cars for a while now  and one of Uber s biggest competitors  Lyft  has recently partnered with General Motors Co      in order to test a fleet of self driving electric taxis on public roads 

Uber Still Rules

A  100 million settlement is nothing to a company who is worth over  50 billion  It s an annoyance  really  a small hurdle to overcome  And the settlement  in a way  validates Uber s business model  a model in which it broke new ground in terms of both tech innovation and regulation 

If  and it s looking like when  Uber s self driving car ventures become a success  there will be no need for drivers at all  Just imagine  you open the Uber app  request a car  and minutes later  a fully autonomous vehicle arrives at your location  ready to take you anywhere  No drivers could significantly reduce the number of lawsuits filed against Uber  and greatly cut down on both costs and headaches for the company 

Had the lawsuit not worked out in their favor  the implications of the settlement would have reached far beyond Uber  but to the entire on demand  we commerce culture  The companies that operate in this space think  would undoubtedly have been hit hard  more so than they already are 

But thankfully for Uber  and all of its users and investors  it did  Now we can focus on imagining just what these driverless car rides will be like  Will they feel normal  Will there be music or awkward silence

32554,254069,CINF,CINF  One Of The Longest Dividend Growth Streaks In America,opinion,"Cincinnati Financial  O CINF  has increased its dividend for 54 consecutive years  an impressive streak that only eight U S  public companies can match 
With a 3 4  dividend yield  a large base of recurring revenue  and excellent free cash flow generation  CINF is the type of stock we like to own in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewCINF was formed in 1950 and is among the top 25 U S  property casualty insurers today  offering business  home  and auto insurance  Insurance companies make money by writing and selling insurance policies  which typically breaks even or loses money for most insurers   and investing policy proceeds for income until claims need to be paid out  this is where the money is really made   Local independent insurance agencies market CINF s policies within their communities  which span across nearly 40 states 
The company s mix by premiums written in 2014 was 67  commercial  25  personal  5  life  and 3  excess   surplus  By state  18  of CINF s premiums came from Ohio  7  from Illinois  6  from Indiana  6  from Pennsylvania  5  from North Carolina  5  from Georgia  and 5  from Michigan Business AnalysisInsurance companies live and die by managing risk  If insurers fail to price risk accordingly in their policies  they won t be around for long  Compared to some insurers  CINF s underwriting process is somewhat more aggressive because the company targets a combined ratio of 95  to 100   which means that it expects its policies to be slightly profitable at best  when a combined ratio is below 100   the company achieves an underwriting profit  
However  CINF s combined ratio has outperformed the industry all but one of the past five years  The company has also produced 26 years of favorable loss reserve developments  which means it has conservatively booked more losses than it has actually realized each year  CINF s reinsurance program also limits its losses beyond certain thresholds  and its pristine balance sheet provides additional comfort 
In addition to CINF s proven risk management track record  the company has several other competitive advantages  Its large size  CINF is one of the 25 biggest U S  P C insurers  provides economies of scale in marketing  administrative operations  and support staff  CINF is able to spread these costs over a sizable pool of insurance policies to keep its prices very competitive  CINF is also able to price its premiums lower than smaller competitors because its risk is reduced with a larger pool of policies 
Furthermore  the company s long operating history  range of insurance products  and size provides branding benefits and trust with the agencies that market CINF s policies  Establishing and supporting relationships with agencies takes significant time and cost but provides CINF with relatively low cost distribution advantages 
CINF has over 1 500 agency relationships in nearly 2 000 locations across the country and does everything possible to support them  The company doesn t compete with agencies by selling online or direct to consumers and employs nearly 3 000 associates who provide support to field associates  As a result  CINF is the number one or number two carrier by premium volume in nearly 75  of agencies partnered with it for five years or more  although an agency may represent dozens of carriers 
CINF has also been effective at expanding its market share with agencies over time  CINF says that its net amount of agency relationships has increased by 28  since the end of 2009 and that it still only has about 11  market share of the estimated  39 billion total P C premiums produced by currently appointed agencies  leaving plenty of room for future expansion of relationships 
In addition to effective distribution channels  the insurance market also requires strict compliance with regulations and substantial amounts of capital to compete  A large pool of policies and financial assets are needed for an insurer to be able to pay out claims and survive catastrophes  creating barriers to entry for new players 
While catastrophic events can strike at any time  some states are more prone to them than others  For example  California and Florida are frequently hit by earthquakes  hurricanes  and other natural disasters  One of the things we like about CINF is that it has no presence in California and a minimal presence in Florida  Most of its operations are in the Midwest  perhaps reducing its exposure to catastrophes 
Finally  the mature state of the P C insurance market provides another advantage for CINF  When a market s growth rate is low  new entrants have to steal market share from incumbents to gain a foothold  CINF s policy renewal rate is between 80  and 90  most years  providing a solid base of recurring revenue that helps it keep its policy prices competitive and market share stable  Insurance is also a product that is always in demand regardless of economic cycles  which has helped CINF generate consistent results Key RisksThe insurance industry goes through pricing cycles  which significantly impacts its profitability  Insurance is essentially a commodity  so pricing follows supply and demand  Demand is generally stable given the non discretionary nature of insurance  so supply is the main driver 
When insurers have a healthy pool of profits  strong capital reserves  and excess underwriting capacity  they are more apt to lower pricing to chase market share  This environment typically results from several years of minimal natural disasters and catastrophes 
After a period of catastrophes and tighter capital conditions  there is less underwriting capacity in the market as insurers look to improve their financial condition  These periods are marked by better profitability and more rational pricing  CINF must put up with this cyclicality and remain disciplined with its pricing of risk and balance sheet strength  regardless of market conditions 
Of course  unexpected catastrophes are the biggest risk faced by insurers  A  perfect storm  can wipe out smaller  less disciplined players completely  As we mentioned earlier  CINF is fairly well diversified with the states it does business in  avoids some of the riskier ones like California  and has a long operating history which adds to our confidence in its conservative underwriting process  Even still  record high catastrophe losses in 2011 caused CINF s payout ratio to spike over 150    you can never be too sure with insurers  A M  Best also noted that 2013 2015 marks the first time since the early 1970s that the industry s underwriting has been profitable in three consecutive calendar years   perhaps the next underwriting profit cycle is about to begin 
Underwriting aside  CINF does have more risk with its investment portfolio than many other insurers because it has around 30  of its portfolio in common stocks  most other insurers invest 10 20  of their portfolio in stocks   The portfolio is diversified  no stock is more than 3 6  of the portfolio  and invested in dividend growth stocks  all 50 stocks raised their dividend last year   but these investments are still more volatile than investment grade bonds 
Finally  it s worth noting that while the insurance industry is generally slow to change  it is changing  Technology is leading to more advanced data models that are pricing risk more efficiently on a policy by policy basis  which will only result in more competition for accounts with the best risk profiles 
Furthermore  CINF is completely dependent on independent agencies to sell its insurance policies  According to the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America  independent agencies write about 60  of overall U S  property casualty insurance premiums today 
However  we expect more policies to be purchased online over the coming decade  Selling policies online can result in lower prices and greater profits for insurers because they do not need to pay commissions and can save labor costs as well 
Overall  CINF s financial conservatism and long standing customer and agency relationships help mitigate many of these concerns 
Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
CINF s dividend is safer than most company s dividends with a Safety Score of 65  Over the last four quarters  CINF s dividend has consumed 59  of its earnings and 39  of its free cash flow  These are reasonable payout ratios  but we wouldn t want to see them move much higher given the risk of unexpected catastrophe events hitting profits like they did in 2011  see below  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
One of the things we like about insurance is that it is always in demand regardless of economic conditions  We can see that CINF s sales fell by 10  during fiscal year 2008 but increased by 2  in 2009  The stock also outperformed the S P 500 by 14  in 2008 and raised its dividend 
However  CINF s investment portfolio  remember its above average exposure to equities   performed poorly and the company was hit with underwriting losses that caused earnings per share and free cash flow per share to drop by 47  and 26   respectively  in fiscal year 2008  While CINF s sales don t fluctuate too much  its profits are clearly impacted during recessions Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Importantly  CINF s business model generates solid free cash flow in any environment  Even during the depths of the financial crisis  CINF generated enough free cash flow per share   2 74  to more than cover its current annual dividend payment   1 84   However  the chart below also highlights the impact that record high catastrophe events can have on the business  see fiscal year 2011  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While the insurance industry has numerous attractive characteristics  it is still a commodity product  As seen below  CINF s return on invested capital has remained positive but under 10  since fiscal year 2008  While the company is still creating value for shareholders  its return on capital will always be constrained by the industry s dynamics Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Finally  CINF s balance sheet is in great shape  The company s debt to capital ratio is a conservative 12   and it could cover its entire debt balance with cash on hand and less than half a year of earnings before interest and taxes  CINF also has strong credit ratings with S P and Fitch  This is important given the unpredictable nature of catastrophe events in the insurance industry Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
CINF s dividend Growth Score of 74 suggests that the company s dividend has above average growth potential  CINF has raised its dividend for 54 straight years and is a member of the dividend aristocrats index and the dividend kings list  Fewer than 10 U S  public companies have achieved such a lengthy dividend growth streak  putting CINF in quite the exclusive club 
The company has increased its dividend by 3 5  per year over the last five years but most recently rewarded investors with a special dividend in December 2015  resulting in 30  total dividend growth in 2015 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Going forward  however  we would expect dividend growth to match earnings growth  which will likely remain in the mid single digits ValuationCINF trades at 16x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 3 4   which is below its five year average dividend yield of 4 0   The company also has a price to book ratio of 1 4  which is higher than its peer group s average ratio of 1 2 
For a mature insurance business  CINF appears reasonably priced today but is not a bargain  We think the company can continue growing its revenue by 3 4  per year as it adds more agencies and new lines of insurance products  e g  tailored policies for high network individuals  reinsurance  
With a reasonable amount of operating leverage and potentially some help from higher interest rates over the next 5 10 years  earnings per share could compound at a mid  to upper single digit rate  resulting in total return potential of 8 10  per year ConclusionCINF is a well managed insurance business that has been a sound bet for safe  growing dividend income for more than half a century  The insurance industry experiences its fair share of performance cycles  but CINF has proven to be a disciplined risk taker with both its underwriting and investment portfolio  Overall  we think this blue chip dividend stock remains a reasonable bet for income investors ",2016-01-27,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cinf:-one-of-the-longest-dividend-growth-streaks-in-america-381971,381971

107685,329200,CINF,Cincinnati Financial  CINF  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Cincinnati Financial  CINF  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 51 billion  up 1 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 48  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cincinnati Financial 
For Cincinnati Financial  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 95  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Cincinnati Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cincinnati Financial would post earnings of  0 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of  16 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported
