173082,394598,IBM,Why IBM Stock Just Popped 5 ,news,"What happened
Two days ago  says StreetInsider com     or maybe it was only yesterday  says TheFly com     analysts at Edward Jones upgraded shares of IBM  NYSE IBM  from  hold  to  buy   Whenever the upgrade actually happened  details on what it contained only began filtering out this morning    and it seems investors really like reading those details 
After rising 1 8  on Monday  and a further 1 9  on Tuesday  IBM shares were shooting ahead a full 5  as of 1 p m  EST today 

So what
So what are the details on this one  As TheFly reports  Edward Jones  upgrade is based primarily on the fact that IBM CEO Ginni Rometty is stepping down as CEO and Arvind Krishna is stepping up to take her place 
Curiously  these are the exact same details that sparked a 5  rally in IBM stock last week  which may not say much about investors  attention spans  Granted  Edward Jones also added that this change in management is a  positive catalyst  for the stock    but anyone who s paid attention as IBM stock lost 22  of its market cap during Rometty s tenure could have told you that 
Now what
If there s one bit of information in this upgrade that may be worth paying more attention to  it s Edward Jones  observation that IBM shares look attractively valued    but even here  I fear I must quibble 
Objectively speaking  IBM s price to earnings ratio of 14 8 may make it look like something of a value stock  and IBM s fat 4 5  dividend yield certainly makes it a viable candidate for a good dividend stock   Yet most analysts still think IBM will only grow its earnings at about 6 4  annually over the next five years  Whatever Edward Jones may believe  the idea of paying a double digit multiple for single digit growth still doesn t look like a very good way to make money 
To become a real  buy   IBM simply must grow faster ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prk70,2077118

Slumping along with the Dow were International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  and Boeing  NYSE BA   IBM stock had been surging after the company announced a CEO transition  but it was unable to keep the rally going  Meanwhile  Boeing stock was weak after a new software bug related to its Starliner spacecraft was disclosed 
IBM s rally takes a breather
Shares of IBM got a big boost at the end of January when the tech giant announced that CEO Virginia Rometty was stepping down effective April 6  The CEO position will go to cloud and cognitive software chief Arvind Krishna  while the president position will go to Red Hat head honcho James Whitehurst 
Between Jan  31 and Feb  6  IBM stock shot up 14 6   The stock carved out a new 52 week high  reaching levels not seen since 2018 

Shares of the century old tech company took a break on Friday  falling along with the Dow  IBM stock was down about 1  by early afternoon  giving back a small portion of its recent gains 
Rometty s legacy at IBM is complicated  Since taking over in 2012  revenue  profits  and the stock price have all moved in the wrong direction  However  the company has refocused over the years on growth opportunities like hybrid cloud computing  artificial intelligence  and data analytics  Legacy businesses were sold off or de emphasized  with resources shifted to areas where IBM could build up competitive advantages 
IBM expects to produce revenue growth this year  driven by the Red Hat acquisition and a recently launched mainframe system  If the company can remain in growth mode after 2020  the stock could finally regain the ground it s lost since topping out soon after Rometty took over 
The management shuffle reset the narrative  Now  IBM needs deliver

Boeing is now having issues with software in other parts of its business  On Thursday  a NASA safety review panel said that a December flight test of a Boeing CST 100 Starliner space taxi almost ended in a catastrophic failure due to a software bug  That test was cut short by a separate issue 
The new software bug was fixed by Boeing during the flight  but the panel found that it could have resulted in a catastrophic failure involving erroneous thruster firings  The panel recommended that NASA review Boeing s software verification process before allowing its spacecraft to ferry humans 
The 737 Max debacle has threatened Boeing s reputation  Yet another software issue won t help the situation  Boeing stock was down 1 25  Friday afternoon ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pskyo,2079520

IBM  NYSE IBM  was by far the best performing stock in the Dow  up considerably after the company announced a major leadership change  Meanwhile  shares of Visa  NYSE V  were down following a quarterly report that fell short of expectations 
IBM gets a new CEO
On Thursday  the tech giant announced that its president  CEO  and chairwoman  Virginia Rometty  was stepping down after 8 years at the helm  effective April 6  Rometty will continue as executive chairwoman through the end of 2020  at which time she will retire from the company 

Rometty s role will be split  Arvind Krishna  currently the head of IBM s cloud and cognitive software  will take over as CEO  James Whitehurst  CEO of Red Hat  will take over as president  IBM closed its  34 billion acquisition of Red Hat last year  a deal spearheaded by Krishna 
Rometty took over IBM in 2012 at a crucial point in the company s history  as cloud computing was disrupting the tech industry  The company took bold action under Rometty to position itself for the future  including dozens of acquisitions to build out its cloud computing  artificial intelligence  and data analytics businesses  Billions of dollars of annual revenue from legacy businesses were divested as IBM refocused on the highest value opportunities 
The results have been complicated  IBM s revenue is down considerably since it peaked in 2012  and earnings have been trending downward as well  Divestitures and negative currency effects were partly to blame  but IBM s organic results have been mostly lackluster 
But there s little question that IBM is better positioned for the future now compared with 2012  Especially with Red Hat in the fold  IBM s hybrid cloud business will be a key engine as the company looks to return to sustainable growth 
Shares of IBM were up 3 9  on the news of Rometty s departure  The leadership switch could help change the narrative around IBM stock  which has languished for years  Since the beginning of 2012  shares have tumbled 22  
Visa s results underwhelm
Payments giant Visa disappointed investors when it reported its fiscal first quarter results on Thursday evening  The company grew revenue and adjusted earnings at double digit rates  but both numbers missed analyst expectations  The stock was down 3 8  by late Friday morning 
Visa reported first quarter revenue of  6 05 billion  up 10  year over year but  30 million short of the average analyst estimate  Payments volume was up 8   cross border volume was up 9   and processed transactions rose 11  
Non GAAP  adjusted  earnings per share came in at  1 46  up 12  year over year but  0 01 below analyst expectations  Along with the first quarter results  the company announced a new  9 5 billion share repurchase program 
For fiscal 2020  Visa expects low double digit revenue growth  mid single digit operating expense growth  and mid teens growth in EPS  Notably  Visa sees the percentage of revenue going toward client incentives at the high end of its guidance range of 22 5  to 23 5  
This minor disappointment for Visa comes a few weeks after the company announced the massive  5 3 billion acquisition of fintech start up Plaid  which connects fintech applications with accounts at financial institutions  acting as the back end to many popular fintech apps 
While Visa s results barely missed expectations  the stock is certainly on the expensive side  Based on the average analyst estimate for adjusted 2020 earnings  it trades at a price to earnings ratio of 32  Visa is an exceptional company and certainly deserves a premium valuation  but the market may be rethinking the size of that premium after the first quarter report ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppjnk,2073248
173109,394625,IBM,IBM s  surprise  CEO  Arvind Krishna to take over from Ginni Rometty,news," Reuters    International Business Machines Corp s  N IBM  Ginni Rometty  the first woman chief executive of the tech pioneer  will be replaced in April by the head of its fast growing cloud business  Arvind Krishna 
While the leadership change was largely expected  Wall Street analysts were surprised by the timing and the choice of Krishna as the CEO 
 We believe the frontrunners in most investors  minds had been either Jim Whitehurst  former CEO of Red Hat  or former CFO Martin Schroeter   said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi 
Here are some facts about the CEO to be  who has spent nearly three decades with the Big Blue 
  Krishna has an undergraduate degree from the Indian Institute of Technology  Kanpur  India  and a Ph D  from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign 
  He is IBM s 10th  chief executive in the company s 108 year old history 
  Krishna started his career in IBM s Watson Research in December 1990 and was part of the team until July 2009  according to his LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  profile  
  In 2013  he was named general manager of  IBM  Systems and Technology Group s development and manufacturing organization  responsible for developing and engineering advanced semiconductor materials 
  Krishna is known as the  principal architect  of IBM s biggest acquisition ever  Red Hat  which the company bought for  34 billion last year 
  In an interview  with Business Insider in August last year  he said the hybrid cloud market could be worth about  1 2 trillion in aggregate in the future

So what
Krishna is currently IBM s senior vice president for cloud and cognitive software  He will be joined at the top of the company by James Whitehurst    currently the CEO of Red Hat  the open source software provider that IBM bought last summer    who will become IBM s president 
Both executives will assume their posts on April 6  Rometty will remain executive chairman of the board of IBM through the end of 2020  then retire

In its press release on the management changes  IBM praised Rometty for the  bold changes  she made  to reposition IBM for the future   including the acquisition of 65 companies and the building up of IBM s businesses in hybrid cloud  security  industry and data  and AI 
Receiving less attention is the fact that  since Rometty took the helm in 2012  blue chip IBM stock has lost about 22  of its market value    while the S P 500 has surged ahead 157   Investors today are betting that a new CEO might change those dynamics

173143,394659,IBM,IBM Is Replacing Ginni Rometty After 8 Years of Rocky Results,news,"There s a big shakeup brewing at IBM  NYSE IBM   CEO and president Ginni Rometty will step aside in April  triggering a couple of high level promotions in Big Blue s C suite    and a new era in the technology giant s illustrious history 

Who s taking over IBM s corner office 
When Rometty bows out  her CEO title will fall to Arvind Krishna  He is currently serving as IBM s senior vice president for cloud and cognitive software  which has become the company s core competency in recent years  Krishna is also credited as the driving force behind IBM s  34 billion acquisition of open source software pioneer Red Hat  Krishna s appointment basically ensures that IBM stays the course it has already traveled in recent quarters and years  which should make the transition smoother than the sudden strategy shift that occurred when Rometty took the CEO baton from Sam Palmisano in 2012 
Further ensuring a trouble free transition  Rometty will stay on as executive chairman of IBM s board of directors until the end of 2020  As such  she ll have plenty of oversight and significant strategy setting power for a few more months 
Rometty endorsed Krishna s appointment  describing him as a  brilliant technologist  with strong leadership skills 
At Arvind Krishna s right hand  you ll find former Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst in the role of president  He ll play a big role in Big Blue s day to day operations and long term strategic direction  For critics who feared that IBM s buyout would choke Red Hat s open source culture under a mountain of bureaucratic weight  Whitehurst s top level appointment should alleviate that concern  If anything  Red Hat s role inside IBM appears to be expanding as we speak 

Why now 
IBM has a tradition of replacing its CEOs at the age of 60 or so  Apart from company founder Thomas Watson  who retired at the sprightly age of 82  every IBM CEO since has stepped back between the ages of 57 and 62 
Rometty is actually an outlier  here  being the oldest exiting CEO since Watson  From that point of view  Rometty s exit shouldn t surprise anyone 
Her reign at Big Blue has been rocky  starting a conscious strategy shift away from a hardware heavy  one stop IT shop and toward a pure focus on software and services  Many shareholders are happy to see her go  because the Rometty era has not been kind to the company s stock prices    even if you reinvested the generous dividends in more IBM stock along the way  as shown below 

IBM data by YCharts 
What s next 
As a longtime IBM owner myself  I think Rometty did her best to redirect Big Blue toward a more sustainable and profitable business model for the long haul  Palmisano s ideas were right for the 2000s  but the times  they were a changin  in 2012  and that transformation continues today 
Investors applauded this management change  boosting IBM s stock price by 4 5  in Thursday s after hours trading session  As much as I appreciated Rometty s ideas  I m excited to see Arvind Krishna s artificial intelligence focus and Jim Whitehurst s open source mentality steering IBM into the next decade 
IBM s stock is trading at just 12 times trailing earnings with a juicy 4 7  dividend  Fellow IT consulting giant Accenture  NYSE ACN   for example  is trading at 24 times earnings  and software titan Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  is fetching 35 times trailing earnings after a similar shift toward new IT strategies under Satya Nadella  It won t take much of a success story to drive the P E ratio and IBM s share prices much higher ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppgr7,2073016
173144,394660,IBM,IBM Returns To Revenue Growth  But Is It Sustainable ,news,"On Jan  21  IBM  NYSE IBM  reported fourth quarter earnings for 2019  Following the close of its Red Hat acquisition on July 9  2019  this was the second full quarter with Red Hat consolidated in its results  Then this week  Big Blue announced its CEO Ginni Rometty was stepping down 
With a  34 billion price tag  IBM made a big bet on Red Hat based on the premise it would accelerate IBM s efforts in the cloud  Red Hat is the leading provider of hybrid cloud solutions  a rapidly growing sub sector of the overall cloud industry  Together  IBM and Red Hat s hybrid multi cloud platform offerings allow businesses to securely deploy  run  and manage data and applications on premises and on private and multiple public clouds  The acquisition was supposed to be symbiotic  Red Hat would open up the hybrid market and its customer base to IBM  and IBM s incumbency and scale would help accelerate Red Hat s growth 
Six months in  investors are looking to see any signs that this plan is paying off for the tech stock 
Let s get right to the heart  cloud growth
On its fourth quarter conference call  management was surprisingly upbeat  Specifically  Red Hat s revenue growth accelerated 24  year over year  This is significant as it was stronger than the third quarter growth rate of 20  and the 16  growth before the acquisition 
Even more significant is that Red Hat appears to be propelling IBM s cloud revenue growth forward too Remember that symbiotic relationship  IBM s total cloud revenue growth accelerated to 23  year over year in constant currency  This is an increase from the 14  growth reported in the third quarter  IBM s cloud revenue growth grew almost as fast as Red Hat s  which is a positive sign 
IBM said  new Red Hat engagements  were expanding  and  our cloud revenue for the year was  21 billion  By leveraging our technology  incumbency and expertise to help our clients with their journeys to cloud  it now represents 27  of our revenue   That 27  figure is for the full year  but with its cloud business growing substantially faster than the rest of IBM  and with a boost from Red Hat  cloud is quickly growing as a percent of sales and represented 31  of sales in the fourth quarter 
If a  34 billion acquisition doesn t convince investors that IBM is committed to the cloud  on Jan  30 after the market close  IBM announced that Rometty plans to step down in April  IBM s Senior Vice President for Cloud and Cognitive Software  Arvind Krishna  will become the new CEO  Krishna was a principal architect of the company s acquisition of Red Hat  which speaks volumes to how IBM feels about the early success of the transaction  The board of directors announced James Whitehurst  CEO of Red Hat  was elected as IBM s president  also effective in April  Krishna has been with IBM for nearly 30 years  while Whitehurst came with the Red Hat acquisition less than a year ago  This new duo at the top is an exciting selection by the board to say the least 

Is a return to sustainable revenue growth possible 
The good news for IBM is that almost one third of its business is growing at over 20   That s meaningful  Why  Consider that when 30  of your business grows at a 20  rate  if the rest of your business remains flat  overall revenues would grow 6   That would be a significant improvement in top line growth for IBM compared to the modestly declining revenue growth it s been experiencing 
More good news is that its systems segment seems to have turned a corner  The systems segment houses IBM s old legacy mainframe computing business  But a new product cycle is underway and is off to a strong start  Total systems revenues for the fourth quarter grew 16  year over year versus a decline of 14  last quarter  The systems segment accounts for another 7  of revenue  Thus  combined with the cloud business  close to 40  of IBM s revenue is growing at a healthy clip  
The problem is that remaining 60  of revenue  which collectively declined 9  in the fourth quarter  The largest problem is the global technology services  GTS  segment which accounts for about half of the decline and operates at a single digit profit margin  the lowest of IBM s four business units  The GTS business is the technical consulting arm of IBM helping businesses design  build  and run technical solutions for their businesses 
Despite the current weak operating environment  the GTS segment still plays an integral role for IBM  GTS has an industry leading market share position  global footprint  and scale  and most importantly  IBM says it s central to  the integrated value proposition of IBM overall as we run the mission critical workloads for many of our clients overall  
CFO James Kavanaugh commented on the segment 

We are going to take aggressive actions around our GTS business model   we are going to integrate our go to market with GBS  Global Business Services  and our global account teams at the large enterprise level  We re going to take these integrated offerings  leverage now the integrated value and breadth of IBM that can play across the continuum as clients move to journey to the cloud   And we re going to go drive that hard  And in addition  I would tell you  we are going to improve the cost competitive structure of this business with the actions we re going to take here early in 2020 

This business is still a work in progress  but the right assets are in place  Hopefully  progress will be seen this year 
Strong guidance and low expectation makes for a nice setup
Its 2020 guidance included growth in revenues  gross margins  operating EPS  and free cash flow  Specifically  operating EPS is expected to grow 4  to  13 35 per share  basically in line with the consensus of analysts  estimates  but helped by a lower than expected tax rate of 7  to 9   Free cash flow is expected to grow 5  to  12 5 billion  more than double the dividend payout  and includes growth in capital expenditures for cloud investments  Further  the balance sheet continues to strengthen as IBM has now repaid  10 billion in debt since the closing of the Red Hat acquisition when total debt peaked at  73 billion 
Going forward  IBM needs to execute on two things  continuing to show strong revenue growth in cloud and improving performance of the GTS business  The combination of these two things will allow IBM to return to sustainable mid single digit top line growth  
IBM still carries low expectations in the marketplace  Trading at just over 10 times forward earnings and offering a dividend yield north of 4 5   not much is baked in for a reacceleration of growth  But if IBM can show continued progress over the next few quarters  14 to 15 times 2020 earnings of  13 35 is not unrealistic  Investors who buy IBM today could see the stock price approach  200 per share by the end of the year  representing upside of more than 40  ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pphgb,2073083

173206,394722,IBM,3 Reasons to Buy IBM Stock,news,"International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  managed to beat expectations with its fourth quarter report last week  and it provided guidance calling for revenue and earnings growth in 2020  The stock has been trending downward for years as the company s transformation failed to translate into sustainable growth  That painful period may finally be over 
While looking at IBM s stock chart doesn t foster much confidence  there are a few good reasons to buy the stock 
1  Red Hat
IBM loaded up its balance sheet with debt to acquire open source software company Red Hat  While there s no guarantee that the  34 billion deal won t end in write offs and disappointment  Red Hat presents IBM with some significant growth opportunities 
Red Hat itself was growing at a solid double digit rate prior to the acquisition  Red Hat Enterprise Linux accounted for about one third of the paid enterprise operating system market in 2018  second only to Microsoft  And Red Hat OpenShift  the company s container based platform for hybrid cloud  currently leads the market 
The Red Hat acquisition strengthened IBM s position in the hybrid cloud market on day one  The combination of IBM and Red Hat is powerful  because IBM now has the opportunity to pitch Red Hat software to its large clients  Red Hat s normalized revenue growth rate accelerated to 24  in IBM s fourth quarter as that benefit began to be realized  One example  IBM recently announced a  1 billion hybrid cloud deal with a major Spanish bank involving Red Hat s OpenShift platform 
While IBM paid a steep price for Red Hat  the deal may end up being the key to IBM s return to sustainable growth 

2  A pessimistic stock price
IBM grew its revenue in the fourth quarter  and it expects revenue growth in 2020  Earnings are being pressured by the accounting treatment of Red Hat s pre acquisition deferred revenue  but IBM stock looks cheap even including that headwind 
For 2020  IBM expects to generate adjusted earnings per share of at least  13 35  This number includes the impact of IBM being unable to recognize all of Red Hat s stand alone revenue  Free cash flow is expected to be around  12 5 billion  up from  11 9 billion in 2019 
With the stock trading around  139  both the price to earnings ratio and price to free cash flow ratio are right around 10  That s a valuation that assumes little or no growth  IBM expects to grow its adjusted pre tax income by a high single digit percentage annually through 2021  factoring in the benefits of Red Hat  If the company can hit that target  it could earn the stock a higher multiple 
A cheap price alone isn t enough to make a stock a good investment  But combine the beaten down valuation with the growth potential afforded by Red Hat  and IBM looks like a good value 
3  Almost a Dividend Aristocrat
IBM temporarily halted share buybacks once the Red Hat acquisition closed in order to prioritize paying down its debt  The company remains committed to growing the dividend  though  and another increase is expected in April 
Assuming IBM does raise its dividend in a few months  the company will become a Dividend Aristocrat  having increased its dividend for 25 consecutive years  IBM has paid dividends uninterrupted for over 100 years 
IBM s next dividend increase will likely be small  but a high yield makes up for the sluggish growth  The current quarterly dividend of  1 62 per share represents a yield of about 4 7  
IBM is not a growth stock  Slow and steady growth is likely the best investors can hope for  but that s perfectly fine if the price is right  With IBM trading at pessimistic levels and sporting a high yield dividend  growth doesn t need to be spectacular for the stock to be a winner over the next few years ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnxzu,2069482

173208,394724,IBM,IBM  Is Big Blue Set for Sustained Growth ,news,"Earnings season has generally not been kind to IBM s  NYSE IBM  stock  In the last two years  IBM s share price has fallen more than it s risen following its earnings report  The most recent quarterly report has been an exception  with the stock rising over 3  during the trading day following the report 
Is this an aberration or could it be the start of a trend 
IBM s earnings surprised on the upside    
On the surface  IBM s fourth quarter results provided cause for optimism  Both revenue and earnings outperformed expectations  with revenue growing 0 1     breaking a streak of five quarters where revenue declined year over year  Cloud revenue  a strategic focus for the tech company  rose 21  helping drive a 190 basis point improvement in gross profit margins  Nor was the outperformance limited to the current quarter    the company raised its adjusted earnings per share estimates for 2020 from  12 80 to  13 35 
To cap it off  IBM s CEO commented that the company was positioned for  sustained revenue growth in 2020   It s not a surprise  then  that the stock reacted the way it did 

To determine whether such outperformance is sustainable requires a more detailed look at the performance of IBM s various segments  specifically the distinction between its legacy businesses and its so called strategic imperatives    initiatives aimed at emerging technologies such as the cloud  cyber security  and artificial intelligence  The bull case for IBM s shares is premised on growth in the latter more than offsetting a decline in the former 
   But a detailed look provides a more nuanced picture
The most recent quarter s results illustrate the contrast between the two businesses  Revenue at Red Hat  the open source technology company that IBM bought last year  rose 24   helping drive a 9  increase in IBM s Cloud and Cognitive Software division  In contrast  revenue in the company s legacy Global Business Services  GBS  and Global Technology Services  GTS  divisions  which combined still account for the lion s share of IBM s revenue  fell 0 3  and 4   respectively  
An exception to this trend was IBM s legacy Systems business which saw a 16  increase in revenue  driven by the launch of a new mainframe cycle  This will likely continue to support earnings over the near term  However  mainframe cycles tend to last for only about five quarters or so  and thus the impact may be a fleeting one  Excluding this  overall revenue would have declined year over year 
Moreover  IBM s other legacy businesses are likely to see further headwinds  if a recent survey of corporate chief investment officers  CIO s  by Morgan Stanley is any indication  The survey suggested that CIOs planned to spend less on IBM s software and IT services  which prompted a recent downgrade by a Morgan Stanley analyst  With IBM s legacy and new businesses pulling in opposite directions  any further softness in the former will likely take a toll on overall revenue growth 
The case for investing in IBM  however  is a long term one    where success should be measured in terms of years rather than quarters  Its acquisition of Red Hat was designed to jump start IBM s efforts to capitalize on the  1 2 trillion hybrid cloud market  and synergies are already starting to materialize  For example  the number of new service engagements leveraging Red Hat nearly doubled across GBS and GTS versus the previous quarter  These synergies will continue to grow in the years ahead 
Meanwhile  IBM remains one of the highest yielding dividend stocks within the technology sector  with a 4 7  yield  With dividends accounting for less than 50  of the company s free cash flow  there is plenty of room to extend its dividend growth streak of 24 years  And  at a price to forward adjusted earnings ratio of a little more than 10  the market is not giving IBM the benefit of the doubt    which could set the stage for a sustained rally in the event that it surprises on the upside ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pofid,2070590
173234,394750,IBM,Why IBM Stock Rose 5  Today,news,"What happened
Shares of International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  jumped as much as 4 8  on Wednesday  following an impressive fourth quarter earnings report on Tuesday night  By 3 p m  EST  Big Blue s stock had cooled down somewhat to a 3  gain 
So what
IBM s fourth quarter sales held steady year over year at  21 8 billion and adjusted earnings fell 3  to  4 71 per share  Your average analyst would have settled for earnings of roughly  4 68 per share on revenue near  21 6 billion  The company also set its full year profit guidance slightly ahead of current Wall Street projections 

Now what
The computing systems and IT consulting giant expects a return to revenue growth and solid bottom line earnings in 2020  reaping the cloud computing rewards of buying open source software veteran Red Hat for  33 billion last summer  It will take a couple of years to pay down the additional debt that the deal required  but the buyout is already paying dividends in the form of a cool  1 billion of additional revenue per quarter and a positive contribution to IBM s free cash flow

173235,394751,IBM,IBM Returns to Growth Thanks to Red Hat and Mainframes,news,"2020 will be a growth year for International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   Thanks to the acquisition of software company Red Hat and a new mainframe system  IBM sees revenue  adjusted earnings per share  and free cash flow rising this year 
IBM s full year guidance came alongside a fourth quarter report that beat expectations across the board  The tech giant posted an unexpected revenue increase  albeit a small one  and its bottom line exceeded analysts  projections as well 
While IBM s transformation is still a work in progress  there was a lot to like about its latest results 

Returning to growth
For the most part  IBM s revenue has been shrinking over the past six years  The decline hasn t been as bad as it appears  because a combination of negative currency effects and divestitures has played a big role  But even on an adjusted basis  the picture hasn t been pretty 
Analysts were expecting another decline in the fourth quarter  but IBM managed to pull a rabbit out of its hat 

Data source  IBM  YOY   year over year  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
Revenue growth looked better after adjusting for a few items  Revenue was up 1  adjusted for currency  and up 3  adjusted for currency and divestitures 
IBM s revenue included a contribution from Red Hat  although only a portion of what the software company would have generated as a stand alone company  Red Hat contribute  573 million in revenue in IBM s fourth quarter  but it would have generated  1 07 billion in revenue on a stand alone basis 
Accounting rules related to deferred revenue prevent IBM from recognizing all of Red Hat s revenue  The negative impact will dissipate as time goes on  and IBM will be able to recognize a greater proportion of Red Hat s revenue with each passing quarter  This Red Hat revenue issue hurt earnings in Q4  because IBM still needs to recognize all of Red Hat s costs 
Cognitive software and systems strength
Software and hardware were bright spots for IBM in the fourth quarter  while services lagged behind 

Data source  IBM  YOY   year over year 
The cloud and cognitive software segment includes Red Hat  so its growth was partially due to that additional revenue  In the systems segment  IBM s new z15 mainframe was the star of the show  Mainframe revenue soared 63  year over year  typical for the first full quarter a new mainframe is shipping  This growth more than offset a steep decline in sales of Power systems 
Total cloud revenue  which spans all of IBM s segments  grew 23  at constant currency during the fourth quarter  For the year  cloud generated  21 billion in revenue  Red Hat  which contributed to the cloud growth  grew its own normalized revenue by 24  in the fourth quarter 
Positioned for growth
IBM s guidance for 2020 was vague on the revenue front  with the company only saying that it expects its top line to rise this year  That s not too surprising  given the additional revenue from Red Hat and the new mainframe 
The company expects to produce non GAAP EPS of at least  13 35 this year  up from  12 81 in 2019  The accounting issues with Red Hat revenue recognition will continue to have a negative impact on earnings this year  Free cash flow is expected to be around  12 5 billion  up from  11 9 billion in 2019 
Acquiring Red Hat strengthened IBM s position in the hybrid cloud market  It also created various cross selling opportunities  IBM can accelerate Red Hat s growth by selling its software to large IBM customers with little or no exposure to Red Hat  and it can boost sales of its own software by making it available on Red Hat s platforms 
The real test will be whether IBM can keep growing in 2021 and beyond  once the initial revenue boost from Red Hat and the new mainframe have been lapped  If IBM s revenue declines are truly in the past  the beaten down stock could be in for quite a recovery ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plwim,2066031
173236,394752,IBM,Why IBM s Solid Cloud Business Won t Lead to a Strong Dividend Increase,news,"Instead of delivering a forecasted sixth consecutive quarter of year over year revenue decline  International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  posted revenue growth during the fourth quarter  and non GAAP  adjusted  earnings per share  EPS  of  4 71 exceeded analysts  expectations by  0 02  In addition  thanks to the strength of the tech giant s cloud business  management predicted free cash flow to increase in 2020 and committed to raising the dividend  But despite these encouraging results  investors shouldn t expect more than a low single digit dividend hike 
The rise of cloud
IBM s fourth quarter year over year revenue increase of 0 1  remains modest  but it represents an important change of trajectory  The company has been struggling over the last several years to offset the decline of its legacy businesses against the rise of cloud computing  Enterprises have been moving some of their applications and computing infrastructure from their premises to the cloud to focus on their core businesses and take advantage of the flexibility this technology offers 
In consequence  IBM s legacy hardware  software  and services such as consulting and outsourcing have become less relevant  As an illustration  IBM s global technology services  which consist of designing  implementing  and maintaining infrastructure and systems  declined 4  year over year because of ongoing transition to the cloud 
IBM has been adapting its business to this new way of consuming information technology over the last several years  But with its 109 years of history and its  77 1 billion of revenue in 2019  the company couldn t catch up with innovative emerging public cloud players such as Amazon com s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft s Azure 
Thus  IBM acquired the growing open source cloud company Red Hat in 2019 for  34 billion to accelerate its transition and focus on hybrid cloud offerings  flexible solutions that run on any combination of public and private cloud providers   This decision seems to keep up with its promises  so far 
Beyond the year over year revenue growth acceleration of Red Hat from 19  during the third quarter to 24  this quarter  at constant currency and normalized for comparability to historical performance   synergies with IBM s other businesses seem to have  materialized  For instance  IBM s Cloud Pak solution takes advantage of Red Hat s OpenShift platform to allow customers to move their applications to any cloud in an efficient and secure way  Also  IBM is taking advantage of its large scale by implementing Red Hat solutions over its legacy customer base  During the last quarter  IBM doubled the number of Red Hat large deals  above  10 million  to 21 
As a result  cloud revenue increased to  6 8 billion during the fourth quarter  up 23  year over year  which represented 31 2  of the company s total revenue compared to only 4 4  in 2013 

Dividend increase vs  debt
With these strong results and given the tailwind IBM s cloud business represents  management indicated it would expect free cash flow to increase from  11 9 billion in 2019 to  12 5 billion in 2020  Besides  during the earnings call  CFO Jim Kavanaugh said the company would remain committed to increasing its dividend  which will put IBM in the list of Dividend Aristocrats 
Since IBM s annualized quarterly dividend of  5 6 billion represents less than half of the expected free cash flow in 2020  there s ample room for a strong dividend increase  But the company must focus on reducing its debt after it paid its  34 billion acquisition of Red Hat in cash  and Kavanaugh confirmed this will be the company s goal over the next couple of years 
Discussing IBM s debt remains tricky since the company also acts as a bank for some of its customers  lending them money to finance their projects  IBM s total debt amounted to  62 9 billion at the end of 2019  But even if you exclude these financing activities  which involve a debt of  24 7 billion  IBM s core debt of  38 2 billion remains high  In any case  IBM s total debt and core debt represent 5 0 times and 3 1 times its forecasted free cash flow  which remains significant  
But you should also take into account the current dividend will leave only  6 9 billion of cash in 2020 to reduce the debt  Thus  I expect the dividend hike management should announce by the end of April to remain modest 
Yet even after the increase in the stock price after these better than expected results  IBM s dividend yield of 4 66  remains attractive  And the non GAAP EPS forecast of at least  13 45 corresponds to a low P E ratio of 10 7 
Despite a possible disappointing dividend increase  dividend oriented investors should consider IBM an interesting opportunity because of its low valuation  In addition  the growth potential of its cloud businesses should support a sustainable dividend over the long term ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmdft,2067033
173237,394753,IBM,Better Buy  IBM vs  McDonald s,news,"It s hard to think of two more classic blue chip stocks than IBM  NYSE IBM  and McDonald s  NYSE MCD  
One is a tech giant that s been around for more than 100 years and the other is the world s biggest restaurant chain  Both are among the 30 components that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
Though IBM and McDonald s aren t competitors  there s no doubt that investors look to each stock for similar qualities  including a reliable dividend payment and a business model and brand name that has been successful over generations  That makes them competitors for investment dollars 
As you can see from the chart below  over the past five years  McDonald s stock was far and away the better performer of the two as the company successfully recovered from challenges it encountered in the first half of the 2010s  However  there s no guarantee that that pattern will persist 

MCD data by YCharts
Let s take a look at where each company stands to determine which would be the better buy for investors today 
IBM  A legacy tech company in transition
It would be hard to understate how much IBM has struggled in recent years  The company has been in the midst of a long transition from a hardware company to one that is more focused on delivering software and services  but it seems to have fallen behind competitors in key businesses like cloud computing  It also has been unable to grow its revenues from the businesses it sees as its future rapidly enough to make up for the declines from the units that it has sold off or has been winding down 

In 2019  IBM s overall revenue fell 3 1  to  77 1 billion  though it was up 0 2  after adjusting for divestitures and foreign currency moves   
With its recent acquisition of Red Hat  IBM is taking aim at the massive opportunity in providing hybrid cloud services    arrangements under which businesses use a mix of third party public cloud and on premises private cloud servers  Expect to see the company redirect some of its investment in the coming years as it attempts to capitalize on this growing trend 
Yet after years of its leadership talking about growth markets  IBM remains a slow growth company on both the top and bottom lines  For 2020  it forecasts that its earnings per share will increase by just 4 2   and its revenue has fallen throughout much of the last decade 
Even growth in its  strategic imperatives  businesses has been disappointing  Total cloud revenue rose just 11  to  21 2 billion in 2019  for example  a growth rate that pales in comparison to those delivered by peers like Amazon and Microsoft  the leading providers of infrastructure as a service  the kind of service that had long been a strength for IBM 
IBM remains a reliable cash machine with profit margins well in the double digit percentages  and it s about to become a Dividend Aristocrat  but the company s lack of growth and the stock s poor performance are warning signs for investors 
McDonald s  The arches  still golden
Under CEO Steve Easterbrook  who guided the company from 2015 until just a few months ago  McDonald s executed better than it had in a long time  The company successfully rolled out all day breakfast    something its customers had requested for years    added digital ordering kiosks  signed deals with third party delivery services  fought back against rivals with a new value menu  and refranchised restaurants abroad to free up capital and improve cash flow 

However  Easterbrook was fired in November after it was discovered that he had had an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate  and now the company s future seems less certain  
Nonetheless  the fast food giant is bringing strong momentum into 2020  In the third quarter  its global comparable sales jumped 5 9   with 4 8  growth in the U S  and even faster growth internationally  showing the company executing in all of its regions   Earnings for 2019 have been flat  however  as intense competition forced the company to be more promotional  the company has also been spending aggressively to remodel restaurants under the Experience of the Future program  In the U S   traffic is still falling  but the company has compensated for that by coaxing customers to spend more through initiatives like delivery and digital 
In November  Chris Kempczinski  who previously served as president of McDonald s USA  became the new CEO  He s expected to continue implementing the company s Velocity Growth Plan  focusing on digital  delivery  and Experience of the Future to grow the business over the coming years 
Which is the better buy 
In terms of valuation  IBM is significantly cheaper than McDonald s  The tech giant trades at a price to earnings ratio of just 11 compared to 27 for the fast food chain  That shouldn t come as a surprise given IBM s lack of growth recently  while McDonald s continues to put up impressive comparable sales gains  How both stocks are dividend powerhouses  McDonald s is a Dividend Aristocrat  having raised its dividend annually for 43 consecutive years  while IBM is set to join that elite club this year when it boosts its payout for the 25th year in a row 
McDonald s dividend is currently yielding 2 3   compared to IBM at 4 5   However  McDonald s has been raising its payouts at a much faster pace in recent years 
Overall  while there are reasons that investors might consider IBM    among them  its yield and its turnaround potential    McDonald s looks like the all around better buy  It has strong momentum and a smart strategy that has thus far delivered impressive results  While last year s sudden change of leadership brought some uncertainty with it  I expect McDonald s stock to continue to outperform IBM stock as the company takes advantage of opportunities in digital ordering  delivery  refurbished restaurants  and new menu items  McDonald s is the better choice ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnw8f,2069346

IBM s fourth quarter results by the numbers

Data source  IBM  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
Big Blue s adjusted earnings fell while the underlying GAAP net profit nearly doubled  The non GAAP results backed out a  1 9 billion tax benefit from the year ago period that was scaled down to a mere  14 million in this report 
The entire income statement also carries contributions from Linux vendor Red Hat  which IBM acquired in a blockbuster  33 billion deal that closed last summer  Red Hat reported fourth quarter earnings of  1 07 billion  up from  863 million in the comparable year ago period as a separate company  The company is now included in IBM s cloud and cognitive software division  which posted 9  year over year revenue growth to  7 2 billion 
A fresh generation of System Z mainframe computers lifted IBM s systems hardware sales 18  higher  Power server sales fell 23  while System Z orders surged 63  higher 
Debt service
IBM is known for its desire to send its cash flow back to shareholders through a combination of generous dividends and substantial share buybacks  That s still a long term ambition for Big Blue  but the company is tapping the brakes on its stock buybacks for a couple of years in order to pay down the debt that was used for financing the Red Hat acquisition 
On that note  IBM generated  6 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter and funneled  1 4 billion of that into dividend payouts  Another  3 4 billion was invested in accelerated debt repayments  Management hopes to complete the Red Hat related debt service by the end of 2021  restoring IBM s damaged credit ratings to a higher level investment grade 

What s next for IBM 
Looking ahead  IBM s management expects GAAP earnings to rise in fiscal year 2020  compared to  10 57 per share in the just completed year  Adjusted earnings should land north of  13 35 per share  implying at least 4  year over year growth  Free cash flow should also increase by roughly 4   landing near  12 5 billion 
 With this trajectory  in 2020  we expect to grow revenue  operating earnings per share  and free cash flow  and expand operating gross margin   CFO Jim Kavanaugh said in the earnings call   Within that  we ll maintain a high level of investment focused on hybrid cloud and data and AI capabilities  we ll drive productivity and take structural actions  especially in our  Global Technology Services  business  And remember  we ll continue to face year to year headwinds from the divested businesses  especially in the first half  and our P L will also still have an impact from the Red Hat non cash purchase accounting adjustments  though less than 2019  
This version of Big Blue  with Red Hat front and center  is finally on track to deliver on the cloud based strategic shift that started eight years ago  though it s happening while also paying down the massive debt that came with the Red Hat deal  Nothing is ever easy in this rapidly changing tech industry  That being said  I still like IBM as a long term wealth creator that marries a perennially undervalued stock    the shares are trading at just 10 9 times trailing earnings    to a bountiful 4 7  dividend yield  It s a great buy for patient investors ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plee5,2065023

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorWelcome and thank you for standing by  At this time  all participants are in a listen only mode  Today s conference is being recorded  If you have any objections  you may disconnect at this time Now I will turn the meeting over to Ms  Patricia Murphy with IBM  Ma am  you may begin Patricia Murphy    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  This is Patricia Murphy  Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM  And I want to welcome you to our Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Presentation  I m here with Jim Kavanaugh  IBM s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  We ll post today s prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially  Additional information about these factors is included in the company s SEC filings Our presentation also includes non GAAP measures to provide additional information to investors  For example  consistent with last quarter s format  we present revenue growth at constant currency throughout the presentation  In addition to provide a view consistent with our go forward business  we ll focus on constant currency growth adjusting for the divested businesses for the impacted lines of total revenue  cloud and our geographic performance  We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8 K submitted to the SEC I also want to remind you that IBM s revenue  profit and earnings per share reflect the impact of purchase accounting and other transaction related adjustments associated with the acquisition of Red Hat  These adjustments and charges are primarily non cash So with that  I ll turn the call over to Jim James J  Kavanaugh    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Finance and OperationsThanks  Patricia  And thanks to all of you for joining us We had a solid finish to 2019  In the fourth quarter  we grew revenue at actual rates and it was up 3  at constant currency excluding divestitures  Our operating gross margin was up over 2 points  which is the best margin expansion in some time  We delivered  4 2 billion of operating net income and  6 billion of free cash flow  and we had  4 71 of operating earnings per share  We also reduced our debt balance by another  3 billion in the quarter for a total reduction of  10 billion since the end of June  This caps off a year with  77 billion of revenue   12 81 of operating earnings per share  and about  12 billion of free cash flow  in line with our expectations In 2019  we took a number of actions to strengthen our foundation for the next chapter of our clients  digital reinventions  We acquired Red Hat with a number one Linux operating system  RHEL  and the leading hybrid cloud platform OpenShift  We modernized our software portfolio  making it cloud native and optimized for OpenShift  We announced the industry s first public cloud designed specifically for financial services  We expanded our services offerings and skills for the cloud journey including consulting and technology services for Red Hat in multi cloud management  We expanded the reach of our Watson AI offerings  and we are leading the industry in our approach to trust and transparency for data and AI  We continue to deliver innovation in areas like our new z15 mainframe and quantum  and we divested select software and services businesses as we continue to prioritize our investments and optimize our portfolio With 3  revenue growth  we started to see the benefits in our fourth quarter results  Cloud   Cognitive Software revenue was up 9   We had growth in all three lines of business  reflecting demand across our software portfolio  We had good adoption of our Cloud Paks  continued growth of security  and Red Hat again posted strong performance  In Global Business Services  we had continued growth in consulting and in application modernization projects as we help our clients on their digital journeys  We re also seeing this in our GBS signings this quarter  including acceleration in new Red Hat engagements Global Technology Services revenue was down 4  in line with the expectations we discussed last quarter  We expanded Global Technology Services gross margin consistent with our focus on managing the business for margin and profit  And in Systems  we had a good start to our z15 cycle and growth in high end storage resulting in double digit revenue growth and gross margin expansion in this segment Across our segments  our cloud revenue growth improved to 23  this quarter  and our cloud revenue for the year was  21 billion  By leveraging our technology  incumbency and expertise to help our clients with their journeys to cloud  it now represents 27  of our revenue  We know there s a lot of interest in our hybrid cloud approach including Red Hat  so I ll focus on that upfront As we ve said  the next chapter of cloud will be driven by mission critical workloads manage in a hybrid multi cloud environment  This will be based on a foundation of Linux with Containers and Kubernetes  This quarter we had strong performance in RHEL and OpenShift  Red Hat s normalized revenue was up 24   eclipsing  1 billion in a quarter for the first time  In August  we introduced Cloud Paks  cloud native software that simplifies deployment  reduces operational costs and allows clients to build once and run anywhere  Cloud Paks bring together IBM s middleware  AI  management and security  and Red Hat s OpenShift platform  Our strong performance in Cloud Paks this quarter is an example of the synergy from the IBM and Red Hat combination As we look forward  the largest hybrid cloud opportunity is in services  advising clients on architectural choices  moving workloads  building new applications  and of course  managing them  With IBM services expertise in digital reinventions and managing mission critical workloads  we are well positioned to help our clients on this journey  And now in the fourth quarter  demand for our cloud capabilities continue to ramp and we re starting to realize the synergies across IBM and Red Hat  We see it in our total cloud revenue  which as I said  was up 23   and we see it in our combined software revenue growth of 9  Across GBS and GTS  we nearly doubled the number of new services engagements leveraging Red Hat versus last quarter  We continued to expand our client base and now have over 2 000 clients using Red Hat and IBM container solutions  and we doubled the number of Red Hat large deals versus the previous quarter with 21 customers with deals greater than  10 million  And as I said  Red Hat s normalized revenue is up 24   Within that  infrastructure revenue  which is predominantly RHEL  was again up double digits and 1 point higher than last quarter s rate  We continue to take share with RHEL as clients put more of their enterprise workloads on Linux Revenue and application development and emerging technologies was up over 50  this quarter  driven by OpenShift and Ansible  As I mentioned  IBM s Cloud Paks include the OpenShift platform  And so as we sell Cloud Paks this drives additional Red Hat OpenShift revenue  The transactional nature of Cloud Pak sales accelerated the revenue growth of OpenShift and total Red Hat reflecting IBM s seasonally strongest quarter  Our partners also see the value of IBM and Red Hat  For example  we re expanding IBM s partnership with Workday  one of our most important enterprisewide business platform providers  As Workday grows  it is committed to using the Red Hat portfolio as a key component of a service delivery infrastructure  Workday is also expanding its use of the IBM Cloud We re also extending our partnership with Box  Box has chosen Red Hat to help power its IT infrastructure  and Watson as its preferred AI provider for intelligent business processes  IBM and Box are also working together to deliver joint solutions focused on governance  security and AI  And so  we re off to a great start with Red Hat with solid revenue trajectory and expanding client base  both good indicators of our clients  confidence in the value of IBM and Red Hat together So let me turn to IBM s key financial metrics  Similar to last quarter  IBM s revenue  profit and operating earnings per share reflect the impact of Red Hat s non cash transaction related activity and adjustments  Our revenue of  21 8 billion was up more than  3 7 billion sequentially  That s above the high end of the range we discussed in October  Strong transactional performance drove our 3  year to year revenue growth  With the contribution from our high value software and systems  our operating gross margin was up 230 basis points and our gross profit dollars were up 5   Our operating expense was up 15   reflecting the impact of Red Hat and significant investments we re making to strengthen our foundation for Chapter 2 and deliver sustainable revenue growth The majority of the increase  10 of the 15 points  is driven by acquisitions and divestitures  This includes Red Hat s operational spending and higher interest expense associated with the incremental debt we took on  The 10 point increase also reflects a year to year benefit from divested businesses including a gain of about  135 million associated with the divestiture completed in the fourth quarter  But to be clear  the benefit from the divestiture gain is more than offset by the investments we re making in innovation and in go to market capabilities  Over the last couple of quarters  we ve had higher spending for our z15 launch  for the containerization of our software and for research in areas like quantum  and you see that in higher base expense across SG A  research and development  which together with lower IP income drove 4 points of our expense increase Our operating tax rate in the quarter reflects a full year rate of about 9  versus the all in operating tax rate of 9  to 10  we previously discussed  Looking  Technical Issues  at our free cash flow  as I said earlier  we generated  6 billion in the quarter and nearly  12 billion for the year  That s 126  of GAAP net income  Our strong cash generation and focus on capital allocation leaves us with a stronger balance sheet ending the year with a cash balance of about  9 billion and improved debt profile with  10 billion of debt reduction in the second half So now I ll turn to the segment results  starting with Cloud   Cognitive Software  which was up 9  this quarter  We had growth across all three lines of business of cloud and data platforms  cognitive applications and transaction processing platforms  And cloud revenue in the segment was up over 75   demonstrating good adoption of our hybrid cloud solutions including Red Hat and Cloud Paks  Looking at the business areas  cloud and data platforms revenue was up 20  this quarter  This is one area we re starting to see the synergies of bringing IBM and Red Hat together  We had broad based traction across the suite of Cloud Paks that addresses workloads from automation to data to integration  Clients are realizing the benefits of hybrid cloud with this containerized middleware and data platform software portfolio including faster deployment and improved automation Cognitive applications grew this quarter reflecting the strength of our AI led software solutions including areas like security and IoT  We are continuing to drive new innovation in these areas  In November  we launched a Cloud Pak for security and early client reaction has been positive  This offering allows clients to integrate their security tools and connect to existing data sources  enabling them to resolve security incidents more quickly using open standards  This is the way we believe companies will effectively handle security in the hybrid cloud era and get more value for what they ve already invested in cyber security In IoT  we announced Maximo asset monitor  This is a new AI powered monitoring solution designed to help maintenance and operations leaders better understand and improve the performance of their high value physical assets  This new offering extends the Maximo suite deployed in nearly 100 countries and recognized by IDC as a leader for enterprise asset management applications And then in transaction processing platforms  revenue also grew this quarter  This performance reflects the value we provide clients managing critical workloads  and their preference for predictability and IT spend  While not directly correlated  new innovation like the z15 mainframe bolsters clients  confidence and drives commitment to our platform for the longer term Looking at profit for this segment  the decline in pre tax margin was driven by the purchase accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition  We are pleased with the momentum in Cloud   Cognitive Software in 2019  Revenue was up 6  for the year  driven by the hybrid cloud strategy  modernization of our software portfolio  and the strength of IBM and Red Hat together Moving to Global Business Services  our revenue was flat in the quarter and up for the year  In GBS  we bring together industry and technical expertise to help clients with their digital reinventions  As we enter Chapter 2  clients are making architectural choices and embarking on application led transformations  We ve been investing in offerings and capabilities to help advise clients and move their applications to a hybrid multicloud  Against this backdrop  our consulting revenue grew 4  driven by services that enable each phase of our clients  digital journey  We again had growth in application modernization and development  next generation enterprise applications like S 4HANA and Salesforce  and in offerings that use AI to unlock new opportunities and realize productivity improvements We see this at ExxonMobil where GBS iX partnered with the client to create its recently announced ExxonMobil Rewards   the all in one loyalty and payment application  which is hosted on the IBM Cloud  Our application management performance reflects continued revenue growth across the offerings that build and manage cloud applications  The year to year decline in AMS reflect strong prior year performance driven by the achievement of significant milestones across a few accounts  In global process services  revenue declined as demand is shifting from traditional BPO offerings to new business platforms around intelligent workflows Overall  we had good signings performance across all three lines of business in GBS with strong demand in digital strategy and iX  cloud application development and modernization  and offerings around intelligent workflows  We more than doubled our Red Hat signings sequentially and had 50 new client engagements in the quarter with companies such as Honda  Toyota and Vodafone Turning to profit  GBS gross margin was 27   While this is flat year to year  we had margin contribution from yield on our contract delivery improvements  mix shift to higher value content and currency benefit from leveraging our global delivery resource footprint  This was offset by investments we re making in capacity and offerings to capture the market opportunity  Overall  GBS had another solid year with full year revenue growth of 2  and gross margins expanding by almost 1 point In Global Technology Services  revenue declined 4  consistent with our expectations as we came into the quarter  We again had year to year declines due to lower client business volumes impacting some of the more traditional labor based managed services  We are taking actions to accelerate the shift to higher value segments of the market opportunity  We are introducing new managed services offerings for public and private cloud in areas like cybersecurity  data management and hybrid orchestration  We are investing in joint services offerings across GBS and GTS  and deploying joint go to market capability as clients look for solutions across applications and infrastructure We are expanding our cloud data center footprint and we are taking structural actions to improve our cost competitiveness  while deploying a more asset based delivery model  Our incumbency is a huge differentiator as the shift of mission critical workloads to the cloud accelerates  given our intimate knowledge of our clients  industry  business and regulatory requirements  An example is the first financial services ready public cloud that I mentioned earlier  We develop this in collaboration with Bank of America  leveraging our knowledge of the financial services industry environment to address the requirements for regulatory compliance  security and resiliency  We continue to have solid growth in our cloud offerings in GTS with 13  growth in cloud revenue and double digit growth in cloud signings This quarter  clients such as Banco Sabadell and Broadridge are turning to IBM to enable their transition to cloud  At Banco Sabadell  IBM will modernize the bank s IT environment  We re bringing together IBM services and Red Hat OpenShift to deploy new cloud native applications and modernize existing ones  while meeting the bank s security and regulatory requirements  And at Broadridge  we are moving their mission critical workloads to the cloud  This solution will leverage our deep financial services industry expertise and open source capabilities to allow Broadridge to provide industry leading solutions Turning to profit  we had good gross margin performance in GTS  Our year to year gross margin expansion of 20 basis points was driven by continued scale out of our public cloud  the mix of our portfolio and our productivity actions  We had the largest sequential improvement in pre tax margin in some time  In Systems  revenue was up 16  this quarter  Growth in IBM Z and storage was mitigated by a decline in power  IBM Z was up a strong 63   The performance reflects our first full quarter of z15 and demonstrates the client demand for technology that addresses data privacy and resiliency across hybrid cloud  We shipped the highest MIPS in history this quarter  driven by growth in new workloads and we ve already seen broad adoption of the new mainframe across a number of industries and countries  For example  we see large financial institutions migrating their global mainframe footprint to z15 as a critical backbone of their environment and cloud native strategy  Cloud native development simplifies building new applications and modernizing existing ones  This gives developers a consistent way to deploy their applications across public and private clouds  while taking advantage of the underlying performance  resiliency and security of IBM Z And in October  we announced Red Hat OpenShift for IBM Z bringing together the industry s most comprehensive enterprise Container and Kubernetes platform with the enterprise server platforms of IBM Z and LinuxONE  With these unique innovations  IBM Z continues to deliver a high value  secure and scalable platform for our clients  In the fourth quarter  power declined  I ll remind you that last year we launched our next generation POWER9 processes in the high end as well as completed the roll out of our supercomputers for the US Department of Energy  Storage revenue was up 3  led by growth in the high end  In November  we launched the next generation high end storage system DS8900  This new system tightly integrated with the z15 mainframe offers industry leading response times  availability and pervasive end to end encryption  Looking at profit  our Systems pre tax margin was up more than 5 points  reflecting the benefit from new hardware launches  New innovation is fundamental to this segment and we ve accomplished a lot this year with the release of both the new z15 mainframe and DS8900 high end storage Now turning to cash  we generated  6 7 billion of cash from operations  excluding our financing receivables  and  6 billion of free cash flow  This capped off a year with  14 3 billion of cash from operations  also excluding financing receivables  Our net capital expenditures were  2 4 billion  The year to year decline reflects our strategy to de emphasize lower value content across our services and financing portfolios  It also includes a benefit from real estate sales  which reduced our net capex  We generated free cash flow of  11 9 billion in 2019  in line with our view from the beginning of the year  and our free cash flow realization was 126  I ll remind you  our free cash flow reflects a few headwinds we ve discussed including the headwind in cash taxes  predominantly in the second half  the impact from Red Hat including pre closing financing costs  and the impacts of actions we ve taken on our portfolio  Looking at uses of cash  of course  our largest was the acquisition of Red Hat  We also returned over  7 billion to shareholders this year  This includes  5 7 billion in dividends  We ve now increased our dividend per share for 24 consecutive years  and we remain committed to growing our dividend  We also spent  1 4 billion on share repurchases prior to the closing of Red Hat Looking at the balance sheet  we ended the year with a cash balance of  9 billion  that s down  3 billion from a year ago when we were increasing our cash balance in advance of the Red Hat acquisition  Now let me spend a minute on our debt profile  With the additional debt we took on to fund the Red Hat transaction  we had  73 billion in debt at the end of June  a combination of Global Financing debt and non financing  or what I ll call core debt  We suspended our share repurchases at the time of the Red Hat acquisition  allowing us to focus our strong cash generation on debt repayment  In the fourth quarter  we reduced our debt by  3 billion contributing to  10 billion reduction in IBM s core debt since June  Our total debt now stands at  63 billion  of which core debt is  38 billion  This puts us on track to achieve a leverage ratio consistent with a mid to high single A rating within a couple of years I also want to comment on our Global Financing debt  which is fully supported by financing assets with a leverage ratio of 9 1  While there is no meaningful change to debt levels in the second half  we reduced our Global Financing debt by  6 5 billion since the beginning of the year  In February  we announced the wind down of our OEM commercial financing operations which we essentially completed by the end of the year  In addition to reducing our debt levels  this improved the overall credit quality of our receivables  which ended the year at 62  investment grade And as we typically do in January  I want to provide an update on the performance of our retirement related plans  Our US plan has been frozen since 2008  And over the last several years  we moved our asset base to a lower risk lower return profile  We had strong returns this year with just under 15  return on assets well ahead of our expected returns  At the end of 2019 in aggregate  our worldwide qualified plans are funded at 102  with the US at 107   that s up 3 points and 2 points  respectively from a year ago  You can see our retirement related plans continue to be well funded Now  let me wrap up with a few comments on 2019 and how this positions us for 2020  We ve been focused on the next chapter of our clients  digital reinventions  Upfront  I talk about what we ve done in 2019 to strengthen our foundation for Chapter 2  We acquired Red Hat  modernized our software portfolio and brought these together to create the leading hybrid cloud platform  We are introducing joint GBS and GTS offerings to help clients on their cloud journeys  We brought new innovations to market  I mentioned the Cloud Paks  the financial services public cloud  z15 and high end storage  We also have a leadership position in quantum  and again we re the leader in US patents  At the same time  we divested some businesses that weren t important to our success in Chapter 2  And now in the fourth quarter  we had good transactional performance across our high value software and systems  We re starting to realize the synergies from the combination of IBM and Red Hat in Cloud Paks  in services engagements  and in Red Hat itself  And in services  we re seeing good growth across GBS and GTS in the services to advise  migrate  build and manage hybrid cloud environments  along with some pressure in the traditional labor based services All together  we delivered revenue growth of 3  this quarter  With our high value mix and focus on productivity  we expanded our gross margin and we had strong free cash flow generation  With this trajectory  in 2020  we expect to grow revenue  operating earnings per share and free cash flow  and expand operating gross margin  Within that  we ll maintain a high level of investment focused on hybrid cloud and data and AI capabilities  we ll drive productivity and takes structural actions  especially in our GTS business  And remember  we ll continue to face year to year headwinds from the divested businesses  especially in the first half  and our P L will also still have an impact from the Red Hat non cash purchase accounting adjustments  though less than 2019  Looking at tax  we expect an operating tax rate in the range of 7  to 9   Like 2019  that s an all in rate  including an estimate of discrete items Putting all this together  we expect to deliver at least  13 35 of operating earnings per share for the year  Turning to free cash flow  we expect about  12 5 billion in 2020  Within that  we re expecting growth in capex  as we continue to build out cloud capacity  And as we said back in August  we expect Red Hat to be accretive to free cash flow  and that s net of the incremental interest expense With that  let me turn it back over to Patricia for the Q A Patricia Murphy    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Jim  Before we begin the Q A  I d like to mention a few items First  I ll remind you that the year to year growth rates  we re providing today for Red Hat are normalized to provide comparability to Red Hat s historical performance  Second  we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the full year  And finally  as always  I ask you to refrain from multi part questions So  Sheila  let s open it up for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America  Your line is open Wamsi Mohan    Bank of America    AnalystYes  Thank you  Jim  nice to see the strong overall revenue performance and Red Hat performance as well  I know you don t explicitly guide revenues  but can you help at a high level bridge the big items that we should be thinking about in 2020 relative to 2019 for revenues  And then do the same for free cash flow  I know you touched a little bit on capex  But if you could maybe break it down between core business  Red Hat  tax  pension  what are some of the larger puts and takes that we should think about embedded in that  500 million increase year to year  That would be great  Thank you James J  Kavanaugh    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Finance and OperationsOkay  Thank you  Wamsi  and I appreciate the compliment to all the IBM ers around there  who have been working hard  Let me start out as we always talk about our guidance  It s the first time we re coming out with 2020 guidance overall  And as we always do  we take into account multiple scenarios trajectory of our business  operational indices  business plans  etc   and all that gives us confidence in the expectation we went out with regards to  13 35 at least on EPS  and approximately  12 5 billion  But there are a couple of things underneath that  and some of them  which you talked about  let me just share some of the color So first around currency  Currency  we expect on a full year to be pretty de minimis between 0 point and 1 point of a headwind  a little bit different what we ve been challenged with the last few years  but most of that s going to be here in the first half and in the first quarter at current spot rates  Second  we ve done a lot of work around our portfolio optimization  divest the non core assets  that is going to be about 1 point impact on the year and 2 point impact in the first half  very similar to what we just finished in second half of the year  Three  we re continuing to deal with the deferred revenue impairment and we were very transparent on Investor Day  we gave you the four quarter roll out  and that s predominantly a first half statement  second half it s lessen  And four  embedded in our results as we talked about our prepared remarks  we ll go through  In GTS  we are going to take aggressive structural actions to reposition the business overall  I would tell you  if you look at the last few years  that will probably be on the high end of that  And when you take a look at our guidance on tax  which again to be fully transparent 7  to 9   that is all in including discretes  we expect a tax discrete benefit in the first quarter that will pretty much offset the charge  and on a full year basis be immaterial  So that s some of the color behind the overall Now  when you talk about the full year  I mean  you look at our guidance in the full year  we will grow revenue  we will grow operating earnings per share  we will grow free cash flow  and we will continue to expand margins nicely  And embedded in that will be continued acceleration of our cloud business and continued good growth out of the IBM plus Red Hat together Patricia Murphy    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  Wamsi  Let s go to the next question  please OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Tien tsin Huang with JP Morgan  Your line is open Tien tsin Huang    JP Morgan    AnalystHi  thanks  good afternoon to you guys  Just    I guess I m also intrigued by the revenue growth outlook for  20  And again I know you can t get too much on segment thoughts  but with GTS signings down  the short cycle stuff was an issue last quarter  I m curious  just your visibility or confidence in delivering the revenue growth against that what you see with GTS  again recognizing that you also have some structural actions to do James J  Kavanaugh    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Finance and OperationsYeah  well  let s talk about since we got asked twice  and again  Tien tsin  thank you for the question  Overall  as I said  at the IBM level  we expect to grow revenue  operating earnings per share  free cash flow and continue to expand margins  Within that  when you look at it by segment  let me give you some of the colors from a segment Number one  we continue to have a very strong portfolio and offering line up in our software base of business  complementing now with the Red Hat acquisition  you re seeing in our results the synergistic value we re bringing to our clients  bringing IBM and Red Hat together  and we see consistent performance in that segment  GBS overall  we actually finished pretty strong in GBS  very strong signings in the quarter  We returned that business for the first time in years back to backlog growth and we re pretty optimistic about accelerated growth in 2020  GTS  to your question  we talked about 90 days ago  fourth quarter played out pretty consistent with the guidance we gave 90 days ago  And when you look at our backlog position where we ended and you look into 2020  we are going to take actions around high value portfolio optimization  around offerings  around go to market models  around incentives and changing our operating model in light of what we re seeing in the marketplace  and I would see an improving trend in GTS as we move through the year predominantly in the second half  And then if you look at Systems  we re off to a very good start  That segment has always been predicated based on bringing new innovation and value to market  Our z15 and new high end storage  which we brought the market  both grew nicely  Value proposition resonating  We expect a very strong first half in both of those  And we ll see as we get into the second half  how this cycle plays out Patricia Murphy    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Tien tsin  for the question  Sheila  can we please go to the next question OperatorOur next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse  Your line is open Matt Cabral    Credit Suisse    AnalystYeah  Thank you  Wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the performance in GBS  and in particular dig into what s driving the divergence between consulting and apps management  And then related to that  just if you can walk through what drove the pressure on PTI margins for the segment in the fourth quarter and how we should think about profitability there going forward James J  Kavanaugh    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Finance and OperationsSure  Thanks  Matt  I appreciate the question  GBS overall  first of all  we talked about 90 days ago  we were facing a very difficult compare  When you look at fourth quarter last year  I think I m going off memory  we grew high single digit overall  we were double digit consulting growth  we returned apps    application management to mid single digit growth  And we talked at that time that we had done a lot of work about improving the quality of our delivery and we had achieved significant milestones that were contributing to fourth quarter last year  And by the way  if I remember correctly  our pre tax income was up 30  to 40  fourth quarter last year So we knew what we were entering here in the fourth quarter  But I ll tell you  overall  I couldn t be more pleased with the GBS space of business for the full year  second year in a row  consistent revenue growth  We grew operating gross profit margins by 90 basis points  We continue to reposition this business to capture the growth in our clients  digital reinventions and journey to cloud  we re seeing nice acceleration in both  And as I just said on the prior question  we finished the year pretty strong in GBS with regards to signings growth  returning to overall backlog back to growth and we see an accelerated GBS positioning going into 2020  And to your question  that s really led by    we ve talked about the rationale of Chapter 2 around hybrid cloud  around a large portion of mission critical workloads that are going to move to the cloud as we move forward and hybrid is going to be that destination I think what you re seeing is the natural early innings of that playing out  And that is represented more so in project based businesses around cloud advisory  cloud application  migration and advisory services  So consulting is leading the way  but to me  that s the tip of the arrow that s going to lead then AMS  and then eventually as that matures  our GTS managed services going forward Patricia Murphy    Vice President  Investor RelationsThanks  Matt  Can we please go to the next question OperatorOur next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein  Your line is open Toni Sacconaghi    Bernstein    AnalystYes  thank you for the question  You talked a lot about the very strong transactional performance in the quarter  I think better than your expectations  Is there a risk that that pulled forward any revenue from 2020  And I think you talked about 4  to 5  revenue growth on your August call for 2020  Is that something we should still be thinking about  And then on cash flow  I know a number of people have asked  but maybe you can just draw a bridge between this year and next year  You re up about  0 5 billion  I think you ve said Red Hat alone will contribute  0 5 billion  That implies that everything ex Red Hat is flat despite the fact that margins appear to be going up and you seem quite confident in some of the businesses  So maybe you can also just help with that bridge as well  Thanks so much James J  Kavanaugh    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Finance and OperationsThanks  Tony  Appreciate the questions overall  Let me try to take each of these  and piece parts First of all  fourth quarter  yes  If you dial back 90 days ago  we talked about our seasonality in our business and we were looking for a transactional quarter that would take our sequential growth up about  3 5 billion to  3 7 billion  and we achieved above that high end  Now  truth be told all transparency  currency got a little bit better in the quarter  But even with that  we still beat the high end of our guidance overall  and most importantly returned IBM back to revenue growth  Now when you look underneath the transactional performance  I would tell you  one  our mainframe  we re off to a normal cycle here in the quarter  We had a very good start  Our first full quarter  grown 63   highest MIPS ship in history  So I would tell you that less about a pull forward from 2020  that s kind of normal cycle And when you get underneath software  we ve got good momentum  We spent a lot to invest and modernize our software portfolio  containerized our offerings  make them cloud native  and optimized and OpenShift with Red Hat to play out the synergistic value of IBM plus Red Hat  and I think we re seeing very good momentum in adoption in our Cloud Paks here in the fourth quarter  The only area I would call out  and we ve talked about this many times  and that is our transaction processing platforms  We ve run mission critical workloads on our systems for our clients  it s high value for our clients  it s high value for IBM  And there is always volatility in that portfolio on when clients choose to commit to our platform for the long term And you saw in the fourth quarter  we actually did better than our internal expectation  So we re taking a prudent view of that in 2020  But I think that s another instantiation of the innovative value we bring to the marketplace with our systems offerings overall  So that s what I would say with regards to your first question  I m trying to remember all of them Let me go to free cash flow  Very important  We said approximately  12 5 billion  And when you look underneath that  yes  during the Investor Day  we said over the next two years  Red Hat and IBM will deliver  1 5 billion of free cash flow  By the way  that Red Hat will be free cash flow accretive in year one  and we are well on our path for that  So when you look at the dynamics of our free cash flow  it s really in a couple of different buckets  A couple of headwinds  A couple of tailwinds  On the tailwind side  we re going to have operational profit and we re going to have Red Hat contribution  all in  net of incremental interest expense  retention  etc   will be accretive in year one  On the tailwind    excuse me  the headwind side  we are going to invest  In 2019  our capital we were driving a balanced capital allocation process  driving efficiencies out of that  that will wrap in 2019 and we will have a headwind in capex and the investing in our business  and we will also have a headwind in cash tax overall And when you take a look to your last question around revenue  I would tell you right now  we said in August that Red Hat    IBM plus Red Hat together would deliver 4 points to 5 points  When I look at where the current estimate is and consensus in the Street  I think the Street is pretty reasonable  It s 3  overall  you add at constant currency  with the headwind on the currency to stronger dollar  and you look at our divestitures  we re at mid single digit growth  So I think the current estimates out there reasonable Patricia Murphy    Vice President  Investor RelationsGreat  thanks  Can we go to the next question please OperatorOur next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI  Your line is open Amit Daryanani    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks for taking my question  guys  I guess  Jim  when I look at the calendar  20 EPS guide  in the past  you ve kind of talked about how does the contribution fall out for Q1 and the first half broadly on an EPS on rate basis  I was wondering if you could just touch on    does Q1 account for 17   18  of full year s EPS again  or does that now change a little bit with Red Hat  And then secondly  on the tax rate  just I get this clear  the delta between the 8  tax rate that you re guiding for versus the 11  and 12  that people had in the models  that s essentially all the discrete benefit we get in Q1  Is that fair James J  Kavanaugh    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Finance and OperationsYes  Thanks  Amit  I appreciate the question  And let me take each of them  Just quickly  net  you re right  On color of first quarter  it is a little different  just given the Red Hat  And if you go back to how we were transparent and hopefully everyone appreciates this as I go out and talk to investors  we ve given you the deferred revenue impairment charge for the first four quarters after the closure of the Red Hat transaction  But really when you look at our first quarter  first on EPS  We expect EPS from SKU perspective to be between 14  and 15  of the full year  Underneath that  that is basically on our historical trajectory  less the Red Hat deferred revenue impairment  which as we told you is about  400 million  So pretty normal SKU  taking into account the Red Hat deferred element In terms of revenue  we look at revenue and we see    again  can t predict currency  We re calling currency between a small impact to about 1 point impact right now  all that varies depending on our geographic and product mix  But we re seeing right now at a constant currency level  accelerated growth of about 0 5 point here from fourth quarter to first quarter at constant currency And when you take a look at tax rate  very good question  We printed in 2019  8 5  all in  We guided pretty much right between that  7  to 9  overall  That does include discretes as we re trying to give you increased transparency and what s in our expectation  but very important to note  is I talked about we will be taking structural actions to reposition our GTS business from a cost competitiveness perspective in light of what we re seeing in the marketplace  And unlike last year where we had a funding event with regards to a gain that offset a charge  this year we re taking a charge and we re going to absorb that through the return of that  So we really don t see a benefit overall  as we go forward Patricia Murphy    Vice President  Investor RelationsGreat  Thanks  Amit  Let s go to the next question please OperatorNext  we will hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Katy Huberty    Morgan Stanley    AnalystYes  thank you  Two quick questions  First  Jim  you mentioned the possibility of taking structural actions in GTS this year  What might that entail  And then back in August  you had outlined about  1 65 billion of potential revenue synergies post Red Hat  Any context around how much of that you have captured  Should we think about the 4 point acceleration in Red Hat pro forma growth as signaling the type of revenue synergies that you ve been able to capture  Thank you James J  Kavanaugh    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Finance and OperationsYeah  so let me take the second one first  and we ll talk about synergies  So obviously as I stated upfront  we re very pleased with the first six months here of bringing IBM and Red Hat together  and I think you could see based on the performance in the acceleration that we are truly better together  We re delivering the synergistic value to our clients overall  The best way  when I look at it  first of all  the accelerated revenue in Red Hat up 24  year over year is one instantiation  The second  and I know many of you out there have been writing and have different models of trying to figure out what s IBM s organic revenue number and so forth  and I ve been spent a lot of time with our investors  And let me give you the way we look at it and how we re managing to ensure that we drive the synergistic value of the technology architecture decisions we re making and the go to market leverage of our scale and large enterprise presence  which gets at your  1 6 billion plus of synergistic effect When we look at our business overall  we re looking for the lift in the growth in the acceleration of our overall software business  And when we look at the operational performance of this segment  we look at it on an all in historical normalized basis  And at that level  our software growth accelerated all in to 3   Now what does this reflect  To your question  it reflects  in my opinion  the true demand of our software demand from our clients  including Red Hat  Then adjusting out the deferred revenue impairment impact and Red Hat s stand alone revenue last year  So when you look at what we talked about in Investor Day  we talked about sell more Blue IBM and we talked about sell more Red  The sell more Red was our global presence and our scale to accelerate Red Hat overall  And as I said in the prepared remarks  we re seeing a great progress  We had 21 deals above  10 million  up 2x year over year  and a half    over half of those deals were large IBM enterprise clients So we are seeing the instantiation of the leverage of the IBM side  And around sell more IBM  I just told you about accelerating software revenue  We have now over 2 000 clients on OpenShift and Cloud Paks  and around services  we ve signed hundreds of services Red Hat engagement deals overall including several design wins in network cloud providers around 5G that will play out as we go through 2020 Patricia Murphy    Vice President  Investor RelationsGreat  thanks  Can we go to the next question please OperatorOur next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus  Your line is open David Grossman    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystThank you  Good afternoon  Jim  can you give us a little better insight into the specific issues that are impacting GTS including the bookings performance  And what underlies your confidence that growth should improve as the year progresses given that the GTS turnaround really  truth be told  is probably eight or nine quarters in already and taking longer than you anticipated James J  Kavanaugh    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Finance and OperationsOkay  David  thank you very much for the question  And let me start with providing some overall context  because I think it s important to share what are we seeing in the market and then how that informs our actions  As you heard in the prepared remarks  we printed down 4   consistent with our expectations and what we talked about 90 days ago as we re experienced lower client base business volumes  But it s important to note  GTS  one  has the industry leading market share position  two  has the global footprint and scale  and three  most importantly has a very integral role into the integrated value proposition of IBM overall as we run the mission critical workloads for many of our clients overall And by the way  you see that playing out in our cloud based performance in GTS  where over the trailing 12 months  we got over  8 5 billion book of business that s growing double digits  and you heard the significant wins we had in the quarter  Broadridge  Banco Sabadell  Bank of America public cloud  in addition to several Red Hat wins  including what I just said about some design wins with network providers  But I ll tell you what we re seeing in the marketplace  David  to your point is clients are making architectural choices  There are embarking on application led transformation  And we see this opportunity really playing out as I said earlier in project based services  the advise  the build  the migrate  which is very aligned to our GBS business And by the way  that s why we feel pretty confident in where we ended 2019 and our opportunity in 2020 around GTS  Now if you look at    as client adoption matures and it moves through the advisory phase and the application modernization phase  this will naturally extend to our GTS aligned managed services phase  which should scale up over time  And that s why I said  more of a second half play as we go forward  So in light of that  what we re seeing in the marketplace  we are going to take aggressive actions around our GTS business model  We are going to reposition this business for hybrid cloud investing jointly  integrating GTS and GBS offerings around advise  build  move and manage  we are creating a building skills and investing  and where we see the growth right in front of us  that s starting to scale around cybersecurity management  trust and compliance services  multi cloud management  and of course managed services around OpenShift  And second  we are going to integrate our go to market with GBS and our global account teams at the large enterprise level  We re going to take these integrated offerings  leverage now the integrated value and breadth of IBM that can play across the continuum as clients move to journey to the cloud And we re going to go drive that hard  And in addition  I would tell you  we are going to improve the cost competitive structure of this business with the actions we re going to take here early in 2020 Patricia Murphy    Vice President  Investor RelationsThanks  David  Can we go to the next question please OperatorNext  we will hear from Jim Suva with Citigroup  Your line is open Jim Suva    Citigroup    AnalystThank you very much  Everything you talked about totally makes sense and jives  Phonetic   And I have one question and it s probably because I m just definitely not the smartest one out there  And that s on the signings numbers  That number appears  if my number looks right in the calculations  that it was down year over year  Are there some features going on  like maybe larger contracts rolling off  or something with timing we should be aware of  or at some point  shouldn t that revert to be positive or if not  why  Kind of what s going on about why everything else is going so well  but the signings number just looks like it just didn t materialize to be up James J  Kavanaugh    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Finance and OperationsSure  Jim  Thanks for your question  I appreciate it  And no  you got the numbers right  So let me talk a little bit about signings overall  and more importantly  as I ve always said before  signings vary  they re not all equal  how they impact backlog  how they impact realization  But if you look at our signings overall  we delivered  14 4 billion  I would tell you internally  that was actually above our expectations  Why  To your point  we were coming off of a very difficult compare last year  Signings are down 9  overall  And when you look underneath it to my point about all signings are not equal  and you break out large deals from smaller deals  and let me just use  100 million as I ve been for the last few quarters here  our large deal signings greater than  100 million were down 34   That was coming off of last year where we had 19 deals above  100 million  predominantly in our GTS base of business  of which many of those were natural extensions and not new logos  That s the point about signings not be an equal But our smaller deals  less than  100 million by the way  which is still big  were up double digits  both for the quarter and for the half  and across both businesses  GTS and GBS  Back to David Grossman s question  I think you re seeing the natural evolution of the early innings of this journey to cloud as we move forward Now the interesting thing is  underneath  we posted over  112 billion worth of backlog  And that backlog was actually up  5 billion quarter to quarter  That s one of our largest sequential 3Q to 4Q backlog increase  by the way  with and without currency that we ve had in quite some time So I would tell you  net answer  tough compare  large deal focus  but the health of the underlying portfolio growing substantially double digits both GTS  GBS  in less than  100 million Patricia Murphy    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  great  Thanks  Sheila  let s take one last question OperatorThank you  Our last question comes from Jeffrey Kvaal with Nomura Instinet  Your line is open Jeffrey Kvaal    Nomura Instinet    AnalystYes  thanks very much  I would like to clarify a prior point and then throw out a broader one  And the clarification is  if you could go once again through the delta on EPS given the tax rate  it does seem as though many of us had expected 3 or so points higher on the tax and that works out to be  0 40  So that s a big increase in opex  I just want to make sure I ve tied that correctly And then a bigger picture  to what extent do you think any of the    or how much of the changes in the macroeconomic picture affected your outlook for 2020 and that could include trade or what have you  Thank you James J  Kavanaugh    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Finance and OperationsThank you  Jeffrey  Appreciate the question  On the 2020 guidance  reiterate it just to make sure there is absolute clarity here for everyone  When you look at our tax rate  our tax rate in 2019  8 5   Our tax rate in 2020  we said 7  to 9   pretty much right in the middle  So tax year to year is not a benefit  We re growing operating EPS year over year  When you look at that tax rate    and I m not going to talk to what each of you have in your own model  but underneath that we  as we said  are going to take structural actions to reposition our GTS business for the hybrid cloud world  Those structural actions are going to flow through to profit And when I said those structural actions upfront  I said  if you look at the last few years  we are going to be at the high end of that range  of that total charge  There is no coverage for that charge  We are going to absorb the return in our fiscal 2020 and still grow operating earnings per share to at least  13 35 coming off of what we just finished at  12 81  So that s the first question was Was there a part two  Macro environment  I would tell you  Jeffrey  if you ask me from 90 days ago to today  we ve obviously had some clarity around some of the uncertainty was out there with regards to at least Phase 1 on trade  around Brexit  and a few other areas  I ve always said  when you have high value innovative technology that you can bring to market that creates differentiated competitive advantage for your clients  spending will occur  If anything    and by the way  I don t think this is a change we ve seen throughout  19  CFOs that I talked to  everyone is focused on more so productivity  ROI and predictability of spend  Everyone is trying to lock in what their spend rates are as they move forward But when you have strong technology like the mainframe that brings differentiated value  people are buying that to actually deliver differentiation for them in the marketplace to win So as always  let me make a few comments to wrap up the call  2019 was an important year for IBM  We had a good end to the year and we re pleased with the strength and the positioning exiting the year  The acceleration in Red Hat  strong adoption of our Cloud Paks  growth in our cloud based services  all validate the actions we ve taken to position us for growth in 2020 So I want to thank all of you for joining us today and we look forward to continuing the dialog Patricia Murphy    Vice President

173339,394855,IBM,Better Buy  Cisco Systems vs  IBM,news,"These days  the tech industry isn t short of non profitable  high growth companies  But if you prefer to invest in solid free cash flow machines that should still be able to pay a generous dividend even if a recession materializes  tech giants Cisco Systems and International Business Machines are probably on your radar  But which one should you prioritize 
IBM is facing yet another transformation
Over the last couple of decades  IBM has been selling hardware  software  and services  consultancy and outsourcing  that help enterprises run their computing infrastructure  However  after having survived technology revolutions  major recessions  and world wars  the company    founded in 1911     must adapt its business to cloud computing 
As enterprises move some of their applications from their premises to the cloud  they ve needed less hardware and software from IBM  which has also reduced the need for IBM s consultants to implement those solutions 
With the divestiture of some of its low margin businesses  such as its low end servers in 2014  IBM has been posting diminishing revenue  that figure dropped from its historical highs of  106 9 billion in 2011 to  77 1 billion over the last 12 months 
However  IBM has been investing in growing markets  such as machine learning and cybersecurity  to offset this decline  And with its  34 billion acquisition of Red Hat in 2019  it has also made a strong push into the cloud market 
As a result  IBM s revenue stayed flat in 2018  and last quarter  revenue declined by only 0 6  after adjusting for divestitures and currency exchange  Besides  as an illustration of the company s shift to new technologies  revenue from its cloud business increased to 27 8  of its total revenue during the last quarter compared to 4 4  in 2013 
Despite these challenges  IBM stabilized its operating margin    under generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP     above 15   Its trailing 12 month net income reached  7 7 billion  which largely covers its annualized last quarter dividend of  5 6 billion 

Cisco dominates its market
Cisco is also facing the threat of cloud computing  but in a different way compared to IBM 
Since the end of the last century  Cisco has been selling routers and switches  These network devices connect computers and servers to the same physical network  and they forward network traffic between networks  Cisco dominates this market given its 51  market share during the last quarter of 2018  according to a study from Synergy Research Group 
The giant network vendor then expanded its portfolio with cybersecurity and communication solutions that complement its core business  For instance  enterprises can select Cisco as a single provider for their network and cybersecurity solutions  which simplifies the procurement  implementation  and maintenance of their computing infrastructure  
However  Cisco was slow to adapt its monolithic and proprietary technologies to cloud networking  Web scale providers such as Amazon with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft with Azure require scalable  flexible  performant  and cost effective solutions to grow their huge networks  As a result  emerging competitors proposed network solutions that fit the cloud data center model  For example  Arista Networks has made a dent in Cisco s high speed data center switching market share  which decreased from 78 1  in 2012 to 46 6  during the first half of 2019  
Yet despite its expected single digit year over year revenue decline next quarter due to the challenging macro environment  Cisco should continue dominating its market given its large revenue base of  51 7 billion in fiscal 2019  up 7  year over year  Also  it recently addressed its weakness in the cloud data center with its chip  Silicon One  and its network operating system  IOS XR7  that cloud titans can use to build their own network devices 
Cisco s scale  which contributes to optimizing both its research and development and sales and marketing expenses over its large revenue base  has kept its GAAP operating margin above 25  over the last few years 
As a result  with its trailing 12 month net income of  11 billion and its positive cash position    net of debt    of  8 4 billion  Cisco s annualized last quarter dividend of  5 9 billion seems safe 
Cisco or IBM  Both 
Looking at the valuation metrics listed in the table below  IBM s stock seems cheaper than Cisco s

IBM s stock comes with more risks due to its lower margins and higher debt load    giving it a lower valuation  But both tech stocks remain compelling for investors looking for a safe dividend with exposure to the tech industry  Thus  there s no clear winner  Prudent investors could diversify their portfolios and buy both stocks ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pivfx,2061126
173340,394856,IBM,Another Revenue Decline Expected for IBM,news,"International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  will report its fourth quarter results after the market closes on Tuesday  Jan  21  The report will close out a challenging year  with revenue down in 2019 as the company continues to transform itself  The acquisition of Red Hat is part of that transformation  but it won t help IBM s numbers much in the fourth quarter 
What happened last time
IBM s third quarter report was a mixed bag  Earnings beat analyst expectations  but revenue slumped by more than expected 

Data source  IBM 
Adjusted for currency and divestitures  revenue was down just 0 6  in the third quarter 
IBM completed the acquisition of Red Hat last July  so its third quarter numbers did include Red Hat s results  However  IBM was able to recognize only a portion of Red Hat s standalone revenue because of accounting rules related to deferred revenue  While Red Hat would have generated nearly  1 billion of revenue as an independent company  IBM was able to recognize just  371 million of revenue 
While Red Hat s revenue contribution was only partial  IBM did have to recognize all of Red Hat s expenses  That s one reason for the steep decline in earnings 
Like its overall results  IBM s segment results were a mixed bag 

Data source  IBM 
What analysts are expecting
IBM is expected to report small declines in revenue and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter 

Data source  Yahoo  Finance 
Once again  IBM will be required to include all of Red Hat s expenses but only a portion of its revenue  Revenue will get a boost from the z15 mainframe  which began shipping at the very end of the third quarter  The tech giant typically enjoys four to five quarters of strong year over year growth in mainframe revenue after each major refresh 
Red Hat can drive growth in the long run
IBM should be able to muster some revenue growth in 2020  thanks to Red Hat and the new mainframe  On a stand alone basis  Red Hat grew its revenue by 20  in the third quarter  With an annual revenue run rate of roughly  4 billion  that s around  800 million of annual growth if IBM can maintain that rate 

IBM can accelerate Red Hat s growth by selling its software to existing customers with little or no Red Hat exposure  IBM sees a  1 billion annual revenue opportunity for every 5  of its large client base that adopts Red Hat 
The benefit of acquiring Red Hat was on display when IBM announced a 10 year   1 1 billion deal to overhaul Spanish bank Banco Sabadell s IT systems  Banco Sabadell is moving to a hybrid cloud environment  and Red Hat s OpenShift platform is a key ingredient 
IBM s results will continue to be muddled by revenue recognition rules related to Red Hat in the fourth quarter and into 2020  Earnings will be under pressure this year  but IBM expects EPS to begin to benefit from Red Hat in 2021  Also in 2021  Red Hat is expected to add around  1 billion to IBM s free cash flow 
IBM made a big bet on the hybrid cloud when it paid  34 billion for Red Hat  We ll see over the next few years whether that gamble pays off ",2020-01-20,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkcxs,2063198

173370,394886,IBM,IBM Post Earnings  Mainframe Cycle Could Buy Time For RedHat Integration,opinion,"While the big news after International Business Machines s  NYSE IBM  earnings release was that Ginni Rometty would be stepping down as CEO  and would be replaced by Arvind Krishna   supposedly the  IBM  executive that pushed for the RedHat acquisition   while James Whitehurst  the RedHat CEO who will become president of IBM  maybe the more important aspect to the earnings release was that the mainframe  System Z   business was strong in Q4  19 and helped drive results 

Morningstar noted in their summary of IBM s 4th quarter that typically the mainframe cycle lasts 5 quarters  My first thought was that  well  that gives IBM a year to get RedHat fully integrated into IBM  

Morningstar still does not think this is a turnaround for IBM   and that the pop in the stock represents just a rally to catch the mainframe cycle  my words  not Morningstar s  
Street consensus is expecting just 1 2  revenue growth over the next three years   2020 to 2023  which is expected to generate 4  5  EPS growth  which is still better than the decade of 2010 to 2019  where only three of those years saw positive revenue growth 

Expectations for IBM are still remarkably subdued today 

In an article written for Seeking Alpha prior to earnings  two graphs were posted showing that IBM has underperformed the S P 500 by about 1500 bp s per year since IBM s stock price peak near  215 in 2013  and 1300 bp s per year for the entire decade from 2010 to 2019   The article is here  but it was posted only for subscribers  

Here is a weekly chart of IBM  






Readers can see the green spike in the last few weeks in the stock price  some of it possibly due to short covering and some due to  perhaps  optimism over a new CEO and President focused on RedHat and the hybrid cloud and cloud opportunity 
An interesting interview on CNBC last week between Becky Quick and CNBC contributor  demonstrated the emotion of the Ginni Rometty s resignation  Becky   reading the script   called Rometty s tenure  turbulent  while Sonnenfeld was far more upbeat and glowing 

Maybe a better word for Rometty s time as CEO was  lethargic   Watson never went anywhere and was heavily promoted in ads  until analysts started asking questions about Watson s numbers and then it went away  because Watson  at least 3 years ago  was more hype than reality  The  strategic imperatives  initiatives around the cloud from 2 3 years ago fizzled as well  IBM reported the growth every quarter and it really failed to get traction  IBM was a distant player in the cloud business and still is  although the hybrid cloud and RedHat could drive some growth for IBM   if they get it right   Morningstar describes the hybrid cloud market as a  1 4 trillion opportunity  still in its earlier stages  

Summary   Conclusion   Readers worried about the length of this bull market today can hedge some of that risk by looking at long term laggards that have badly under performed the S P 500  and IBM  certainly qualifies in that regard  The above chart shows IBM is seeing some renewed interest from investors BUT the stock needs to trade over  160 on decent volume and remain there to break the 7 year downtrend 

I ll be looking at the back half of 2020 s EPS and revenue estimate revisions  and also 2021 to see if analysts have any confidence in Arvind Krishna and James Whitehurst and the IBM hybrid cloud team  Morningstar is skeptical on the hybrid cloud opportunity  the old Mstar analyst saw more opportunity  but the new analyst is definitely more skeptical about IBM being able to turnaround based on RedHat and the hybrid cloud 
Color me a skeptical believer  The right management always matters 

The stock still has an 8  free cash flow yield and a 4 5  dividend yield for those who can be patient  Client positions are still less than 1  of total invested assets ",2020-02-06,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibm-post-earnings-mainframe-cycle-could-buy-time-for-redhat-integration-200505078,200505078

update on the ongoing 2019 Q4 earnings season and evolving impact of the virus outbreak on estimates for the current period  we present here new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Exxon Mobil  Chevron and International Business Machines  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of February 6th  2020 Including all of this morning s reports  we now have Q4 earnings reports from 305 S P 500 members or 61  of the index s total membership  Total earnings for these 305 index members are up  0 5  from the same period last year on  4 1  higher revenues  with 71 8  beating EPS estimates and 67 5  beating revenue estimates This is better performance than we have seen from this same group of companies in the recent past  even though earnings growth remains anemic and a lower proportion of companies are beating EPS estimates  Looking at Q4 as a whole  combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still to come reports  total earnings are now expected to be up  0 5  on  4 2  higher revenues 2020 Q1 Estimates Coming DownEstimates for the current period  2020 Q1  have started coming down in a notable way over the last few days  with the Coronavirus impact a big driver for the estimate cuts  S P 500 earnings in 2020 Q1 are now expected to be up  1 7   sharply down from  3 4  last week Given the evolving nature of this headwind  it is reasonable to expect that 2020 Q1 estimates will come down further in the coming days For a complete look at the Q4 earnings season and expectations for the current and coming quarters  please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here Exxon Mobil shares have lagged the peer group lately  but the Zacks analyst likes the company for its bellwether status in the energy space and optimal integrated capital structure that has helped it come up with industry leading returns The company owns some of the most prolific upstream assets globally  with a number of major projects slated to come online over the next few years  Notably  ExxonMobil has made 16 oil discoveries in offshore Guyana and estimates 750 000 barrels of oil production per day from the region by 2025 However  the company s downstream and chemical businesses significantly underperformed in 2019  resulting in lower than expected earnings  The units are unlikely to recover in the coming quarters owing to scheduled maintenance activities  As such  the stock warrants a cautious stance   You can  Like all energy stocks  Chevron shares have struggled lately  but they have nevertheless done better than the peer group as whole  Driving this outperformance is Chevron s status as one of the best placed global integrated oil companies to achieve sustainable production ramp up America s No  2 energy company s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry  thanks to planned expansion in the lucrative Permian Basin  Chevron s substantial Permian holdings of 2 2 million net acres realized production growth of 154 MBOE d in 2019 with Chevron targeting output of 900 000 barrels per day in 2023 Chevron s well economics in the play also continues to improve as it has been able to achieve a 40  reduction in its expenses since 2015  You can  IBM s shares have gained  13 5  over the past three months against the S P 500 s rise of  8 1   The Zacks analyst believes that IBM s improving position in the hosted cloud  security and analytics aided revenue performance Moreover  RedHat acquisition has helped IBM to enhance containerized software capabilities  Robust adoption of security solutions  including Resilient and QRadar  bodes well  Growing clout of Watson Health and growth in Payer  Provider  Imaging and Life Sciences domains are noteworthy Further  gains from z15 and high demand for data privacy and resiliency solutions across hybrid cloud are positives  However  stiff competition in the cloud computing market and high debt level pose concerns  Also  IBM s time consuming business model transition to cloud is a headwind  You can  Other

173388,394904,IBM,IBM Now Has 100 Quantum Computing Customers,news,"It will likely be many years before quantum computing is widely used for real world applications  While traditional computers operate on bits which are either 0 or 1  a quantum computer s qubits exist as some combination of those two states  This opens up the possibility of doing certain types of calculations exponentially faster than a traditional computer  but it also introduces a wide array of challenges that must be overcome 
International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  is one of the tech companies leading the way on quantum computing  IBM now offers cloud based access to 15 quantum computers for clients to explore potential applications for the technology  including an industry leading 53 qubit system 
While quantum computing is a long way from being a meaningful revenue generating business for IBM  the company is growing its customer base  On Wednesday  IBM announced that over 100 organizations are now working with the company s quantum computers  These include major companies  research labs  and start ups 

A wide variety of potential applications
Recent additions include Anthem  Delta Air Lines  Goldman Sachs  Wells Fargo  and Woodside Energy  Notably  Delta is the first airline to join IBM s quantum computing initiative 
While it s unclear what quantum computing will ultimately be useful for when the technology matures  organizations are exploring many possible applications  Anthem is working on producing personalized treatment options and predicting health conditions  while Delta is exploring how the technology can be used to improve the customer experience and solve day of travel challenges 
Elsewhere  financial institutions are applying quantum computing to trading strategies and risk management  and industrial companies are working on fleet logistics and manufacturing optimization 
IBM s plan is to put its quantum computers out into the world and allow clients to explore the possibilities   IBM s focus  since we put the very first quantum computer on the cloud in 2016  has been to move quantum computing beyond isolated lab experiments conducted by a handful of organizations  into the hands of tens of thousands of users  We believe a clear advantage will be awarded to early adopters in the era of quantum computing and with partners like Delta  we re already making significant progress on that mission   said Dario Gil  director of IBM Research 
It s far too early to say anything about the commercial potential of IBM s quantum computing business  But the company is clearly making strides as it works to bring the technology mainstream 
Right now  earnings are all that matter
IBM s quantum computing efforts may eventually pay off  but for investors  the company s upcoming earnings report is the only thing that matters  IBM is scheduled to report its fourth quarter results after the market closes on Jan 21  Front and center will be the company s guidance for 2020  which will include the impacts of the acquisition of Red Hat and a recently launched mainframe 
While accounting rules will prevent IBM from recognizing all of Red Hat s revenue in the fourth quarter  that headwind will ease as 2020 plays out  Barring catastrophe  IBM should return to growth this year  although the jury is still out on whether that growth will be sustainable 
Quantum computing may someday be a big part of IBM s business  Today  the focus is on hybrid cloud computing  artificial intelligence  data analytics  and other growth areas  IBM will need to tell a compelling story and report decent numbers to impress investors later this month ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgeu4,2056815

Our latest available data shows that IBM has returned about 7 23  since the start of the calendar year  In comparison  Computer and Technology companies have returned an average of 2 97   This means that International Business Machines is performing better than its sector in terms of year to date returns 
Looking more specifically  IBM belongs to the Computer   Integrated Systems industry  a group that includes 8 individual stocks and currently sits at  114 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 4 20  so far this year  so IBM is performing better in this area

173401,394917,IBM,3 Extra Large Caps With Great Zacks Ranks,opinion,This earnings season is turning out much better than investors were fearing  Sure  earnings are down from last year  but that was to be expected after such a strong market performance in 2019  But most companies are beating expectations  According to Sheraz Mian s recent   approximately 70  of companies have outperformed on the top and bottom lines  You can thank the large caps for a lot of that success  Whether it s the big banks that kicked everything off a couple weeks ago or the tech names that are really flexing their muscles right now  this asset class is showing everyone how it s done We ve got a screen called  that finds companies with market caps over  25 billion that also are ranked Strong Buys or Buys  Below are three companies that passed the criteria for this screen and just reported solid quarterly results Bank of America  BAC  Earnings season has been pretty good so far  and it all got started with the big banks last month  Bank of America  BAC  was one of those behemoths that got us started on the right foot  On January 15  the company reported its sixth straight positive earnings surprise  Earnings per share of 74 cents for the fourth quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 8  and also improved 6  from last year  More specifically  BAC has beaten 14 times and matched once in the past 15 quarters  which means it hasn t missed since early 2016  It has also amassed an average surprise of 8 6  over the past four quarters Revenue of  22 3 billion was down a bit from last year  but did inch past our consensus of around  22 billion  The Banks   Major Regional space is in the Top 14   which is a nice position given the unusually low interest rate environment  BAC has certainty felt the pressure with several business segments showing lower net income generation from last year  However  the company enjoyed improved trading and investment banking numbers  as well as decent loan growth   Furthermore  BAC is also opening branches in new regions  improving its digital offerings  focusing more on consumer banking and controlling costs  Earnings estimates have been trending higher for months  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is  3 05  which is up 2  in three months and 1 3  in the past 30 days  Earnings are then expected to grow approximately 8  to  3 29 next year  That consensus has advance 3 8  in 90 days and 2 2  in 30  Shares of BAC are up 15  over the past year  which is pretty good for a stable name with a market cap just under  300 billion   Intel  INTC There are two things that Intel  INTC  knows how to do REALLY well  1  make chips and 2  beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate This company hasn t missed in years  Take a look at the Price  Consensus   EPS Surprise graph below  green arrows right off the page The latest beat included fourth quarter earnings per share of  1 52  which topped our consensus by more than 22  and brought the four quarter average up to 14 6  Earnings per share improved by more than 18  from last year as well But that s only part of what the CEO called   the best quarter in company history  INTC also reported revenues of  20 2 billion  which marks the first time it made more than  20 billion in a single quarter  The result beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 2  and improved nearly 9  from last year   One of the brightest spots in the quarter was the Data Center Group  which saw revenues jump 18 8  from last year to  7 21 billion  The upside was led by a strong mix of high performance second gen Xeon Scalable processors and solid demand for Cloud service providers  CSP  Furthermore  its PC group rose 2  when the market was expecting a decline Earnings estimates have improved nicely since the report  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is now  4 99 per share  or 5 7  better than 30 days ago The estimate for next year is up to  5 09 after rising 7 8  in that time  For the moment  analysts only expect a 2  improvement from the previous  but there s plenty of time for that to change especially if the CEO is right that 2020 will be another record year   Shares of INTC have gained approximately 46  over the past year  and its part of the highly ranked Semiconductor   General space  Top 16  of the Zacks Industry Rank  IBM  IBM Revenue growth of 0 1  doesn t seem like something to write home about  unless of course you ve reported five straight quarters of year over year declines Such was the case for IBM  IBM  in its fourth quarter report  which came out on January 21  Shares are up by more than 5  since then and nearly 14  in the past year Big Blue was one of the first big caps to report strong numbers and  therefore  help calm investor fears that this earnings season would be a disappointment So far  it hasn t been  especially for the large caps and technology  and IBM is both Revenues of nearly  21 8 billion inched higher year over year  but more easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 4  We can look to the clouds for the main reason why this long revenue growth slump came to an end  Total cloud revenues soared 21  to  6 8 billion Another noteworthy performer was Red Hat  which had revenues rally 24   IBM completed this acquisition in July as part of its efforts to boost the Open Hybrid Architecture Initiative  Red Hat is part of the Cloud and Cognitive Software segment Acquisitions are a big part of IBM s growth and that will continue moving forward  It has bought more than 150 companies since 2000   On the bottom line  IBM doesn t usually beat by a lot  but it does beat often  For the fourth quarter  earnings per share of  4 71 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 43   The average beat over the past four quarters is 1 8   which isn t bad for a company this size that s been around for over 100 years IBM has a record of positive earnings surprises that stretches back several years Looking forward  its growth will be driving by cloud computing  of course   but also analytics and security  IBM expects 2020 non GAAP earnings per share of  13 35  which caused expectations to move up recently The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is now  13 33 per share  which has advanced 1  from two months ago  Next year s outlook has risen by the same amount to  14 16  which suggests year over year growth of more than 6  Just released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys  They deem these tickers  Most Likely for Early Price Pops   Since 1988  the full list has

information technology infrastructure  customer service  warehousing and logistics services as well as digital marketing  The reason that BZUN has fallen into the cellar of the Zacks Rank is that analyst earnings estimates have dropped significantly I last wrote about Baozun as the Bear of the Day in early December when shares were still trading above  35  Here s what I noted about this steady earnings decliner   Fast forward to today and BZUN has once again been spending lots of time as a Zacks  5 Rank  even before the company reported earnings on November 21  On that event  shares gapped down from  44 to  36 and subsequently the 2019 EPS estimate has collapsed further from  1 30 to  1 00 The results are confirming what we ve seen across the board in Chinese technology stocks as the largest consumer class in the world struggles with a slowing economy and trade disputes  end of December 6 report excerpt No doubt the coronavirus epidemic is impacting forward views of the outlook as well Since that report  2019 s EPS tally has fallen 10  to  0 90 and we should hear confirmation of this in their Q4 report by early March  Meanwhile  full year 2020 estimates dropped from  1 60 to  1

season is turning out much better than investors were fearing  Sure  earnings are down from last year  but that was to be expected after such a strong market performance in 2019  But most companies are beating expectations  According to Sheraz Mian s recent   approximately 70  of companies have outperformed on the top and bottom lines  You can thank the large caps for a lot of that success  Whether it s the big banks that kicked everything off a couple weeks ago or the tech names that are really flexing their muscles right now  this asset class is showing everyone how it s done We ve got a screen called  that finds companies with market caps over  25 billion that also are ranked Strong Buys or Buys  Below are three companies that passed the criteria for this screen and just reported solid quarterly results Bank of AmericaEarnings season has been pretty good so far  and it all got started with the big banks last month  Bank of America was one of those behemoths that got us started on the right foot  On January 15  the company reported its sixth straight positive earnings surprise  Earnings per share of 74 cents for the fourth quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 8  and also improved 6  from last year  More specifically  BAC has beaten 14 times and matched once in the past 15 quarters  which means it hasn t missed since early 2016  It has also amassed an average surprise of 8 6  over the past four quarters Revenue of  22 3 billion was down a bit from last year  but did inch past our consensus of around  22 billion  The Banks   Major Regional space is in the Top 14   which is a nice position given the unusually low interest rate environment  BAC has certainty felt the pressure with several business segments showing lower net income generation from last year  However  the company enjoyed improved trading and investment banking numbers  as well as decent loan growth   Furthermore  BAC is also opening branches in new regions  improving its digital offerings  focusing more on consumer banking and controlling costs  Earnings estimates have been trending higher for months  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is  3 05  which is up 2  in three months and 1 3  in the past 30 days  Earnings are then expected to grow approximately 8  to  3 29 next year  That consensus has advance 3 8  in 90 days and 2 2  in 30  Shares of BAC are up 15  over the past year  which is pretty good for a stable name with a market cap just under  300 billion   IntelThere are two things that Intel knows how to do REALLY well  1  make chips and 2  beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate This company hasn t missed in years  Take a look at the Price  Consensus   EPS Surprise graph below  green arrows right off the page The latest beat included fourth quarter earnings per share of  1 52  which topped our consensus by more than 22  and brought the four quarter average up to 14 6  Earnings per share improved by more than 18  from last year as well But that s only part of what the CEO called   the best quarter in company history  INTC also reported revenues of  20 2 billion  which marks the first time it made more than  20 billion in a single quarter  The result beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 2  and improved nearly 9  from last year   One of the brightest spots in the quarter was the Data Center Group  which saw revenues jump 18 8  from last year to  7 21 billion  The upside was led by a strong mix of high performance second gen Xeon Scalable processors and solid demand for Cloud service providers  CSP  Furthermore  its PC group rose 2  when the market was expecting a decline Earnings estimates have improved nicely since the report  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is now  4 99 per share  or 5 7  better than 30 days ago The estimate for next year is up to  5 09 after rising 7 8  in that time  For the moment  analysts only expect a 2  improvement from the previous  but there s plenty of time for that to change especially if the CEO is right that 2020 will be another record year   Shares of INTC have gained approximately 46  over the past year  and its part of the highly ranked Semiconductor   General space  Top 16  of the Zacks Industry Rank  IBMRevenue growth of 0 1  doesn t seem like something to write home about  unless of course you ve reported five straight quarters of year over year declines Such was the case for IBM in its fourth quarter report  which came out on January 21  Shares are up by more than 5  since then and nearly 14  in the past year Big Blue was one of the first big caps to report strong numbers and  therefore  help calm investor fears that this earnings season would be a disappointment So far  it hasn t been  especially for the large caps and technology  and IBM is both Revenues of nearly  21 8 billion inched higher year over year  but more easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 4  We can look to the clouds for the main reason why this long revenue growth slump came to an end  Total cloud revenues soared 21  to  6 8 billion Another noteworthy performer was Red Hat  which had revenues rally 24   IBM completed this acquisition in July as part of its efforts to boost the Open Hybrid Architecture Initiative  Red Hat is part of the Cloud and Cognitive Software segment Acquisitions are a big part of IBM s growth and that will continue moving forward  It has bought more than 150 companies since 2000   On the bottom line  IBM doesn t usually beat by a lot  but it does beat often  For the fourth quarter  earnings per share of  4 71 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 43   The average beat over the past four quarters is 1 8   which isn t bad for a company this size that s been around for over 100 years IBM has a record of positive earnings surprises that stretches back several years Looking forward  its growth will be driving by cloud computing  of course   but also analytics and security  IBM expects 2020 non GAAP earnings per share of  13 35  which caused expectations to move up recently The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is now  13 33 per share  which has advanced 1  from two months ago  Next year s outlook has risen by the same amount to  14 16  which suggests year over year growth of more than 6  Just released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys  They deem these tickers  Most

173415,394931,IBM,Is IBM  IBM  A Great Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use tried and true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
One company to watch right now is IBM  IBM   IBM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value 
Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  IBM has a P S ratio of 1 64  This compares to its industry s average P S of 2 09 
Finally  our model also underscores that IBM has a P CF ratio of 9 71  This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook  IBM s current P CF looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P CF of 10 42  Over the past year  IBM s P CF has been as high as 9 82 and as low as 8 40  with a median of 9 19 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in IBM s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that IBM is an impressive value stock right now ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-ibm-ibm-a-great-value-stock-right-now-200501526,200501526
173416,394932,IBM,Retirees Should Know These 3 Facts About Required Minimum Distributions   January 30  2020,opinion,"If you do not make a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the specified deadline  the IRS could hit you with a big penalty   50   For example  if you were required to withdraw a minimum of  4 000 and you did not  you would be obliged to pay  2 000  Plus  beginning January 1  2020  the rules concerning RMDs were updated 
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose IBM  IBM   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Preparing for the distribution stage is where you may settle on choices about where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll wish to travel  interests you may seek after  and different choices that will influence your retirement spending 
Along with these aspects  it is important to consider the RMD that applies to most retirement accounts  Essentially  the IRS requires you to withdraw a specific sum from your qualified retirement accounts once you attain a certain age  That age used to be 70 1 2 but it is now 72 
Why does the IRS require you to start taking your money out  It s simple   they want to make sure they get their tax  If this rule didn t exist  people could live off other income and never pay tax on their retirement investment gains  Then  that money could be left to family or friends as an inheritance without the IRS collecting any taxes from you 
The Most Important Things to Know About RMDs
What types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When does it become necessary to begin taking distributions  Your first distribution must be taken by April 1 of the year following the calendar year that you turn 72  for most accounts   Also  if you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year after the calendar year in which you retire 
For each year after your required starting date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you don t need to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you covered taxes before contributing  Other varieties of Roth accounts require RMDs  But  there are approaches to avoid them   for instance  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What will happen if I neglect to take my RMD  If you don t take an RMD  or don t take a large enough distribution  you are liable for a 50  tax on the amount that was not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Example  Ann is 71 and must take her first RMD in the year following the year she reaches age 72  Her year end IRA balance the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  The result of dividing  100 000 by 27 4 is  3 649 63   the amount that Ann must withdraw for her first RMD

173418,394934,IBM,Improve Your Retirement Income With These 3 Top Ranked Dividend Stocks   January 30  2020,opinion,"Here s an eye opening statistic  older Americans are more afraid of running out of money than of death itself 
And older Americans have legitimate reasons for this worry  even if they have dutifully saved for their golden years  That s because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses   and with people generally living longer  the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period 
Retirement investing approaches of the past don t work today 
For many years  bonds or other fixed income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs  However  these yields have dwindled over time  10 year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6 50   but today  that rate is a thing of the past  with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future 
The impact of this rate decline is sizeable  over 20 years  the difference in yield for a  1 million investment in 10 year Treasuries is more than  1 million 
In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields  today s retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits  Because of certain demographic factors  it s been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035 
Unfortunately  it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income   bonds and Social Security   may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees  But what if there was another option that could provide a steady  reliable source of income in retirement 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
Dividend paying stocks from low risk  high quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace current low risk  low yielding Treasury and bond options 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
One way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3   and positive average annual dividend growth  Many stocks increase dividends over time  helping to offset the effects of inflation 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Bridge Bancorp  BDGE  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 24 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 06   This compares to the Banks   Northeast industry s yield of 1 76  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 77   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 96 is flat compared to last year 
IBM  IBM  is paying out a dividend of 1 62 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 4 71  compared to the Computer   Integrated Systems industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  6 48 is up 3 18  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 31 per share  Invesco  IVZ  has a dividend yield of 7 03   This is compared to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 22  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 24 is up 3 33  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
Overall  that is true  But stocks are a broad class  and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high quality dividend stocks that can generate regular  predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market 
An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio  they can help lessen the effects of inflation  since many dividend paying companies  especially blue chip stocks  generally increase their dividends over time 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks  you can still pursue a dividend income strategy  However  it s important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF  which can ultimately reduce your dividend income  working against your strategy  Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest 
Bottom Line
Whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  seeking the steady income of dividend paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress free retirement

173445,394961,IBM,Will IBM  IBM  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering IBM  IBM   which belongs to the Zacks Computer   Integrated Systems industry 
This technology and consulting company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 55  
For the last reported quarter  IBM came out with earnings of  2 68 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 64 per share  representing a surprise of 1 52   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  3 06 per share and it actually produced earnings of  3 17 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 59  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for IBM lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
IBM has an Earnings ESP of  0 19  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 21  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-ibm-ibm-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200500086,200500086

173520,395036,IBM,Rainstorms Over Bahamas Watched as Possible U S  Threat,news," Bloomberg     Within 5 days  a patch of clouds and showers over the Bahamas could become a dangerous tropical system in the Gulf of Mexico  Or it could mean a rainy  gusty day in Florida  The odds are about even 
Welcome to the game of atmospheric chess watched by the world s weather forecasters  The U S  National Hurricane Center on Wednesday gave the rainstorms a 60  chance of changing from a blob on the map to an actual weather system in the next five days  up from 50  earlier 
The showers and clouds are now being held back by wind shear created by an upper level low pressure system to its west  said Jeff Masters  co founder of Weather Underground  an  IBM   NYSE IBM  business  in Ann Arbor  Michigan  That s left it a  big sloppy mess   he said 
If the low pressure system pulls away  and organizes into a tropical storm  it will be called Humberto  the eighth storm named across the Atlantic in a season that s been slightly more active than the average 
Meanwhile  some forecast models keep the system and the low pressure tied together indefinitely  limiting any movement  said Dan Kottlowski  lead hurricane forecaster at AccuWeather Inc  in State College  Pennsylvania 
 I like the idea of a 50 50 chance   Kottlowski said by telephone   If one is not starting to develop by Friday  then I think all bets are off  
The U S  has been hit by two hurricanes this year  Barry in July  and the just exited Dorian that clawed a path of destruction from the Bahamas  to the U S  East Coast and then deep into Canada  The Bahamas are still grappling to recover from Dorian  which stalled over the island nation as a Category 5 hurricane with 180 mph winds that left scores dead and devastated Abaco and Grand Bahama islands 
If the blob over the Bahamas does develop  it s hard to say just how strong it might become  Kottlowski said  The Gulf waters are quite warm  and last year  Micheal was able to grow from a potential storm on a Saturday to a major hurricane by Tuesday  Anyone making a guess as to the possible strength now  is very delusional   Kottlowski said

173524,395040,IBM,Reserve Bank of India to pick up slack as India stimulus measures to fall short   Reuters poll,news,"By Indradip Ghosh
BENGALURU  Reuters    Recent stimulus measures announced by the Indian government will be insufficient to boost economic growth significantly  said a majority of economists in a Reuters poll who predicted two more interest rate cuts this year  in October and December 
To revive the ailing economy  the government in September announced a steep cut in the corporate tax rate   to 22  from 30    triggering the biggest intraday gain in Indian stocks in more than a decade 
That along with other measures  including a rollback of a higher surcharge on foreign portfolio investment   introduced in the budget in July   led international investors to become net buyers of Indian assets in September 
But nearly 60  of around 50 economists who answered an additional question said those stimulus measures were unlikely to have a notable impact on the economy 
 While the cut in corporate taxes is sharp  its actual impact on growth is uncertain  Given that the current problem is of weak demand  a demand augmenting measure would have been more productive   said Rini Sen  India economist at ANZ 
Although the economy is expected to have recovered last quarter from the sharp slowdown in the three months prior  economists downgraded their growth outlook for this fiscal year and next from three months ago 
The Sept  24 30 poll of over 50 economists predicted gross domestic product growth to average 6 1  this fiscal year  the lowest since polling began for the period in April last year 
If realized  that would mark the slowest pace of growth in seven years 
The economy was then expected to expand 6 8  next fiscal year  a downgrade from 7 2  predicted in the July poll 
That weak outlook was driven by lack of clarity on when and how the U S  China trade war will end  which has already hurt business sentiment  manufacturing activity and the global economy 
But some economists argued recent measures announced by the Indian government  along with monetary policy easing  would likely boost Asia s third largest economy 
The Reserve Bank of India has already eased policy by a cumulative 110 basis points this year 
It is now expected to cut its repo rate  by 25 basis points on Friday  making it the fifth meeting in a row of easing  and is then predicted to follow that up by with another 15 basis points slice in December  taking the key rate to 5 0  
But the RBI is then forecast to keep rates unchanged until 2021 at least 
 It looks like the authorities   both the government and the central bank   are firing up all cylinders to provide stimulus to the economy   with stimulus announced so far should start to revive growth going forward   said Prakash Sakpal  Asia economist at ING 
When asked how many more rate cuts it would take to boost growth significantly  nearly 45  of economists said cumulative rate cuts up to 50 basis points will be needed 
Eleven said between 50 and 100 basis points would do the trick  while two said over a percentage point 
The outlook for further policy easing was also backed by subdued inflation  which is not expected to breach the central bank s medium term target of 4  until the fourth quarter of 2020 
 With inflation remaining under control  monetary stimulus in combination with the recent fiscal measures are likely to be growth supportive   said Shashank Mendiratta  economist at  IBM   NYSE IBM  
But not everyone agreed with that view 
Nearly 30  of respondents said boosting economic growth significantly is beyond the RBI s immediate control 
 Not only monetary policy but also short term measures that the government has taken so far  are used to sugar coat the wrong policy trajectory from a structural point of view   said Hugo Erken  head of international economics at Rabobank 
 Because what India really needs is a large scale reform package on several fronts  
A weak growth outlook  ongoing concerns about the U S  China trade war and the prospect of further RBI easing are all expected to hurt the Indian rupee  in coming months 
After rallying as much as 3  against the dollar in September  the rupee is forecast to reverse most of those gains to trade at 72 50 per dollar in a year  compared to 70 70 on Monday 
 Despite the fact that both monetary and fiscal levers are now being deployed to prop up growth  a material recovery is still elusive   added ANZ s Sen 
 We therefore see limited scope for the current  rupee  rally to last unless demand sharply recovers  In addition  global risks including worsening in trade uncertainties or an oil price surge could add to rupee volatility

173525,395041,IBM,Hurricane Lorenzo Hits Record Size  Aims at Ireland as Wind Ebbs,news," Bloomberg     For the third time in three years Europe is bracing for a storm driven October as warm Atlantic waters fuel a record setting hurricane that s headed toward Ireland and Scotland 
Lorenzo on Saturday became the strongest storm to form in the eastern Atlantic  with winds of 160 miles  257 kilometers  per hour  That made it a Category 5 hurricane  the most powerful level surveyed by forecasters  Since then  the winds have fallen to a mere 100 mph  a Category 2 storm that s now nearing the Azores 
But as Lorenzo has lost power  it has swelled in size  Tropical storm strength winds reach 345 miles from its center  and 12 foot waves extend out 900 miles  There s a 50  or higher chance those high winds  accompanied by driving rains  will at least graze Ireland and Scotland  the U S  National Hurricane Center said 
 This thing is huge   said Jeff Masters  co founder of Weather Underground  an  IBM   NYSE IBM  business   That is a massive wind field and a massive wave field  It is going to cause impacts  
Winds of at least 74 mph reach out 90 miles in all directions from Lorenzo s center  said Phil Klotzbach  lead author of the Colorado State University seasonal storm forecast  Based on that metric  it is the largest hurricane ever recorded in the eastern Atlantic  Klotzbach said 
Swells from Lorenzo have spread across the North Atlantic bringing rough surf and rip currents to the U S  East Coast and Canada as well as Europe and the Caribbean islands  the National Hurricane Center said 
So far this year  the Atlantic has produced 12 storms  the number usually seen in an average season  Two of those storms reached Category 5 strength    Hurricane Dorian last month  and now Lorenzo  Forecasters are watching two more disturbances near the Caribbean that could become storms  The six month hurricane season is in its most active phase  and officially ends on Nov  30 
A warmer Atlantic has fueled the recent spate of storms that have made runs at Europe  allowing them to hold onto their tropical structure and power as they neared a continent not historically known for its hurricane strikes 
In 2017  Hurricane Ophelia became a post tropical storm as it came ashore near Valentia Island in County Kerry Ireland  killing three people  causing power outages  ripping off roofs and toppling trees  Last year  Hurricane Leslie nearly made it to Portugal before becoming a hybrid storm and flooding France with heavy rains 
The Atlantic s waters are warmer due to a nasty combination of factors  The ocean undergoes a natural temperature variability over time that forecasters call the Atlantic Multi decadal Oscillation  At the same time  the effects of global warming are kicking in  said Dan Kottlowski  a hurricane forecaster at AccuWeather Inc  in State College  Pennsylvania 
 Developing Monsters 
 Thirty years ago there is no way that most of these storms would have come as strong   Kottlowski said by telephone   The longer the Atlantic stays warm  the more we will see these monsters developing  
A similar thing is happening in the Pacific  according to the Weather Underground s Masters  Hawaii  which for years saw few hurricanes  has been hit  grazed or narrowly missed by an increasing number of storms  In both cases  ocean heat deserves much of the blame  he said 
 This is to be expected if you are going to heat the oceans up   Masters said   An extra degree of warming makes all the difference when you are near 80 degrees Fahrenheit  which is the cut off  ",2019-10-01,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/general/hurricane-lorenzo-hits-record-size-aims-at-ireland-as-wind-ebbs-1990375,1990375

173599,395115,IBM,India s inflation likely edged up to nine month high in July  Reuters poll,news,"By Indradip Ghosh
BENGALURU  Reuters    India s retail inflation rose for the sixth straight month in July   the longest stretch of monthly increases since January 2016   to a nine month high  largely due to a continued rise in food prices  a Reuters poll predicted 
Despite rising  inflation is expected to remain below the Reserve Bank of India s medium term target of 4   clearing the way for more policy easing 
The July 31 Aug  6 poll of 30 economists showed retail inflation rose to 3 20  in July from a year ago  a touch above June s 3 18  
The expected rise in inflation was mainly based on an increase in food prices and fuel costs   the biggest components of the consumer price index  Food prices have risen due to lower than expected monsoon rains over the past two months 
 Vegetable prices increased last month  Retail prices of petrol and diesel also went up as a result of higher taxes  These factors drove inflation up   said Sameer Narang  chief economist at Bank of Baroda 
However  rains in coming weeks are likely to make up for a shortfall in the first two months of the season that began in June  according to India s state run weather office  raising expectations of food prices remaining subdued over the near term 
Core inflation  which excludes volatile components like food and energy  has been on a downward trajectory since February  suggesting a lack of demand and weak economic activity 
That supports the case for further monetary policy easing  The RBI was expected to cut its repo rate for the fourth consecutive time later on Wednesday 
 We are not expecting inflation to pick up over the coming months because of subdued demand in the economy   said Shashank Mendiratta  economist at  IBM   NYSE IBM  
 We also expect inflation to remain below the RBI s inflation target  That would mean at least two more rate cuts after the forthcoming meeting

Earnings Hits and MissesAnalysts agree  earning estimates are too high  and it s time to start doing something about it  They always underestimate  so there s usually a  pop    Estimates for last week declined  just as they did in late 2018  and earlier this year  It was not a pleasant fourth quarter last year  and weak estimates are primarily what precipitated the decline  That doesn t mean earnings are headed into negative territory  but they are declining  or rather  not growing as fast as they did 
Despite the fact that 81  reporting companies beat their estimates  I question most analysts  estimates for this reason   those that miss  like  IBM   NYSE IBM   get crushed  While the Federal Reserve s position on interest rates has become more favorable  rates often decline before underlying economic conditions decline  at least that s the way it s supposed to happen  It s only a matter of time before the markets react if growth becomes selective  We ve all seen it before  it s called a TOP 
A Word On Trade and Volatility
With respect to volatility  despite the market s gains yesterday  increases in the daily range did not follow suit  What is somewhat reassuring to the bulls is that the test came on the upside over 3000 and not below 2993  an area of support that has become critical  see charts above   The usual macroeconomic uncertainties remain intact  with nothing out of the ordinary expected  Tariffs reduce the amount of money in circulation 
Global trade decreases when entities like China and the United States do battle  exhibited by the lackluster results out of South Korea  It s time to create assurances that the battles have been fought  and so far no one has won the trade war

173651,395167,IBM,Chart Of The Day  IBM Miss May Be Opening Shot Of A Medium Term Downtrend,opinion,"International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  shares were sold off after its 3Q revenues came short of expectations  even after the tech giant s acquisition of open source company Red Hat  which was supposed to boost growth 
Despite 20  growth for Red Hat in the quarter  IBM revenue declined 3 9   even though it beat on earnings  Perhaps  this occurred because this is the fifth straight quarter of revenue decline  amid a global slowdown  
The stock s price is the same as it was two years ago  before these missed revenues  While that might suggest that investors are willing to look past slowing growth within a complex global environment  a longer view reveals signs of overall weakness 

While the current price is flat when compared to two years ago  in December  the price plunged 25   That selloff formed another trough  reinforcing the downtrend since the March  2013 top at  216  over 70  higher 
IBM has been fluctuating for the past five weeks  ultimately has made no headway in either direction   as it struggles to break free of its entrapment between the 200 and 100 DMAs  The levels of fluctuation just happen to be at the same levels as those of the April highs 
If the price declines from here  it will have formed the right shoulder   at the same height as the left shoulder   of a H S top  with the neckline connecting the May and August lows of the left shoulder and head  at  132 
As we often point out  the placement of a pattern is crucial to its interpretation  This H S top is below the 200 DMA and the long term downtrend line since March 2013  helping to explain why investors might want to stay away from the stock at these levels  at this time 
Note  the volume has been drying out  even amid the post Christmas Eve rally 
A downside breakout of the H S pattern would imply a lower trough  extending the long term downtrend  and boosting the U S  slowdown story 
Trading Strategies   Bear Position Setup
Conservative traders should wait for a downside breakout  employing a minimum of a 3  and 3 day  preferably including a weekend  filter  to avoid a bear trap  Then  they d wait for a return move  which would demonstrate resistance 
Moderate traders may wait for the pattern completion  with just a 2  penetration and a 2 day filter  Then  they may wait for a pullback for a better entry but not necessarily for trend confirmation 
Aggressive traders may short now  relying on the pattern s momentum  the low volume  the 200 DMA and the proximity of the long term downtrend line  after the December trough re established the long term downtrend 
Trade Sample   Short Position Setup
Entry   142
Stop Loss   145  above the October high
Risk   3
Target   133
Reward   9
Risk Reward Ratio  1 3

173663,395179,IBM,U S  billionaire Ross Perot  who shook up presidential politics in the 1990s  dead at 89,news,"By Bill Trott  Reuters    H  Ross Perot  the feisty Texas technology billionaire who rattled U S  politics with two independent presidential campaigns in the 1990s that struck a chord with disgruntled voters  died on Tuesday at the age of 89  his family said   Ross Perot  the ground breaking businessman and loving husband  brother  father and grandfather  passed away early Tuesday at his home in Dallas  surrounded by his devoted family   the Perot family said in a statement  A family spokesman said leukemia was the cause of death  Perot s fortune was estimated at  4 1 billion by Forbes magazine in April 2019  Perot was a natural salesman who made a fortune in computer services but he was an unlikely and unconventional politician  He was short with buzz top haircut  spoke with a folksy Texas drawl and had protruding ears that even he joked about  He was blunt and assertive and his success in business made him accustomed to getting his way  Perot was so gung ho that when two of his employees were jailed in Iran in 1978  he organized a team of commandos from his employees and hired a former Green Beret colonel to break them out  Perot leaped into the 1992 presidential race as an independent and quickly found a lode of Americans turned off by the Republican and Democratic parties  His overarching issue was curbing the government s deficit spending   an issue he referred to as the  crazy aunt in the basement  who no one wanted to talk about  His outsider campaign  much of it financed by his own money  featured 30 minute television  infomercials   With his charts  self deprecating humor and down home economic remedies  Perot led a Gallup Poll five months before the election with 39 percent  compared to 31 percent for incumbent Republican George H W  Bush and 25 percent for Democrat Bill Clinton  SURPRISE WITHDRAWAL A month later  however  Perot stunned the political world by withdrawing from the race  He re entered several weeks later saying he had dropped out because Republican tricksters had been plotting to disrupt his daughter s wedding  Perot finished with a respectable 19 percent of the vote in the presidential election  trailing Clinton s 43 percent and Bush s 37 5 percent  Perot stayed active in politics by speaking out against the North American Free Trade Agreement  saying it would create a  giant sucking sound  of American jobs going to Mexico  For his 1996 White House run  Perot started the Reform Party but captured little more than 8 percent of the popular vote  as well as causing a rift in the political movement he founded  Many voters said they had come to perceive Perot as overbearing  volatile  paranoid and egotistical   even if they had liked his ideas  By 2000  Perot had mostly faded from the national political radar  Henry Ross Perot was born on June 27  1930  in Texarkana  Texas  and raised in the height of the Depression  He graduated in 1953 from the U S  Naval Academy  where he first learned about computers  After his naval service  Perot joined  IBM   NYSE IBM  as a computer salesman in 1957 and quickly made a reputation for himself  In 1962 he met his yearly sales quota by Jan  19  Disenchanted that his bosses did not like his ideas  Perot started his own company  Electronic Data Systems Inc in Dallas  a move that would make him a billionaire by age 38 by handling data processing for customers such as the Medicare system  NASA and other government entities  SELLS COMPANY TO GM When General Motors  NYSE GM  bought controlling interest in EDS in 1984  Perot became the largest single shareholder of the world s largest corporation  But he quickly clashed with top GM officials and two years later was paid  900 million to quit the GM board and relinquish control of EDS  In 1988 Perot started another data company  Perot Systems Corp  He took time off from the company for his political forays but when he returned to it in 1998 he saw the company s profits nearly quadruple and long term debt slashed by about half  He turned the company over to son Ross Jr  and Dell bought it in 2009 for  3 9 billion  Perot said he liked to hire military veterans  especially those with combat experience  because of their leadership ability and ability to deal with pressure  American prisoners of war and those listed as missing in action in the Vietnam War became a key issue for Perot and he made several trips to Vietnam on their behalf  At the Perot Systems headquarters he kept mementoes  including his childhood bicycle and a walking stick believed to have belonged to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden   One section of the building was dedicated to the rescue of two EDS workers imprisoned in Tehran on suspicion of bribery before the shah of Iran was overthrown in 1978  According to the non fiction book  On Wings of Eagles  by Ken Follett  an Iranian EDS employee helped lead a revolutionary mob s attack on the prison  allowing the EDS employees to escape  They were then sneaked out of the country  along with other EDS employees  In 1984 Perot s foundation purchased a copy of the Magna Carta dating to 1297 for  1 5 million  It was sold in 2007 for  21 3 million  
Perot s survivors include his wife  Margot  who he married in 1956  They had five children   Writing and reporting by Bill Trott  Editing by Howard Goller and Jonathan Oatis ",2019-07-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-billionaire-ross-perot-who-shook-up-presidential-politics-in-the-1990s-dead-at-89-1918640,1918640

173667,395183,IBM,IBM  IBM  Surpasses Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"IBM  IBM  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 68 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 64 per share  This compares to earnings of  3 42 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 52   A quarter ago  it was expected that this technology and consulting company would post earnings of  3 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 17  delivering a surprise of 3 59

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
IBM shares have added about 25 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 5  
What s Next for IBM 
While IBM has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

173668,395184,IBM,Tropical Storm Barry Aims at Louisiana  Curbing Oil Output,news," Bloomberg     Tropical Storm Barry is rumbling toward Louisiana and could hit the coastline as a hurricane by Saturday  causing close to  1 billion in damage and worsening flooding in New Orleans 
The system  which was about 95 miles  153 kilometers  southwest of the Mississippi River s mouth as of 5 a m  New York time  has already curbed about half the energy output in the Gulf of Mexico and helped lift oil prices to a seven week high  It s also prompted Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards to declare a state of emergency  while hurricane and tropical storm warnings and watches are in place along the state s coastline 
 It is a heck of a water event once again   said Bob Henson  a meteorologist with Weather Underground  an  IBM   NYSE IBM  company   We keep hammering that water is a big threat and here we are again  Barry may or may not become a hurricane  but it will be a rain event and there could be surge problems  
The storm    with current top winds of 50 miles an hour    may drop as much as 25 inches of rain in some places  according to an advisory from the U S  National Hurricane Center  It is expected to move northwest later Friday and could become a hurricane tonight or early Saturday  when its center approaches the coast of Louisiana 
Ship traffic was disrupted in the Mississippi River  where water levels are rising  Companies have cut 53  of oil and 45  of natural gas output in the Gulf  Tropical storm force winds are reaching as far as 175 miles east of Barry s center  according to the NHC s advisory 
While New Orleans    where an emergency was declared Wednesday    won t have a mandatory evacuation  residents should be prepared to shelter in place because the slow moving storm could bring heavy rain for 48 hours  Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a press conference  The Mississippi is now forecast to crest at 19 feet  according to the National Weather Service  That should keep the river below the tops of levees in the city  according to Cantrell

Louisiana is already under pressure from floods after the months of rain that have set records across the U S  and prevented farm fields from being planted  The Mississippi River in the state has been at flood stage since January and  for the first time since the Bonnet Carre spillway was completed in 1937  the Army Corps of Engineers has had to open it twice in the same year to help prevent flooding in New Orleans and take pressure off levees

U S  benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude traded above  60 a barrel on Friday  while natural gas futures reached the highest level in almost six weeks on Wednesday 
Gulf of Mexico operators have shut in 1 01 million barrels a day of oil production because of the storm  the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said in a notice  Almost 1 24 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas production is also closed 
The Gulf offshore region accounts for 16  of U S  crude oil output and less than 3  of dry natural gas  according to the Energy Information Administration  More than 45  of U S  refining capacity and 51  of gas processing is along the Gulf coast 
While the offshore platforms could return to normal operations in a few days  there is a chance widespread flooding could close some refineries and make it difficult for ships to make deliveries across the region  Jim Rouiller  chief meteorologist at the Energy Weather Group near Philadelphia  said by telephone 
 The first impact is to the rigs and platforms  then the second risk shows up on Friday and Saturday to the refinery areas   Rouiller said   The thing that is going to be really worrisome is the amount of flooding rains across Louisiana  I think the worst is yet to come  
Based on its current track  the storm will likely cause about  800 million to  900 million in damage  said Chuck Watson  a disaster modeler with Enki Research in Savannah  Georgia  That could balloon to  3 2 billion if floods overwhelm New Orleans  he said 
A spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers doesn t believe levees will be topped by flood waters  The barriers on the lower Mississippi have been inspected daily since November when flooding became an issue 
Shipping is grinding to a halt along the southern reaches of the Mississippi River as deteriorating weather conditions make it unsafe for river pilots to board and steer cargo ships  The heavy rains could hurt cotton crops in southern portions of the Mississippi Delta  said Don Keeney  a meteorologist with Maxar in Gaithersburg  Maryland  Kyle McCann  assistant to the president of the Louisiana Farm Bureau  said there hasn t been any damage to crops in the state yet  but expects a substantial impact in coming days 
Thunderstorms have already flooded New Orleans streets and the National Weather Service has issued a flash flood watch from southern Louisiana to the Florida panhandle  City pumps had trouble keeping up with the water  which is a  bad sign   said Enki Research s Watson

173678,395194,IBM,Explainer  Initial exchange offerings flourish in crypto market,news,"By Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss NEW YORK  Reuters    Initial exchange offerings  IEOs  are currently the most popular fundraising trend in the cryptocurrency industry  which has seen poster child bitcoin surge more than 150  in 2019  As the name suggests  initial exchange offerings are conducted over crypto trading platforms and exchanges   Binance was the first major cryptocurrency exchange to join the IEO wave  with the introduction of Binance Launchpad this year  A handful of IEOs has been done before but in much smaller exchanges   In January  the Binance platform conducted the sale of the BitTorrent  BTT  token  or digital currency  raising  7 million in just the first 14 minutes of sale opening  San Francisco based BitTorrent is a software company specializing in peer to peer file sharing  BACKGROUND ON CRYPTOCURRENCIES Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency created in 2008  It is a form of electronic currency  independent of traditional banks  that allows users to send money directly from one computer to another even on another side of the world  Bitcoin s popularity fueled the creation of more than 2 000 cryptocurrencies and spurred the launch of an entire global industry on blockchain  a distributed ledger technology that drives it  Cryptocurrencies are also traded on digital currency exchanges  which are all online  many of them available on mobile phone applications  People buy cryptocurrencies from these exchanges by just signing up from their websites  Bitcoin on Thursday traded at  9 400 on the BitStamp exchange  People buy cryptocurrencies primarily for speculation because they have gone up in price so much in the last three years  Some like developers buy specific currencies to gain access to certain networks that are relevant to them  Since 2008  the biggest financial names have entered the cryptocurrency space  from  IBM   NYSE IBM  to Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   and most recently Facebook  NASDAQ FB   which launched the blueprint for its own cryptocurrency on Tuesday   But cryptocurrencies are risky  Because they are virtual currencies  they can be hacked or disappear forever if you lose the keys to the online wallets used to store them  And with no clear regulatory body overseeing the digital currency industry  funds would be difficult to recover once you lose them  WHAT S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN IEO AND ICO   IEOs are a byproduct of initial coin offerings  ICOs   which took off in 2016  ICOs are also a way to raise capital  bypassing banks and venture capital firms  But IEOs take place on cryptocurrency exchanges which  for a fee  effectively act as middlemen  performing functions such as due diligence on a project   know your customer  screening  marketing and selling tokens to customers  ICOs  on the other hand  are undertaken by start ups themselves  shouldering the token offering costs and selling these currencies on their websites  They have raised nearly  29 billion for cryptocurrency companies since 2016  but slowed sharply this year amid a regulatory crackdown on fraudulent and illegal offerings led by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  The limit on the amount of tokens that can be bought at IEOs   usually capped at  20 000   has enhanced the attractiveness of these offerings to retail investors and has prevented bigger investors from monopolizing them   Investors that want to participate in IEOs just go to the exchange s website   An IEO is like Goldman Sachs crashing into Nasdaq   said Steven Nerayoff  chief executive officer of consulting and investment firm Alchemist  suggesting that exchanges like Nasdaq have taken on investment banking functions  such as vetting IEOs and marketing them to customers   It s a new breed of fundraising that could potentially change what s happening in finance     but regulations have to be figured out    HOW MUCH HAVE IEOS RAISED SO FAR  Start ups doing IEOs  however  are raising millions of dollars quickly  sometimes within seconds  reminiscent of a trend seen at the peak of ICOs in early 2017   For instance  Veriblock  a blockchain project leveraging bitcoin s network  raised  7 million in April through an IEO on the Bittrex exchange in 10 seconds  Blockhain  which underpins bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies  is a digital database with information that can be publicly shared within a large decentralized network   IEOs have raised  1 5 billion so far this year  according to cryptocurrency tracker CoinSchedule  compared with just  836 million raised from ICOs since January  Crypto exchange operators interviewed by Reuters said hundreds of start ups are lining up to do IEOs  more than they could possibly handle   For a graphic on  Initial exchange offerings are all the rage  click   U S  file sharing firm BitTorrent  which conducted an IEO on Binance Launchpad  officially kicked IEOs into high gear at Binance  the world s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume   IEOs are helpful for projects like us because we don t have the time to do compliance   said Justin Sun  founder and chief executive officer of TRON  a blockchain based company focused on building a decentralized internet  TRON purchased BitTorrent for  120 million in 2018   WHAT DO IEOS MEAN FOR EXCHANGES   IEOs typically mean more revenues for exchanges  Exchanges that will host an IEO will typically do the vetting process of a project for a fee  They also get fees when the token starts trading on their exchange   Market observers said IEOs came at a time when cryptocurrency exchanges struggled as digital currencies slumped and cryptocurrency buyers dwindled  IEOs gave them some form of lifeline  For some exchanges  however  IEOs mean more users for their trading platform and some of them are willing to undertake the screening process of a project even without a listing fee  
By doing IEOs  we attract communities to trade on Beaxy   said Artak Hamazaspyan  chief executive officer at digital asset exchange Beaxy Digital  which opened its trading platform to IEOs   If I list a project and it s not listed anywhere else  I get all these communities to join us  ",2019-06-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/explainer-initial-exchange-offerings-flourish-in-crypto-market-1903391,1903391

173697,395213,IBM,Expert System  Accelerating Investment In Growth,opinion,"While H119 revenues were slightly below those reported a year ago   Expert System   MI EXSY  is confident of meeting revenue expectations for the full year  which imply year on year growth of 13   Management is using the funds raised in April to accelerate investment in sales and support  Although this reduces our EBITDA forecasts for FY19 and FY20  it should lead to stronger revenue growth in the medium term as the company takes advantage of the strong interest in the practical application of artificial intelligence in business processes 





Growing the recurring revenue base
In H119 Expert reported a 7 7  y o y decline in sales to  11 9m and an EBITDA loss of  0 4m  As part of an ongoing strategy to shift to a subscription licensing model  the company saw 91  of licence revenues generated from subscription sales compared to 79  a year ago  This increases the company s revenue visibility and presents a less challenging initial investment decision for customers  The company expects to achieve revenues of c  33m for FY19  at the lower end of its previous guidance range   which implies a one third two third revenue split for the year  typical of seasonality seen prior to FY18 
Estimate changes reflect accelerated investment
When the company raised funds of  7m in April  it highlighted that it intended to use some of the proceeds to accelerate sales  particularly in the US  It has therefore reduced EBITDA guidance for FY19 from  7 8m to  5 6m to reflect this accelerated investment  Although this slows the pace of margin expansion  it should position the company for faster revenue growth in the medium term  The company is also investing in supporting channel partners  which present another route to market and provide additional implementation resources  We have revised our estimates to reflect management guidance 
Valuation  Reflects growth potential
The share price has performed well since the fund raising in April  as the proceeds allowed the company to reduce its debt burden and accelerate investment in growth  Compared to a diverse set of peers  Expert is forecast to grow faster but is less profitable  Evidence that the recent investment is accelerating revenue growth would be a key driver of share price upside  Progress towards operating profitability and cash generation should also provide further support 
Share price performance





Business description
Expert System has developed and patented technology that extracts useful information from unstructured text using semantic based techniques  It applies this technology to a number of verticals including enterprise search  customer experience management and big data analytics 
Review of H119 results






In H119  Expert reported a 7 7  y o y decline in sales  while grants and other income was  0 12m higher than H118  resulting in a decline in total revenue of 6 4  y o y  This decline should be considered in light of the company s strong sales performance in H118  which made up 45  of FY18 sales   well ahead of the historical 35  contribution of H1 sales to full year sales 
The company increased capitalised development costs by  0 42m y o y whereas staff and other costs were broadly flat year on year  This resulted in EBITDA declining from  0 07m in H118 to a  0 43m loss in H119  With depreciation and amortisation effectively flat  normalised EBIT was lower by a similar amount 
Reflecting the  7m in funds raised during H119  net debt at the end of H119 fell to  5 7m  down from  10 0m at the end of H118 and  12 6m at the end of FY18 
Shift to subscription licensing continues
The company noted that of licence revenues reported in H119  91  were from subscription licences  compared to 79  in H118 and 72  in FY18  Professional services made up 40 5  of H119 revenues  vs 40  in H118   with the remaining 59 5  consisting of licence and maintenance revenues  Although the company did not disclose the split between licence and maintenance revenues  the fact that perpetual licences have now fallen to 9  of total licence revenues implies that recurring revenue  subscription licences plus maintenance  is approaching 60  of group revenue  we estimate it was nearer 50  in H118  
International business growing faster than Italy
The company disclosed the geographic revenue split in Exhibit 2  Sales outside Italy were flat year on year compared to a decline in sales from Italy  The company noted that business in the UK saw strong growth   62  y o y   with particular success in the insurance market  After a period of restructuring  the French business saw better growth   23  y o y   Sales in the US were helped by strong demand from US government customers  Business in Italy was lower year on year  with delays in decision making due to the uncertain political and economic environment 





Share capital increase from fund raise and option exercise
The company issued 3 89m shares to ERGO  a group of private investors  in April and received gross proceeds of  7m  Also in H119  an additional 0 2m shares were issued from various share grant schemes  including the final tranche from the Temis acquisition 
Business update
So far this year  the company has continued to receive positive reviews from market research analysts  For the fifth year running  it is included in KM World s  100 Companies That Matter in Knowledge Management   It also featured in Gartner s recently published Insight Engines Magic Quadrant 
Notable customers this year include 
Swiss Re  the company is collaborating with Expert to use Cogito to manage  high intensity information   This includes helping to automate processes such as risk assessment or analysing requests for reimbursement as well as identifying news that could indicate sources of future losses 
AXA Group  AXA XL Risk Consulting chose Cogito to enhance its capabilities in Property Risk Engineering  This includes reducing the time required to read all necessary documentation and to therefore speed up the quote process 
OCP  the world s largest producer of phosphate and phosphoric acid and one of the largest fertiliser producers in the world  The company is using Cogito to manage flows of information from external and open sources to help to identify strategic insights for internal analysts and management 
Product development
The company launched Cogito v14 4 in April  The latest version of the platform speeds up the ability to expand the knowledge graph via the acquisition of new information  has improved machine learning functionality and makes it easier to integrate with robotic process automation tools 
The company noted that product developments expected in H2 include 
a new release of the Cogito Intelligence Platform 
a beta version of Cogito for Life Sciences 
a restructure and widening of the knowledge graph for German  Arabic  Dutch and Chinese  and
new intelligent analysis of complex documents 
Channel partner progress
Expert continues to work with channel partners to broaden its addressable market and get access to implementation resources  It offers partners an e learning platform and has so far issued 139 certifications to individuals at 21 companies in 18 countries 
Outlook and changes to forecasts
The company expects to achieve sales of c  33m in FY19  It previously suggested it could achieve of  33 34 5m and we forecast sales of  33 3m for the year  This implies that revenues in H119 would make up roughly one third of full year revenues  Although this looks low compared to the prior year when H1 revenues made up 45  of full year revenues  this is more like the pattern seen in FY17 and prior years  Based on deals signed since the end of H119  renewals of subscription contracts expected in H2 and deals in the pipeline  management is confident it will see a step up in revenues in H2 to meet the  33m FY19 target 
The company has reduced guidance for FY19 EBITDA from  7 8m to  5 6m  When it raised funds of  7m in April  the company noted that proceeds were to be targeted at growing the business  It plans to do this by increasing headcount for sales and pre sales  technical support for channel partners and R D to simplify the implementation of Expert s software by partners  We have revised our forecasts for staff and other operating costs to take this extra investment into account  The company noted it would be drafting and presenting its 2020 2022 business plan in the next few months 





Valuation
Most of Expert s direct competitors are private companies or subsidiaries of large companies such as  IBM   NYSE IBM  or Micro Focus  We have compared Expert s valuation and operating metrics to peers operating in the natural language processing  big data analytics  enterprise search and information management markets  as well as to Italian software and IT services peers 
Based on EV sales  Expert is trading at a premium to Italian peers and at a discount to all other peer groups  with forecast revenue growth towards the upper end of the group  On an EV EBITDA basis  Expert is trading at a premium to Italian and enterprise search and information management peers and at a discount to data analytics peers  Evidence that the recent investment in sales and support is driving accelerating revenue growth would be a key driver for share price upside  Progress towards net cash generation and operating profitability should provide key support to the share price 





Since the company raised funds in April at  1 80  at an 18  premium to the share price at the time   the share price has performed well  peaking at  3 68 and now trading at  2 72  The proceeds have reduced Expert s debt burden and provided funds to accelerate growth 
We have performed a reverse DCF to calculate the growth and profitability that is factored into the share price beyond our forecast period  We estimate the share price is factoring in a revenue CAGR of 9 5  from FY20 to FY28  with EBITDA margins rising to 28  by FY28  Assuming the company continues to capitalise development spend  we forecast capex sales reducing to 7 8  by FY28  with a terminal EBIT margin of 19 6   in line with established software companies   We use a WACC of 8 5  and long term growth of 3   A 1  increase in the WACC results in a valuation of  2 19 share  whereas a 1  decrease results in a valuation of  3 53 ",2019-10-03,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/expert-system-accelerating-investment-in-growth-200470195,200470195

Considering these trends  value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One stock to keep an eye on is IBM  IBM   IBM is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A 
Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  IBM has a P S ratio of 1 57  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 58 
Finally  investors will want to recognize that IBM has a P CF ratio of 9 17  This figure highlights a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook  IBM s current P CF looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P CF of 10 25  Within the past 12 months  IBM s P CF has been as high as 13 52 and as low as 7 74  with a median of 9 32 
These are only a few of the key metrics included in IBM s strong Value grade  but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now  When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook  IBM looks like an impressive value stock at the moment ",2019-10-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-ibm-ibm-stock-200471882,200471882

173741,395257,IBM,Annaly Capital Management  Not Suitable For Retirement Accounts ,opinion,"Although some might disagree  I believe that investors either in retirement  or close to becoming retired  should be a little more conservative with how their portfolios are positioned   This position is primarily predicated on the reality that investors in retirement do not have the luxury of the time often needed to recover from bad decisions  or from bad market environments in general 
In conjunction with this more prudent and conservative portfolio positioning  retired investors are best served to take a long term buy and hold investment strategy   Consequently  this would also apply that retired investors should favor consistent and predictable performance over inconsistent and erratic performance   This further supports the prudence of investing in blue chip high quality dividend growth stocks for the equity portion of their portfolios 
I believe the biggest advantage that blue chip dividend growth stocks offer retired investors is a predictable and consistent growth of dividend income regardless of market price behavior   Common sense  and historical reality  clearly validates the prudence of steady dividend growth over highly volatile market price action   With dividend growth stocks  the income stream is highly predictable whereas the capital appreciation component fluctuates along with emotionally charged market reactions 

Therefore  I am not in favor of chasing yield in retirement accounts  especially in highly volatile mREITs   To be clear  this particular asset class is volatile and erratic with both price and dividends   With that said  many mortgage REITs  mREITs  are currently offering extremely high double digit yields that capture the attention of income seeking investors such as retirees   The following stock price quotation courtesy of Seeking Alpha shows that the popular mREIT   Annaly Capital Management Inc   NYSE NLY   statistically speaking appears to be an extremely attractive dividend stock with a very low valuation and a high dividend yield  highlights in yellow are mine  




Wow  an investor might conclude  a dividend yield of almost 12  and a P E ratio of only 8 which is approximately half the valuation that most stocks trade at   Since I am looking for income  this is almost too good to be true   or is it    Now  I understand  especially considering today s generally low interest rate levels   how investors might become smitten with double digit yields   On the other hand  I believe if those same investors look closer under the hood  they might have a different attitude and perspective 
Annaly Capital Management Historical Performance
For starters  a bottom line examination of Annaly s cumulative dividend production over the last couple of decades is nothing short of awesome   A  10 000 investment made on December 31  1999 would have generated  36 525 79 in dividends through June 2019   That is approximately 10 times the dividend income that an equal investment in the S P 500 would have produced   The average retiree would be quite happy with those long term dividend income results 
However  I would question whether the average retiree would have been willing to hold onto this company over that timeframe so that they could have achieved those dividend income results   A closer look suggests that a buy and hold approach to Annaly since 2000 would have presented several challenges   Here is the full dividend record 




The reader should note not only the many dividend cuts  but the general inconsistency of the dividend payments as well   Additionally  capital appreciation over this timeframe was very poor relative to the average company   As you can see  Annaly shareholders barely broke even   However  the total return that shareholders received since 2000 was superior to the overall market 
Nevertheless  even though the outcome was palatable  the journey was treacherous and nerve racking   I highly doubt that most retired investors would have been capable of staying the course to achieve those results   Additionally  when you examine different timeframes you get significantly different outcomes  most of which underperform the market on a total return basis  I will be presenting this in detail in the video below    Consequently  I do not consider Annaly   or mortgage REITs for that matter  suitable for retirement accounts despite the high yields 
 Investment Must Be Rational  If You Don t Understand It  Don t Do It  Warren Buffett
In addition to what I covered above  one of my primary issues with including mortgage REITs in retirement accounts is the complexity of their business models   As the title of this section suggests  I find the business model of mortgage REITs both complex and confusing   The following excerpt taken from Nariet attempts to explain the business model of mREITS   Although I generally understand what they do  I consider it extremely difficult to attempt to forecast future results   Consequently  I personally have little confidence in evaluating mREITS  and even less in attempting to forecast what their futures would hold for me as a shareholder 
 Nariet  The mREIT Business Model
mREITs hold mortgages and MBS on their balance sheets  and fund these investments with equity and debt capital  Their general objective is to earn a profit from their net interest margin  or the spread between interest income on their mortgage assets and their funding costs  mREITs rely on a variety of funding sources  including common and preferred equity  repurchase agreements  structured financing  convertible and long term debt and other credit facilities  mREITs raise both debt and equity in the public capital markets 
mREITs typically use less borrowing and more equity capital to finance their acquisitions of mortgages and MBS than do other large mortgage investors  
Common Shares Outstanding
The last sentence above also presents an issue I have with investing in mREITS   extreme dilution   Later  when I show earnings per share and other metrics  look back on how dilutive these businesses are to shareholders   Since 1998 Annaly Capital Management s shares outstanding have increased from 13 million to 1 2 billion by the end of 2018   That is a compound annual growth rate  dilution rate  of 25 4  per annum to shareholders 
Operating Cash Flow Per Share
As a result of the complexity of the mortgage REITs  business model in conjunction with the dilution mentioned above  operating cash flow tends to be very erratic   even turning negative in many years   Therefore  it is no wonder that mREITs have such spotty dividend records   It is hard to pay and or increase your dividends when cash flows are collapsing  or worse yet  turning negative   The following graphic plots Annaly Capital Management s operating cash flow since 2003 




mREITs Risks and Risk Management 
Since mREITs operate in such a dynamic market  it is incumbent on management to be able to deal with many types of risk   However  this also implies utilizing many hedging strategies that are very difficult for the lay investor  and for that matter  the professional investor to understand and evaluate 
Here is what NARIET has to say about Risks and Risk Management
 Risks and Risk Management
Most mREITs are registered with the SEC and are required to publish regular financial statements for review and monitoring by investors and analysts   The business risks that mREITs face are similar to those of other financial firms  mREITs have considerable experience managing many types of risk 
Interest Rate Risk  Managing the effects of changes in short  and long term interest rates is an essential element of mREITs  business operations  Changes in interest rates can affect the net interest margin  which is mREITs  fundamental source of earnings  but also may affect the value of their mortgage assets  which affects corporate net worth 
mREITs typically manage and mitigate risk associated with their short term borrowings through conventional  widely used hedging strategies  including interest rate swaps  swaptions  interest rate collars  caps or floors and other financial futures contracts  mREITs also manage risk in other ways  such as adjusting the average maturities on their assets as well as their borrowings and selling assets during periods of interest rate volatility to raise cash or reduce borrowings  
Credit Risk  The bulk of mortgage securities purchased by residential mREITs are agency securities backed by the federal government  which present limited credit risk  Commercial mREITs may be exposed to credit risk through their private label RMBS and CMBS  The degree of credit risk for a particular security depends on the credit performance of the underlying loans  the structure of the security  that is  which classes of security are paid first  and which are paid later   and by the degree of over collateralization  in which the face amount of the mortgage loans held as collateral exceeds the face amount of the RMBS or CMBS issued  
Prepayment  Changes in interest rates or borrower home sales affect the probability that some borrowers will refinance or repay their mortgages  When such a refinancing or repayment occurs  the investor holding the mortgage or MBS must reinvest the proceeds into the prevailing interest rate environment  which may be lower or higher  mREITs seek to hedge prepayment risk using similar tools and techniques as those they use to hedge against interest rate risks 
Rollover  mREIT assets are mainly longer term MBS and mortgages  while their liabilities may include a significant amount of short term debt  especially among residential  mREITs  This term mismatch requires that they roll over their short term debt before the maturity of their assets  Their ability to do so depends on the liquidity and smooth functioning of the short term debt markets  including the repo market  The repo market is extremely liquid  with an estimated  2 trillion in outstandings and several hundred billion dollars in daily trading volume  Banks and dealers also use the repo market as an important source of market liquidity  In the financing markets  the liquidity of the agency MBS and TBA  To Be Announced  markets is comparable to the market for Treasuries  Commercial mREITs tend to match the duration of their assets and liabilities and face little rollover risk  
FAST Graphs analyze out loud video  Annaly Capital Management
Proponents of mREITs like to tout the notion that dividend growth stocks are potentially overvalued because of their expected growth   Consequently  they believe that future growth will stagnate when the economy slows   In contrast  they will also promote mREITs  tendency to outperform when the market is underperforming 
This is fine and good and has proven true over our last two recessions   On the other hand  there is a problem with this when your investment horizon is long term   What these promoters do not point out is the fact that recessions and bad markets tend to be very short lived  whereas bull markets tend to last much longer   Consequently  the advantage that a mREIT like Annaly Capital Management might offer during a recession  tends to be very short lived 
In the video that follows  I will illustrate this performance anomaly as well as highlight the long term risks that I believe mREITs engender   The most insightful and I consider important part of this article will be found in the video  please watch it for your own edification 


Summary and Conclusions
I do believe that there are certain circumstances  and investor types that might find mREITs viable investments  even attractive long term investments   The secret to making a mREIT a successful long term investment is to diligently reinvest the dividends   Investors that can do this  and can do it over the long run  can produce acceptable and even attractive long term returns through investing in mREITs 
However  I do believe that these investor types are rare and in the minority   In reality  it takes a great deal of fortitude to be able to have the confidence to stay the course long enough in mREITs in order to take advantage of the benefits that they offer   Most investors are not capable of enduring significant volatility in both price and dividends 
On the other hand  for the reasons stated in the article and clearly illustrated in the video  I don t consider mREITs suitable selections for retirement accounts despite their high yields   Therefore  this will be the first of 7 installments on some of the most popular and widely recognized mREITs   My primary purpose and objective is to ensure that all investors  and especially retired investors  understand the reality of investing in high yielding mREITs

173742,395258,IBM,One Bitcoin Now Or 2 Altcoins Later ,opinion,"The famous  cookie now or two later  experiment best describes the current situation on the Bitcoin market  However  we should wonder if those future cookies would still be Bitcoins  Seemingly  some alternative coin  Altcoin  with more value has a chance to replace it 

As the Bitcoin price continues to fall in August  it proves its elasticity to the news  Although many react to Trump s tweets  a single comment shouldn t cause havoc to the cryptocurrencies as it did  The same goes for the false ones triggering the bullish trend as it happened on April fools  day 

Nevertheless  the big news for September 2019 is Bakkt finally launching Bitcoin Futures  The long delayed launch is on 23rd September  promising another exciting end of the month for traders  

However  is there a chance for the crypto market to enter the era of stability  At that time  will those suppressing the need for instant gratification be able to buy more valuable assets  Furthermore  is there an Altcoin with the potential of being more valuable than Bitcoin 
Bitcoin Losing the Support
The last days of the previous month were the ones to remember  Regardless of the bull run during the end  the Bitcoin price didn t go up as far as it should  Falling two months in a row means the end of September will be  the break it or make it   If the price goes below  9 623  the Japanese Candlestick pattern will suggest selling  Seemingly  the volatility of Bitcoin will last while the blockchain technology improves  It is because the blockchain technology is innovation  but cryptocurrencies are still in the infancy stage  The harsh truth  but many choose to twist the reality and believe that the bubble  as Ray Dalio refers to Bitcoin  will last  At this point  only the financial crisis could be the catalyst for its survival  Even in that case  it is hard to believe that Bitcoin can hold value as gold does  It is also interesting to notice that Ray Dalio s suggestion on buying gold  Bitcoin enthusiasts consider as support Far from the truth  since there is a big difference between Bitcoin and gold  Similar to the silver and stones like Jade  the value of gold lies in the possibility to make remarkable objects  Therefore  it is more likely for gems and stones to increase their prices during the financial crisis  For example  an ounce of Jade is even now more valuable than the ounce of gold As Bitcoin is a very straightforward usage of blockchain  it lacks some aspects that hold more value  
Altcoins Offer Innovations
On the other hand  many Bitcoin alternatives grouped under the name Altcoins have much more to offer  Of course  their focus is on the speed of transactions  security  and user experience  

It is because Altcoins tend to replace fiat currencies  But the problem is that security and lesser fees are not a breakthrough  If the blockchain offers a radical change  why should we accept only a small portion of it 

As mentioned  the logical explanation is the early stage of the tech  To support this claim  every cryptocurrency  including Bitcoin  face its issues 
Ethereum

The Ethereum network is infamous for its forks  The first was resulting in a loss of 3 6 million of Ether worth a  70 million at the time  Although its byproduct is Ethereum Classic  no significant improvement came from it nor from the forks that followed  

Nevertheless  the Ethereum platform is valuable as the basis for concepts such as Cryptokitties  Even though the hype for these digital cats caused a severe delay in overall transaction time 
Ripple

On the contrary  Ripple achieved transaction speed higher than PayPal  Furthermore  news as partnerships with the Bill Gates Foundation and donation to schools boost rating a lot 

Regardless of these altruistic moves  Ripple still has to survive its lawsuits  In one of the past trials  Ripple settled for  1 million with its former executive and founder  
Stellar

Since it was the man behind the Ripple code  the very same man founded Stellar as an improved model  Stellar partnered with International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   and it is claiming faster transaction speeds  Thus  starting the rivalry with Ripple  

Unlike the initial Ripple s focus on banks  Stellar tackles both institutions and individuals  Moreover  the real innovation comes from solutions that use the Stellar platform  

For example  Traxalt supports internal data collection  analytics  and reports  Furthermore  the system of credits as an off chain solution makes transactions even faster  Another solution  Tempo Crypto deals with the purchase of goods alongside other upcoming Stellar ICOs 
 
Conclusion
If Bitcoin Futures fail or impact the derivatives market as mortgages did  we can expect the Bitcoin bubble burst in the upcoming months  

It is because the price drop in September leads to the three black crows pattern  Since many traders react to this signal for the bearish market  we can expect massive selling 

Therefore  buying a Bitcoin at this bullish moment is similar to  taking a cookie now  because of FOMO  Although no one can guarantee  two cookies later   the chances are high of some of Altcoins making a breakthrough  

Innovative solutions are giving hope that the focus will shift to blockchain solving the real life problems  It is because the logical choice should be to use cryptocurrencies in everyday life due to making it more comfortable  

Nowadays  the supply and demand for Bitcoin is a trigger for the price of most Altcoins  Thereby  only the unique solution that holds the real value could break this vicious circle  If some Altcoin can achieve this  it would become bulletproof to Bitcoin fluctuations  In this case  it might overthrow it 

So  why take one or even two cookies  when you can take a piece of the cake ",2019-09-18,Andrey Sergeenkov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/one-bitcoin-now-or-2-altcoins-later-200461269,200461269

173781,395297,IBM,Two more shippers join Maersk s cost cutting blockchain based platform,news,"By Jacob Gronholt Pedersen
COPENHAGEN  Reuters    Two of the world s biggest shipping groups will join a Maersk led blockchain platform aimed at boosting efficiency and limiting the enormous paper trail of global container shipping 
With Mediterranean Shipping Co  MSC  and CMA CGM  the second  and fourth largest container shipping companies  joining the platform  nearly half of all cargo being shipped by sea   which accounts for 90  of traded goods worldwide   will be tracked using it 
More than 100 companies  ports or authorities  such as Procter   Gamble and U S  Customs and Border Protection  have signed up for the platform led by Copenhagen based Maersk  the world s largest container shipping company 
Blockchain graphic  
The participation of key players in the platform  launched last year in collaboration with  IBM   NYSE IBM   is seen as crucial for cutting costs in an industry that has seen little innovation since the container was invented in the 1950s 
 Still lots of processes in our industry actually predate the container   Maersk Executive Vice President Vincent Clerc said in an interview 
The blockchain platform  named TradeLens  helps customers  shipping lines  freight forwarders  port authorities and customs authorities manage and track the paper trail by digitising the supply chain process from end to end 
The technology powers the digital currency bitcoin and enables data sharing across a network of individual computers 
 Even today customers live with the administrative burden of having to maintain the huge amount of paperwork and not having visibility of what is happening with their goods   Clerc said  calling MSC and CMA CGM s participation a game changer 
Each year  more than  4 trillion in goods are shipped  and more than 80  of the goods consumers use daily are carried by the ocean shipping industry  according to Maersk 
Paperwork accounts of about 20  on average of the cost of shipping a container from one place to another  A significant part of that administrative cost can be shaved off once the platform is used at full scale  Clerc said 
 Digital collaboration is key to the evolution of the container shipping industry   Andr  Simha  chief digital   innovation officer at Swiss based MSC  said in a statement ",2019-05-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/two-more-shippers-join-maersks-costcutting-blockchainbased-platform-1880235,1880235

outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  19 11 billion but declined 4 2  on a year over year basis  At constant currency  cc   the metric dipped 1 6   The year over year revenue decline can primarily

173785,395301,IBM,Blockchain Is Revolutionizing The Way We Do Business,opinion,"Blockchain is one of the most revolutionary technologies of this generation and has applications that spread across every sector of our economy  The technology has applications that go way beyond a means of transferring wealth 
Blockchain can be utilized to ensure efficiency and security in supply chains  data sharing and even keeping intellectual property protected  Its decentralized functionality makes it an extremely useful tool to protect individuals from not only fraud  but human error 
What Is A Blockchain 
A blockchain is exactly what it sounds like  a chain of interconnected digital blocks  ledgers  that are used to secure data  Some would describe it as a  value exchange protocol  
It was originally invented by Sotoshi Nakamoto  at least this is the name that inventor s  went by  in 2008 to create the first cryptocurrency bitcoin 
The way bitcoin works is through a distributed ledger that records every transaction that is made  In order for a transaction to be made a new block has to be created within the bitcoin chain  Every new block that is created it is given a cryptographic hash of the prior block  or node  linking it to the chain  This cryptographic hash is the unique identifier of that makes each bitcoin authentic 
The new nodes are created automatically and all transaction data is permanently accounted for on every node in the chain  The transactions are then verified by competing crypto miners who are granted coins for verifying transactions to ensure that there is no double spend 
Blockchain technology is decentralized which means that there is no entity that controls it  The nodes of each transaction are spread across many servers and computers with no centralized control

of the most revolutionary technologies of this generation and has applications that spread across every sector of our economy  The technology has applications that go way beyond a means of transferring wealth Blockchain can be utilized to ensure efficiency and security in supply chains  data sharing and even keeping intellectual property protected  Its decentralized functionality makes it an extremely useful tool to protect individuals from not only fraud  but human error What Is A Blockchain A blockchain is exactly what it sounds like  a chain of interconnected digital blocks  ledgers  that are used to secure data  Some would describe it as a  value exchange protocol  It was originally invented by Sotoshi Nakamoto  at least this is the name that inventor s  went by  in 2008 to create the first cryptocurrency bitcoin The way bitcoin works is through a distributed ledger that records every transaction that is made  In order for a transaction to be made a new block has to be created within the bitcoin chain  Every new block that is created it is given a cryptographic hash of the prior block  or node  linking it to the chain  This cryptographic hash is the unique identifier of that makes each bitcoin authentic The new nodes are created automatically and all transaction data is permanently accounted for on every node in the chain  The transactions are then verified by competing crypto miners who are granted coins for verifying transactions to ensure that there is no double spend Blockchain technology is decentralized which means that there is no entity that controls it  The nodes of each transaction are spread across many servers and computers with no centralized control Blockchain technology makes it effectively impossible to add  remove or alter the data on the blockchain  This is because each autonomous block  ledger  is keeping track of all past  present and future activity Use In FinanceThe use of blockchain for a digital currency was a no

173804,395320,IBM,One Lousy Treasury Bond Auction Doesn t Say Anything,news," Bloomberg Opinion     The U S  Treasury Department sold  27 billion of 10 year notes on Wednesday  and by one important metric  it drew the lowest demand in a decade  Some called the results  stunningly weak   Others claimed that buyers stepping back validated JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon s observation that yields are  extraordinarily low  
I m here to tell you that practically none of it matters  At all 
Sure  the bid to cover ratio  which gauges demand by comparing the amount of bonds that were bid on with the amount offered  came in at 2 17  There s no way to spin that as a good number  but it s also hardly an outlier  The auction three months ago had a middling 2 35 ratio  and back to back sales in August and September 2017 came in at 2 23 and 2 28  respectively  Those latter results are arguably worse than this week s deal when considering that the September 2017 auction was a mere  20 billion in size  That means Wednesday s enlarged 10 year auction drew about  13 billion more in demand 
What s more  the  15 9 trillion Treasuries market has faced progressively lower auction appetite for years now  To understand this trend isn t any more complicated than the obvious arithmetic  The U S  is borrowing more to finance widening budget deficits and investors aren t proportionately upping their bids  A chart of the two year rolling average of the bid to cover ratio tells the tale  By that measure  demand is about the weakest since shortly after the financial crisis 
A year ago  after a poor 10 year sale  and  coincidentally  amid a fresh round of tariffs   I took a  deep dive into demand and pressed traders and strategists for insights into how to react to the auction figures  The answer I got back was near unanimous  You can t 
But for bond traders  the day to day implications are less clear  Take last month s 10 year auction  Demand was the ninth lowest since the start of 2009  In all the instances it was lower  yields fell four times and rose four times in the following month  Sometimes  Treasuries rallied into the offering  on other occasions  they were in the midst of a sell off 
That s why some strategists are reluctant to draw any grand conclusions from the upcoming slate of auctions  particularly as investors try to assess the fallout from the latest round of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump 
 The auction stats that come out immediately after auctions are really a referendum on how well the market is pricing in the risk and the concession built in   said Blake Gwinn  strategist at NatWest Markets   As far as the longer term trend in yields  can you look at a strong auction and say clearly we re in a bullish market  I don t know I d ever really go that far  
At the time of Wednesday s auction  financial markets didn t have a firm read on whether the U S  and China would reach a trade deal  which explains why 10 year yields were little changed  With rates some 15 basis points below their 2019 average  it s understandable why investors would be leery to step in and bid aggressively given the uncertainty  Plus  the Treasury had competition  Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  Co  issued  19 billion of debt on Tuesday  and International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  Corp  borrowed  20 billion on Wednesday  Those were two of the 11 largest U S  corporate bond sales in history  Domestic buyers  after all  are the ones who have stepped up in recent years to finance America s budget deficits  And they may have simply been running low on cash 
The setup for Thursday s 30 year bond sale was more of the same  with Trump announcing minutes beforehand that he had received a  beautiful letter  from Chinese President Xi Jinping and that the two leaders would probably speak by phone   I think it ll be a very strong day   he said  though  our alternative is an excellent one   Yields quickly moved to little changed on the session  The auction wound up drawing decidedly average interest 
As for linking the weak demand to comments from Dimon  well  remember he said 5  10 year yields were  a higher probability than most people think  back in August  and they never came close  But more to the point  it s not as if low yields have stopped investors from bidding aggressively before  In June 2016  just a month before yields reached their all time lows  the bid to cover ratio was 2 7  a level that hasn t been reached since  The last time the ratio was above 3 was in March 2013  just months before the so called taper tantrum and when yields were a paltry 2 03   
Ultimately  the only way to read anything into auction results is by understanding both longer term expectations and looking at how the market moved leading into the sale  If bond traders are convinced that growth will slow and yields will stay persistently low  like mid 2016   they ll bid no matter the price  However  if yields move sharply lower in short order on some sort of fleeting shock   say  North Korea conducting a powerful nuclear test   that s how you wind up with a result like in September 2017  which  again  could be considered even weaker than this week s offering  
More often than not  though  one set of auction statistics says little about the path forward for the world s biggest bond market  It s fun to draw up conspiracy theories that the weak demand for 10 year notes reflected a no show by China  the largest foreign holder of Treasuries  Even if that were somehow proven true  it provides little guidance because investors know that the country realistically can t afford to entirely shun America s debt  
If a U S  auction ever failed  of course  that would be a big deal and raise questions about how the government overseeing the world s largest economy would fund itself  But until that day comes  which could very well be never   traders need not sweat the small stuff in any given Treasury bond sale ",2019-05-09,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/onelousy-treasury-bond-auction-doesnt-say-anything-1863175,1863175

173806,395322,IBM,Red Hot Dividend ETFs Of 2019,opinion,With rate cuts in the cards and lower bond yields  the appeal for dividend ETFs has been on a rise this year on investors  drive for juicy yields Though these stocks do not offer much price appreciation in a rising stock market  they offer a steady stream of income along with the potential of capital gains  Dividend focused products offer safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to large swings in stock prices Dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk  The companies that pay out dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis Further  research shows that dividend stocks often outperform their non dividend paying counterparts over longer periods  According to Chicago based Greenrock Research  a portfolio with the top 20  S P 500 companies ranked by dividend yield and weighted by market capitalization  outperformed the overall S P 500 by  annually from 1995 to 2018  read    Stocks having a history of dividend growth lead to a healthy portfolio when compared to simple dividend paying out stocks or those with high yields  Notably  the S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index  which includes members of the S P 500 Index that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years  has delivered a total return of almost  since inception in 2005versus 221  for the S P 500 and 168  for the S P 500 Value Index  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stocks That said  we highlight some dividend ETFs that have become immensely popular this year and have been hitting all time highs  These products

173807,395323,IBM,Elliptic Data  IBM Find Only 2  of Bitcoin Transactions Are Unlawful,opinion,"Elliptic  a London based blockchain organization centered around the investigation and prevention of criminal activity in cryptocurrencies has recently released a study that claims only two percent of Bitcoin transactions are unlawful 
  which was produced in partnership with MIT and IBM  NYSE IBM  utilized Artificial Intelligence and deep learning algorithms to reach its conclusions  represents something of a landmark for the use of AI in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry 
The primary purpose of the investigation was the exploration of several methods used to detect acts of money laundering within the crypto industry  hopefully with the result of increasing efficiency of detection and prevention 
Of the 200 000 transactions analyzed throughout the study  two percent were deemed unlawful  21 percent were considered legal  while the remaining 77 percent were left unclassified  
The primary takeaway from this study is that while cryptocurrency as a whole has gained a reputation as the channel of choice for illicit behavior such as money laundering  those opinions may be somewhat dated 
Recent developments in AML  Anti Money Laundering  and KYC  Know Your Customer  protocols have gone a long way to helping eliminate much of the illegal activity that was admittedly prevalent in the early years of crypto 
AI in the crypto sphere 
A key element in the success of the recent study is the utilization of artificial intelligence throughout the procedure  The integration of AI into the process of AML protocols is significant in that it highlights how far the technology has come  Artificial intelligence is now sophisticated enough to both analyze and navigate the complexities that the blockchain presents  
The  report isn t the first time we ve seen AI technology used in the blockchain and crypto world  Companies such as Singapore based DeepBrain Chain and Velas  a startup based out of Europe have been forging a path for quite some time now 
For Alex Alexandrov  CEO of both Velas and crypto payments gateway CoinPayments  the role of artificial intelligence in the blockchain industry is simple  To solve problems 
 Here at Velas  our purpose is to address and fix existing issues and challenges faced by most existing Blockchains  such as centralization for example  or 51  attack  nothing at stake problem  scalability  security  high upfront expenses and so on  This is done by using neural networks optimized by artificial intelligence to enhance its consensus algorithm  
AI s role in preventing money laundering
Artificial intelligence s role in the world of cryptocurrency and the prevention of criminal behavior is already fairly well defined at this point  but the integration of the technology into the blockchain industry could be a game changer of significant proportions 
In a recent interview with a leading cryptocurrency news outlet  DeepBrain Chain CEO He Yong explained that DeepBrain Chain aimed to  connect all the idle AI computing resources globally so that the entire network can share computing power  
He went on the add that as things stand  there is no algorithm that I know of that can connect thousands of computers to each other on a secure base   which is where progress still has to be made 
If this was achieved  however  the inclusion of AI with AML protocols could bring forth a new era of robust and empowered security tools that could change not just the crypto industry  but the world of finance entirely 
Today there is still a lot of skepticism of the blockchain and crypto worlds  more so the latter  but that is to be expected of an industry that is still relatively young and finding its feet  What cannot be denied is the vast potential that blockchain technology offers  and the integration of AI is yet another facet of this industry that could change the way we go about business in the future 
We are seeing the technology gain more and more acceptance from academics and developers alike  which can only be a good thing for overall progress within the space  The work carried out thus far by companies like Velas and DeepBrain Chain is shining examples of what is possible when AI is utilized alongside blockchain technology ",2019-08-09,David Cullinan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/elliptic-data-ibm-find-only-2-of-bitcoin-transactions-are-unlawful-200453542,200453542

173820,395336,IBM,Inside the Blockchain Companies Listed On Public Exchanges,opinion,"Investors wanting exposure to blockchain focused companies have traditionally been limited to largely unregulated cryptocurrencies and exchanges  While not a pure play  investors have shown interest in companies such as IBM  NYSE IBM   Alibaba  NYSE BABA  Group  Fujitsu  T 6702   Mastercard  NYSE MA   and ING Groep  AS INGA  for their blockchain practices and innovation in the space 
The good news is that around the world there has been a silent movement of blockchain technology firms that are avoiding any kind of speculative fundraising practices and instead have decided to pursue public listings on some of the world s most well known exchanges and markets  
The criteria for blockchain companies to get publicly listed is no different than any other company  Companies must submit all required documentation  meet all exchange listing standards  fund an underwriter or sponsored facilitator  and apply  
In some cases  the companies started off as internet or technology companies before publicly declaring themselves as blockchain companies  The most notable is Overstockcom  NASDAQ OSTK  which was founded in 1999 as Deals com and has since evolved into one of the first security token issuance providers as well as one of the first retailers to accept Bitcoin as payment  
While a good example of a successful transition  not all companies shared the same success  Long Island Iced Tea  OTC  LTEA  experienced a 200  jump in its stock price after adding the word  blockchain  to its name in December 2017  Unfortunately  the hype was temporary as the company failed to remain active  
Across the pond  European companies have been well received by exchanges as companies search for liquidity and validation in public markets  In Germany  one company has managed to list on three of the largest exchanges  Advanced Blockchain AG is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  FRANKFURT  BWQ   Dusseldorf Stock Exchange  and on Deutsche B rse s Xetra  
In Asia  we have seen companies like Blockchain Industries  OTC  BCII  was first established by a parent company in Singapore and has been listed on the OTC markets since mid 2018  The company has expressed its intention of going public in the US through a reverse merger  
In the middle east  Israeli owned Atlas Blockchain Group  CSE  AKE  secured nearly  5m USD in financing to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Isracann Biosciences  The blockchain mining and technology company previously went public on the Canadian Securities Exchange  
A lot of these companies mentioned did not raise money through an ICO or any kind of crowdfunding campaign  This means they likely did not capitalize on the often extreme sums of capital that were being thrown at blockchain companies in 2017 and 2018  
Going public gives companies with traditional structures the opportunity to raise additional capital to expand and diversify risk ownership  With the recent news around Facebook s Libra Coin  blockchain companies are now on the international spotlight  for better or worse  and it should be expected that more blockchain companies will seek public listings as the industry grows and matures

173851,395367,IBM,IBM  IBM  Q2 Earnings And Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"IBM  IBM  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 17 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 06 per share  This compares to earnings of  3 08 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 59   A quarter ago  it was expected that this technology and consulting company would post earnings of  2 21 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 25  delivering a surprise of 1 81  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
IBM  which belongs to the Zacks Computer   Integrated Systems industry  posted revenues of  19 16 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 25   This compares to year ago revenues of  20 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
IBM shares have added about 26 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 8  
What s Next for IBM 
While IBM has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for IBM was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 51 on  18 19 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  13 89 on  76 82 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

173881,395397,IBM,Autonomy founder Lynch set for  5 billion Hewlett Packard court showdown,news,By Paul Sandle LONDON  Reuters    Mike Lynch  once hailed as Britain s answer to Bill Gates  faces Hewlett Packard  HP  in London s High Court on Monday in a multi billion dollar showdown over the U S  technology company s 2011 purchase of the Autonomy software business he founded  The case is part of a dispute between HP and Lynch lasting more than six years over who is to blame for the disastrous deal  which ended up costing the Silicon Valley stalwart s shareholders billions of dollars  HP is seeking damages of around  5 billion from Lynch and his former colleague Sushovan Hussain  alleging that they inflated the value of Autonomy before selling the big data firm  whose software searches and organises unstructured information  such as telephone conversations  Lynch has denied the allegations and said the failure of the  11 billion acquisition was down to HP s mismanagement   The 53 year old  whose doctoral thesis is one of the most consulted at Cambridge University  is counter suing for more than  160 million for loss and damage caused by HP s actions  Autonomy was supposed to be the centrepiece of a plan to transform HP from a PC and printer maker into a software focused enterprise services firm  a shift successfully undertaken by  IBM   NYSE IBM  in the previous two decades  Lynch has been engaged in a war of words with HP ever since he was fired by former HP CEO Meg Whitman in 2012 less than a year after the deal was completed   The entrepreneur has maintained his standing in the British tech scene by investing in a string of new companies and through membership of bodies such as the Royal Society  However  the stakes in the dispute escalated in November when Lynch and Stephen Chamberlain  another former Autonomy executive  were indicted for wire fraud in the United States  a charge that carries a maximum term of 20 years imprisonment  An amended indictment filed on Friday added charges against both men  including a securities fraud count against Lynch that could subject him to a 25 year prison term  Lynch has stepped down from his government advisory role and from Royal Society committees  Hussain was found guilty in a related case in April 2018  but has not yet been sentenced  SOFTWARE STRATEGY The Autonomy deal started to turn sour before it was even completed  Many shareholders baulked at the 79 percent premium  the architect of the strategy CEO Leo Apotheker was sacked and HP s board looked into the possibility of walking away  And a little over a year after it was completed  HP said it had discovered  serious accounting improprieties  that had inflated the value of Autonomy  writing off more than  5 billion in relation to the botched deal   That is the sum it is now seeking from Lynch  who received about  800 million for his stake in Autonomy  and Hussain  HP will argue that Autonomy s management made undisclosed  loss making hardware sales and misrepresented revenue to inflate Autonomy s value  its claim shows   Lynch will deny all of HP s claims  his defence says and a counterclaim document shows  In it Lynch says that HP s executives have campaigned over a number of years to shift the responsibility for their failures in the acquisition and integration of Autonomy onto him  The case is set to last until the end of year and it could then take the judge another six months to reach a decision ,2019-03-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/autonomy-founder-lynch-set-for-5-billion-hewlettpackard-court-showdown-1815641,1815641

Investing com   There s much to like about Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  right now 
The stock is up 29  since bottoming in the Christmas Eve selloff and 20  this quarter  second only to  IBM   NYSE IBM  in the Dow  After reporting fiscal second quarter results on Feb  13  the stock is up better than 9 5  and has hit 52 week highs six times  including on Tuesday 
Cisco  the maker of networking equipment used both in the cloud and on internal networks around the world  has generated consistent earnings and revenue growth  Its gross profit margins are still right around 62   where they ve been for years  Its quarterly dividend  first instituted at 6 cents in 2011  has just been boosted to 35 cents a share 
It has  40 billion in cash and short term investments available to deploy  In fiscal 2018  it bought back some  17 billion in shares  In the last quarter it bought back  5 billion more and boosted its buyback authorization to  24 billion 
Meanwhile  China s Huawei  one of Cisco s biggest competitors in networking  is accused of being an arm of the Chinese government in alleged efforts to spy on U S  companies and the government  The Trump administration doesn t want domestic customers to buy Huawei products and even threatened to withhold classified intelligence from Germany unless it halted plans to buy Huawei equipment for its 5G network 
What could go wrong for Cisco 
Right now  not much  In fact  the government shutdown had little impact on Cisco s business  CEO Chuck Robbins said on the Feb  13 earnings call  Most analysts have price targets on the stock in the mid  50s  Based on earnings growth and a price to earnings ratio above 18x  a case could be made for the stock to reach  60

A second issue is irrational exuberance

173914,395430,IBM,Earnings Preview  IBM  IBM  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"IBM  IBM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This technology and consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 7  
Revenues are expected to be  19 11 billion  down 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for IBM 
For IBM  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that IBM will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that IBM would post earnings of  2 21 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 25  delivering a surprise of  1 81  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
IBM doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-ibm-ibm-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200438454,200438454

173928,395444,IBM,Undercover Down Under  Miners study gum leaves  groundwater for new finds,news,By Melanie Burton MELBOURNE  Reuters    Australian mining magnate Lang Hancock famously discovered the world s biggest iron ore deposit when he noticed the red stained cliffs of a canyon while flying over the Outback in the 1950s  Now  the days when massive mineral deposits could be simply spotted by plane are gone  so miners are adopting new lab techniques and machine led mapping to detect metal traces in everything from sand to gum tree leaves and groundwater  Australian miners are taking a deeper look at the 80 percent of the country that lies  under cover    obscured by meters of sediment and sand  particularly in the desert interior  across an area twice the size of India   They are using a mix of new techniques and established methods in new ways  backed by greater computing heft  including a new generation of multi layered maps produced by Australian government agencies    There has been a perception that Australia is a mature destination and all the big finds have been found   said Will Robinson  managing director at Encounter Resources  which is exploring for gold using a new type of soil sampling developed by the CSIRO  Australia s peak science body   You re seeing more success as companies go out there and supply new technologies and new thinking into areas to find new big deposits   he said   It has reset the maturity clock   Having repaired their balance sheets on the back of a commodities price recovery  miners large and small are rushing to peg out prospective land in undercover areas    Anglo American   LON AAL  told Reuters it has recently been granted or is seeking permits over almost 11 000 square km of land in Queensland state  while iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group raised its exploration tenements by a third last year   Rio Tinto   LON RIO  also sharply increased its exploration holdings under the remote Great Sandy Desert  where it announced a large copper find last week  Encounter Resources last month reported a gold find under shallow sand using CSIRO s Ultrafine Soil technique  sending the explorer s shares up 30 percent   These ancient landscapes have buried deposits   said Ryan Noble  a CSIRO scientist leading the development of the process   The analysis relies on separating out large particles of sand  which in remote Australia can account for as much as 95 percent of a sample  from much smaller clays and iron oxides  which attract gold  copper and zinc   Developments in analysis mean smaller particles of 2 microns can now be detected  about one 50th the size of a grain of salt  revealing signs of mineralization as deep as 10 20 meters  30 65 feet  under soil or sand   We think there is huge value for Australia and other places to reprocess the samples they have collected and generate new targets and open up new areas   CSIRO s Noble said   Other new techniques are also starting to show results  In South Australia  ASX listed Marmota is using a biogeochemical leaf analysis which helped guide it to a high grade gold strike at its Gawler Craton project in September  Gum trees siphon up minute traces of gold from their roots to their leaves  which are then analyzed in a lab    The gums were able to pick up moderate mineralization down to about 60 meters  200 feet    geologist Aaron Brown told Reuters   The technology was developed during the boom years of 2012 2013 but has taken time to be used commercially as miners and investors look to reinvest in exploration after several lean years  GOVERNMENT SUPPORT Australian government bodies are also getting on board  The Australian government is part way through a four year  A 100 million   70 75 million  exploration program under the oversight of GeoScience Australia  It includes projects to collate soil geochemistry data with groundwater data sets into predictive maps for highly prospective mineral regions  Geoscience Australia is also working with other international bodies such as the Geological Survey of India to help uncover hidden deposits on the subcontinent  underscoring the competition among global mining zones to attract capital in the new wave of exploration    The release of excellent pre competitive geoscientific data by Geosciences Australia and the Geological Survey of Queensland has enabled us to evaluate previously under explored parts of Australia  including undercover areas of interest   Anglo American told Reuters  Meanwhile   IBM   NYSE IBM   which launched a resources platform developed in Canada that uses machine learning to better predict where mineralization lies  is drawing interest from Australian miners   IBM s Watson for the natural resources industry uses artificial intelligence to combine data such as government drill results and aeromagnetic surveys with historical visual data including hand drawn maps in a way that has not been done before  Geologists can ask technically specific questions of Watson about a resource and get an answer back   Traditionally geologists would spend 80 percent of their time sorting through data  trying to find it  correlate it  then organize it  and then running their models   IBM partner David Dickson told Reuters    Now it s flipped and 20 percent of the time is spent doing that  and geologists can spend more time on getting insights from the information and making better decisions on where the prospective regions are    Australia has a long tradition in mining and a significant potential of still unexplored reserves  he said    Gold for example  generally is very low grade so you can spend a lot of money on exploration  The more we remove the uncertainty and variability from the exploration program  the more viable the program is  ,2019-03-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/undercover-down-under-miners-study-gum-leaves-groundwater-for-new-finds-1800069,1800069

Consensus Estimate of  18 52 billion and declined 4 7  on a year over year basis  At constant currency  cc   the metric dipped 0 9   The year over year revenue decline can primarily be attributed to currency fluctuation and headwinds from IBM Z product cycle  Also  softness in the emerging markets of Asia Pacific affected the top line performance Notably  IBM stated that signings declined 14  on

competition  Segmental revenues pertaining to Cloud revenues declined 15   IBM Z revenues decreased 38  year over year However  Power revenues increased 9  from the year ago quarter  The upside can be mainly attributed to Linux and robust adoption across the latest POWER9 based architecture Meanwhile  storage hardware revenues declined on weak performance in both high end and mid range  partially

E mini S P  March 
Yesterday s close  Settled at 2632  down 39 50
Fundamentals  U S  benchmarks made a U turn ahead of the close yesterday and have grinded higher into this morning  The S P 500 was down as much as 2  when White House Chief Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow stopped the bleeding late in the session with positive comments on trade confirming next week s fresh round of talks with China in Washington 
It was reported earlier that the White House rejected China s preliminary offer from Friday to eliminate the trade balance over six years  The idea that the meeting itself was cancelled never gained traction  Although Kudlow provided absolutely nothing new  his upbeat comments reinvigorated the tape  The real boost came from the latest instance of false reporting minutes later  The New York Times essentially reported the imminence of a Senate funding bill being passed  Price action ripped 10 points into the close before it became clearer that the Senate will vote on two separate funding bills tomorrow  one from the Republicans and one from the Democrats  more or less as a formality with little or no hope of being passed  The reaction to headlines late last week and yesterday in both directions goes to show you how fickle this market is 
Earnings yesterday morning weighed on the tape into the afternoon but an initially negative reaction to  IBM   NYSE IBM  after the bell turned positive as the evening unfolded  it is up more than 6  this morning  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA   Procter   Gamble  PG  and United Technologies  NYSE UTX  reported this morning and are up 4   3 5  and 3 3  respectively  The headline flow followed by strong earnings has brought a positive wave of sentiment at the onset of U S hours

173990,395506,IBM,What s Behind The Current Bitcoin Spike  And Will It Last  ,opinion,"Bitcoin  BTC   the most highly valued cryptocurrency by market cap  appears to have finally come back to life  after it collapsed into a swoon that lasted from late 2017 through all of last year  Trading under  4 000 per token just a few weeks ago  Bitcoin has surged  now over  8 000 at the time of writing  And it s pulling other cryptos  including Ethereum  XRP  Bitcoin Cash  EOS and Litecoin along with it 

Investors familiar with this highly volatile digital asset class will likely be aware that this latest spike could be short lived  It might be worth taking a step back to try and figure out what s triggered the move 
China U S  Trade War Driving Prices 
There is some speculation that the escalating trade dispute between China and the U S  is playing a role in driving investors toward BTC  Risk off attitudes toward equities because of this global headwind could have triggered the revival  with yesterday s precipitous global stock decline adding to the Bitcoin momentum 
Lars Seier Christensen  former CEO of Saxo Bank and founder of Concordium  has successfully profited from BTC trading  He notes 

 There does seem to be a correlation between increased Chinese trade tension  and higher Bitcoin prices  Apparently  some Chinese investors move into Bitcoin at times where they re worried about US Chinese trade relations  

He also points out that the share of total investors in the crypto market cap is now nearing the late 2017 highs of 60 percent  But over the long term Christensen remains skeptical of this current Bitcoin move 

 This  spike  seems to indicate that it is more of a knee jerk move into Bitcoin and less of a broad based crypto rally  I have my doubts about how far it can go  I would expect another BTC top before too long  but it is clear that the crypto winter is coming out of deep freeze which can only be a good thing for the whole industry  

Unlike many  however  he doesn t perceive the cryptocurrency as the much touted  Gold 2 0   Barring that status  Christensen adds  Bitcoin does not have a lot going for it except the early mover advantage  which rarely lasts forever 
Bulls and Bears At It Again
Alex Mashinsky  CEO of Celsius Network  takes a different view  He believes all the recent activity is just Bitcoin bulls and bears at it again  He references the skirmish that occurred on April 1 when over  500 million worth of short positions in the cyrptocurrency were wiped out in a few hours as proof 

Since then  many deniers tried to re enter their short positions all the way up to the recent highs of  7 400  believing this is just another blip on the way down to zero  

What we ve been seeing over the past few weeks  says Mashinsky  is a  global surge   indicating that a lot of fresh capital from all over the world has been pouring in because of FOMO  fear of missing out  
Others are attributing the latest spike to the fact that bigger players are now entering positions in the asset class  Alex Frenkel  VP of product at Kin says the continuous investment into crypto by big VCs like Andreessen Horowitz and investment by tech giants such as IBM  NYSE IBM  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  is behind this recent rise 

 This positive trend makes a lot of sense based on the above We believe that in the future we ll have a lot of consolidation in this space and many tokens are going to disappear  but when all the dust clears there will  still  be a few huge that are huge  

Whales Coming Out to Play 
Former Goldman Sachs banker and the founder of London based Wimmer Financial LLP  Per Wimmer  recently warned kitco com 

 The crypto market is dominated mainly by ten big whales or privates  They are massive in the market and take up a lot space and volume so if you take the top 10 or even 50 you will have a lot of the volume covered already  It is too easy to manipulate the market so far  

The term whales is used to describe holders of huge cryptocurrency positions  Nevertheless  Wimmer disagrees with widespread rumors that the large institutional players are entering the space and driving the most popular tokens higher  He points out that rising crypto crime and exchange hackings have put off institutional investors 
Any or indeed all of the above catalysts could be driving the current price action  Whatever the cause  it pays to remember that Bitcoin and its peers have a history of wild whipsaw swings in either direction ",2019-05-14,Tanzeel Akhtar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-bitcoin-finally-coming-back-200421065,200421065

173999,395515,IBM,GDP Comes under Pressure Due to Shutdown,news,"U S benchmarks are pulling back from Friday s rip higher as optimism over U S  China trade deal fades  writes Bill Baruch  President of Blue Line Futures 
E mini S P  March 
Last week s close  Settled at 2671 50  up 36 25 on Friday and up 76 50 on the week
Fundamentals  U S benchmarks are pulling back from Friday s rip higher  Positive tailwinds on trade have dissipated a bit  the IMF warns of slower growth  fourth quarter earnings kick into high gear this week  the government shutdown remains at a stalemate and the Brexit brings a world of questions  Last week  it was reported that the U S was weighing lifting tariffs on China  Although these reports were almost immediately denied  it began a strong move higher  On Friday  China came to the table with a plan to eliminate the lopsided trade balance over six years  This boosted the S P 500 to the highest level in over a month  These reports are certainly going to have an upbeat impact on the market  but the fact remains  there is no substance  Is the U S going to allow China six years to close the gap  Furthermore  this doesn t address key issues such as copyright infringement  The impact this news had was exacerbated by the simple fact of repositioning  which we have spoken of for two weeks  those trapped shorts from 2550 and lower are now squeezed out and under positioned portfolio managers have chased higher  Overall  this jawboning was expected ahead of next week s trade talks  but it was also able to hit a pressure point for this market 
Although global equity markets are in recovery mode since the Christmas lows  it doesn t change the facts  growth is slowing  On Sunday  China s growth figures were the slowest in nearly three decades  The IMF used this opportunity to lower their global growth forecast for 2019 from 3 7  to 3 5  citing trade tensions and rising interest rates  The World Economic Forum in Davos has kicked off and we are likely to hear more on this topic as the week unfolds 
Today is day 32 of the U S government shutdown and the White House said every week that this goes on decreases GDP by 0 1   Furthermore  the economic calendar is sliming which makes it harder to understand where U S growth is and next week s Q4 GDP report is all but postponed  Durable Goods data is the latest casualty  however  we do get Existing Home Sales at 9 00 am CT  This sheds additional light on an already pivotal earnings season  Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  are both down about 1 5  after reporting this morning and  IBM   NYSE IBM  leads after the bell 
Lastly  a world of questions surrounding Brexit will not help the risk appetite  U K Prime Minister May is trying to find support for her Plan B after a historical defeat last week while the opposition party is pushing for a second referendum on leaving the EU  A hard Brexit in March would certainly be detrimental to global markets but going back to the polls could easily have the same effect 
Technicals  On Friday  we neutralized our bias in a wait and see mode given the news flow and short squeeze but did not deter from our exhausted rhetoric  With the market extended on Friday  we began reintroducing our bearish bias at the trade desk as it neared our rare major four star resistance  Repositioning has brought a vicious tailwind  one that we feared as price action extended above 2600  However  we still see the upside extremely limited in the near and intermediate term  Today  minor support comes in at 2643 75 2646 75  Below there is major three star support at 2632 2635 25  this aligns multiple key technical indicators including the gap close from Thursday and we expect this level to get tested over the next 24 hours

Crude Oil  March 
Last week s close  Settled at  54 04  up  1 68 on Friday and up  2 13 on the week
Fundamentals  Crude oil is a dollar from Friday s settlement with the February contract falling off the board today  China s GDP figures on Sunday were in line with expectations but still at nearly 30 year lows  The IMF responded by giving a stark reminder growth is slowing  they lowered their 2019 and 2020 forecasts  We have also seen tailwinds for risk sentiment dissipate a bit in this new week  Monday s holiday pushes out inventory data with API after the bell tomorrow and the official EIA data Thursday  These numbers will come at a pivotal time as price action has run into a wall of resistance and the jawboning from both OPEC and on the U S China trade front begin to dissipate  We maintain that crude oil cannot breakout above  55  but will hold  50 without seeing a change in the inventory trend 
Technicals  Price action is developing a sharp reversal on this extended hours holiday session  First key support comes in at  52 81  53 03  this is a strong level  however  too high in order to be a major three star support  Below here  second key support aligns with Friday s low and a move through here would secure an outside bearish pattern  We have introduced a bearish bias and only a close back above  54 04 will negate this potential rollover 
Bias  Bearish Neutral
Resistance  54 04    54 55 54 98    55 51 55 55

Gold  February 
Last week s close  Settled at  1 282 6  down  9 70 on Friday and down  6 90 on the week
Fundamentals  Gold traded lower through the holiday trading hours Monday and is attempting to stabilize this morning  The U S Dollar Index remains elevated which is weighing on gold  but the metals weakness comes more so from the Chinese yuan which has lost ground for four straight sessions tallying about 0 5   This does not fundamentally change our narrative  we remain unequivocally Bullish Gold 
Technicals  We have pounded the table on capitalizing on recent strength in order to welcome potential weakness  That weakness is beginning to arrive  and price action is battling at first key support at  1 278 1  1 282 3  Traders must prepare to buy into major three star support at  1 260 8  1 263 8  Our momentum indicator today comes in at  1 279 7 and it is favorable that price action is above here  however  only a close out above  1 289 6  1 292 3 is bullish in the near term

Underscoring that push  IBM in October agreed to buy Red Hat  a deal expected to close in the second half of the year 
The company is also shedding some of its legacy business as part of the shift  The company said in December it would sell some of its software products business to India s HCL Technologies for  1 80 billion 
IBM said its cloud business  part of what it refers to as  strategic imperatives   grew 12 percent to  19 2 billion in 2018

Chart courtesy of Stewart Solaka  Chicagostock    ES F 2nd close   3D pivot since b o  on March 28  Thursday s range above   overhead resistance for sellers to defend buyers to overcome  Failure to do so leaves buyers trapped for sellers to tgts sell stops  2885 last Thurs low to reverse b o  Close above needed to recover 
There is a tug of war going on right now  Do you know what it is  Its call taking some profits  The big ETF s have been getting out of Dow  S P and Russell stocks  and buying the Nasdaq  tech stocks   So far the overall markets have been holding  but late Tuesday before IBM  NYSE IBM  reported  the  ES sold off a quick 10 handles  and yesterday the futures traded below the  2900 00 big figure   down to 2898 50   
Let s face it  the ES has rallied over 600 handles  or 16   off its December low  Over the last few days there has been a lot of talk about filling the upside gap set on 10 04 18 at 2924 00  and it fell two ticks shy yesterday   
If you are registered as a premium user of the Opening Print  you know that yesterday I talked about the ES being overbought  and how the bullish sentiment is at an extreme high  I also talked about CNN s  fear and greed  index trading 70   and the PitBull saying   if the ES doesnt make a new high it could be a problem   I went on to say that our overall lean was to continue to buy weakness  but to be more cautious 
The ES has to get above 2924 and hold to run the buy stops up to 2938 2940  On the other side  a close under 2908 2906 could be a short term bearish signal  As I have always said  I am not an economist or an analyst  I m just a street guy who thinks the markets could be setting up for a pullback  As the PitBull always says   no gaps go unfilled  in the ES   
During Tuesday nights Globex session  the S P 500 futures  ESM19 CME  printed a high of 2923 25  a low of 2908 75  and opened Wednesday s regular trading hours at 2923 00 
As has been the pattern of late  the ES rallied on Globex  then sold off after the 8 30 CT open  The first leg down saw a low print of 2904 50  which was Tuesday s low  followed by a pullback up to 2912 00  and then a second leg down to 2900 75  which would remain the low for the rest of the morning 
Heading into the afternoon  the futures had again retraced a little  this time topping out at 2908 50  and then turned back lower to test the low  By 1 30 the ES had printed a new low at 2898 50  and that would remain the low for the rest of the session 
Going into the close  the futures had been pretty much trading sideways for the majority of the day  and when the 2 45 cash imbalance reveal came out showing  368M to sell  the ES was trading at 2906 25  From there  it would go on to print 2903 50 on the 3 00 cash close  and end the day at 2900 50 on the 3 15 futures close 
In the end  the overall tone was one of a weak ES  and a firm NQ  In terms of the days overall trade  total volume was higher  with nearly 1 4 million futures contracts traded

174037,395553,IBM,IBM  IBM  Q1 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"IBM  IBM  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 25 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 21 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 45 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 81   A quarter ago  it was expected that this technology and consulting company would post earnings of  4 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 87  delivering a surprise of 1 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
IBM  which belongs to the Zacks Computer   Integrated Systems industry  posted revenues of  18 18 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 89   This compares to year ago revenues of  19 07 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
IBM shares have added about 26 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 9  
What s Next for IBM 
While IBM has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for IBM was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

 we ve heard this dream many times from different people  However if you start digging into it  you realize that it may look great on paper  but in reality  to make use of it  it s really hard

Hinrikus at TransferWise raises a point about the Ripple Network  a startup that uses blockchain technology to facilitate cross border payments between banks in an almost instantaneous fashion 

 If every bank in the world was going through the Ripple network  it would be amazing  Yet how many banks are using Ripple today in production  It s a very short list

174095,395611,IBM,Blockchain Battles On DApps Are Underway  Who Will Win ,opinion,"The elemental idea of Blockchain technology  cryptography hash functions and public key cryptography  have been around since the 1970s but it took the arrival of Bitcoin in 2009 to show a glimpse of its true socioeconomic potential  The arrival of Bitcoin after the global financial crises triggered frank discussions about the role of governments and corporations as middlemen in economic activities 
Blockchain technology provides decentralized trust in many practical use cases beyond financial transactions  Ethereum heralded smart contracts which are essentially self executing contracts that eliminates the need for intermediaries 
However  Ethereum is struggling with scaling challenges and now  there are many different Blockchains facilitating the development of DApps  This piece examines how Ethereum and its biggest competitors are faring in the grand war to bring Blockchain technology to the mass market 
Snapshot report on how different Blockchains are faring
Ethereum Facing Downward Pressure
Ethereum  the second largest Blockchain project by market cap is valued around  14 95B and it trades around  141  Over the last one year  Ethereum has suffered a depressing price action that saw it plummeting from a  1400 high to a  90 low  Beyond the fact that the general cryptocurrency market is in a downtrend  Ethereum has been unable to maintain positive market sentiments as seen the chart below 

The trading price of Bitcoin has declined by 39 99  in the last one year but the trading price of Ethereum has recorded almost 2X more losses with a decline of 63 81   At the heart of Ethereum s problem is its persistent scalability challenge  The Ethereum Network has proposed different solutions such as Proof of State  Sharding  and Layer2  yet  none of them looks to be the  perfect  solution that would restore positive market sentiments 
However  SKALE Labs Inc seem to have found a way to help Ethereum overcome its scalability challenged  The team launched the SKALE DevNet earlier this year and the launch of its Mainnet is projected to happen sometime in Q3 2019  Using SKALE  developers can launch applications on sidechains without necessarily relying on the main chain for validations 
SKALE is essentially a Layer 2 Blockchain scalability network that provides Ethereum DApps with a platform to run low cost smart contracts at fast speeds  As expected  SKALE is a decentralized open source project  it is secured with a Byzantine fault tolerant system and Ethereum DApps can run in layer 2 at 1000x speeds 
EOS Is Gaining Market Share
EOS is considered the Ethereum killer  and with good reason  The brains behind EOS have intelligently sidestepped some of the pitfalls that are limiting Ethereum  For instance  EOS uses a Delegated Proof of Stake that makes it somewhat  centralized  but free from consensus bottlenecks  EOS allows up to 100 000 tx s and it doesn t require developers to learn new programming languages 

In the chart above  EOS has recorded a slightly lower price fall relative to Bitcoin  More so  the percentage decline in Ethereum twice as much as the percentage decline in EOS within the same period  EOS is rapidly stealing market share from Ethereum and innovative solutions such as LiquidApps might eventually help EOS get a lead over Ethereum  LiquidApps is designed to fix the problems with the scarcity of RAM and CPU on EOS 
EOS is attractive in the development of DApps for the mass market because it offers zero tx costs and it doesn t have a scalability challenge  However  developers can t run their DApps unless they own and use RAM on the Blockchain  The cost of RAM on EOS Blockchain has been rising steadily in the last couple of months  hence  developers are not quite enthusiastic about launching their DApps on the platform 
LiquidApps provides a win win situation for all stakeholders by introducing a vRAM system as an alternative storage solution for EOS developers  Its DApp Network and it DApp Service Providers also provides a network effect on the EOS mainnet to provide developers with access extra storage capacity  secure communication services  and other critical utilities that could make the development of dApps substantially easier and more affordable 
Stellar Is The Distant Cousin No One Talks About
Stellar says it s on a mission to deliver a blockchain powered platform for moving money across borders cheaply  Critics opine that it is a knockoff of Ripple except that it has s  3M funding from Stripe to bankroll its operations  Some people don t like that fact that Stellar Lumens can t be mined  there is some disquiet about the transparency of its undistributed supply  and its Ripple style consensus is not entirely reassuring 

The chart above shows the performance of Stellar Lumens in the last one year  Stellar is down 42 88  to record bigger losses than Bitcoin and a slightly lower loss than Ethereum  Nonetheless  its trading price around  0 107 suggests that it might still enjoy a speedy rally when the crypto market returns to bullish ways 
However  Stellar is quietly making progress and it appears to be the top DApps Blockchain that doesn t  seem to have a scalability problem  Last year  IBM  NYSE IBM  regarded Stellar as a  wonderful  scalable  publicly accessible digital asset registry   Last month IBM launched IBM Blockchain World Wire to accelerate cross border foreign exchange payments and remittances though Stellar 
Neo Seems To Be On The Fast Track To Obscurity
If you had bought NEO at any point in the last one year  the odds are that you ve taken your losses in good stride or hoping that the platform will deliver an incredible turnaround  From the onset  Neo positioned itself as a blockchain platform for automating the digital managements of assets through smart contracts  Neo was probably the most vocal evangelist of the Smart Economy focused on Digital Assets  Digital Identity  and Smart Contracts 

However  in the last one year  NEO has fared the worst out of the major blockchain platforms trying to bring DApps to the mass market  As seen in the chart above  NEO s trading price has declined by more than 80     a significantly larger loss than the decline in the price of Bitcoin 
On the technical development side  NEO currently lay claim to have 1000tps and it says it is on track to deliver 100kps by 2020 
Trinity  NEO s equivalent of the Lightning network made its debit with the promise of real time settlement  privacy protection  scalability and low transaction fees  The off chain scalability offered by Trinity could potentially facilitate the development of DApps on NEO over the long term 
Final Words On The Blockchain Battles
Ethereum unveiled the incredible potential of DApps but until is finds a definitive way to fix its scalability challenges  it probably won t be able to usher Blockchain technology into the era of mass market acceptability  Yet  it would be interesting to see how far SKALE can go to help Ethereum unlock scalability 
EOS seem to be strategically positioned to facilitate the mainstream adoption of DApps  and developments such as LiquidApps might help it strength its lead  Nonetheless  news about a recent Bithumb hack in which  13M worth of EOS was stolen could exert short term downward pressure on EOS 
For Stellar  the future is uncertain  but it is somewhat too early to give up on its future potential especially because it seems to have found a niche in financial services  The fact that Stellar is focusing on facilitating the adoption of Blockchain in developing economies suggests that it might enjoy a niche advantage in frontier markets ",2019-04-04,Nikolai Kuznetsov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-blockchain-battles-on-dapps-are-underway-who-will-win-the-war-200403786,200403786
174096,395612,IBM,Cryptocurrency Gaining Steam And Disrupting Different Industries,opinion,"Blockchain technology and its cryptocurrencies digital coins are having a transformational effect  For example  Columbia University is hosting an International IBM sponsored Blockchain Summit  In addition  Turbo Tax has just partnered with a CryptoTrader  so cryptocurrencies are gaining attention and interest from different sectors of the industry  Streamex is a newcomer onto the scene and gaining international appeal from traders from across the globe 
 As governments around the world lay the foundation for regulation  exchanges should be prepared for a mass influx of users with diverse demands  
The attractiveness of the Streamex platform is its cross platform trading  This means that the service can serve web based trading clients  Android native clients  iOS native clients  Therefore  the cryptocurrency space is diversifying as far as offering a compatibility based platform for all 
To create an international and cultural force  Streamex has assembled an diverse community  In other words  the platform houses traders from around the world and the crypto based site supports the following languages  Chinese  Japanese  French  Russian  German  Arabi  Korean  Spanish  English  and Portuguese 
According to Investopedia  cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that utilizes cryptography to protect information  One of the hallmarks of cryptocurrency based services is that they are not centralized  Meaning  that they are not run or administrated by a central authority  Coincidentally  the platforms are theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation 
 The first blockchain based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin  which still remains the most popular and most valuable  Today  there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions or specifications  
From inception of Bitcoin  other platforms have come to try and replicate the success of this digital currency or digital wallet  Transactions that take place on this platform are carried out as Streamex digital coin  STE   It so happens that the digital currency runs natively on the Ethereum blockchain with an ERC of 20 coins  There is a cap or a limit on the number of STE units of coins that can be created 
One of the ways to know if cryptocurrency is here to stay is to examine what is happening within this growing community  and industry  As mentioned at the beginning of this text  cryptocurrency is not an afterthought  It is ushering a new wave of startups and it is becoming a disruptive force with segments of the market  To know the state of affairs  looking at the performance of Bitcoin is a great indicator for those potentially interested in investing in this growing movement 
 However  overall cryptocurrency market trading volume spiked back toward  27 billion on Saturday  enabling the bitcoin price to launch as high as  4 137 on Bitstamp before settling back down to a present value of  4 090  Other top tangible resources saw comparable gains  enabling the cryptocurrency market cap to climb above  139 billion   as reported by CCN 
The platform has gone a step further and provided reliable protections for user informatio  It has also implemented rigorous protocols and a robust infrastructure to offer reliability  One of the difficulties and vulnerabilities of these innovative platforms is that they can be susceptible to hacks  Nevertheless  Streamex has assembled a product that has learned from mistakes made on other cryptocurrency platforms

174097,395613,IBM,Earnings Preview  IBM  IBM  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when IBM  IBM  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 16  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This technology and consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 22 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 4  
Revenues are expected to be  18 65 billion  down 2 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for IBM 
For IBM  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that IBM will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that IBM would post earnings of  4 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 87  delivering a surprise of  1 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
IBM doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-ibm-ibm-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200405143,200405143

174119,395635,IBM,IBM Surprises  Chooses Stellar Platform For New Payment Transfer Service,opinion,"What s perhaps most surprising  and possibly even somewhat cutting edge about International Business Machines   NYSE IBM  recently launched Blockchain World Wire payment transfer service isn t who the provider is  nor that the solution is blockchain based  Rather it s the open source platform on which it s built Stellar Lumens  the ninth most popular cryptocurrency by market cap 
Jesse Lund  head of IBM s blockchain division praises the payments and settlement network saying it cements the tech giant s leadership in the blockchain technology space  He characterizes the development of World Wire  which is now being used by six international banks including Philippines based RCBC  South Korea s Bank Busan and Brazil s Banco Bradesco as 

 We re building on a new idea  which is to be able to store monetary value electronically and be able to move that value around the world in real time  I think the problem with cross border payments today  the inefficiencies are based on the fact that the way that banks communicate  the network that banks communicate on is separate from the network or the rails that money actually moves on 

Many would argue it s already possible to store monetary value electronically and move it around in real time  Banks are already virtual although the funds stored are not yet fully digital  Which means IBM may not really be doing anything groundbreaking here 
That is  unless you consider Big Blue s use of Stellar  Until now  larger rival XRP  formerly known as Ripple  had been the banking industry choice  That s because  according to its developers   it enables secure  instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks   But  says Viabhav Kadikar  CEO of CloseCross  a decentralized market prediction platform  Steller is the preferred chain for micropayments  as it s relatively inexpensive 

 IBM has made an operational decision in choosing them  Stellar  as a network to build on  A considerable difference to the current virtual offering by banks is that the proposed flow of funds through World Wire will not require after the fact  cross border reconciliations to be carried out  This process normally involves a number of banks and even federal banks  so with World Wire they are proposing an overall increase in efficiency and transparency  

The way IBM portrays it  they re building a new backbone for banks  using blockchain  explains Alex Frenkel  VP of product at Kin Ecosystem  He stresses that blockchain technology is slower and harder to maintain than a conventional database  Its main virtue is in the direct exchange of value between people around the world 
 I m not sure this is the most efficient way to improve the banking backbone   he adds   The real revolution with blockchain and crypto is removing the need to use banks for sending value across the world  In this vision  banks will have a completely different role in the financial world and will not deal with controlling and validating value exchanges between people  
Breaking Banks Out of Their Comfort Zone
Many banks  however  are still operating within their comfort zone  Kadikar points out 

 But partnering with a tech giant like IBM will  make them  feel more confident trialing new technology 
Large banks and corporates need to be in their comfort zone when they attempt to trial or utilize new tech  They need a partner that is solid  large and reliable based on previous experiences as well as something their regulators will accept  

To that end  the launch of IBM s World Wire is a good thing for the overall blockchain landscape  especially for the payments industry where the back end functions can develop at scale in a blockchain environment without any user experience friction 
There is also a case to be made that transaction times and fees will drop with this latest launch  Gadi Srebnik  blockchain team lead at Kin Blockchain  which is a fork of Stellar Blockchain  believes that has serious benefits for the end consumer   Clients will gain as work and costs are reduced on the banking side   he says 
Perhaps more important than the workflow and settlement efficiencies  IBM is setting the technology standard that all banks will need to meet going forward  Jehan Chu  co founder of Social Alpha Foundation and managing partner of Kenetic points out 

 As banks compete even harder  the near instant global settlement across their network will eventually become the new norm  IBM is signalling where the future of finance lies  and it s built on blockchain  Banks are moving from the electronic age to the digital age  with blockchain as it s connective tissue  ",2019-04-02,Tanzeel Akhtar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibm-and-world-wire-200401714,200401714

174142,395658,IBM,IMB Partners With Stellar And Shares Rise,opinion,"They promised a splash and they delivered  The partnership between IBM and Stellar has taken their first step into the world of international bank settlements by onboarding six international banks as their first clients 
These banks will now have instant access to send payments across the stellar blockchain  either by using a stable coin or when appropriate using Lumens  XLM tokens  at a fraction the cost and exponentially faster than when using the current industry standard SWIFT system 
Lumens tokens rose more than 11  on the news before paring back this morning  In my mind though  this news is almost as big for  IBM as it is for  XLM  The computing giant taking its first significant steps into the massive market that is global settlements is indeed noteworthy 
Noteworthy  but perhaps not surprising given IBM is the top blockchain patent holder in the United States 

The apparent success of the partnership with Stellar and XLM is perhaps a promising omen for IBM s future in the space 
IBM s shares did rise slightly yesterday and are now testing their highest level of the year  Of course  what many of our clients will want to know is  how does this affect Ripple 
Well  on the face of it  this would seem like good news  Ripple Labs is far ahead of Stellar in the number of banking partnerships they have and though having a competitor that s teamed up with IBM may seem scary  in this nascent industry having healthy competition is probably a good thing

European financial media can t seem to get enough of the upcoming shakeup in the banking make up  It seems that the two largest German banks are about to get hitched  with the authorities set to flag it through 
In an email from Bloomberg this morning  writer John Authers rips into a recent research paper that was published by Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   which is one of the parties involved in the impending merger 

As Authers writes  this kind of action would take the concept of too big to fail to an entirely new level that he calls  too big to rescue   It would be good for the bankers  other than those who will lose their jobs of course  and would be bad for savers  who currently enjoy the competition  In short  the proposed merger could load some serious risks into the German banking system

One of those signs is bitcoin s 200 Day moving average  which is something we ve been talking about here for a few months now  Fundstrat s Tom Lee has now also placed high importance on this indicator 
Yesterday s Altseason winner was Stellar Lumens  very likely connected with the announcement above  followed closely by Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin

174143,395659,IBM,Is The Crypto Winter Coming To An End ,opinion,"Questions are being asked constantly when it comes to Bitcoin s battle with the  4000 mark  The result of this battle sets the tone for a bullish or bearish trend  Since December 14  2018  there have been several battles between bulls and bears at the price level of  4K  In each of this battle  bulls have lost the war because  after the first attack at the  4K level  the bears have been able to gain enough strength to push the price back below this critical mark  It is in this essence  that this level has become a matter of death or life for crypto traders 
If you are a long term investor  you will not really worry about these short term levels  The element of risk premium is of critical importance here and I find this immensely interesting  For simplicity s sake  consider this as a premium that one is willing to pay over the previous low which would have been a better entry price  For instance  the price of Bitcoin at the time of writing this article is trading at 3962 and the recent meaningful low was formed on March 4 when the price touched the price level of  3671  The difference between the two is your risk premium  We all know that it is extremely arduous to catch the extreme low  It is all about making an intelligent choice and buying when the price is still close enough to its bottom  For investors who are buying at these levels  they usually have a target of previous high  and for Bitcoin  it needs to be the level of 20K 
This is because there is a high chance that the next bull run has a minimum potential of pushing the price 5 times higher  That is over  100K  I personally believe that each Bitcoin can go up as much as  400K and if history repeats itself  this number is not a fool s paradise  This is a simple math calculation  approximate percentage projection of the price which we experienced during the last bull run 
Why am I saying that crypto winter is coming to an end 
Well  before I go and talk about fundamentals  the below chart shows the percentage drop for the Bitcoin price after its major rallies  Back in 2011  the price plunged nearly 93 percent and in 2014  it dropped 84 percent  As for the most recent price crash  we have experienced the smallest price crash  79 percent from its recent high  The most important part is that the price has started to rally back up  This argument becomes even more clear when we look at the bottom panel of this chart  The drawdown percentage curve is much higher now  shown in green circle  as compared to what happened back in 2011  shown in red circle  

Similarly  if we look at the monthly gains of Bitcoin and plot this on a chart  as I have done this in the chart below   it becomes clear that Bitcoin has broken its longest streak of monthly losses  This is the strongest signal for the bulls that crypto winter is no longer as cold as it was back in December or November 

Another major bull signal comes from the weekly chart as I discussed before  the 200 week moving average  shown in green  has saved the day for the bulls  The 50 week moving average  shown in pink  is moving fast towards the price to close the distance between them  Now  if the price kisses the 50 week moving average goodbye and moves above it at that stage  all bets would be in favour of the bulls  Looking at the chart  when the price breaks above the 50 week moving average  it sends the strongest bull signal and so far it has worked really well  But this is something that we would have to wait and see  It may take a couple of months for this to happen 

As for the fundamental aspect  there is absolutely no shortage of positive news  We are seeing more actual use cases of blockchain technology now than ever before  For instance  TreeCoin is one of the strongest projects out of Switzerland which is using an asset class that has performed extremely well  The project is going to tokenize timber  and this would improve the liquidity and most importantly save the environment with their German technology of reforestation trees  The action is not only limited to start ups  but more and more major firms are jumping in this space  The battle to own the custody space has become even more intense with IBM  NYSE IBM  also stepping into this space ",2019-03-19,Naeem Aslam,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-crypto-winter-coming-to-an-end-200398962,200398962

174177,395693,IBM,Tech Trends Of The Next 5 Years,opinion,"Technological progress is making giant strides  and it is fairly easy to predict that  in the coming decades  a person s daily life will change dramatically  The most successful companies will be those that introduce artificial intelligence  big data  blockchain and other technologies  combining them with a highly people centric focus 
Blockchain  AR And The Quantum Leap Forward
In the coming years  every company will have to master new technologies to make a meaningful breakthrough to the next level  Among these technologies is blockchain  a sensation two years ago  which will simplify the exchange of data between companies  No less important is rapidly developing artificial intelligence  which allows for the optimization of countless processes 
Perhaps less obvious  but no less important  is Augmented Reality technology  encompassing both AR and VR   It is not so much about the possibility of a person being able to enter other worlds as it is about solving banal tasks  for example  repairing a car with the help of visual instructions 
Finally  quantum computing is the only technology listed here that no company has yet had time to adopt  It is not yet assured that quantum technologies will be introduced in the next 5 years  but they are developing rapidly enough that it should not be ruled out 
In fact  companies today simply cannot ignore this trend  Some say that  when quantum computing becomes a reality  it will be possible to figure out any password within an hour  In fact  this technology will facilitate the collection and processing huge amounts of data  which can be used to solve any number of global problems  such as the search for a cancer vaccine 
Biotechnologies And Medical Startups
The development of medical IT start ups is now gaining momentum  The introduction of machine learning  big data  blockchain and other technologies can significantly accelerate the development and introduction of new drugs and treatment methods 
In addition  medical giants such as Merck  NYSE MRK   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and Sanofi  PA SASY  ADR  NASDAQ SNY  accelerating the development process significantly by buying or funding start ups  For example  small companies produced 63  of all medicines introduced on the US market in 2017 
Examples Of Medical Startups Include 
Israeli medical startup Vessi Medical Ltd  states that it is on the path to patenting a medical device that can freeze tumors and treat superficial bladder cancer more effectively 
Hayat platform  from Zynecoin Business Incubator  which is designed to decentralize medical data storage and improve the interaction between patients and health care providers 
Healthy io and Samsung  KS 005930  have developed a medical startup together offering a special TV screen via which users can take a urine test and find out the results without leaving home 
Aetna  NYSE AET   Anthem  NYSE ANTM   Health Care Service Corporation  PNC Bank and IBM  NYSE IBM  announced their joint intention to create a blockchain based system in the healthcare sector  The creation of an inclusive blockchain network will allow medical companies to develop  share and improve ideas that promote the digital transformation of the industry 
The Digital Footprint And Smart Marketing
In 2019  companies will collect more and more data about consumers  and will take advantage of their digital footprints  Businesses will begin to collect large databases of their customers  preferences  which will allow them to diversify and expand their sales and delivery offerings 
Today there are already a number of companies that are ahead of their time  having achieved significant success thanks to the analysis of customers  digital footprints  The Indian loan platform SlicePay has learned how to use technology to track human behavior  it receives data on how often clients go to a restaurant  what they buy on the Internet  and what photos they post on social networks  This information creates client profiles that replace standard credit histories  These profiles can make the difference as to whether a person has issued a loan or not 
The volume of accumulated consumer data will be constantly growing  In the future  this information will significantly expand the range of products and services offered by companies  Digital footprints are paving the way today for the emergence of both smart insurance  which allows you to calculate the cost of auto insurance depending on the client s driving style  and smart marketing  when a customer who buys something is automatically sent a selection of accessories that can be worn with it  such as hats or pair of shoes which go well with a dress 
A Man Is Smarter Than A Company
People in the post digital era will learn to rapidly acquire new knowledge and expand their skill sets  They will change jobs more often  choosing more technologically advanced companies  Meanwhile  some companies will not manage to introduce new technologies with enough time for their employees to master them  There is a gap forming between the capabilities of people and the level of development of companies  this gap does not favor the latter 
In 2019  some companies will have to adjust their personnel training strategies and help their employees develop the necessary skills for the future  As such  PayPal today offers its employees the opportunity to receive training via self managed video  Employees select and view the videos themselves  and PayPal collects information about which topics are of the most interest to them  Therefore  it s not the employees adapting to the company  but the company to the employees  as it tries to meet the expectations of its personnel 
Hackers A Thing Of The Past 
The growing interconnection of different companies increases their vulnerability  and therefore the importance of addressing security issues is increasing  Today  most companies attempt to defend themselves against cyber threats themselves  but in the future they will have to create collaborative alliances to fight hackers 
In October of 2018  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   Mastercard  NYSE MA  and Fidelity conducted joint cyber security exercises  The result of the experiment was that IT managers discovered that they each respond to threats in different ways  In the post digital era  to combat hackers  it is necessary to create models for managing cyber risks that go beyond simply the company itself  they need to be developed at the level of the entire ecosystem  Companies will have to create whole alliances to fight hackers  as the threats posed by them will become increasingly global in nature 
The Hunt For Clients
Companies in 2019 will have more opportunities to study their customers  Business will have access to more data that can be used to study the market and attract customers 
Today  the Indian brand Paper Boat requests customer feedback via WhatsApp  and then uses the data to make adjustments to the products it produces  The company even considers fleeting requests  During the holidays  small special deliveries of specific seasonal drinks are delivered to the market at the request of customers  Scan   Go has created an application that allows customers to scan products on store shelves and check their quality  In the future  the company wants to introduce iBeacon technology for navigation inside large stores 
The technology of digital doubles  which allows for the creation of digital models of objects  has a great future  The Port of Rotterdam plans to launch the  digital twin port  project by 2025  This will allow operators to receive real time information about each vessel ",2019-03-14,Andrey Sergeenkov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-tech-trends-of-the-next-5-years-200397587,200397587

174215,395731,IBM, MKR  Maker Price Prediction 2019 2020 5 Years,opinion," MKR  Maker Price Prediction   Forecast  Updated 4 March 2019 
Thinking of investing in MKR in March 2019  Here is our honest price prediction and forecast 
The Maker  MKR  token has prevailed throughout the crypto bear market of 2018   even seeing positive growth in Q1 2019  MKR s strong performance is possibly due to a well designed platform which combines the solidity of a stablecoin with the flexibility of digital currencies  Additionally  the Maker network has been actively accruing strategic crypto partnerships  These partnerships have served to strengthen the viability of its stablecoin  MKR is currently in an upward trajectory  which began in early February 2019 and continues  MKR did see a sharp sell off recently due  in large part  to the latest Bitcoin  BTC  price dump 
Utility token Maker  MKR  is a decentralized autonomous organization  DAO  that operates on the Ethereum blockchain 
The MKR token is a stablecoin digital currency used for voting and influencing on the DAI network  DAI is a stablecoin pegged to the USD 
The goal of the Maker network is to create a highly decentralized  community governed  and asset pegged currency  A token of this nature holds the capability of withstanding extreme market volatility and would remain a legitimate unit of value within a variety of circumstances 
MKR has been a strong value option since its inception  The token even overtook Ethereum  ETH  in February 2018  The price  at that time  nearly reached  1 700   with a market cap just over  1 billion 
The last year has been marked by relative stability for MKR in comparison to the extreme bear market of the Crypto Winter  The coin dipped as low as  325 near the end of November 2018 but has begun to recover substantially  February 2019 has seen 37 percent gains so far  with the price sitting around  665 in spite of the recent dip  The MKR token has held strong in the market and is currently ranked 16th in market capitalization 

Fundamental Analysis
As MKR is the utility token behind the DAI stablecoin  its fundamentals revolve around a stablecoin concept  However  MKR isn t plagued by the same controversy which has hobbled the growth of many stablecoins  Because of its second layer governance platform  the coin is removed from the direct trades that create such confusion 
The Maker platform has developed a smart contract based collateralization system  This system operates on the margin trading principle so that MKR minimizes volatility for its parent network s stablecoin token  DAI  Powered by smart contracts  the supply mechanics of the Maker token decrease volatility for DAI 
Using the MKR token and a complex smart contract system  Maker maintains the value of the adjacent DAI at around  1 USD  In other words  MKR bears the brunt of all the volatility of the crypto market  allowing DAI to retain a value more closely aligned with the mainstream market 
This is a unique  but functional  system   culminating in a cryptocurrency that is both decentralized and an excellent value proposition for use in everyday life and margin trading of the DAI token 

Technical Analysis
The MKR token is created or destroyed based on the price fluctuation of the stablecoin it backs  the DAI token  which is soft pegged to the U S  dollar  Therefore  its value is closely associated with DAI  as well as the Ethereum platform on which it was created 
From its 2017 inception  MKR has performed well compared to other coins  The token makes up nearly two percent of the total market supply of Ethereum  ETH  
At its height in January 2018  MKR approached  1700 USD  When the market began to correct  MKR dropped back down under  900  The remainder of 2018 brought massive fluctuation throughout cryptocurrency  MKR was not immune to this volatility  The token ranged between  325 USD and  1100 USD 
2019 has brought new upward mobility to MKR  It has seen substantial growth  starting the year at  483 and rising as high as  766 in recent weeks  Nevertheless  the coin has seen recent price declines back near  650   in line with the dump in the price of Bitcoin  BTC  
The coin was likely overbought at the higher levels in February  as the market sentiment has become more bullish  The subsequent decline is more reflective of the true value of MKR and provides new stability at that level 

Specialists  Perspective
Popular opinion throughout the market on MKR is resoundingly positive  Blockchain experts and stablecoin proponents alike tout the decentralized nature of the platform  Coupled with the low volatility potential MKR offers its native stablecoin  DAI  these create tremendous benefits from both a utility and an investment perspective 
Investors see great potential in the ability of MKR to help DAI overtake Tether  USDT   the leading stablecoin currently pegged to the U S  Dollar  This is due to the fact that DAI is decentralized as a result of MKR being a first level utility token 
As the utility token of the DAI platform  MKR is also used to pay fees and perform other operational tasks  like community management  In this current climate of blockchain focused projects  the Maker platform offers a strong value proposition for long term investors 
An increased focus on digital assets also bodes well for MKR  As institutional investors and top technology firms alike begin considering distributed ledger technology  MKR s stability will likely bring investors to the table 
However  not all specialists  price predictions are good for the MKR token  For example  perpetually conservative WalletInvestor com predicts a 77 percent drop in the MKR token in coming months 
DIgitalcoin com predicts a similar  yet equally low  short term price for MKR  However  the site does identify MKR as an excellent long term investment   forecasting prices over  1500 USD 
Even TradingBeasts  a site that seems almost impossibly bullish at times  sees continued short term lows for MKR 

Maker Price Prediction 2019
2019 has been unofficially named the year of the blockchain  As such  MKR is optimally positioned not only to survive but to thrive in the future  Its fractional reserve approach to stabilization is both unique and highly functional 
Due to the ongoing need for price stabilization in the crypto market and the potential MKR offers in that regard  Maker could do very well this year  In fact  market stabilization coupled with a strong blockchain foundation could push MKR to substantial growth by the end of the year  Nevertheless  the coin may also remain mired in the current market   remaining relatively stable in price throughout the year 
With these competing issues in play  a prediction is difficult  However  it seems best to understand the competing market forces as a cause of stability for the token  For that reason  we at BeInCrypto see 2019 as a year of stability  where MKR will continue growing support for its platform   with prices remaining relatively stable around  650 
That being said  a returning bear market  ongoing price fluctuations  and even a failure of the Maker platform to deliver its targeted functionality could see MKR plummet  A perfect storm of factors could send it as low as  200 or below 
Maker Price Prediction 2020
By 2020  experts hope the price of MKR will have stabilized and begun rising to a higher price point   potentially as high as  1000  This will primarily be a function of the market  led by Bitcoin  BTC  and Ethereum  ETH   both of which are struggling to find long term bullish support 
However  should stability return to the cryptocurrency market  2020 could bring increases in price   or  at least  maintain stability  Where MKR lands in 2020 is largely dependent upon events in 2019  If the token remains stable at or around  650  it is likely to find good traction moving in 2020  This would drive increased growth  leading to substantially bullish movement over  1000 
However  if prices return to previous lows in the  200  350 range  for example  investors may not see much growth beyond that for 2020  In this way  the overall cryptocurrency market will determine whether MKR is able to grow out of 2019 
Maker Price Prediction 5 years
The MKR five year price prediction holds a lot of promise  with highs over  3 000 suggested by some investors  This is also due to the state of the overall crypto market  While digital currency is nowhere close to being in widespread usage  blockchain is getting major attention from some key players 
Governmental agencies  social media platforms  and business giants are exploring the many potential use cases for blockchain  It stands to solve many of the scalability issues facing standard web platforms 
Additionally  blockchain technology is being strongly considered as an optimal solution to international banking needs  Some traditional financial institutions   such as JP Morgan  MasterCard  and IBM  NYSE IBM    are already integrating blockchain into their existing service structure 
This opens up enormous potential for existing blockchain platforms such as Maker and the MKR token  Its transparency regarding blockchain development   as well as its existing partnerships with systems such as CargoX  Request Network  and Tradeshift   increase both trust and long term viability for the token 
As the overall cryptocurrency market regains its footing over the next 2 3 years  MKR is well positioned to move into growth  Additional users will bring increased network stability and drive prices upward through the next few years  The coin could see highs at or near the predicted  3 000 mark over the course of five years 
Our Prediction
Based on the current market state and the strong fundamentals of the MakerDAO platform  BeInCrypto forecasts prices remaining stable at or around  650 in 2019  However  we would be reticent to ignore the strange place the entire crypto market is facing  With a continued bear market or even extreme price fluctuations  especially with Ethereum  ETH   MKR could experience dramatic declines in value 
The Maker platform is solid and its focus on true decentralization is encouraging  The platform only launched in 2017 because the team spent over three years in development and is clearly committed to a powerful  flexible platform  Furthermore  the Maker development team is clearly committed to long term business growth 
While the inherent volatility of any cryptocurrency at any time cannot be ignored  2019 is likely an excellent year to increase positions in MKR  with anticipation for dramatic growth moving forward 

Nevertheless  investors should always do their own research and tread lightly before investing in cryptocurrency  All cryptocurrencies  including Bitcoin  BTC   are extremely volatile  Never invest more than you can afford to lose and be prepared to lose everything

Not many investors understand how liquid alternatives often called hedge funds for Main Street work and how they should be used in a portfolio  Sal explains what investors need to know about these strategies 
Some of these strategies available to investors in an ETF wrapper include merger arbitrage  market neutral  long short  global macro  event driven  and inflation protection 
Merger arbitrage  a popular hedge fund strategy  aims to exploit the spread between target stock s price after the announcement of the deal and the final takeover price  Due to the risk that an announced deal may not go through for some reason  target usually trades at a lower price until the takeover is complete 
The IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF  employs a merger arbitrage strategy by investing in companies for which a takeover has been announced and shorting broad global equity indexes  Tune into the podcast to learn more about this strategy 
We discuss the construction of the ETF  how components are selected  as well as what happens if a deal fails to materialize  We also discuss some of the top holdings  including Red Hat   NYSE RHT   and Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   
Red Hat is being acquired by IBM   NYSE IBM   and Celgene is being bought by its rival Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY   
We also discuss the outlook for M A activity in 2019 
The first and the biggest liquid alternative ETF  IQ Hedge Multi Strategy ETF  seeks to replicate hedge fund returns across different strategies  including long short equity  global macro  market neutral  event driven  fixed income arbitrage and emerging markets 
QAI is a fund of funds  We discuss some of its top constituents 
Investors should remember that these strategies aim to provide returns that are not correlated to the broader indexes  Since these strategies have low correlations with stocks  they also provide some diversification benefits to the portfolio and risk mitigation during periods of market turmoil  Both MNA and QAI outperformed the S P 500 index last year

174254,395770,IBM,Cryptocurrencies Are Disrupting The Commodities Market,opinion,"The cryptocurrency market continues to pullback carrying last year s momentum into 2019  This is the exact opposite of what happened between the latter stages of 2017 to the start of 2018  As such  some investors are wondering whether it s all done and dusted for the crypto industry  However  this market has been one of the most exciting over the last few years and it would be premature for anyone to call it a day for cryptocurrency investments 
In fact  just as the uncertainty about the long term future of the market continues to cloud the cryptocurrency industry  startups are beginning to raise their game by creating niche products that target specific segments of various industries  Most importantly  startups are looking to create cryptocurrency products that are backed by value rich assets like real estate  crude oil  and precious metals 
This has created an interesting angle for companies looking to invest in the commodities market and that want to tap into the disruptive force of blockchain technology  As such  we now have cryptocurrencies that are backed by gold  silver  crude oil  copper and diamonds  While in most cases the reason behind the creation of cryptocurrencies that are backed by pure assets is to try to create some form of intrinsic value  other cryptocurrencies are being created to try to decentralize rigid markets while at the same time helping to improve the security of transactions 
Time To Put Diamonds In The Blockchain 
One good example  in this case  is the creation of diamond backed crypto  which most investors view as a good avenue to invest in the highly illiquid diamonds market  Decentralization of the diamonds market using blockchain is helping to simplify the intricate nature of diamond investments while at the same time improving the security of transactions  Top technology companies led by the likes of IBM  NYSE IBM  have created blockchains to help track and verify diamonds thereby streamlining the diamonds supply chain 
Last year  IBM launched TrustChain  a blockchain ledger created in cooperation with several diamond retailers and manufacturers to help verify and track diamonds from mine to the jeweler  Earlier in the year  the world s largest diamonds dealer  De Beer s  alongside five other companies operating in the diamonds market also launched Tracr  another blockchain system that will help to verify and track high value diamonds from mine to the jeweler  Ideally  digitizing the whole process using a blockchain system will help to decentralize the diamonds market thereby making it more accessible to financial market traders 
But this is still going to need to overcome some crucial hurdles  Last year  diamond backed crypto CARAT coin partnered with the Israel diamonds exchange in a bid to taking the diamond crypto mainstream  However  that partnership was cut short after a few months with the Israel diamonds exchange citing failure by Carats io  the organization behind CARAT coin  to obtain a diamond trading license from Israel s diamond regulator 
CARAT coin was created to ease the financing difficulties engulfing the diamonds market  Over the last few years  banks have been reluctant to issue loans to diamond buyers  CARAT  which later partnered with New York based Celcius Network was launched to try to solve this problem  It allows users to receive loans and earn interest on their diamond investments  Carats io has indicated that its CARAT coin could also help to reduce volatility in the diamond market 
Venezuela s Petro Coin And Where Does That Leave Other Governments On Blockchain 
Now  even national governments are joining the bandwagon of digital currencies  Latin America and the Caribbean are heading the queue  with the likes of Bahamas and Venezuela embracing blockchain  Venezuela s Petro coin  in particular  has been the most interesting over the last few quarters  Since making it public that it was looking to launch an oil backed cryptocurrency  Venezuela has received all sorts of critics  Not for the sake of launching Petro  but for the purpose it was created for 
Venezuela s local currency Bolivar has been on a dire state since oil prices plunged from  115 per barrel to just  35 in 2014  The country s leadership made some critical economic mistakes when they tied their local currency to the price of oil  Venezuela s economy is highly dependent  about 98   on oil  which also explains why they decided to pin the Bolivar to oil prices  However  as it turned out  that wasn t the smartest decision and the local currency has since suffered  In a bid to stimulate it  the country decided to launch Petro coin  which has since been criticized in the cryptocurrency industry with some analysts touting it as a bad thing for the success of blockchain technology 
But Is Iran Eager To Go One Better Than Venezuela 
That has not stopped more governments from investing in blockchain technology  Last week  the Islamic Republic of Iran became the latest country to launch a government cryptocurrency when it launched PayMon  a gold backed cryptocurrency  According to a report published by the Financial Tribune  Iran launched the gold backed cryptocurrency in cooperation with four banks  namely  the Parsian Bank  the Bank Pasargad  Bank Melli Iran  and Bank Mellat  This move was taken following international sanctions 
The report also said that  an over the counter  OTC  cryptocurrency exchange called Iran Fara Bourse is expected to adopt PayMon   PayMon will primarily be used to tokenize the financial institutions  assets and properties  A total of 1 billion PayMon tokens are set to be issued initially 
Now  for starters  this might sound like a similar idea that drove Venezuela to launch Petro coin  but unlike Petro coin  which is oil backed  gold backed cryptocurrencies are common in the market  Furthermore  while it may have lost its title as a store of value  the yellow metal has for centuries been one of the most trusted safe havens 
When financial markets spiral into turmoil  some investors whisk a good percentage of their investments by selling high risk assets and diverting some of the money into gold investments  And with Iran staring in the face of international sanctions  perhaps it would be correct to infer that one of the expected consequences of the sanctions could be a major decline in foreign investments  This will likely hurt the country s GDP  which means that it might be a good time to seek the safe haven of gold investments  This could involve among other things  tying some assets to gold using the gold backed crypto  PayMon  the Persian word of  covenant  
Conclusion
In summary  the commodities market plays a crucial role in the global financial markets  Most economies in the world are driven by commodities  which range from oil and gas commodities  agricultural commodities  precious metals  gold  silver  and palladium  etc   gems  diamonds  Rubi  and white sapphire  etc   and rare earth metals  among others  And over the last few years  blockchain and cryptocurrencies have emerged as the most disruptive technological advances of the decade 
As such  it makes sense to national governments and mainstream financial institutions to try to leverage the opportunity presented by fusing commodities with crypto to generate market synergies that will create compelling value propositions to investors

High volatility cuts both ways  Stocks with great momentum moving up often have harsher pullbacks on the way down  That s why I m closely monitoring what investment opportunities can be found in the information technology  IT  sector right now 
Take blue chip IT juggernaut International Business Machines  NYSE  NYSE IBM  as an example  Few companies have made as many contributions to the advances of the computer age as IBM   which has been around for more than a century  So it s no surprise that IBM is at the forefront of the next great technological revolution  artificial intelligence  Even now  technologies that utilize AI are already churning out profits for IBM  This past week  IBM released its fourth quarter earnings report  beating analyst estimates on both revenue and earnings  IBM s largest revenue source is its technology services and cloud platforms segment  bringing in nearly  9 billion in revenue last quarter  But its second largest segment   Cognitive Solutions   is certainly one to watch  This includes its AI based technologies  like IBM Watson  which apply machine learning to big data analytics  The application of these technologies is far reaching and can touch many sectors of the market   from healthcare data management to manufacturing logistics  Last quarter  IBM s cognitive solutions segment brought in  5 5 billion in revenue   about 25  of the company s total sales for the quarter   with positive year over year growth  Historically  the fourth quarter is IBM s strongest  And earnings get reported in January  This pattern has led to a unique phenomenon that my colleague Emerging Trends Strategist Matthew Carr identified as a stock s  Profit Launch Window   It s the cyclical period in a stock s price history that produces the strongest returns  As it turns out  shares of IBM just entered their historical Profit Launch Window  as you can see in the chart above  IBM shares typically perform best between December and March  based on data from the past five years  This has proven to be a reliable period to capture quick gains on the stock

174283,395799,IBM,Norges Bank And ECB Take Centre Stage ,opinion,"Market movers today 
We have a more interesting day ahead of us after the quiet one yesterday  In  Norway   we expect Norges Bank to stay on hold  10 00 CET   All in all  we think there is little reason for it to depart from its planned gradual normalisation of monetary policy and still expect it to signal the next hike will come in March 
Later at 13 45 CET  we have the policy announcement from the ECB  and at 14 30 CET  ECB President Mario Draghi s press conference  We expect the debated growth risk assessment to take centre stage  At the previous meeting  the ECB coined the growth risk assessment as broadly balanced but moving to the downside  Since then we have seen a string of disappointing data  We expect questions from the audience on liquidity operations but no formal announcement until the March meeting  see  ECB Preview   We assign 60  chance of ECB hike in December 2019   18 February  
In terms of data releases  preliminary PMIs for euro area and US  are due out  In euro area  we expect the manufacturing PMI to have fallen further to 50 7 in January  Beyond headwinds from the German car industry and political risks in France  we think there are downside risks due to ongoing weakness in China  as well as weak external demand and fragile risk sentiments in financial markets 
Selected market news 
Yesterday  markets traded sideways overall without any significant news  The overnight session in Asia continued its wait and see mode ahead of the central bank meetings today  However  the US equity markets ended on a stronger footing  as the earnings season has started  Both IBM  NYSE IBM  and Procter and Gamble reported strong earnings 
Concerns about the growth implications of the US government shutdown have started to circulate  Yesterday  White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett cautioned that zero growth is possible should the shutdown continue through March  followed by  humongous  growth once the shutdown ends  Later  media reports suggested that the Democrats may grant President Trump his USD5bn plus budget request to increase border security  However  those funds are said not to be used to build a wall but  only  to increase border security 
On the political front  the grasp for power continues in Venezuela  President Trump  among others  quickly recognised opposition leader Juan Guaid  as President after he declared himself the leader  Venezuelan bond yields declined on the outlook for a regime shift 
The annual meeting in Davos is well underway  We note that Germany s Angela Merkel  Japan s Shinzo Abe and China s Wang Qishan all defended globalisation while also calling for an end to the trade wars 
Scandi markets
We expect Norges Bank to stay on hold today but to keep the strong tightening bias  signalling a rate hike in March  Global turmoil persists and global interest rate expectations are slightly lower than in December  On the other hand  the domestic economy has performed slightly better than expected and core inflation has again surprised on the upside 
There is little reason for Norges Bank to depart from its planned gradual normalisation of monetary policy  as the output gap has closed  growth seems to be staying above trend and core inflation is moving upwards from the target 
We estimate the LFS unemployment rate dropped moderately to 3 9  in November 
Fixed income markets
There were modest moves in yields yesterday  Spain outperformed EU peers as the investor data from the strong 10Y auction showed a widening of the investor base relative to the syndicated deals in previous years  Asian investors have begun buying Spain given the upgrade and positive outlook for the debt to GDP  Danish government bond yields continue to track Germany even though there was modest demand at the inaugural 10Y DGB auction yesterday 
Today  France will come to the market with an auction in the 3Y to 6Y segment  where it will sell EUR8 9bn in four different maturities including a new 3Y bond  In addition  it will sell EUR1 1 5bn in 5Y  9Y and 30Y linkers  We expect there will be plenty of demand given the yield pick up that France still offers to EU peers 
In Scandinavia  the main event is the Norges Bank meeting  We expect it to confirm a hike in March and this should add pressure on the spread between Norway and EU peers  See more in Reading the Markets Norway  21 January 2019 
FX markets
GBP outperformed in the G10 space yesterday supported by a technical break above 1 30 in GBP USD  While uncertainty related to Brexit remains high  the risk of a  no deal  Brexit appears to be fading  which has improved appetite for GBP  We reckon that the past week s rally in GBP is fair given that the  post Brexit  outcome distribution for EUR GBP looks increasingly skewed towards the downside  Momentum is strong and with risks skewed towards the downside for EUR at the ECB meeting today  EUR GBP could still test lower towards 0 86 in the coming days 
Today  focus in FX markets turns to Norges Bank and the ECB  On the former  if we are right in our call  see above   this should not lead to a significant immediate repricing of a March hike  currently priced at only c 14 15bp   However  it should confirm that relative rates will increasingly become a NOK supportive factor as we approach the meeting as long as the global risk environment holds up  For today s session  we should expect NOK appreciation to be more limited  On the ECB front  we do not expect Draghi to move EUR much  but  if anything  we believe risks are tilted to the downside given our expectations of downward risks to the growth assessment ",2019-01-24,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/norges-bank-and-ecb-take-centre-stage-200381677,200381677

IBM  NYSE IBM  soared 10  higher on Wednesday morning  after posting earnings that beat Wall Street expectations 
The stock s market cycles point to a bit more upside and then a pullback  as its declining phase approaches 

The company reported earnings per share of  4 87 and total revenue of  21 76 billion  above analyst estimates of  4 82 and  21 75 billion  Management forecast its fiscal year revenue at  13 90  which was also above expectations

With regard to IBM s market cycles  we can see that it is in the rising phase of its current minor cycle  with the declining phase of the intermediate cycle in sight  We previously saw IBM as in a negative pattern  but it is now repairing itself  Nearing resistance  we expect the stock to pull back from around  136  with a better buying opportunity coming in late March or April

174296,395812,IBM,Earnings Rescue Market From Morning Drop ,opinion,"The major indices lost their grip on early gains Wednesday but still recovered enough to get back on the positive side by the closing bell 
	The Dow rose 0 70   or about 171 points  to 24 575 62  The index was up nearly 300 points in the session and then slipped all the way into negative territory before heading higher again  The Dow got a lot of help from IBM  NYSE IBM   which soared nearly 8 5  after reporting better than expected fiscal fourth quarter results after the bell on Tuesday 
	The other major indices took the same trajectory though didn t have as energetic a rebound  The S P increased 0 22  to 2638 7  while the NASDAQ inched upward by 0 08  to 7025 77 
	Stocks had a four session winning streak snapped yesterday on concerns over slowing global growth and the trade impasse with China  There was no news on either front today  but earnings season managed to get stocks back into the green 
	The question now is  How much longer can that scenario play out  Earnings season has been pretty good so far  but the market could really use some clarity on these bigger uncertainties  As we ve seen in recent weeks  the market s improved sentiment suggests its waiting to take off on any positive developments  Last night and into the morning we saw nice earnings from Proctor and Gamble  IBM and United Technologies  NYSE UTX   Normally the market would hold gains on big stocks heading higher on strong EPS  However  the typically risks are simply overpowering any solid earnings news   said Jeremy in Counterstrike  So individual stocks can still go higher on good EPS  but the market will continue to struggle until we get past China and the government shutdown   Today s Portfolio Highlights 
	Home Run Investor  Simply put  a good stock at a discounted price is what every investor wants to find  and that s exactly what Brian Bolan sees with Funko  FNKO   This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  pop culture consumer products company was a huge 130  winner for the editor s other service  Stocks Under  10  last year  He s looking for more of the same in 2019  FNKO has beaten in each of its last four quarters and is relatively cheap  Brian also sees margin improvement and topline growth of nearly 24   If it beats again  he thinks this stock could get back to the  20 range  Read the complete commentary for more on this new addition 
	Value Investor  In its first earnings report since being added to the portfolio in early December  Synchrony Financial  SYF  beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 7th quarter in a row  The consumer financial services company announced earnings of  1 09  which beat our expectations by more than 17  and brought its four quarter average surprise up to 13 8   The stock was the best performing name among all ZU portfolios on Wednesday with a jump of 10 7   The stock is still  dirt cheap  according to Tracey  SYF is also one of the stars of the portfolio with a gain of more than 16  since inception Surprise Trader   I love it when a plan comes together  Despite the very bearish feeling in the market throughout the mid morning  stocks managed to put up another victory today 
	 The trading day went just about as expected with stocks gapping up early  then letting loose down under the 50 day moving average only to stage a rally again for the second straight day  I d like to believe that the downside is over  I like the retest but if we can t find escape velocity soon  the market may be heading for some trouble 
	 A second retest of the 50 day moving average was met with strength today  I m looking for the market to get into the gap of today s open and fill it before deciding on a direction  If it reverses to the downside  I m worried the 50 day won t see the buying it has seen the last two sessions      Dave Bartosiak

174335,395851,IBM,Relief Rally In Global Equity Markets To Be Tested This Week ,opinion,"After a positive start to the week  Asian equities fell today amid rising concerns over the global economic outlook  The market is currently being driven by the daily news feed  An example of this  is the caution observed over the latest revised growth estimates from the IMF  The fund lowered its growth expectation for the global economy by 0 2  for 2019 and 0 1  for 2020 to 3 5  and 3 6  respectively  This was the second downturn revision in three months  and we can still see further downgrades in near future if trade tensions escalate  the U K  exits with a no deal from the EU  or China s economic growth drops more sharply 
Updates received from U S  China trade talks were not encouraging either  According to a Bloomberg report  the negotiations over intellectual property theft have gone nowhere  With only eight days left before China s Vice Premier Liu He visits Washington to resume trade negotiations  any headlines related to trade talks will be market moving 
Overall  we think the relief rally in global equity markets will be tested this week especially with earnings season kicking into higher gear with companies like Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   IBM  NYSE IBM   United Technologies  NYSE UTX   and several airlines scheduled to post their Q4 results 
In currency markets  the Australian and New Zealand dollars are feeling most of the pressure as concerns over the global economy and China s economic outlook grows  However  it remains to be seen what new measures China will take in order to boost sentiment 
British Prime Minister Theresa May unveiled her Brexit Plan B yesterday  and as expected it looked a lot like Plan A  The fate of her alternative plan seems similar to the previous one and will not likely pass through the parliament  EU leaders also did not show a willingness to negotiate for a new deal  Despite these facts  the sterling held steady against the dollar  Investors seem like they are still ruling out the possibility of a hard Brexit and believe the current dysfunction in U K  politics will lead to at least an extension of Article 50  and possibly a new referendum

174366,395882,IBM,Investing In Precious Commodities  What Does The Future Hold ,opinion,"The commodities market is regarded as one of the basic forces that drive global financial markets  From the perspective of energy  oil and gas commodities  to food and horticulture  as well as precious metals  all these commodities are exchanged globally in trillions of dollars worth of market value 
In many cases  commodity prices have been used by analysts to predict the future direction of financial markets  Oil  for example  affects several industries across the world  From travel to the heavy industrial plants  as well as  the transportation market  Several global economies  especially in the middle east  north Africa and some parts of Latin America are driven by oil 
Gold  on the other hand  used to play a crucial role in the global banking system in the Gold Standard system  Its impact on the monetary value of various currencies has diminished over time  but it often comes into play during an economic crisis when investors try to put some of their investments in safe havens   
So  what does the future hold for gold and silver 
In today s markets  gold and silver are technically currencies and not commodities  Yet  theoretically  they are two of the most commonly traded commodities  The economics of the two has been moving from bars and coins into the digital space and things could get more interesting in the next few years 
Cryptocurrency startups are now using them to back their token sales  as blockchain technology continues to revolutionize markets  While digital trading of gold has always offered enough liquidity  things have been a little different for silver as a commodity 
Nonetheless  these commodities could become even more liquid and easily accessible to ordinary investors as more of them are added to blockchains  This could also provide a basis for their re invention in the global financial markets 
When you look at the emphasis given to the likes of bitcoin and Ethereum in the digital economy  it is not hard to imagine how influential gold and silver could become once again if they made a complete transition to the digital space 
Currently  gold and silver prices tend to trend higher longer when some countries  central banks are restocking their reserves with physical gold in anticipation of an economic slowdown  or in an attempt to stimulate their local currencies  Russia  for instance  has been doing this regularly over the last few years  while India and Poland were also major players in 2018 
If the tables could be reversed such that  the digital market place dictates the prices of gold and silver more  then there is a high chance that they could become major forces again in the global financial marketplace 
Diamonds too are precious commodities  so why aren t they traded as such 
The monopoly in the diamonds market may have ended  but they are still primarily sold as jewelry  Diamonds have no value an industrial application perspective and this sets them apart from other commodities 
Furthermore  they do not have a specific standardization or benchmark that market players can use to trade it  Oil is sold or traded by the barrel  gold and silver can be traded in ounces  while most food commodities like coffee  can be traded in Kilograms or ounces 
With diamonds  the 4Cs come into play when investing  We talk of carat weight  cut  color and clarity all contributing to the price of a diamond  And then we also have the issue of certified and non certified  loose  diamonds  All these make things tricky for those looking to make an investment in diamonds 
Putting all these in a digital platform that allows traders to quickly open and close trades has proven to be a challenging task  There could be several varieties priced based on the 4Cs with only a few probably available for each carat weight  color  clarity  and cut 
However  with companies like IBM  NYSE IBM  and De Beer s coming up with blockchain based digital ledgers  TrustChain and Tracr  respectively  that will allow market players to verify and track individual diamonds from mine to the jeweler  things could change soon  Once enough diamonds ate put in blockchains  trading could become opensource with ordinary investors gaining access via various crypto exchanges 
In addition  technological advances have made it possible for companies to manufacture diamonds in labs  This could also help reduce the scarcity in the market and in turn boost liquidity  The next few years will be interesting 
Oil  a precious resource  the  black gold 
That black substance that comes out of the ground after  ground breaking  hours of drilling has made nations  oligarchs  and multi national corporations rich  And that s what has earned it the nickname  black gold  
Yet in recent years  the price of oil has become most volatile when compared to its historical fluctuations  Over the last few years  we have watched the prices of WTI Crude Oil and Crude Brent rally to over  100 before falling below  40  They then bounced back to trade above  70 00 before retracting again to the current levels of about  50 for WTI Crude and about  60 for Crude Brent  This is volatility at its finest 
Back in the ages when just a few countries and a few companies had the technology to drill oil  prices were dictated by the demand  Now  production and supply play the key role because of the rise of the industrialized economy and a world that is now closely knitted together through revolutionary transportation methods  Demand for oil appears to have peaked  which means there is little room for improvement 
Nearly every country in the world now has an oil well of its own  as the  black gold  rush continues  This effectively minimizes the growth opportunity for the demand for the commodity in the market  As such  eyes have now turned to production capacities and predicted supply for the next few months  Oversupply and geopolitical imbalances have mostly been the main causes of a decrease or an increase in oil prices Furthermore  the global push to try to minimize industrial activities that cause climate change and global warming have also seen companies launch revolutionary methods to produce renewable energy  Companies are now investing in offshore wind power  where ocean currents guarantee better power output than land based windmills  which are affected by physical and man made obstacles like mountains and tall buildings  Mega solar plants like the one in Morrocco are also being built to boost solar energy production  which is by far the most efficient source of energy once a plant is set 
As such  fossil fuels like oil could face more turbulence in the long term future  but for now  they remain a crucial item of the global economy  When gas prices go up  a lot of things do as well 
Unlike gold  silver  and diamonds whose shiny and sparkling appearances make them precious  oil is a precious commodity purely on the basis of its usefulness  Its long term future may not be as promising as it was in the past  but it still has a few more decades to power the world 
Conclusion
In summary  precious commodities impact the markets differently  Some of them like oil  are basic for commerce and drive the GDPs of those countries while others like gold  silver  and diamonds draw their value from their sparkle or shine and are mostly considered a luxury  The blockchain technology could make some of these  somewhat scarce  commodities more available to ordinary investors from a trading perspective  The future looks interesting ",2019-01-10,Nicholas Maithya,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investing-in-precious-commodities-what-does-the-future-hold-200374349,200374349
174367,395883,IBM,Analysts Estimate IBM  IBM  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"IBM  NYSE IBM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 22  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This technology and consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 85 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 4  
Revenues are expected to be  21 76 billion  down 3 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for IBM 
For IBM  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 27  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that IBM will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that IBM would post earnings of  3 40 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 42  delivering a surprise of  0 59  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
IBM doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-ibm-ibm-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200375746,200375746

Coming into today  shares of the technology and consulting company had lost 5 25  in the past month  In that same time  the Computer and Technology sector lost 7 27   while the S P 500 lost 8 82  
IBM will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  which is expected to be January 17  2019  On that day  IBM is projected to report earnings of  4 85 per share  which would represent a year over year decline of 6 37   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  21 76 billion  down 3 49  from the prior year quarter 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM  Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Within the past 30 days  our consensus EPS projection has moved 0 07  lower  IBM currently has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Digging into valuation  IBM currently has a Forward P E ratio of 8 23  This represents a discount compared to its industry s average Forward P E of 8 57 
We can also see that IBM currently has a PEG ratio of 1 66  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  Computer   Integrated Systems stocks are  on average  holding a PEG ratio of 1 66 based on yesterday s closing prices

174388,395904,IBM,Earnings Preview  IBM  IBM  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"IBM  IBM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 17  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This technology and consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 85 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 4  
Revenues are expected to be  21 76 billion  down 3 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for IBM 
For IBM  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 27  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that IBM will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that IBM would post earnings of  3 40 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 42  delivering a surprise of  0 59  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
IBM doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-ibm-ibm-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200374496,200374496

174405,395921,IBM,Blockchain benefits still murky for most commodities trading,news,"By Julia Payne
LONDON  Reuters    Commodity firms and banks have been diving into blockchain pilot schemes over the last two years but the new technology s application for most trading has likely been over hyped  a report by Boston Consulting Group  BCG  said 
Blockchain  originally the platform behind cryptocurrency Bitcoin  is viewed by some as a solution to inefficiencies  improving transparency and reducing to the risk of fraud  But BCG believes its potential has been exaggerated 
A high tech ledger  blockchain uses a shared database that updates in real time and can process and settle transactions in minutes without the need for third party verification 
The volume of trades through various schemes has been negligible so far and it is too early to tell how soon it might reach a critical mass 
 There are so many pilot schemes but none have become real production scale systems yet  One of the problems is that it s not designed for physical trades  The fundamental issue  how do you track a physical entity in a virtual world  It s two worlds colliding   Antti Belt  co author of the BCG report  said 
Among the obstacles to scaling up the technology include reconciling terminologies and whether the switch to a blockchain platform is even financially justifiable 
 The industry is very old and everyone uses a different language  How do you define quality  shipment schedules     a lot of reconciliation is currently needed for both sides   Belt said 
 People have spent millions  sometimes over  100 million  on IT system  do they want to do it again  
Furthermore  it is uncertain to what degree traders will want to adopt a technology that will erode already razor thin profit margins 
BCG said that as the platforms take shape  it would be  bad news  for merchant traders as the price inefficiencies and unequal dissemination of information that they rely on to make profits would disappear 
 The use of blockchain solutions would significantly improve transparency     It would also create a more efficient and liquid market  moving commodity trading away from bilateral deals struck directly between two parties to transactions based on electronic platforms to match buyers and sellers   the report said 
Co author Steven Kok said interest in the wider adoption of blockchain technology would start where the primary driver is certifying the source of the asset  as with diamonds  rather than efficiency 
 Anglo American   LON AAL  s De Beers said in May it had tracked 100 high value diamonds from miner to retailer using blockchain  in the first effort of its kind to clear the supply chain of impostors and exploitation 
Nevertheless  major companies and banks have tested blockchain across commodities such as in power  diamonds  food and oil  Last year  a consortium including major banks  trading firms and producers  BP   LON BP   Equinor and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  announced that they would develop a blockchain based platform ready to go by the end of 2018 
Separately  commodities trader Trafigura set up another platform with  IBM   NYSE IBM  and Natixis for the U S  crude oil market last year  Major agriculture traders have also tried blockchain such as Louis Dreyfus Co with a cargo of soybeans 
 Simply put  blockchain may not be the right answer for all players   the report concluded ",2018-08-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/blockchain-benefits-still-murky-for-most-commodities-trading-1576236,1576236

174476,395992,IBM,Australia Is Morphing Into The Next Crypto Haven,opinion,"Over the last few years  there have been some major accomplishments made in the crypto community  Forbes magazine reported in November 2017  that Bitcoin was processing  2 billion worth of transactions per day  This prior to the nearly  20 000 high BTC soared to the following months  Major laws have been passed by governments setting regulations for tax reporting that have now gone into effect  Let us not forget the  1 7 billion dollar ICO that is still ongoing  brought to us by Telegram Open Network  TON   It is not surprising the more countries are taking notice of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology  One that you may not have suspected has made amazing strides recently is the country of Australia  They have been going to great lengths to secure a foothold in this emerging market  
What Is Australia s Position In The Leaderboards Of The Global Economy
Australia  like many other developed countries  has had to overcome a myriad of socioeconomic turmoil over the past few decades  From huge national debt   currently hovering around  680 billion   to an unemployment rate that seems to have stuck at just over 5 percent  Largely based in the service sector  making up 70 percent of Australia s gross domestic product  GDP  and being the 11th largest economy in the world  while holding the spot of 54th largest in population the citizens are turning to more creative means to rise above the challenges posed during these difficult times  And for many Australians in this era of fintech  the crypto market is turning out to be a popular means of getting by  Unlike many of its counterparts from the developed world  
How Are They Embracing Digital Currencies 
Unlike many of its counterparts from the developed world  Australia is starting to accept it in places you wouldn t expect  The first astonishing place that I found to accept crypto was Brisbane Airport  If you re ever traveling and find yourself in the Queensland capital  you can purchase some reading material with Dash  or even pick up that overpriced neck pillow with Steem  You can even choose a payment method from a growing number of altcoins  and not just the grandfather of crypto  bitcoin  To be able to use your altcoins for purchases is just solidifying the foothold crypto has on the country s finances and stock markets  This very year the Sydney based fintech company  HAVVEN reports a successful ICO  raising just shy of  39 million to surpass another Aussie blockchain startup  Power Ledger 
There are also companies like Auscoin that have started placing Bitcoin ATMs throughout the country to give more access to individuals that use it  Accessibility is key when trying to implement any form of new tech  and the Australians are doubling down on this key aspect for implementation  After all  if you can t get it when it is needed  then what good is it anyway 
What Is The Government Doing To Strengthen Its Crypto Grasp
While all those things are wonderful and music to every crypto lover s ears  the Australian government itself is proving to be the best thing for the industry  The Australian Stock Exchange  ASX  has been listing blockchain and crypto companies over the past three years  with plans to move the ASX to the blockchain in advanced stages  This is bound to make trading faster  more secure  and considerably cheaper for the average trader in Australia  Plus  as this post explains  the government s  1 billion AUD deal with IBM  NYSE NYSE IBM  for blockchain based projects will go a long way in establishing Australia as a world leader for everything crypto 
Even further  mid last year  the Australian government classified digital currency as money right around the time when the Australian Securities and Investments Commission  or ASIC  fitting for the subject matter but confusing for use miners  had begun implementing regulations on exchanges  These regulations were meant to reign in on the high rate of ICO scams that had ravaged the world of cryptocurrencies  while also building a framework for future innovation within this space 
Conclusion
There has been a need for someone to step in and get these malicious token offerings in check  With regulations comes taxes and with taxes  there s always going to be a group of very upset crypto users  To that  I say  who do you want stealing your money  The government  who will use those taxes to better your country  or some pimple faced shyster  who will use the money to buy the Lamborghini that you have been dreaming of 
With that said  it s surprising that more countries haven t followed Australia s path  But with the Aussies setting the pace for the developed world  it s only a matter of time before the doubters and naysayers begin putting their faith in cryptocurrencies  Australia s willingness and determination to make crypto into a staple and viable means of economic independence is a breath of fresh air to the crypto communities after dealing with being shunned by the financial district over the last few years ",2018-11-13,Howard Goldstein,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-australia-is-morphing-into-the-next-crypto-haven-200358578,200358578

CEO Ginni Rometty redirected IBM s priorities from its traditional business of distributing hardware and software to innovative technologies like artificial intelligence  AI   blockchain  and cloud computing  The new businesses are referred to as  strategic imperatives   Currently IBM is one of the most  blockchain adopters  The company is involved in over 60 blockchain network projects 
In the second quarter  revenue from the  strategic imperatives  rose 15  to  10 1 billion  which accounts for more than 50  of IBM s total revenue  The company s CFO James Kavanaugh noted that IBM s shift to newer technologies had been paying off  He  Reuters 

 We accelerated our growth  really capitalizing on these emerging high value areas  

In annual terms   strategic imperatives  increased by 15  to  39 billion  compared to  34 1 billion recorded in the same period last year 
Total revenue for the quarter rose about 4  to  20 billion  better than the  19 85 billion anticipated by Reuters analysts  Thus  IBM s revenue has increased for the third straight quarter after being in the red for about six years 
The quarterly operating gross profit margin fell to 46 5  from 47 1  
CFRA Research analyst David Holt noted 

 One of the key components was as a service growth     and as that scales through  you re starting to see margin expansion shine  Gross margin closed the gap  

In the second quarter  which ended June 30  net income increased to  2 4 billion  or  2 61 per share  from  2 33 billion  or  2 48 per share the previous year 
On the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE   the IBM share price added 0 7  for the day  However  since the beginning of the year  the share price has lost about 6  

Kavanaugh revealed that the business has been growing overall  Over the last quarter  IBM signed 13 deals at over  100 million each

 We think  and the common consensus is  that it has real merit   said  SBS chief executive Shaun Drylie at the SBS annual meeting earlier this week  according to a  of the news outlet Southland Times  Blockchan and cryptocurrencies were one of the topics discussed at the meeting 
The possible application of blockchain technology in banking is to improve the speed and lower the cost of bank transfers  or to find its application in the security of the transactions  Another potential use is in offering financial services to the currently unbanked 
Not very surprisingly  however  Drylie is skeptical towards the cryptocurrencies    Cryptocurrencies  we re not too sure  and if you look at the volatility of cryptocurrencies that would suggest the market is not too sure as well   he noted  adding that the bank is keeping an eye on them too  as they might have future   We re keeping a close eye on it  but it s very hard to pick where it s going to go long term   he said  Besides  according to him  the regulatory situation is still rather unclear 
Overall  the New Zealand banks have a somewhat hostile attitude towards cryptocurrencies  Only recently the governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  Geoff Bascand said a central bank issued cryptocurrency would not be financially stable because of its existing scalability constraints and slow confirmation process  Earlier this year some New Zealand crypto exchanges have had trouble with their bank accounts

Based on data from CryptoCompare  XLM has a 21  inflow of Tether  USDT   But the chief reason for the rally is the pairing with Bitcoin  where the rapid appreciation translated into a higher XLM price 
The XLM pickup also follows the announcement at the end of last week that Coinbase was exploring the addition of the digital asset  The news dashed expectations that Coinbase would add XRP  Investors have noted that XLM is the open source version similar to the Ripple approach for a distributed ledger  Both projects were led by Jed McCaleb  with Stellar being created as a pro bono  open source platform

174506,396022,IBM,This Is Why I m Long IBM ,opinion,"Back in 2015  I wrote an article titled  Retirees  I Did Not Buy IBM to Sell  It s about the Dividend Income Stupid   At the time I published the article  I was long International Business Machine  NYSE IBM  and remain long today  With the article I attempted to illustrate why I was including IBM in retirement portfolios  As the title so brashly stated  it was about the dividend income  Put more directly  I was investing in IBM to augment the yield of my dividend growth portfolio based on the company s quality and financial strength 
Moreover  I talked about the many varied investing strategies that investors could implement  Specific to my IBM investment  it s important to emphasize that I intended to hold the company for many years to come  and still do  Therefore  I am not too concerned about short term price volatility simply because I have no intention of selling anyway  Additionally  I had  nor do I have  any delusions about IBM generating significant short term capital gains  In fact  I was confident that I would have to be patient on the capital appreciation front  but as I said in the article 

A Growing Dividend Income Stream Was My Purpose for Investing In IBM
I have been and continue to be aggressively adding IBM into retirement portfolios  However  even upon my first foray into the company  I was never expecting substantial capital appreciation  at least over the short to intermediate term  Instead  my attitude about investing in this company was based solely on the opportunity to receive a safe  above average and growing dividend yield  On that basis  IBM has proven to be a resounding success because  as I expected  IBM s dividend income has steadily increased 

Here I would also add that dividends are paid on the number of shares I own and not based on the current market price  This is simply another reason why I am not too concerned with price volatility  It will be many years from now before I decide that it is time to sell IBM  unless I truly come to believe that its financial strength has deteriorated to the point where I can no longer trust its dividend  However  at this point I have no indication that this will happen any time soon  In fact  the Red Hat  NYSE RHT  acquisition gives me confidence that fundamentals may actually grow again at some point in the future 
IBM s Financial Strength
Moreover  in addition to my dividend growth objective  my contentment to continue to hold IBM was also predicated on its financial strength  Simply put  I considered and still consider IBM a company of formidable resources and immense financial strength  I understand the company has been struggling adapting to the current revolution in technology  but I feel strongly that it will both survive and endure  The following excerpts from the 2015 article illustrates my confidence 

Additionally  when it comes to determining the safety associated with investing in a stock  determining whether it possesses superior financial strength is an obvious and commonly utilized approach  However  there are additional important safety measurements that are subtler  less understood and often either ignored or their importance not given the credit deserved 

These subtler safety measurements are an above average  but sustainable  current dividend yield and sound valuation  or better yet  significant undervaluation  This last point is critically important because I believe any issues that IBM has are already  and have been for some time  priced into the stock  Stated more directly  I believe that IBM is trading at a significant discount to its intrinsic value  Moreover  I believe that even if IBM continues to grow at low rates  it is still undervalued  Because  even a company with no growth is worth more than IBM with its significant resources  Consequently  and to expand on why I am not worried about the short term or current low stock price  I do not believe in selling anything   common stock or otherwise   for less than I believe it s worth  Therefore I do expect IBM to provide me substantial at best  and more than adequate at worst  long term capital appreciation  Therefore  as long as the dividend continues to grow  I am more than willing to patiently wait for future capital appreciation to occur 

IBM s Financial Strength
IBM was founded in 1910 and incorporated in the state of New York in 1911  The company took on the iconic IBM name in 1924  Consequently  IBM has been an American technology stalwart even before technology became cool  As such  IBM has been long renowned as a blue chip dividend growth stock  So much so that legendary investor Peter Lynch once quipped  no one ever gets fired for buying IBM 

As a side note  several people commented that I recently misused the above quote  They corrected me by stating that Peter Lynch said that no IT manager ever got fired for purchasing IBM  That may be true  however  my quote was referencing what Peter said on page 44 in his best selling book  One up on Wall Street  as follows 

there is an unwritten rule on Wall Street  you ll never lose your job losing your clients money in IBM 

IBM Credit Rating Downgrades   Remain Investment Grade
Credit rating agencies have recently been evaluating IBM s credit ratings  However IBM continues to receive investment grade ratings as follows 

S P  based on the Red Hat acquisition announcement  lowered IBM s credit rating one notch from A  to A 
Moody s rates IBM A1 with a possible downgrade alert as of October 29  2018

Did IBM Buy Red Hat At A Bargain Valuation 
From my contrary perspective on IBM  my belief in the company s formidable financial strength was validated by its Red Hat announcement  Most pundits and many investors suggest that IBM dramatically overpaid for Red Hat  I disagree that it overpaid and in the video below  I make the case that the acquisition was made at a fair or reasonable valuation  This is important to me because it also validates my original reason for purchasing IBM   it was all about its growing dividend  The following excerpt from the press release on IBM s website backs my premise that IBM s management team will continue to support and grow its dividend  emphasis added is mine  

Financial Details
The acquisition of Red Hat reinforces IBM s high value model  It will accelerate IBM s revenue growth  gross margin and free cash flow within 12 months of closing  It also will support a solid and growing dividend 
The company will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings  The company will target a leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating  The company intends to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021 
At signing  the company has ample cash  credit and bridge lines to secure the transaction financing  The company intends to close the transaction through a combination of cash and debt 
The acquisition has been approved by the boards of directors of both IBM and Red Hat  It is subject to Red Hat shareholder approval  It also is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions  It is expected to close in the latter half of 2019 ",2018-10-31,Chuck Carnevale,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-im-long-ibm-200352611,200352611

174519,396035,IBM, IBM Awarded 6 Blockchain Related Patents in One Week ,news,"IBM   NYSE IBM  is actively working on innovations in the distributed ledger technology  DLT   In the span of a week  the US tech giant was awarded six blockchain related patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO   Two of the patents were awarded on Thursday  while four patent applications were approved last week 
Here is a brief description of each patent 
1  System  method  and computer program product for privacy preserving transaction validation mechanisms for smart contracts that are included in a ledger   granted on July 12  the  application was initially filed on March 5  2018  The invention relates to blockchain transactions  The description says that the product might be able to deal with multiple forms of transactions  validate them  ensure the ability to handle confidential transactions  control access to transactions  provide means to audit them and ensure accountability of the validating entities involved 

2  Private blockchain transaction management and termination   the application for the other blockchain related  awarded today was filed on January 12  2017  The invention is about a private blockchain system that can be more efficient than a public and global blockchain  which  according to IBM  is too slow  large  and expensive 

3  Limiting blockchain size to optimize performance   last week  IBM was awarded four blockchain related patents  one of which refers to  that can boost the DLT s performance  The problem with most of the traditional blockchain systems is that they record every aspect of a transaction  thus becoming very large in memory size  This is especially challenging in an Internet of Things  IoT  network  which comprises a variety of machines and devices that interact together  IBM s solution is to cut the size of the entire blockchain by compressing the blocks  thus speeding up processes 

4  Tracking assets with a blockchain   the patent application was filed on January 5  2017  The  discusses the use of the distributed ledger technology for various types of assets rather than for financial transactions  As the description reads 

 the blockchain may be used to establish ownership  provenance  a historical record of status  state  location changes  etc  In operation  tracked assets may include a serial number used to uniquely identify each specific item and that serial number may naturally be a key identifier used in the ledger  


5  Blockchain for program code credit and programmer contribution in a collective   IBM filed the application for this patent on January 5  2017  The  proposes to leverage blockchain to help programmers who work in a team get fair treatment and reward based on the accurate assessment of their contribution  Currently  programmers who are collaborating with other parties to code a complex software product cannot enjoy a fair method to determine their contribution in public or even private space  A blockchain based system could help them track the volume of work and contribution with high precision  being an accurate tool for determining the reward and solve dispute resolutions 

6 Tracking items used for providing medical services   the US tech company applied for this patent on January 4  2017  According to the   which was granted last week  a blockchain system may be used for tracking physical items used by doctors in surgical procedures and other medical operations  The proper management of medical items is extremely important for patient safety  which is why such a system would be helpful to improve the medical service in general

174525,396041,IBM,IBM partners Stronghold for new digital stable coin,news,"By Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss
NEW YORK  Reuters    International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  Corp is backing a new cryptocurrency pegged to the U S  dollar  in a partnership with U S  based financial services provider Stronghold that adds stability to a sector known for its volatility  the companies said 
The so called stable coin  Stronghold USD  launched on Tuesday on the Stellar blockchain platform  Buyers of the coin will deposit greenbacks with the company s partner bank  Nevada based Prime Trust for Stronghold to issue the tokens based on a 1 to 1 ratio 
Stable coins  pegged to an asset like gold  or major currencies such the euro  pound and U S  dollar  have emerged as issuers seek to expand uses for digital currencies  which are unregulated and volatile  Bitcoin  the most well known token  has fallen around 55 percent so far in 2018 against the dollar  after surging more than 1 300 percent last year 
Cryptocurrencies are powered by blockchain  a shared database maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet 
Stronghold USDs are designed for use among businesses  such as financial institutions  multinational corporations  and asset managers  the company said  The tokens may be made available to retail customers in the coming months 
 The engineering work has been done on this token and we have seen a little bit of the early release of it   Jesse Lund   IBM  s vice president of global blockchain  said in an interview 
  IBM will explore use cases with business networks that we have developed  as a user of the token  We see this as a way of bringing financial settlement into the transactional business network that we have been building  
As applications that use blockchain and stable coins become more mainstream  Lund said  merchants  consumers and global suppliers will get cheaper  faster and safer alternatives to cash  credit cards  debit cards and wire transfers 
 The token allows folks to do payments  foreign exchange between companies in a very seamless and frictionless and more secure way   Stronghold founder and Chief Executive Tammy Camp said in an interview 
 It enables people to be able to trade that token with other assets and other tokens as well   she added 
IBM also announced on Tuesday a partnership with Columbia University to open the Columbia IBM Center for Blockchain and Transparency  It will offer students access to IBM internships and joint research ",2018-07-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/ibm-partners-stronghold-for-new-digital-stable-coin-1532608,1532608
174531,396047,IBM,IBM Fundamental Analysis By The Numbers ,opinion,"All investing is not done with the same objectives or goals in mind  This applies to investing in common stocks just as it does to investing in real estate  commodities  fixed income vehicles  fine art or collectibles   and any other investment that comes to mind  There are times when investors are looking for maximum total return  which is often automatically associated with buying a stock  However  there are also investors looking for high current income  or a growing income stream  Other investors might be more concerned with safety than they are return  Or as Will Rogers so aptly put it   I am not so much concerned with the return on my capital as I am with the return of my capital  
I bring this up because my experience suggests that people tend to be myopic when it comes to investing in stocks  For example  there are those that believe that you should only invest in a stock that can beat the so called market  Similarly  there are those that believe you should only invest in a stock with the objective of generating a high total rate of return  Therefore  if a stock is not meeting those specific objectives  then it is often considered a bad stock 
For example  in 2015 I wrote an article titled  Retirees  I Did Not Buy IBM  NYSE IBM  To Sell  It s About the Dividend Income  Stupid   Although I was having a little fun with the title  I was also attempting to point out that I was investing in IBM solely for its growing dividend income stream and safety  When that article was published  International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  was offering a current dividend yield of 3 7   More to the point  the dividend has increased each year since at an average growth rate of approximately 9 to 10   Moreover  IBM has also generated substantially more dividend income than I would have gotten had I invested in the S P 500  Consequently  IBM has met and even exceeded my expectations and objectives thus far  Therefore  I have been very pleased with my IBM holding 
On the other hand  IBM was trading at a price of approximately  141 when I wrote the cited article versus the  130 it currently trades at as I write this article  However  many might be surprised to learn that I could care less about what IBM is currently trading at  The reason is simple  as I also stated in the title  I did not buy IBM to sell  instead  I bought IBM for the opportunity to earn an above average and growing income stream over the long run  I believe that objective remains intact  and I am therefore content to continue owning this A  rated blue chip  This recalls a comment the venerable Peter Lynch once made about IBM  Peter said  and I quote   no manager has ever been fired for buying IBM  
What About IBM s Future 
To be clear  I want to restate that I purchased IBM for its above average yield and for the safety that I perceive relative to that yield  In other words  I originally believed   and continue to believe   that IBM is fully capable of offering me an above average generation of spendable dividend income that is growing faster than inflation  Furthermore  I do consider IBM undervalued  and as a result  I am not concerned about losing a great deal of money on this investment over the long run  In other words  I believe IBM s problems are already priced into their stock  On the other hand  I am not willing to rule out the opportunity that IBM will deliver on its strategic imperatives for growth  thereby providing exceptional long term total rate of return in the future  However  I also realize that I will need to be patient that will not occur overnight   if it ever occurs 
It was obvious to me when I purchased IBM and remains so today that IBM is a technology company in transition  Furthermore  this is not the first time that IBM has found themselves in this situation  I have been following IBM since the mid 1970s and watched it endure significant challenges in the late 1980s and early 1990s  In fact  I used to utilize IBM as an example of a low growth cyclical tech stock that I would not invest in  However  IBM proved me wrong  as it produced strong and consistent growth throughout the late 90s through 2013  From there it has suffered 3 years in a row of negative earnings growth  2014 through 2016  and has since produced growth below 2  per annum 
In summary  IBM is a formidable technology icon whose origins date back to the 1880s and whose operations have transcended several technology revolutions  Moreover  the company finds itself once again in transition with management  aware and attempting to right the ship by shifting its portfolio to higher value software and services  Although this includes strategic initiatives and investments in the cloud  the company also believes that companies cannot afford to move everything there  Consequently  the company sees itself in a hybrid IT world  at least according to Morningstar 
Will IBM  or can IBM be successful with its current initiatives  Clearly the jury is still out  However  there are bright spots  Nevertheless  since my objective for investing in IBM is income and safety  their future growth is less important to me than the sustainability of their business  A quick glance at IBM s acceptable current ratio of 1 37 and quick ratio of 1 18 suggests that there is little worry that IBM will not remain an ongoing concern 

Before I talk about why I believe IBM s growing dividend is safe and likely to continue  I want to point out that dividends are paid on a per share basis  Additionally  one of the most often cited criticisms of IBM in recent times has been their aggressive share purchases  In 2007 IBM had 1 39 billion shares outstanding  At the end of fiscal year 2017 their share count had fallen to 922 million shares  Therefore  skeptics are arguing that IBM has only maintained their recent earnings levels because of financial engineering 
IBM Common Shares Outstanding  CSHO  2007 2017

To some extent  those criticisms have some validity  On the other hand  as a minority shareholder  I am primarily concerned with the level of the company s operating results that each share of stock I hold will receive  Therefore  as previously stated  dividends  which were the primary reason for my investment in IBM  are paid on a per share basis  Consequently  when the company purchases its own shares  the shares I and other minority shareholders own are receiving a bigger piece of the dividend pie  Consequently  the probability that my dividends will continue to increase is enhanced because of IBM s share purchases 
Additionally  I would like to add that I am generally neither for nor against a company repurchasing its shares  More specifically  I am in favor of a company repurchasing their shares when their valuation is low   as IBM s has been for the past 10 years  Conversely  I am against a company purchasing their shares when their valuation is high  Stated more simply  I only like to see a company buying their shares when I would also personally be willing to invest in those shares  In other words  I consider buybacks prudent and attractive when a company s valuation is low  and I consider it reckless behavior if a company is buying their stock when their valuation is high 
How Safe Are IBM s Dividends  FAST Graph Analyze out Loud Video
With the following video I will present a by the numbers look at why I consider IBM s dividend both safe and likely to continue growing in the future  Additionally  I will present a fundamental evaluation of IBM s current fair value to include the potential for that value to increase in future time 

Summary And Conclusions
I do want to be clear that I recognize the undeniable reality that IBM is facing significant challenges in today s technology environment  Andrew Lange in an analyst note update on August 27  2018 had this to say 
 IBM is in the middle of yet another digital revolution  and while the jury is still out on the long term strategic and financial success of initiatives like analytics and cloud computing  we think rising sales from these products will mostly offset slow declines in legacy businesses  IBM s large  profitable  and sticky core operations will protect the company from any precipitous slide in competitive positioning  but we think its economic moat has narrowed  as we have concerns about the economics and competitive dynamics of its newer initiatives 
IBM s pervasiveness across the enterprise IT landscape is undeniable  as the company has been at the forefront of providing high quality IT hardware  software  and services on a global scale for decades  Still  enterprise adoption of cloud computing  commoditization of hardware  and exposure to legacy IT services mean that IBM needs to pivot  Its core operations are stagnant  and the company is doubling down on higher growth  strategic imperatives   to counteract the growth shortfall  
Therefore  with all things considered  I believe IBM continues to represent an attractive dividend growth stock in today s persistently low interest rate environment  Whether the company will ever grow again  or whether the shares will ever produce significant levels of capital appreciation remains a question mark  However  I believe the certainty that the company will continue offering a growing dividend income stream is reasonably high 
In closing  IBM is an iconic technology enterprise with enormous financial resources and significant entrenchment into the IT departments of large and small organizations throughout the world  Technology is an ever changing industry  and IBM has been forced to evolve many times over its long history as a technology leader  Of course  there is no guarantee that IBM will succeed with the current initiatives  However  I for one am not yet ready to count them out  Consequently  I hope to continue to collect my dividend income for years to come  And who knows  valuation is low enough that upside surprises could happen in the next 5 to 10 years  Finally  I feel that I m being paid adequately with the growing dividend to patiently wait  Caveat emptor

174543,396059,IBM, Plastic Bank Harnesses Blockchain to Rid Oceans of Plastic Garbage ,news,"Several companies use or plan to use blockchain to fix the problem of plastic garbage in the seas and oceans  The scale of the issue is exemplified by the Great Pacific Garbage Patch  which is a mountain of some 87 000 tons of plastic waste in the ocean territory between Hawaii and California  However  it is only part of the eight million tons of plastic debris that get dumped into the oceans year after year  Vancouver based startup Plastic Bank is one of the companies trying to use the distributed ledger technology  DLT  to keep the oceans clean 
Co founder and chief digital strategist Shaun Frankson  Bloomberg Environment 

 Our goal is to be the largest recycling company without assets  We want to be the Airbnb of recycling  

He revealed that around 80  of plastic garbage comes from developing countries with poor waste management culture and infrastructure 
Plastic Bank has created a blockchain based app that rewards people with digital tokens in exchange for collected plastic bottles and allows the conversion of these tokens to goods or cash  The waste  referred to as  social plastic   is then sold to companies worldwide  The application was developed in collaboration with US tech giant  IBM   NYSE IBM   which is making a great  to the growth of the blockchain market 
Currently  Plastic Bank is operating in Haiti  Brazil  and the Philippines and wants to set up shop in Indonesia by the end of this year  The startup aims to be more than just an intermediary   its goal is to encourage people to participate and be active 

 Instead of making maybe  1 a day  they can now make  5 or  7  It s a collector first mentality  not supply chain first   Frankson noted

Going into the company s second quarter financial release  IBM  NYSE IBM  investors were cautiously optimistic that the computing giant would be able to continue the winning streak it started in 2017  After nearly six years of declining revenue growth  IBM had given investors two quarters of improvements 
Investors got what they were looking for  though the positive results were boosted by a strong dollar 

For the second quarter  IBM reported revenue of  20 billion  up nearly 4  year over year  exceeding consensus estimates of  19 88 billion  Adjusted net income of  2 8 billion increased 3  compared to the prior year quarter  producing adjusted earnings per share of  3 08  up 5   ahead of analysts  expectations of  3 04 
Revenue increased across all of the company s major business segments 

Revenue from cognitive solutions grew 0 5  year over year  but fell 1  when adjusting for currency changes resulting from a strong dollar  Global business services also benefited from exchange rates  up 2  compared to the year ago period  but it was flat when adjusting for fluctuations in currency  Technology services and cloud platforms also gained 2  compared to the prior year quarter  but they were also flat when taking exchange rates into account  The high point of the report was strength in systems hardware and operating systems software  which gained 25  year over year  or up 23  when adjusting for changes in currency 
Strategic imperatives
IBM has been banking on growth in its strategic imperatives  the company s pet name for its high growth initiatives  These areas include analytics  cloud computing  security  and mobile  and they grew to  10 1 billion for the quarter  up 13  year over year    the first time the group accounted for more than half of IBM s total revenue  Strategic imperatives generated revenue of  39 billion over the trailing 12 month period  up 15  compared to the prior 12 month period  and up 12  when adjusting for currency changes 
Cloud revenue for the previous 12 months of  18 5 billion increased 23  year over year  Another highlight was the strong performance of security revenue  which increased 81  compared to the prior 12 month period  cresting  1 billion 
 We delivered strong revenue and profit growth in the quarter  underscoring IBM s progress and momentum in the emerging  high value segments of the IT industry   said Ginni Rometty  IBM s chairman and CEO 
Looking ahead
IBM maintained its 2018 forecast for at least  13 80 in non GAAP operating earnings per diluted share  and GAAP diluted earnings per share inched higher to at least  11 60  The company continues to expect free cash flow of about  12 billion for the year and a realization rate greater than 100   IBM also expects strategic imperatives to produce trailing 12 month revenue of  40 billion by the end of 2018 
The fine print
While IBM s several quarters of improving results have given investors reasons to be optimistic  there are still several asterisks that stand out in the current quarter s results 
It s important to point out that the majority of IBM s current growth was courtesy of its legacy systems business  or the effects of favorable exchange rates  The refresh cycle on its mainframe sales will eventually slow  and exchange rates could turn against them at any time  While IBM has ridden its recent good fortune to three successive quarters of improving results  over the longer term  its cognitive solutions and cloud businesses will need to drive the majority of the growth 
So far  that hasn t been the case ",2018-07-29,Danny Vena,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibm-continues-its-growth-streak-200334300,200334300

174570,396086,IBM,HAL like robot to help astronaut in space odyssey,news,"By Joey Roulette
CAPE CANAVERAL  Fla   Reuters    A science fiction inspired robot hardwired to assist astronauts launched from Florida early Friday to become the first personal  artificial intelligence powered companion in space  
The Crew Interactive Mobile Companion  or CIMON  is an English speaking droid roughly the size of a basketball that will help German astronaut Alexander Gerst conduct experiments on the International Space Station  
 What we re trying to do with CIMON is to increase the efficiency of the astronaut   Matthias Biniok  an engineer for chip maker  IBM   N IBM  and one of the lead architects behind CIMON s artificial intelligence  told Reuters  
CIMON will verbally communicate step by step instructions to Gerst during three planned science experiments on the space station s European module  Currently  astronauts read these instructions from a laptop  which Biniok says is an arduous process that a responsive  hands free companion like CIMON can replace  
 Right now our main mission is to support the astronauts with their daily tasks to save time  because time is the most valuable and most expensive thing on the ISS   Biniok said 
SCIENCE FICTION COMIC
The German Aerospace Center plans for CIMON to undergo three one hour sessions to demonstrate how well the robot can help with experiments  like a crystal growth study  a test for its eight on board cameras and an exercise to help Gerst solve a Rubik s cube  
CIMON will return to Earth on Dec  13  
Biniok said the concept of CIMON was inspired by a 1940s science fiction comic series set in space  where a sentient  brain shaped robot named Professor Simon mentors an astronaut named Captain Future  CIMON also parallels HAL  the sentient computer in Stanley Kubrick s movie   2001  A Space Odyssey  
Philipp Schulien  a German engineer for CIMON s hardware contractor  Airbus  PA AIR   said extending astronauts  abilities in space is imperative for future space exploration journeys  like the crewed missions to Mars that are scheduled to take off as early as 2020  
 There are certain effects that might appear during long term missions like the so called groupthink effect   Schulien said  citing a behavioral phenomenon in which humans that spend lengthy periods of time in isolation are driven to make irrational decisions   Long  isolated groups tend to stop communicating with the ground   he said 
A robot like CIMON with human like personalities could help mitigate the disorientation astronauts may feel in space  Schulien said  

CIMON is among 5 900 pounds of cargo that launched to the International Space Station on Friday  atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket  It is scheduled to reach the station on Monday ",2018-06-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/hallike-robot-to-help-astronaut-in-space-odyssey-1512458,1512458

DeepCloudAI is an AI driven decentralized cloud computing platform for running decentralized applications and Internet of things  Web 3 0 DApps and IoT   Applications will execute in a secure sandbox on the peer to peer resources  with transactions managed on the blockchain via smart contracts 
Modern market technologies and services are efficient when dealing with centralized data  but can t process the AI driven information successfully  Bitcoin and Ethereum networks also fail to provide an efficient  scalable  and available platform to satisfy current market needs 
DeepCloud team is seeking to turn existing time tested cloud computing concepts into a prospective scalable system  This is achieved through three main components described in the project s whitepaper 


Network users  These are the people who use services on DeepCloud AI s platform by spending DEEP tokens  they are the main target audience 


Network contributors  node   These are the people who provide resources to the network and earn DEEP tokens  Resource Provider is required to stake up a certain number of DEEP tokens to run the nodes and offer the services to the users


Network requests  AI controller   Each node has a state in the network  The controller assigns each requests  network users  to the nodes  Some requests may have more complexity to run over the network  controller allocate these requests to run on sidechain  or master nodes 


It s worth mentioning that before starting the project DeepCloud developers spent several years developing and testing operation services and platforms  then they turned to blockchain 
DeepCloud advantages 


AI technology  AI and blockchain integration provides unique identification for each node 


Economic model  Every node will have its own token  Users will be able to earn tokens by providing certain services via the platform 


Security  Platform security system provides solution to blockchain security problems and much more 


Project s token metrics  HardCap    15mln  Total token supply   200 mln  80 mln for sale   Token price  1 DEEP  0 25  Private sale is already on

174572,396088,IBM,Nvidia  Thursday s Q2 Earnings Report Could Spark Another Rally ,opinion,"There s absolutely no sign the love affair investors have with chipmaker Nvidia  NASDAQ NVDA  will end anytime soon 
Despite trade tensions between the US and China which hit some technology stocks hard in recent weeks  Nvidia depends on China for roughly 18  of its revenue   the company s stock remains strong  It s up more than 50  over the past year  outperforming the benchmark Semiconductor Index by a big margin 

The Santa Clara  CA based company reports quarterly numbers later today  Thursday  after the US market close  The consensus view for fiscal second quarter earnings is for  1 66 a share on  3 1 billion in revenue  That would mean revenue growth of an impressive 39  compared to the same period a year ago 
Judging by the history and robust demand for NVDA s products  we see no reason it can t post another blowout quarter  Nvidia has beaten expectations on profit and sales for 11 straight quarters 
Gaming Still A Force  New Growth Areas Emerging
The demand for the company s video gaming and data center chips its two main markets remains strong  In the first quarter  data center revenue surged 71   while sales from gaming  which represents more than half the company s total revenue  rose 68  
Nvidia is benefiting from the robust market for personal computers  where graphic cards remain tightly supplied  allowing chipmakers to charge higher prices  As well  Nvidia s skill at finding new growth areas for its graphic chips has been the main reason why the company has been so successful  Data center operators  for example  are increasingly using Nvidia products to perform the parallel work of artificial intelligence computing 
The gaming business  which currently generates 60  of Nvidia s revenue  has been supplemented by the diversion of high end graphics chip cards into cryptocurrency mining  The world s most powerful supercomputer  developed by IBM  NYSE IBM   is equipped with six of Nvidia s Tesla V100 graphic processors 
Crypto Mining Could Be Weak Spot
One risk to Nvidia s Q2 earnings is the shrinking demand from the highly volatile cryptocurrency mining business  In the last quarter  Nvidia generated  289 million in sales to cryptocurrency miners  That revenue may fall by 2 3 in the second quarter  according to the company s latest guidance 
Despite the potential setback from its crypto business  we think Nvidia is in a great position to offset any revenue losses by the improving sales from its innovative gaming and data center products  Nvidia s unchallenged dominance in the sector will keep its profit margins high 
In the fiscal first quarter of 2018  the gaming segment contributed to a 510 basis point expansion in the gross margins over the same period a year ago  up 64 7   non GAAP  
Bottom Line
Despite the near term uncertainties around the crypto business and ongoing trade war hazards  we don t see a major threat to Nvidia s longer term prospects  The company is pursuing growth in multiple markets  such as autonomous vehicles  artificial intelligence  machine learning and data center processing  where its prospects remain extremely bright ",2018-08-16,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/strong-nvidia-earnings-should-spark-another-rally-200337986,200337986

174587,396103,IBM, Banks   Blockchain Based  Payment Systems Are Not Really Blockchain  Ripple s Schwartz Says ,news,"Ripple s chief cryptographer David Schwartz indicated in a recent  that banks might find it challenging to apply distributed ledgers  or blockchains  for cross border payments  This is because the technology faces privacy and scalability issues  at least for now  It means that some banks  among which Santander  MC SAN   have not been accurate when announcing the development or launch of  blockchain based  cross border payment systems 
 I will concede  we haven t gotten there yet   Schwartz  Reuters  referring to the use of distributed ledger technology  DLT  in processing payments at international level 
In mid April  banking giant Santander  the launch of One Pay FX  an international payments system based on Ripple s xCurrent technology  The platform became available to users in Spain  the US  Brazil  and Poland  However  as Schwartz put it  xCurrent is not a distributed ledger in the full sense of the word  It uses bi directional messaging that can be put on a blockchain afterward 
Santander would not comment on the situation 
It is true that xCurrent relies on cryptography  but it does not directly deal with a blockchain at all  It cannot be compared to the distributed ledgers provided by Ethereum or Hyperledger 
xCurrent applies an immutable  interledger protocol  meant to improve the existing payment systems thanks to its instant settlement features 

 What we hear from many of our customers is that it s imperative to keep their transactions private  process thousands every second  and accommodate every type of currency and asset imaginable   Schwartz stated 

Marcus Treacher  Ripple s SVP of customer success  explained why distributed ledgers are still unlikely for international payments 

 We started out with your classic blockchain  which we love  The feedback from the banks is you can t put the whole world on a blockchain  

In the future  however  Schwartz expects that open ledgers such as the XRP Ledger will be used for the settlement of payments on a global level as banks will adopt xRapid  another product offered by Ripple 
Besides Santander  Ripple s xCurrent has been tested and used by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority  SAMA  and the 61  currently comprising the Japan Bank Consortium
Even though Schwartz says distributed ledgers are not yet possible for international payments  some banks collaborate with other blockchain providers for the same tasks  Thus  R3  last year it was working with 22 banks to build real time payments infrastructure based on Corda  Elsewhere   IBM   NYSE IBM  and Stellar have developed a blockchain based payments system in the South Pacific region ",2018-06-14,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/banks-blockchainbased-payment-systems-are-not-really-blockchain-ripples-schwartz-says-1492582,1492582

174589,396105,IBM, Walmart Awarded 3 Blockchain Related Patents ,news,"US retail giant Walmart  NYSE WMT   the world s largest company by revenue  received last week three patents from the US Patent and Trademark Office for several blockchain related systems  The patents refer to a system for obtaining medical records on blockchain  a method and system for managing demand on an electrical grid  and a system for controlling access to a locked place  Besides Walmart   IBM   NYSE IBM  and Cisco also saw their patent application approved last Thursday  
Walmart s blockchain based  allows patient data to be stored in a distributed ledger  The medical records can then be accessed in emergency situations when a patient is unresponsive  Due to privacy issues  only medical data that is emergency specific should be put on blockchain 
The system has three key devices  one of which is a wearable object that has the function of a local storage medium for the distributed ledger  A bracelet would be an ideal option for the wearable device  There is also a biometric scanner needed to get a patient s biometric signature  like fingerprint  iris  or retina  and an RFID scanner used to scan the wearable device  Walmart filed the patent application in December 2016 
Aside from the medical records system  Walmart was granted a  for a blockchain based energy network  It will be able to cap the supply of electricity based on the use of a cryptocurrency as a method of payment  The company applied for the patent in late 2017 
The solution will help to combat inefficient electricity use by home appliances and other devices  The system will allow a limited amount of cryptocurrency to be issued to each device  Thus  the user can buy the right amount of energy for a certain period 
Walmart s third blockchain related  refers to a system that can help users securely control or limit the access to a real or virtual space  The system uses cryptographic keys stored on a blockchain 
In April 2018  we  that Walmart had filed two patent applications for blockchain based products or systems  The retail giant wanted to leverage the technology for a vendor payment sharing system and a courier shopping system

174590,396106,IBM,3 Reasons Behind Bitcoin And Other Cryptocurrency Surges Today,opinion,"Another big day for the cryptocurrency market as major coins extended their gains from the beginning of the week  While there is an obvious technical reason behind the surge as I covered on Monday and on Tuesday  the fundamentals have also played a big role  Here s an overview of the biggest positive news coverage for this week 
1  First and foremost  the world s first bank owned cryptocurrency exchange opened in Japan  Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings Inc formally launched its cryptocurrency exchange platform  on Tuesday  calling it VCTRADE  The launch came nearly two years after its initial announcement and after months of delays this year  So the fans obviously got a kick out of that 
2  The other big news was from the US tech giant  IBM  who has teamed up with financial technology start up Stronghold on a cryptocurrency that s pegged to the US dollar  IBM is exploring whether a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar may be a better option for making payments than other digital currencies  which tend to be volatile  While this news could be bitter sweet for crypto fans  to people who are on the fence about the whole cryptocurrency industry  this could mean that the industry is here to stay  one way or another 
3  The third piece of positive news came from Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and its new CEO  David Solomon  His new position announcement created a buzz in the crypto market because he is known to be keen in Bitcoin and other digital coins 
So there you have it  The bullish market could continue until the end of this week  but remember that what goes up  must come down  Personally  I believe we could still see another round of pullback before the real uptrend restarts in the markets

RCBC identified its partners as Osaka based Kansai Urban Banking Corp and Kobe based Minato Bank 
Manny Narciso  senior VP at RCBC  said during the launch 

 We want to serve the OFWs  overseas Filipino workers  in Japan through this technology and we re doing it in partnership with two Japanese banks  For the OFWs in Japan  the service will make remittance faster and cheaper as we will collect less fees  

He added that RCBC s alliance with Resona was the result of the growing business opportunities in the Philippines 

 We have a partnership already with Resona and we re looking at them as our first option   Narciso said 

Initially  the service would be offered to OFWs based in Japan  but Japanese nationals could also avail themselves of the new technology to send money to the Philippines  Narciso said 
He added that using blockchain technology would eliminate the need for third party services  like the SWIFT network  and make money transfers faster and cheaper  Moreover  transactions from Japan will now happen in real time because they would not pass through all the other parties 
According to Narciso  the choice of Japan for the launch of the blockchain remittance service is due to the volume of remittances coming from that country to the Philippines  In fact  Japan is the largest source of money transfer in Asia  he added 
Data from the Philippine central bank showed that Filipino workers in Japan sent home  137 4 million in total last month  which is the highest amount in the region

174609,396125,IBM,Pre IPO Coverage  Domo  Inc   DOMO ,opinion,"Check out this week s Danger Zone interview with Chuck Jaffe of Money Life 
Domo  Inc   DOMO   a business intelligence and data visualization provider  will IPO on Thursday  June 28  At a price range of  19 to  22 per share  the company plans to raise up to  189 million and has an expected market cap of  511 million  At the midpoint of its price range  DOMO currently earns our Very Unattractive rating 
Domo s proposed valuation is less than a quarter of the  2 3 billion valuation assigned by its last private funding round in April 2017  The company comes to market burning cash at a rapid rate and needing an infusion of capital to fund its operating costs  Meanwhile  concerns over slowing growth and CEO Josh James  history of self dealing have investors justifiably spooked 
Some investors may view these recent struggles as a buy low opportunity  but that could be a big mistake  Despite the recent price drop  Domo still has highly optimistic growth expectations baked into its stock price  Investors should stay away from this IPO 
Record Low Profitability
Domo has the unenviable distinction of earning the lowest return on invested capital  ROIC  of any of the 2 800  companies we cover  With an ROIC of  344   it lost over three dollars for every dollar invested in its business in 2017  Since ROIC is the primary driver of valuation  1  Domo s extremely negative ROIC is a major red flag for investors 
Figure 1 shows that DOMO s losses have remained steady  Even as revenue grew by 46  in 2016  after tax operating profit  NOPAT  remained roughly flat at negative  175 million 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
A deeper look at the number doesn t reveal much cause for optimism  Gross margin did increase slightly in 2017  from 56  to 59   but that increase was driven solely by a shift in the revenue mix from Professional Services to Subscription revenue  Subscription gross margins actually declined slightly from 63 4  to 62 9  
Marketing Spend Is Unsustainable
In addition to its comparatively low gross margins  Domo s huge losses are driven by its sky high marketing spend  The company spent  132 million   121  of revenue   on sales and marketing in 2017 
Potential investors should be alarmed that Domo s large marketing budget has not led to higher growth  Figure 2 compares Domo to several other high profile tech IPOs in 2018 on the basis of revenue growth and selling expense as a percentage of revenue  It shows that Domo ranks in the middle of pack in terms of growth despite spending nearly double that of the next highest company 
Figure 2  Revenue Growth and Selling Expenses for Recent Tech IPOs

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Even worse  Domo s revenue growth is slowing even as its sales and marketing budget remains sky high  Revenue growth slowed to 32  year over year in Q1 while the company spent 124  of revenue on sales and marketing 
Domo s huge marketing budget led to free cash flow of   160 million in 2017  With just  72 million in cash on hand  the company must cut back on its expenses significantly or constantly raise new capital 
One place where Domo has already cut costs is in research and development  where its spending declined by 3  in 2017  Underinvesting in the product while overspending on marketing could be a bad sign for the long term health of the company 
Shareholders Have Little Control  CEO Gets 86  of Voting Power
Domo follows in the footsteps of other recent IPOs like Dropbox  NASDAQ DBX  and Snapchat  NYSE SNAP  by issuing dual class shares that keeps voting power in the hands of its founder  Despite holding just 15  of the company s shares  CEO Josh James will have 86  of the voting power  meaning outside shareholders will effectively have no say in the direction of the company 
CEO Has History of Self Dealing With Family Businesses
The dual class share structure is especially concerning for Domo  as CEO Josh James has revealed a troubling lack of judgement in the past  The company has been involved in a significant amount of self dealing  such as leasing a jet and hiring catering and furnishing services from companies owned by James and his siblings  The company recently filed an amended S 1 saying it has terminated these relationships  but the existence of these conflicts in the first place is a major red flag 
Family  Friends and Insiders Seek Loophole to Avoid Lock up
In that amended filing  Domo also brought up a new red flag with the announcement of a direct share program to sell shares in the IPO to company insiders as well as their friends and families  Notably  the friends and families would not be subject to any lockup period in this agreement  meaning they could buy shares at the IPO price and quickly flip them for a profit in the event of a first day pop 
Taken together  all these governance issues point to a company that is run for the benefit of insiders and executives rather than for shareholders 
Our Discounted Cash Flow Model Reveals More Potential Downside Risk
Despite the 75  decline in its valuation over the past year  the growth expectations for Domo are still unrealistically high  Our dynamic DCF model quantifies exactly what kind of future cash flows the market price of a stock implies a company will generate 
To justify the midpoint IPO price of  20 50 share  Domo must achieve pre tax margins of 15    comparable to large enterprise software provider like IBM  NYSE IBM    and grow revenue by 20  compounded annually for the next seven years  The proposed IPO valuation implies that Domo can significantly cut back on its marketing expenses while still maintaining a relatively high growth rate 
Specifically  the company would have to cut sales and marketing costs from 120  to 35  of revenue  maintain its current gross margin on subscription revenue of 63   and keep all other operating costs at current levels while still growing revenue at 20  annually  Also  Domo would go from having the worst ROIC of any company in our coverage universe to earning a top quintile 37  ROIC in seven years  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here 
If Domo achieves 10  pre tax margins and grows revenue by 11  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth just  8 share today  62  below the midpoint of the IPO range  In this scenario  Domo would go from having the worst ROIC of any company in our coverage universe to earning a top quintile 24  ROIC in ten years  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here 
Critical Details Found in Financial Filings By Our Robo Analyst Technology
As investors focus more on fundamental research  research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings  Below are specifics on the adjustments we make based on Robo Analyst 2  findings in Domo s S 1 
Income Statement  we made  2 million of adjustments  with a net effect of removing  2 million in non operating expense  2  of revenue   Our biggest adjustment was removing  1 million in non operating expense due to the implied interest cost on operating leases  You can see all the adjustments made to DOMO s income statement here 
Balance Sheet  we made  17 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of  16 million  The largest adjustments was  17 million in operating leases  This adjustment represented 62  of reported net assets  You can see all the adjustments made to DOMO s balance sheet here 
Valuation  we made  84 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  84 million  There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value  Outside of the operating leases mentioned above  the largest adjustment to shareholder value was  20 million in outstanding employee stock options  This option adjustment represents 4  of DOMO s proposed market cap

174610,396126,IBM,Magic Blockchain Dust,opinion,"This one really threw me for a loop this morning    

Firstly  kudos to the Australian Government for embracing and exploring opportunities in blockchain  But some people are wondering is how blockchain can improve government services 
Blockchain technology s main use is for creating immutable  open source  borderless  censorship resistant  and trustless data  These are not usually something government services need  Whatever the Australian Government is working on to improve data security and whatever else might surely be done more efficiently with a centralized database 
The more I dug into this story though  the more I found things just not adding up  Buzzwords like blockchain  artificial intelligence  and quantum computing are being thrown around and it seems like a lot of people don t really understand what they mean 
Both IBM  NYSE IBM  and Australian politicians are claiming this as a win  even though it s not at all clear how this will affect the already murky relations between the two parties 
What is clear is that if Australia would like to meet their goal to be one of the top three digital governments in the world by 2025  they might want to start by fixing the internet  which is reportedly slower than Khasakstan 
If governments around the world want to help foster innovation with blockchain  which they should  the best place to start is by creating the right regulatory environment for companies to start disrupting business activities and sectors that are ripe for change  It s not entirely clear that public services is the right place to start 
Today s Highlights
So it Begins
Is the Bear Coming 
Ripple in Japan and the USA

Traditional Markets
The trade war has now officially begun 
This morning  the United States has imposed groundbreaking tariffs on  34 billion worth of Chinese goods  China has responded with an equal amount of counter tariffs 
Looking at the stock markets you wouldn t necessarily notice any reaction to today s updates though 
The China 50 and Nikkei 225 are up more than 1  today and the European markets opened notably flat 

It probably makes sense though that the reaction to this specific update has been muted  After all  the markets have had adequate time to prepare for this event and so it wasn t at a surprise or shock 
The bigger question is where do we go from here 
Is this entire trade war thing just a distraction as many seem to think  or will it get worse and affect the entire global supply chains as other have claimed 
Well  unfortunately  nobody can really answer that question so it seems that most are just kind of getting picky about their investments 
A recent report from Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  has indicated that more than 100  of the S P500 s returns so far this year have come from just 10 stocks 

Also  look out for the US Jobs report today at 8 30 AM New York time  All evidence suggests that it should go smoothly  However  if there are any surprises in the data it definitely has the potential to shake things up  especially with many traders still on holiday there 
Ripple in Japan
Yesterday a new cryptocurrency exchange came online in Japan  which is backed by the powerhouse financial firm SBI Holdings  T 8473  
The new service is currently doing a gradual rollout that will only be available for 20 000 of their 4 million customers to get started and will only offer a single digital asset    XRP 
Speculations are running high on reddit as to what this might mean for the price of the tokens 
Meanwhile  in the United States  things don t seem to be going so great for Ripple 

Ripple Labs and its founders have been slapped with the thrid lawsuit from investors claiming that the XRP tokens should actually be considered as unregistered securites 
The US government has already come clean and indicated that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not considered securities  However  the jury is still out on Ripple s XRP token  We ll be watching this one very closely going forward

174613,396129,IBM, Commerzbank Succeeds in Processing Corporate Forex Deal on Blockchain ,news,"Commerzbank  DE CBKG  and steel producer ThyssenKrupp  on Wednesday a foreign exchange  forex  transaction with the help of blockchain technology  making this the first deal of its kind for a German company 
The parties concluded that blockchain could be used to speed up processing and cut costs  On Thursday  Frankfurt based Commerzbank said the technology did a great job at reducing errors and delays 
ThyssenKrupp traded an EUR PLN FX Forward deal with Commerzbank  using the latter s FX Live Trader platform  The deal  which totaled 500 000 euro with a one month tenor  was replicated on blockchain  The confirmation was sent to ThyssenKrupp via Corda  a blockchain platform developed by the R3 consortium 
Commerzbank manager Nikolaus Giesbert commented on the transaction 

 Reconciliation is a major issue for banks when trading FX  Significant resources are dedicated to resolving the issues that occur during the matching process  This deal demonstrates how the use of distributed ledger can transform and digitalize the processes in this space  
 Commerzbank is pleased to be working with ThyssenKrupp on this deal and to further develop digital banking solutions for corporate   he added 

Even though the deal was confirmed as successful  the German bank noted that further development of technical  regulatory and legal conditions was needed in order to leverage the full potential of blockchain 
Thomas Empelmann  head of corporate finance at ThyssenKrupp  said 

 The comprehensive insight into the Blockchain process clearly shows how to connect market participants in the future in a highly secure and efficient manner while reducing transaction costs by avoiding external software solutions  

He added that the technology simplified processes  ensured maximum transparency  and reduced the difficulties related to financial integration

174614,396130,IBM, Block Show Berlin  How Enterprises Use the Blockchain ,news,"Startups are not the only ones using blockchains and distributed ledgers   established enterprises are also aboard with the concept  noted Mike Butcher  editor at large at TechCrunch  as he kicked off a panel discussion during Block Show Europe in Berlin 
According to Artiona Bogo  blockchain development expert at SAP  using blockchain technology for agriculture is one of the avenues for using the technology to reach end consumers  The presence of blockchain will not replace current powerful systems  but may be a complimentary layer to established business processes  she said 
Blockchain Solutions Create New Markets
Some of the most exciting implementations  according to the panelists  go beyond agriculture and ethical supply chains  Sustainable timber supply chain has been one real world application which shortens administrative tasks and paperwork  For small artisanal manufacturers  certification on the blockchain may be a handy source of proving the origins and quality of the product 
The blockchain turned out to create a new business model  by creating an online catalogue and reaching new buyers  explained Marc Taverner  worldwide ambassador of BitFury  Local craftsmen managed to offer their artisanal products in premium priced catalogs  due to the availability of blockchain certification 
Pharmaceutical supply chains have been tackled by SAP  for an efficient way of controlling counterfeit drugs  Joost Volker also added that blockchain certification could be used in the pharmaceutical industry in Africa  where counterfeit drugs are a big problem  If government grants some support  enterprises could move into blockchain technologies and offer a working solution  added Volker 
Marc Taverner also believes governments have a key role when it comes to enterprises adopting blockchain technologies  He believes government permissions and regulatory clarity are key  and that blockchain solutions would take off just like the Internet  which was slow initially 
Technical Talent Scarcity
Mike Butcher also raised the question of the shortage of technical talent   a lot of early blockchain adopters may be unwilling to join corporations in their blockchain development efforts  when they could just as easily take up a project of their own 
Antoine Verdon  co founder and CEO at Proxeus Swiss Entrepreneur  noted that even now it is difficult to find cutting edge developers to join a corporate blockchain solutions team  Most experts prefer to build their own projects  or ask for very high consultancy fees  Verdon believes the future is in widgets  toolboxes and ready made solutions  which his team will aim to offer  This would help corporations go one step down the technical side and focus on the business side  he said  Some corporations may not need to hire in house talent 
Open Source and Startups Used by Larger Corporations
Most innovation still comes from startups  and not from older companies that may be carrying obsolete processes  said Frank Fu of Meitu  advisor to the Fantasy Sports platform  MyDFS 
Some enterprises use the newly emerged innovations  the panelists agreed   and open source projects are a good entry point for large corporations  Most projects have open source code allowing corporations to build their in house solutions from freely available code  One example isfor cross border payments 
Mike Butcher added his observation that the newly emerging blockchain market is increasing collaboration between the public and private sectors  as well as between large corporations and startups 
The discussion showed that giants like SAP and Oracle  NYSE ORCL  have readiness to enter the world of blockchain development  but for now  the process is very tentative  with questions on the best way to attract talent  as well as the problems that can be solved ",2018-05-28,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/block-show-berlin-how-enterprises-use-the-blockchain-1465008,1465008

Maersk and IBM have been collaborating for the last two years to digitize shipping procedures  In January  the two companies  the creation of a blockchain platform to speed up processing and cut costs  At that time  the Maersk said that the system would be ready by mid 2018 
According to Smith  two blockchain applications are on the way  one that improves the visibility of a product s supply chain  and another that cuts paperwork and bureaucracy 
Last week    Big Four  professional services firm EY and Guardtime  the first blockchain based platform for marine insurance  with Maersk being one of the commercial users  It is reported that the platform will handle over 500 000 automated transactions and support risk management for over 1 000 commercial vessels in the first 12 months 
Lars Henneberg  Maersk s head of risk and insurance  commented 

 Our ambition is to drive the digital transformation of the transport and logistics industry and we see this platform as a testament to the value that can be extracted from streamlining areas of our industry that still rely on manual and often complex procedures  
 Operating around 350 owned container vessels across the world  marine insurance takes up considerable resources for us  Moving it to this platform is helping us automate manual processes and alleviate a range of inefficiencies and frictional costs in the way we have used to trade marine insurance   he said ",2018-05-29,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/maersk-to-launch-2-blockchain-apps-with-ibm-starts-using-eys-insurwave-1466510,1466510

174622,396138,IBM, Cryptovest Exclusive  Q A With Reuben Yap  COO  Zcoin ,news,"On the second day of the Blockshow Europe 2018 conference  we had the pleasure of meeting up with Reuben Yap  the COO of  a privacy coin that differentiates itself from Monero and Zcash by using an original protocol that provides its own flavor of transaction masking by minting and burning coins in its transactions 
We spoke at length about Zcoin  its future  how privacy coins in general are fairing  legal issues  politics  and the future of ASIC resistance a battle that s been raging for some years now  and it seems as if though ASIC manufacturers have the upper hand  for now 
CV  How does Zcoin differentiate itself from other privacy coins like Zcash and Monero 
RY  First of all  we use a completely different cryptography for our privacy scheme  Monero uses ring signatures and Zcash uses something like Zerocash zk SNARKS is basically the foundation of their cryptography 
We use something called Zerocoin  which was like a predecessor to Zerocash  but it has certain advantages where you have an auditable supply using fancy cryptography  I guess there are not that many independent privacy implementations out there 
We have many Monero clones  we have Sumo  
CV  Even Wownero
RY  Yeah  and all this other stuff  And we have Monero Classic now and all this other stuff 
With Zcash  you have basically coins like Zclassic   Bitcoin  Private  Zencash  Komodo  all of them are just taking that privacy implementation from Zcash  For us  we re quite independent  We basically are the first to implement the Zerocoin protocol  which is often seen as kind of like this older protocol  but we feel it has certain advantages in cryptography not necessarily  following the idea of    The newer it is  the better it is  
Generally  the more tested it is  the better it is  This is something we can talk about later  about how we are moving away from this system to a more advanced privacy system  and to address many of the issues that are plaguing current privacy coins right now  including adoption of the privacy transactions 
 telegram banner 
CV  One of the concerns that I have is that a lot of exchanges have been removing privacy coins like Coincheck  most recently  removing Dash  Monero  Zcash  What kind of reassurances do we have that these coins could still be traded  especially Zcoin  in the future 
RY  Yes  we have seen  I guess  in Japan  that there s been quite a lot of worries about privacy coins and delisting them  But on the other hand  you have Gemini listing Zcash  which is a totally regulated  exchange   yet they could list a privacy coin 
So  that s quite interesting  I don t think there s a clear answer of where we ll be going  but I do believe that decentralized exchanges is a way to achieve these types of things  Because right now  even Binance are looking at  
As long as you have a centralized exchange  you re basically a target  But now  we ve recently got Blocknet DX integration  we re integrated into the Decred exchange  we re integrated into Komodo  so they all have these atomic swaps in exchanges  I guess that s one way of making sure that there are always exchanges for Zcoin or privacy coins in general 
I don t think anyone has quite solved the issue of fiat conversion to privacy coins  but I guess that in those cases you know  you can have a regulation the idea is that you can always go from a fiat exchange to a non privacy coin and then always use another service to change it into a privacy coin 
I mean that s one way  It s a bit convoluted  but I don t think this is the  end  of privacy coins per se and I do think that the Gemini listing of Zcash is a very positive movement in that regard 
CV  The problem with that convoluted system that you were talking about  though  is that you still have a trail 
RY  Yeah  you have a trail  but it just stops there  I mean  I guess what you re saying is that   Oh  you know what  I have a trail buying the Bitcoin  
I don t know if there s a way to totally remove that  Of course  it s not ideal  You have that trail  A P2P system where  
CV  Local Zcoin 
RY  Local Zcoin  Localbitcoin  Those are also solutions that we re looking at as well  There s no one shot that cures it all  It s a matter of having a decentralized exchange  having P2P exchanges  making sure that we are still listed on the exchanges that are more privacy friendly  I don t think it s clear cut that all exchanges will be removing privacy coins 
And I do think that a lot of the issues with privacy coins is that coins like Monero have been very  They re not shy to talk about criminal types of activities and they re quite proud of it 
Zcash  on the other hand  are much more realistic  talking about privacy as a basic financial right  And the way we see it is that privacy is   My money is my business  
We re not here necessarily to do nefarious activities  And as long as we manage to change that narrative and convince governments that privacy coins are not going to screw them over after all  cash is more private than any of these systems if you think about it they shouldn t be fighting these things   Otherwise  you d be forcing these privacy coins into the dark market  when it shouldn t necessarily be so 
 telegram banner 
CV  Governments are still  I don t think this will ease governments  opinions because I don t think that governments ever were particularly as concerned with  Well  they might be more concerned with money laundering than with tax evasion  But they still will be concerned ultimately with tax evasion quite a lot 
RY  Tax evasion  I mean  It s a tricky issue  I really have no idea how the governments are going to react to privacy coins in general because  of course  you can say   Yeah  I m going to ban all privacy coins   but that s just going to bring them underground in the unregulated sphere 
I don t think they should be doing it  I guess it s a similar argument like prostitution  Should we legalize it  Should we not legalize it  If you don t legalize it  then it just goes underground and you just lose total control of it 
At least if you have the privacy coins at the exchange level  at the very moment when you convert your privacy coins to fiat and what not   governments  can regulate that  And I think that s OK 
If you say   I convert my privacy coins to fiat and I want to get taxed on that   it s not about tax evasion  But we are about  I guess  basic financial privacy  That s what we re trying to do 
You raised a very good problem  I don t think that we have an exact solution to that  for sure  We re more about the technology  and of course  you bring very good issues about whether privacy coins will achieve adoption 
But I don t think anyone has a silver bullet for that right now 
CV  What s in Zcoin s future right now 
RY  Right now  we  just launched  several things that are really important I would say three things one of them being MTP  Merkle tree proofs  our new proof of work algorithm  The second would be our next generation privacy protocol  and I guess the third would be user experience 
User experience is something that has been really  really neglected in the privacy coin space and even other cryptocurrencies  They don t think so much about this  It s about geeks doing this cool technological stuff and people don t get it  especially with privacy coins  they are much harder to use than  say  a regular currency 
And if you ve taken a look at this academic paper  breaking the anonymity of Zcash   although Zcash s technology is really good they are industry leading  they are great scientists and great researchers what that research shows is that when you don t have a system where it actually educates the user on how to use it  many people were using Zcash in a way that was de anonymizing them 
They thought that   If I just change the address and bring it back  it s automatically anonymized   without realizing that if you re burning 1 75 coins and you re redeeming 1 75 coins  I have a good estimation that these 1 75 coins were the same ones that you burnt 
And all these usability issues are really affecting and compromising privacy on Zcash  Monero has really taken a good step  Monero actually started out without having privacy on by default  then it moved to privacy on by default  which takes a lot of the user error out 
But at the same time  there s also studies on how you can use Monero wrongly and there s been ways that Monero transactions also have been compromised  But in general  I think that Monero has a very complete product 
Having privacy on by default has a lot of benefits  But I do think that they ve kind of reached the limit of their technology in the sense that in Monero  when you re using ring signatures  you re limited by the ring sizes 
You re going to get anonymity sets in the thousands or millions or stuff like that  It s going to be 5  12  13  maybe  maybe 100 at most 
 telegram banner 
CV  But wouldn t that be enough 
RY  Not necessarily  I mean  we re always talking about  the best   And I actually spoke to some of the analytics guys and they were saying   Yes  it s one in five  but I kind of know that this transaction is being used for illicit activity  
It s kind of like by elimination  In one in five  you can still do it all by elimination  But with one in millions  it s really hard to do elimination there 
I guess that s the idea  Also  in those cases where in Monero there is a per transaction basis  your anonymity set is limited per transaction while with zero knowledge proofs  or Zcash or Zerocoin  it s not on a per transaction basis  It s with the entire history of anyone who has done that private transaction 
It s seen as a huge benefit of zero knowledge proofs versus something like ring signatures  So  you know  we always thought   Is it enough  
Yeah  maybe last time  Bitcoin was anonymous enough  Monero was anonymous enough  but at the end of the day  Monero s key technology is actually a single point of failure 
We ve seen cases like Monero clones like ShadowCash  now known as Particl  where they made a mistake  And once that thing was compromised  everything was retrospectively de anonymized 
And similarly  with quantum computing  When quantum computing comes  then Monero transactions are retrospectively exposed  While with systems like Zerocoin  and with systems such as Zcash  the cryptography may be broken  but it still preserves the anonymity aspect 
So  that s quite important  if you re thinking 10 or 20 years from now  when QC computing might be here  And I think that s really important because  is your history from 7 years ago worthy  Maybe it is  You never know 
I do think that we shouldn t be just looking at things  from a perspective of    Oh  yeah  this is good enough  We can just stop there  
CV  Speaking on quantum computing  Do you really believe that we will see within our lifetimes a mass scale adoption of quantum computing 
RY  I do think we are definitely going to be seeing quantum computing  I mean  we have been seeing  A lot of people get confused with quantum general purpose computing  Right now  you can see that  IBM   NYSE IBM  has been steadily increasing their quantum computing capabilities 
Once you have that  it s just a matter of time before quantum computing gets mainstream  Maybe we re like ten years out or something like that  But who knows 
We re already starting to think about quantum resistance schemes  and we should be looking at schemes like this  But I guess in the next five years  we shouldn t be too worried 
I mean  Bitcoin isn t really looking into that so much just yet  It s not a remote possibility  I do think it s coming 
CV  So  what made you choose to go with a privacy coin and just that  Why not choose to have a privacy coin with features like Ethereum  where you can actually have applications built on top of it and stuff like that 
RY  Well  that s actually in our roadmap  We do have some ideas of how we want to implement it  because being built on the Bitcoin core  there are several options open like opcodes and things like that where you can bring Ethereum virtual contracts into a Bitcoin core code 
These are some things that we have to be quite careful about because once you introduce smart contract capabilities  you are in effect increasing your attack surface because there are more things that can go wrong 
There are so many smart contract platforms out there  So  what are we doing that is different 
And if you take a look at Ethereum  they are also developing something called zk SNARKS on Ethereum  which is basically an application of Zcash technology  And I m thinking   Do we really need to go down that path   to compete with all these things 
But we also develop something called Zerocoin on Ethereum where we have a smart contract that can mix coins and serve as an anonymizing layer on Ethereum  We actually have finished the smart contract for this layer right now  The only thing that s preventing us from launching it is scalability issues with Ethereum right now where the gas costs are too high 
That s also a case with zk SNARKS on Ethereum  But  hopefully  with Casper with proof of stake and further optimizations into the library  one day  we will see privacy on this smart contract platform 
It is something that is definitely in our roadmap  We want to have  maybe  applications for smart contract platforms where you really need privacy  but a cut down set of instructions  But one of the things that we really  really want is in the area of voting and polling 
We think that zero knowledge proofs really fit into those types of things where I can prove that I have voted without showing you which way I have voted  If you think about it  especially from a country like mine a southeast Asian country where we might not have the best democracy  and we may be a bit concerned about our data being leaked out 
We re actually in talks with the lower level with the Thai government to implement this type of system in small scale elections  It s not general elections  but we re saying   Look  we want to implement something where I can vote and prove that I voted but not show you which way I voted  
That is  I guess  a prototype and we want to use it as a polling system where I want to really hear the feedback of the civilians  the people  without having fear of repercussions  I would think that these types of systems are not only good as a use case but it goes to the basis of democratic governance where I can express my opinion without being singled out  but yet at the same time the government has a feedback of what their people are thinking 
 telegram banner 
CV  Do you think that there are any other use cases for this kind of thing besides elections 
RY  You mean  like  zero knowledge proofs in general 
CV  Yeah  zero knowledge proofs 
RY  Well  right now  there s this sort of discussion in which I think that with smart contract platforms  you definitely need some kind of financial privacy  We know about the financial privacy stuff  but there s also talks about something where I can prove that I have a certain balance existing without showing the individual transactions that make it up 
So  I may want to declare to the tax agency that I have X amount of balance  and prove that it s there  But I m not going to show you the individual transactions 
And that s been actually talked about in electricity  like  you know  those electric blockchains something like WePower  these types of things where I can prove that I can prove that I ve consumed a certain amount of electricity without showing you the individual transactions  which may be a bit sensitive 
These are potential use cases  But I do think that the most obvious ones will be voting and polling right now  That s my own personal opinion 
CV  Alright  so  
RY  So  we were talking about how much we know about MTP 
CV  MTP 
RY  The Merkle tree proofs that we were talking about  Right now  we think that as a privacy coin  it is very important for the hashrate to be decentralized 
CV  Hashrate 
RY  I mean  hashing power  not hashrate 
CV  Hashing power  as in mining pools 
RY  Yeah  Mining pools  We don t want to be in a situation where there are a bunch of mining farms controlling it  also because we are primarily a cryptocurrency and not a smart contract platform 
CV  You are using Equihash 
RY  No  no  That s Zcash 
CV  Oh yeah  excuse me 
RY  Yes 
CV  But you know that they just recently  That Bitmain just recently built an ASIC for this 
RY  Yes  This is the thing  So  this is something that I m really excited about because right now  we re at that point where a lot of people have given up on developing ASIC resistant algorithms because things like Equihash  Ethash  Cryptonight  all have ASICs developed for them 
MTP is  I would say  the latest weapon against ASICs  I m not saying that Bitmain is evil people  but we are generally against ASICs for decentralization reasons 
But let s talk about what the current situation is right now  A lot of people think   Equihash is broken  There s no point in developing it   First of all  Equihash is broken not because Equihash is shit  but because the parameters chosen by Zcash were quite bad 
So  you have the algorithm and you have the parameters  Equihash has certain parameters where you can adjust it up and down and increase the computational complexity 
What happened with Zcash is that they wanted to make it so that smartphones can mine Zcash  which I think is kind of a silly idea  personally  But that was one of their design goals  As a result  they had to reduce the complexity and that s why we feel that Equihash had an ASIC developed much sooner than anticipated 
CV  What happens if an ASIC is developed for Zcoin  Will you be forking it very quickly 
RY  We would think that the hard forking route is a stop gap solution because if you are going to keep on hard forking  your coin   you can do that  but first of all  all you are doing is incentivizing people not to even tell that they have an ASIC 
 I ll develop an ASIC  and I won t tell you  
That s even worse  That s much  much worse 
MTP has certain features that make it a lot harder to develop an ASIC for it  for the moment  If you take a look at the current batch of ASICs that are coming out  they are very specialized machines  They only do one thing very  very well 
They re not flexible ASICs where they can tolerate a parameter change 
Now  with MTP  the first thing that we use is a huge amount of memory  We require the miner to allocate 4 GB of memory and it is done at every single block  So  unlike with Ethash which is allocated once every hundred hours ours is allocated at every single block 
You need a huge amount of memory to actually  develop an ASIC   This brings up  first of all  development costs  and it s also interacting with the memory quite intensely so that most of the time  you will be waiting for the memory as opposed to the computational parts 
CV  Couldn t someone just make an ASIC that has a lot of memory 
RY  Yes  you can  But the thing is that MTP was actually designed to require ASICs to have a lot of memory  However  when you re interfacing with the memory  you cannot go any faster than the memory s latency 
Yes  there s talks about   Let s have SRAM  or eDRAM  or other specialized types of RAM   But none have actually gone to that size of 4 gigabytes  It s more like one megabyte or two 
RAM and chips are made with many different processing types  So  so far  even if you amalgamate it to join the memory and the computation portions  you ll still be waiting for the memory  to do its work  
There will be some benefits to making an ASIC for  MTP   but you ll be limited  You can already see this with Bitcoin miners  They re several thousand times more efficient than a computer or GPU  But then we have Scrypt miners  which are maybe 100 times more efficient  Then  you have the Equihash miners  which are maybe five times more efficient  And Ethash is even less than that 
So  I do think that this multiple is coming down a lot more  And we can make it as difficult as possible  I don t think it s possible to make it  completely  ASIC proof  but it s possible to make it really  really  really expensive to develop an ASIC for it  And the benefits from an ASIC optimization will be so low that GPUs and CPUs can still  be feasible  ",2018-06-03,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/cryptovest-exclusive-qa-with-reuben-yap-coo-zcoin-1478046,1478046

The company plans to integrate blockchain with digital user IDs to ensure a smooth and reliable connection between the trade community s members 
Silsal aims to bring exporters and importers closer to each other in terms of trade processing  Also  the platform will offer easy access to transaction status info  cut paperwork and reduce the need for physical meetings and calls  and also will speed up data sharing 
In the first phase  Silsal will be provided to freight forwarders and their clients  after which the services will be offered to other trade community members  who will be able to use it along with the existing system called mPCS  which is Maqta s Port Community System 
Abu Dhabi Ports CEO Captain Mohamed Juma Al Shamsi commented on the initiative 

 At Abu Dhabi Ports we strive to invest in cutting edge technological innovations that not only bring immense benefits to the trade community  but also play a role in the transformation of the UAE to a knowledge based  competitive economy  
 This achievement will help to further augment Abu Dhabi s position as a centre for innovation in logistics and trade   he added 

Maqta Gateway CEO Noura Al Dhaheri elaborated 

 Through Silsal  we will be offering the trade community secure and integrated access to blockchain technology  with the added value of cost and time savings through real time track and trace  reduction in paperwork and ease in extracting vital information to receive live updates  

Blockchain has already been successfully applied in the shipping and freight industries by large companies  including Danish giant A P  Moller Maersk  The latter  with  IBM   NYSE IBM  to build a DLT platform that would support trade processing and save billions of US dollars  Last week  the two companies  that they would soon launch two blockchain apps as part of the initiative  Also  Maersk started to use EY s blockchain platform called Insurwave 

 Not only have we introduced our own blockchain offering  but we have also invented our own form of digital identity  This will eliminate the need for access through passwords  which can often be a security risk   he added

After its sudden surge to the all time high level of  0 50 back in February  Stellar Lumens  and its token  XLM s price action has been as choppy as any other major cryptocurrency  However  from a fundamental point  the company is going strong  establishing partnerships with the likes of IBM  NYSE IBM   Deloitte  and Stripe 
Recent developments include becoming one of the seven currencies to be legalized in Thailand  This was permitted by the SEC which will be in effect by the end of June 
Despite its volatility in the past few months  Stellar Lumens has the highest 1 year market price gain among top 15 cryptocurrencies  Its gains were over 2600   followed by IOTA with 1500   and Monero 1100   Stellar is the world s 7th largest cryptocurrency by the market cap which is around  4 6 billion 
XLM USD Price ActionLooking at its price action on the daily chart  it has been on a downtrend since April and broke below the daily Ichimoku cloud end of May  On Monday it continued to drop almost reaching the 61  Fibonacci retracement level of  0 19  It then corrected the losses by the end of the trading day  The future cloud appears bearish 
If the current market sentiment continues  it is likely that we see XLM USD test this key support level before bottoming out  The pivot levels are set at 0 26 and 0 32  which are the 50  and 38  Fibonacci levels respectively  Once the new uptrend restart  we could see the gains to be capped at 0 39 As the 4th point of the IDDA technique  you must calculate your risk tolerance before deciding on the investment strategy that is suitable for your portfolio

a downtown medical hub has been redesigned as an  Opportunity Corridor  to bring businesses and jobs to poor neighborhoods along its way  In St  Louis  development officials are repurposing a century old hat factory into a space for small manufacturers to bring jobs back downtown  while Baltimore has committed  500 million to a private led overhaul of an old industrial zone  The efforts reflect a growing consensus among economists and policymakers that keeping the overall economy on track will not be enough to help areas left behind by a decade long recovery   The current expansion is among the longest ever and brought national unemployment to an 18 year low  Yet over 6 3 million are still out of work  many of them clustered in cities with chronic  high unemployment  A Reuters review of federal data shows that out of those unemployed about a quarter live in 50 urban counties with above average unemployment  and a third in just 100   Graphic    Often with large minority populations

million people   Bostic said  referring to the number of jobless   We can get to maximum employment and still have a lot of distress   PILE OF CASH While monetary policy works on the national level  the Fed under former chair Janet Yellen and now under chairman Jerome Powell has been only gently raising interest rates in part to see if it can help lagging areas join the recovery  However  a consensus is building among economists and politicians that the persistence of unemployment and poverty in certain areas needs to be addressed with direct   place based  policies  The tax code approved by the Republican congress in December included a bipartisan backed measure to support such locally directed efforts  granting a capital gains waiver for those who invest in locations included on a list of distressed census tracts being chosen by state governors   Advocates  who include Donald Trump s Council of Economic Advisers Chair Kevin Hassett and Jared Bernstein  a former Obama administration adviser  hope it shifts capital from buoyant stock markets and high value real estate to blighted rural pockets  struggling suburbs  or ailing inner city neighborhoods   Investors are sitting on a large pile of  unrealized  capital gains   said John Lettieri  president of the Economic Innovation Group  a think tank that sponsored a 2015 paper by Hassett and Bernstein outlining the idea    We think the scale is likely to be measured certainly in the tens of billions of dollars   Lettieri said about how much of an estimated  1 trillion in unrealized capital gains could make its way to neglected areas  Such amounts still pale with the scale of the U S  economy and critics worry the plan may only reshuffle where the poor and jobless live by speeding up gentrification in areas already on the upswing   However  while the rules for the program are still under development and its effects uncertain  several local initiatives are gaining traction even without federal tax breaks  The Fed s Bostic also noted that dollars invested in capital starved areas may have greater impact and return than elsewhere  That is a point often overlooked in national debate over issues such as tariffs  or by development authorities who traditionally focus on large  greenfield projects  say officials at the DeSales Community Development Corp in St  Louis  The non profit group is renovating a century old  87 000 square foot building in the Fox Park area that once housed a maker of high end barber chairs  then a hat factory that supplied World War II troops  The plan is to

 Finally  cryptocurrencies will experience a heavy correction of up to 90 per cent in the next 12 months and very few companies will survive this correction  While this correction will be critical to cutting through the hype  its lack of impact on financial institutions will create phenomena that we have never seen in any previous bubble burst   the report read 

GP Bullhound doesn t consider this a catastrophic thing  however  as it adds that as soon as the  crypto winter  passes   the growth dynamics for the precious few survivors will be unprecedented  
In short  the company believes that an extreme price correction in the cryptocurrency market will make some operators consolidate their influence over it  leading to eventual growth in the very long term  This conclusion reveals that GP Bullhound doesn t see the whole phenomenon flatlining entirely  Rather  much like a phoenix  it would experience a rebirth from its ashes 
In contrast  Warren Buffett  in January  but never stated when the collapse will happen or whether a recovery is on the horizon 
Adding to its predictions  GP Bullhound considers that the first  corporate ICO  may appear this year 

 We define corporate ICO as the transition of a formerly private and permissioned chain onto a public blockchain  This ICO will also likely be the first ICO based upon a consortium chain which will see several corporates join forces in a private  permissioned blockchain before setting the protocol free for the wider universe of early adopters   the company wrote 

Experts at the investment bank believe that the  automotive  raw materials or luxury goods sector  would be areas to look for this kind of innovation  Indeed  we re already seeing  IBM   NYSE IBM  establish a consortium of companies that use its blockchain technology to  
If GP Bullhound s prediction of doom and gloom for the cryptocurrency market pans out  it might not necessarily be the worst thing to happen to the market  After all  the process of creative destruction gave us a phenomenon that led to more established and reputable companies consolidating the IT sector after the crash that followed the dot com bubble ",2018-05-02,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/major-investment-bank-predicts-cryptocurrency-market-wipe-out-1427251,1427251

Speaking at Oracle s headquarters  Thomas Kurian  president of product development  that the company s software would be a blockchain powered platform as a service product  and added that it would have interoperability with other services 
According to Kurian  Oracle is already using its software to work with prominent clients  One of these clients is Banco de Chile  which is using the software to better track transactions that leave and enter its bank 
Nigeria s government is also working with Oracle to put its customs and import taxes on a blockchain 
At the beginning of October last year  we saw signs that Oracle might pursue a blockchain solution of its own when it  to develop enterprise level software on the cloud 
Nothing was heard after that announcement  giving the impression that the company might not be prioritizing this move  Despite the background work  Oracle must hurry  since  IBM   NYSE IBM  has already beat the company with its own blockchain endeavors with software based on Hyperledger Fabric 
The famous computing company recently announced to its investors that  are now using its blockchain products  including Maersk  Audi  Krungsri  and Helzberg 
It bears noting that this niche still has a lot of room to grow  but IBM has already built a strong reputation by having its own product  If Oracle s cloud focused PaaS approach provides any significant competitive advantages  it might be able to claim some of IBM s market share ",2018-05-08,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/oracle-to-get-into-blockchain-1436378,1436378

PCHAIN   is the world s first multi purpose  crosschain  system that supports Ethereum Virtual Machine  EVM   The system is suited for using large scale corporate apps based on smart contracts and artificial intelligence 
The key PChain features are the following 
1  A native multichain platform  consisting of one main blockchain and multiple derived chaines  The technology is designed to store information about user accounts and transfer of digital currency between accounts 
2  Smart contracts based on intellectual data  PCHAIN can generate valuable data  change its volume  and also embed into the Oracle smart contract chain 
3  A cross transaction chain  The smart contracts of PCHAIN can be invoked with other tokens  BCH  ERC20  
PCHAIN   technology has a wide range of applications  from operations with digital assets  provides reliable transactions recording  to gambling  law  and logistics 
Chinaledger  a coalition whose goal is to jointly support the basic platform  became a partner of the project  From this point of view  China Ledger is an alliance with the resource sharing model  Another partner is IEEE  an international non profit association of engineering experts  the world leader in the development of standards for radio electronics  electrical engineering  and hardware provision for computer systems and networks  The third partner is W3C  the World Wide Web Consortium    an organization that develops and implements technological standards for the Internet

SEED is a decentralized marketplace for developers of conversational user interfaces  CUIs   The aim of the project is to democratize the development of AI  artificial intelligence   in particular  bots  and create an alternative to corporation monopolies that hamper the development of CUI and AI technologies  A striking example is telegram bots in the form of a regular chat  where they can buy  sell  exchange  rent components for bot building 
The Seed protocol and network operation principle is as follows 
1  You go to the platform  SEED  and sign up   create a new project 
2  You specify where the technology will be used  finance  health  etc  
3  You select the type  components and a platform for the bot hosting  Skype  Slack     
4  You model personal characteristics that determine possible scenarios of communication with people using a constructor principle  this is really easy  
Supposedly  the network will be accompanied by a virtual machine to allow to quickly evaluate the efficiency and quality of the purchased template code bot   Blacklists  and the developer reputation ranking will also be created in advance 
Blockchain in the project is required due to the need to guarantee privacy and safety of user data within the SEED network  Smart contracts will regulate the exchange  lease  conditions for the transfer of intellectual property and income distribution  Ethereum is currently chosen as a platform  but if the network is overloaded or in case of some unforeseen problems  SEED can switch to another blockchain   in particular  NEO 
The project team consists of experienced experts with a strong reputation in the market  Nathan Shedroff  CEO  is a guru of business strategy and design  Mark Stephen Meadows  CTO  and the Botanic Technologies CEO has 20 years of experience in VR  15 years in NLP and five years in blockchain  Back in 2011  he developed apps for AI in research laboratories  Xerox PARC  SRI  Waag  etc   and also advised the government  Michelle Katz is the Associate Professor at the California College of Arts  Doctor of Law and an expert in licensing and intellectual property rights

The Token Fund analytical department considers the project interesting for consideration  but the large HardCap of  100 000 000 and the protracted sail  Q2 2018 is the first stage  and Q2 2019 is the second stage  makes it impossible to make recommendations for short term medium term prospects  When opting for  long   SEED has a strong chance to show good growth ",2018-04-22,Viktor Shpakovsky,https://www.investing.com/analysis/initial-coin-offerings-to-watch-pchain-seed-200307631,200307631
174683,396199,IBM,No Surprises With Gold s May Demise ,opinion,"Rhetorical questions  by rationale  are rooted in truth  We all know some of the classics   Does a bear relieve itself in the woods    Do politicians do different from that which they promise    Is the stock market going to crash    Are the Cleveland Browns a bad football team   And as we herein queried a week ago  will it be  Another May of Dismay for Gold   Why even ask  eh 
This past Tuesday with May Day barely underway   the Euro bourses shut in honour of property destruction   Gold wasted no time ringing in its month of dismay by promptly making a new low for the year  trading down to 1302 3 at precisely 07 53 Pacific Time  And to quite literally put a big red cherry on top of it  Gold s weekly parabolic trend flipped to Short  price then settling the week yesterday  Friday  at 1316  No surprise 

Aiding  indeed abetting  Gold s demise were those dirty Dollar traders  who in just the past three weeks have pushed their Index from 88 945 to now sit at 92 425  the biggest like period upswing since year end post election posturing back in December 2016  And whilst never abetting  albeit not helping  was the report from our friends over at the World Gold Council of the global demand for Gold bars and exchange traded funds backed by such as falling to a 10 year low  and thus directionally did Gold go 
 So how far down from here  mmb  
Squire doesn t mince his words  does he  Thus with a Market Rhythms analysis  we ve just come up from the air conditioned computer room wherein we ran Gold s weekly parabolic punch cards through the IBM  NYSE IBM  360 and here s what it found 
For the past two years covering 10 weekly parabolic flips   i e  five to Long and five to Short   price s average maximum follow though was 52 points and the median maximum was 44 points  Technically for this new flip to Short  we ll measure such distance from the opening price of this ensuing week  But using the present 1316 level as a surrogate  less 52 points   1264   or less 44 points   1272   That said  we know    for what has now been years    Gold nauseatingly finds endless price consternation  round Neverland   aka  The Whiny 1290s    and failing that  The Box  1280 1260   Shorting Gold is a bad idea  we oft say  but as  tis the month of May  prudent cash management is the right play 
Coming as well into play by the look of Gold s current downtrend on the daily chart appears a test of the 300 day moving average    the bright blue line we see here    presently at 1286  which vis   vis Neverland and The Box lies betwixt 

Betwixt higher and lower as well is the Economic Barometer  the past week s incoming metrics quite mixed  According to the Department of Labor Statistics  April jobs growth increased  according to Automatic Data Processing  it decreased  The rate of Unemployment declined  but growth in Hourly Earnings slowed  The pace of Personal Spending in March increased  the pace of Personal Income decreased  Q1 Productivity increased  but so did Q1 Unit Labor Costs  March Factory Orders rose  but Construction Spending fell  The trade deficit was reduced in March and the Chicago Purchasing Managers  Index increased in April  yet March s Pending Home Sales significantly slowed  along with slippage in both the Institute for Supply Management s April Manufacturing and Services Indices as well as in Vehicle Sales  Too much information  That s the beauty of the single blue Baro line 

And amidst it all  the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index is closing in on the Federal Open Market Committee s preferred year over year target of 2   They ve got their full employment  they ve got their preferential inflation  they ve got the word  Go   to further withdraw dough  Fortunately  we re told that Q1 Earnings Season is  Great   despite the price earnings ratio of the S P 500 having not fallen  Bob Shiller s CAPE measure is 31 7x  our  live  measure is 55 3x  and the unweighted median is 38 4x   As for the Index itself portrayed by the red line in the above chart  its state remains one of chaotic confusion    which we all know leads to you know what  as appeared amongst the Dow Jones wires this past week   The new stock market fear  Signs that a period of harmonious global growth is crumbling  
And when all around goes crumblin  one expects the precious metals to be a bubblin   So even starting May in affright  they spent the balance of the week attempting to put it right  But the descending blue dots of regression trend consistency that we next see across the daily bars for Gold on the left and Silver on the right are proven technical negatives and they ve further room to fall    certainly so for the latter  albeit Sister Silver  loves  being at home in the 16s 

Nearer term per their respective 10 day Market Profiles  both Gold  left  and Silver  right  have bounded off their bottoms  the support and resistance trading apices as denoted 

In sum  of this year s 251 total trading days  166  66   await in the balance  And thus far in 2018  Gold has  barely  survived dipping into the 1200s  But shall they trade   Yes    barring some fundamental saving grace immediately swooping in to save the day   indeed we expect to see the 1200s as this new parabolic Short trend runs its course  Yet shall Gold then reverse up to finally reach Base Camp 1377 this year   Yes     barring bits  t    which Nouriel  Dr  Doom  Roubini this past Wednesday declared as bulls  t at the Milken Institute Global Conference in New York    gaining global acceptance as the world s currency   And in turn  upon Gold reaching all those lovely  buy stops  up there at 1377  do we still anticipate seeing 1434 as this year s  conservative  high trade for Gold   Absolutely

IBM Earnings Report
International Business Machines topped its fourth quarter earnings report last January posting a growth of 3 5  on its revenue to  22 4 billion on earnings of  5 18 per share in line with analyst estimates  The company posted another earnings beat on Tuesday after the company suffered a revenue decline for the past twenty quarters or almost six years before the quarter which ended in December 2018 
For the first quarter  IBM announced a decline of 43 7  in their adjusted gross profit margin which is lower than their reported decline of 44 5  during the same quarter last year  According to IBM  the gross margin decline it experienced during the quarter was mostly due to significant one time charges it experienced during the quarter 
The company s chief financial officer  James Kavanaugh stated during the earnings call with analysts that the company has been able to conduct costs cutting as well as one time charge worth  610 million during the first quarter but did not go on into details  The company was also expected to hold layoffs under IBM CEO Ginni Rometty who have extended efforts in preventing any further decline from its legacy business 
Due to the changes made in the U S  tax code  the company had a tax benefit worth  810 million  The tech company posted a revenue of  19 1 billion for their first quarter earnings exceeding most analyst expectations the company posting a revenue of  18 8 billion representing a 5  growth from the same quarter last year 
IBM has boosted its efforts in transitioning its business and focusing more on offering cloud computing services  mobile technologies  and data analytics as well as security  For the quarter  revenue of the company from the said business or its strategic imperatives have grown by 15  to  9 billion 
Weak Full Year Profit Forecast
While the company posted a positive earnings report for the quarter  its forecast for its full year earnings disappointed most analysts and was below most forecasts  Compared to analyst expectations of  13 83 per share for its full year earnings  IBM announced that it is expecting full year adjusted earnings of  13 80 per share  While the forecasted full year EPS was about 1 or 2  higher year over year  analysts expressed their disappointment with IBM s forecast adding that it was a similar scenario with IBM s year ago quarter ",2018-04-18,trade 12,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibm-shares-fall-on-weak-profit-forecast-200306575,200306575

174696,396212,IBM,Commodities Steal The Show ,opinion,"Commodities stole the show overnight led by WTI which soared to a three year on the DOE report while industrial metals catapulted higher on the likelihood that an extension of Russian sanctions will hit like a sledgehammer at the heart of the nation s mining complex  But not to be outdone  Gold shot up in glittering fashion on haven demand while catching a fillip from the underlying move in commodity prices 
Following two days of scintillating gains  Wall Street investors were quick to pare some risk after shaky earning results from IBM  NYSE IBM   Also  US Treasury yields have woken from their slumber and were playing a bit of catch up on the back of improved risk sentiment  which also contributed to mixed day on Wall Street 
Earnings will remain the key this week so even with the energy sector surging  investors are still looking for specific evidence of strong corporate performance 
Oil prices
If you need any convincing  we are in the midst of an oil bull market look no further than the abundance of signals overnight  Oil Bulls shifted into overdrive when official DoE inventory report confirmed overly bullish indications on US supply  Total inventories showed a draw of  1 07mn in line with the API print on Tuesday  But Gasoline inventories declined more than expected with a draw of  2 968mn vs  2 5mn shown in API  These are peak driving season type gasoline numbers  and we re only in April  not July  
Also  further OPEC compliance appears on the cards as the partners are unlikely to change the oil supply deal in June regardless of the state of global inventories  But the icing on the cake was a Saudi report  recycled mind you as it was kicked around last week  that the kingdom targeting  80   or even  100   according to reports from a closed door meeting of Saudi officials from last week 
In Canada  a possible rail strike could bottleneck flow from Western Canadian oil producers which adds to the bullish tone 
Supply disruptions and lower US inventories make a very compelling argument to enter or stay long OIL  even at these lofty levels 
Gold Prices
A very productive overnight session for Gold despite the relaxation of global political risks  But in reality  there remains immense practicability to store gold in inventory these days  But again we find ourselves testing the upper end of the current range and looking for that key catalyst to get the market over the top  Without rehashing the contemporary risk narratives  Trade war and Middle East tension  that are providing few if any conclusions this week  But given that any one of some catalysts could trigger a global stock market meltdown  for that reason alone gold has to be an essential component in any portfolio  Currency Markets

The Sterling Bulls got summarily smacked on the disappointing CPI miss overnight  But with trader positions  much more balanced and CPI considered an infamously lagging indicator  Sterling at this critical support level would likely attract some buying interest  The UK economic activity does warrant a rate hike in May  and despite the market getting spooked  we could see calmer head prevail over the near term and another push higher 
The Japanese Yen
It feels like we re in Fast Forward to summer doldrums but despite equity market trading constructively a very positive US macro backdrop  While current market conditions suggest a push higher to 108   headline risk is likely holding traders at bay 
The Malaysian Ringgit
Energy prices remain incredibly supportive for the Ringgit which will likely temper any further weakness ahead of the elections  But we expect tight trading ranges to persist on the back of little local bond activity  And what is trading is moving in a sideways fashion 
Risk sentiment is improving  and the Yuan traded favourably all suggesting that the MYR should trend positively  But with the pre election political malaise hanging over Malaysia Capital markets local currency gains will be relatively muted ",2018-04-19,Stephen Innes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/commodities-steal-the-show-200306739,200306739

174698,396214,IBM,Loonie Softens On Cautious BoC  UK Retail Sales Next,opinion,"Here are the latest developments in global markets 

FOREX  The US dollar index is higher today  but by less than 0 1   Aussie dollar is up by 0 2   lifted by a notable rally across commodities  Meanwhile  the loonie steadied against the dollar  after it plunged yesterday on the back of cautious signals from the BoC 
STOCKS  US markets closed mixed yesterday  While the Nasdaq Composite and the S P 500 advanced 0 2  and 0 1  respectively  the Dow Jones fell nearly 0 2   weighed on by disappointing earnings from IBM  NYSE IBM    7 5    Futures tracking the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are all currently very close to neutral territory  suggesting these indices could open at similar levels today  Japan was a similar story  with the Nikkei 225 and the Topix closing in the green  but only by 0 15  and 0 03  correspondingly  In Hong Kong though  the Hang Seng surged 1 0   In Europe  futures tracking the major benchmarks were mixed 
COMMODITIES  Oil prices skyrocketed yesterday and extended their gains today  with both WTI and Brent reaching fresh highs last seen in 2014  The trigger for the surge was a report that Saudi Arabia would be happy to see oil reach  80 or  100  fueling speculation the nation and OPEC will continue to restrict supply to achieve this  The cherry on the pie was the weekly EIA inventory data  which showed a larger than expected drawdown in US crude stockpiles  In precious metals  gold edged higher by 0 3  today  There was no risk off catalyst behind the gains  so its outperformance seems to be owed to the broader rally across commodities  Nickel is up 9  today  while aluminum touched a fresh six year high  boosted by concerns US sanctions against Russian companies could impact the supply of such materials 


Major movers  Loonie slumps on cautious BoC  sterling drops after disappointing CPIsThe Canadian dollar dived yesterday  following the BoC s policy decision  The Bank remained on hold  as was widely anticipated  while the statement accompanying the decision erred on the side of caution  disappointing those looking for hawkish signals that a rate hike is imminent  Officials dismissed the recent surge in inflation as reflecting mostly transitory factors  while they also highlighted escalating geopolitical and trade conflicts as key risks to the economy s outlook 
The implied probability for a July rate hike fell alongside the loonie  declining from nearly 95  prior to the gathering to 80  currently  according to Canada s OIS  Its worthy to note  though  that the surge in oil prices yesterday likely limited any greater declines in the loonie  Focus now turns to the release of the nation s inflation and retail sales data  due out tomorrow 
Elsewhere  the British pound slumped after the UK CPI data for March disappointed  Both the headline and the core inflation rates surprisingly declined  missing their forecasts for staying unchanged and ticking up respectively  Interestingly enough  while sterling responded as one would expect  the probability for a BoE rate hike in May barely budged  staying elevated at 67   Thus  markets did not see these prints as derailing the prospect for a May action  That said  the overall soft data recently do suggest the Bank could deliver another  cautious  hike  Recall that although the BoE raised rates in November  sterling dropped in the aftermath  as the hike was accompanied by dovish signals 
The antipodeans are slightly higher today  Aussie dollar advanced 0 2  even despite lackluster jobs data out of Australia overnight  most likely supported by the broader gains in commodities  Kiwi dollar was up as well  but by less than 0 1   responding little to the release of New Zealand s CPI for Q1  which slowed in line with expectations 
In emerging markets  the Turkish lira surged yesterday  touching a 2 week high against the dollar after Turkish President Erdogan announced the nation will head to early elections in June 

Day ahead  UK retail sales on the horizonThursday s economic calendar is relatively light  with UK retail sales perhaps constituting the day s most important release UK retail sales for the month of March are due at 0830 GMT  Those are projected to have fallen on a monthly basis  but to have risen annually  Core retail sales  that exclude fuel from their calculations  will also be watched and are expected to exhibit the same pattern  i e  reflect an improvement relative to a year ago and a decline compared to February s reading  Sterling s tumble over the last couple of days in the aftermath of data on wage growth and inflation coming in below analysts  forecasts perhaps adds an additional element of interest to today s release 
In North America  the US will see the release of initial and continued jobless claims data for the week ending April 14  as well as the Philly Fed s business index  at 1230 GMT  Out of Canada  the ADP nonfarm employment report due at the same time might generate some attention 
Corporate earnings remain in focus in the equity space and could drive overall market sentiment 
Permanent FOMC voting members Lael Brainard and Randal Quarles will be among policymakers making appearances today  The two will be talking at 1200 GMT and 1330 GMT respectively  Also of interest might be a news conference  1245 GMT  by IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim ahead of the Spring Meetings of the two organizations  among notable names attending the meeting is ECB President Mario Draghi 
Lastly  geopolitical and trade developments  particularly the latter  have been themes driving the markets for weeks now and it is not unlikely for markets to move on the back of updates on those fronts during today s trading 

Technical Analysis  Gold short term bullish  rises for fifth straight dayGold is posting gains for the fifth day in a row and is currently trading nor far below Wednesday s eight day high of 1 355 58  this being a three week high if one were to exclude April 11 s spike higher   The Tenkan sen is above the Kijun sen  projecting a bullish picture in the short term  The flat Kijun sen though may be pointing to easing positive momentum 
Rising trade and or geopolitical uncertainty could boost the safe haven perceived asset  Immediate support may be taking place around yesterday s high of 1 355 58  with an upside break turning the attention to April 11 s three month high of 1 365 11   the area around this mark also includes the 21 month high of 1 365 89 from late January 
Conversely  receding uncertainties might drive funds out of the yellow metal  pushing it lower  Support to declines could come around the current level of the Tenkan sen at 1 345 93

Batavia is built on  IBM   NYSE IBM  Blockchain Platform technology and  a consortium of five banks  Bank of Montreal  BMO   UBS  CaixaBank  Commerzbank  DE CBKG   and Erste Group 
The recent experiment relied on smart contracts utilizing distributed ledger technology  DLT   another term for blockchain  Smart contracts allow triggering predetermined actions once certain conditions are met  The concept can be successfully implemented in reaching trade agreements  tracking goods  and making payments  All of these were successfully managed by the platform  The next step will be Batavia moving into the customer review phase  The participants expect the platform to be able to monitor air freight by the time it goes live

174703,396219,IBM, Private Blockchains   the Good  the Bad and All the Misconceptions ,news,"Blockchain applications are being deployed across a wide spectrum of configurations  ranging from pure public blockchains  to pure  closed  private chains  and everything in between  Why  And where is all this heading 
If you re an entrepreneur or even a so called intrapreneur  creating a revolutionary blockchain based application  you will be faced with the question of where and how to deploy 
This fundamental question touches the core point of why blockchain technology should be used in the first place  Making the wrong choice is likely to undermine any perceived value and benefits 
If you re an entrepreneur your considerations are likely to include 
Public blockchain for token issuance  and fund raising  e g  Ethereum 
Public blockchain for utilising an already deployed highly distributed trustless network  albeit at a  high transaction  cost  However  absolute transaction and data state replication mean transaction volume and throughput are very limited  and so your application will struggle to scale with the current technical solutions  all of this is well documented 
Creation of your own private blockchain network  as an alternative to the public blockchains  You could use Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric software  and this will be much more scalable  although you will need to build out  and incentivise  your own network of hosting parties in order to decentralise  and therefore increase trust in your network and solution
A range of alternative blockchain platforms that claim to have solved scalability for public chains  In practice  most of these are hybrid solutions where the number of nodes is limited  this is how improved performance   scalability is achieved   and trust is therefore still dependent on a relatively small number of participants  The security and integrity of these types of solutions is yet to be proven  Celebrity VC Fred Wilson recently posted on this   and referenced this  that illustrates just how centralised many of these networks really are  Their developer eco system tends to be much smaller than that of established public blockchains like Ethereum  but some have raised substantial funds  and are using those funds to gain traction 
If you re an intrapreneur working for a large corporate enterprise your considerations are likely to include 
Create own private network using Ethereum  Hyperledger Fabric   IBM   NYSE IBM    Corda  R3   and seek to find hosting partners to expand your network 
Create or join an industry consortium  where consortium members host nodes
We see four dimensions when considering a blockchain deployment 
Scalability    Privacy    Token    Trustlessness
Startups prioritise token acceptance and network trustlessness 
Corporates tend to prioritise privacy and scalability  although there s very little benefit for them  and they re not really harnessing the technology  if they don t grow a trustless network 
What we find in practice  having developed numerous blockchain applications for both entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs  is that the apparently different requirements tend to converge over time 
That is  many applications built by entrepreneurs will integrate with one or more large corporate enterprises at some point  and will therefore need to address their requirements  and similarly  many enterprise applications would like to make their solutions more open and trustless and eventually incorporate tokens of some form  although they currently have many obstacles to overcome before they may do so 
Where is all this heading 
Just as the requirements of startups and corporates are converging  so are the blockchain networks  Both startups and corporates are ultimately heading towards networks of networks  Corporates will  at some point  require integration outside their private network  Initiatives including Polkadot  Cosmos  and Ethereum sharding  as well as various side chains  all involve creating networks of networks 
We envisage a world of interoperability across multiple public and private chains

IBM reiterated its guidance for adjusted earnings per share at a minimum of  13 80 for 2018  Analysts were expecting  in earnings per share  excluding certain items  for the full year  according to Thomson Reuters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 was also  13 83  with 10 analysts providing estimates   the highest being  14 00 and the lowest being  13 75 
Such downbeat guidance punished the stock  which lost about  after hours on Apr 17  2018  despite reporting revenue growth 
Should You buy the Dip  
The company s progress on emerging technologies and  like cloud computing and artificial intelligence positions it better for the long term  But it seems these initiatives are yet to bear fruit

174719,396235,IBM,IBM Turnaround Questioned on Slow Growth of New Businesses,news," Bloomberg     IBM s one quarter growth streak is already in doubt 
Shares of the technology company fell in early trading after it reported narrower profit margins and no revenue growth  excluding help from a weak U S  dollar  That cast a shadow over an effort to sell more profitable cloud based software to revive growth after five years of revenue declines 
Though heading in the right direction  the rebirth of International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  Corp  has yet to materialize  Daniel Ives  an analyst with GBH Insights LLC  said in a note to clients   Patience is wearing thin on the Street around the  IBM  turnaround story  which continues to be elusive  
First quarter revenue came in at  19 1 billion  beating the average analyst estimate of  18 8 billion  That s 5 percent higher than a year earlier  but flat without currency fluctuations  Margins slipped 0 6 percentage points to 43 2 percent  Earlier this year  Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said margins would stabilize  immediately  in the first quarter 
The stock dropped as much as 5 6 percent in early trading Wednesday after closing at  160 91 in New York 
Growth in the cloud business was 14 percent  lower than the 2017 average of 24 percent  Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana said  That  puts a question mark on IBM s hybrid cloud strategy   he added 
During a conference call  Kavanaugh pushed back on questions from analysts about margins and whether revenue can keep expanding  He pointed to growth across the company s business lines  and said execution problems in IBM s computer storage unit and consulting business were partly to blame for the quarter s challenges 
Kavanaugh described the overall picture as positive and said Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty s goal of getting about half of sales  or  40 billion  from newer businesses was ahead of schedule 
 This is a good start to the year   Kavanaugh said   We re well on pace to deliver that  40 billion earlier than 2018   Those new businesses represented 47 percent of revenue over the last 12 months  he noted 
Rometty reversed the trend of revenue declines late last year  though that boost wasn t fueled as much by new businesses as by cyclical demand for more traditional mainframe computers  Investors are watching closely for gains in newer software and services to support growth when the bump from hardware sales fades  In the meantime  Rometty has shifted thousands of jobs outside the U S  and reduced costs 
On average  analysts expected IBM to lift its full year profit forecast  but the company kept it at  13 80 a share 
Armonk  New York based IBM said adjusted earnings per share were  2 45 in the quarter  up 4 percent from a year earlier  Analysts were expecting  2 42 a share on average  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
Some investors aren t waiting around to see if Rometty can return Big Blue to its glory days as one of the tech industry s bellwethers  Warren Buffett  who plowed more than  10 billion into the company in 2011  exited his position almost completely in recent months

174722,396238,IBM, Huawei Brings Out Blockchain as a Service Offering ,news,"Huawei  the company known for being one of China s most successful smartphone manufacturers  announced this week the release of a blockchain as a service platform 
Dubbed  Blockchain Cloud Service   the platform came just after Huawei started working with Hyperledger on a blockchain benchmarking tool known as Caliper 

 Huawei blockchain cloud services are based on open source techniques in data management  security encryption and other core technologies accumulated over the years  Huawei s blockchain cloud service is an easy to use  flexible and efficient universal and basic technology  focusing on helping developers build enterprise class blockchain industry solutions on cloud and Huawei applications quickly and efficiently   the company wrote in  

The solution developed by the telecommunications group is chiefly oriented towards developers looking to make smart contracts  giving them a platform that does not require starting from scratch 
For the time being  Huawei s platform appears to cater to the Chinese technology community  with no documentation in any other language 
In addition  we could not log into the platform unless we used a Chinese phone number 
Near the end of the whitepaper  we can see that the environment will include  homomorphic encryption  zero knowledge proofs  and carrier level cloud security 
Huawei s release may be a response to the blockchain boom in the country  The People s Bank of China itself holds  related to the technology 
It is not rare for Chinese companies to offer their technologies locally first before going global  and Huawei s strategy may involve making use of the enormous testing field it has before unleashing its solution upon the rest of the world 
Walmart  NYSE WMT  and  IBM   NYSE IBM  did the same thing  trialing  in Chinese markets despite the fact that their headquarters are not located in the country

Reports for IBM  Enbridge and ADPThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including IBM  Enbridge and ADP  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today IBM s shares have underperformed the broader market on a year to date basis  losing  8 4  vs  the S P 500 s  13 7  gain  IBM provides advanced information technology solutions  including computer systems  software  storage systems and microelectronics  Strength in cloud  security and analytics as well as cost savings bodes well for company s top line and bottom line The company has been gaining a lot of traction in emerging markets  Accretive acquisitions have expanded company s product portfolio into higher growth segments  such as Cloud computing and Big Data  Further  expanding footprint in the rapidly growing blockchain market is a positive  Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company s Q1 earnings release Nevertheless  IBM is having a tough time  given the ongoing and heavily time consuming business model transition to cloud  Modest IT spending growth along with foreign exchange volatility is a concern  Intensifying competition in most of the markets is a major headwind Shares of Enbridge have declined  24 5  over the last year  underperforming the Zacks Oil Pipeline industry s loss of  17 5  during the same period  Enbridge has the longest and most sophisticated crude and liquids pipeline system in the world that spreads over 17 511 miles The Zacks analyst likes the merger with Spectra Energy  F SEP  as it has made Enbridge the largest energy infrastructure company in North America in terms of enterprise value  The company s huge backlog of growth projects that stands at roughly C 22 billion along with the C 12 billion worth midstream projects that are online will help it drive dividends by 10  annually through 2020 However  the company s substantial debt load is a matter of concern  During 2017  long term debt rose more than 70  while cash balance declined almost 73   reflecting weak financials Buy ranked ADP s shares have gained  14 2  over the last year  underperforming the Zacks Outsourcing industry  which has gained  18 2  over the same period  ADP has been focused on streamlining its business to strengthen core operations in the long run  To this end  the company has divested a number of its divisions in the past few years Further  the Zacks analyst stresses that ADP holds a dominant position in the payroll processing and HCM market  primarily due to its robust product portfolio  Acquisitions have also been a key growth catalyst for ADP  The company s strong balance sheet enables it to continue with its shareholder friendly activities alongside strategic buyouts and investments on product development However  investments in new initiatives may continue to weigh on its bottom line results  Moreover  rising unemployment levels will negatively impact the company  Increasing competition is another major headwind Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Marathon Petroleum and United Continental Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have

174748,396264,IBM, Big Blue Helps Bring Blockchain Solutions to Insurance Industry ,news,"IBM   NYSE IBM  continues its efforts in making the best use of Blockchain  most recently a collaboration with Marsh insurance company to develop the first commercial proof of insurance solution using the technology 
Marsh specializes in insurance broking and innovative risk management solutions  It advises both individual and commercial clients  It had sought ways to bring more efficiencies to its clients and the collaboration with IBM to use Blockchain is a game changer for it 
Furthermore  since proof of insurance is a key business requirement in many industries  this Blockchain solution being developed opens the door to creating a  network of networks to provide verification on a much broader scale   according to an IBM player involved in this collaboration 
The partnership
Also included in the partnership are ACORD and ISN Software Corp  ACORD is industry owned organization that serves the insurance industry 
ISN provides online contractor and supplier management services  It is the first Marsh client to test the solution 
The commercial proof of insurance solution is being built on the open source called Hyperledger Fabric technology and the IBM Blockchain Platform  ACORD is providing input for the solution  while ISN is providing customer feedback  
How Blockchain will be used
Part of Marsh s operations entails helping its clients come up with risk management solutions 
By using Blockchain technology  the company seeks to remove the complexities of the certificate of insurance process  Blockchain will help transform the process from being complicated and manual to streamlined and transparent 
The end result will include clients being able to speed up business operations  such as hiring contractors  
Marsh s chief digital officer Sastry Durvasula said 

 Marsh sees great opportunity in leveraging Blockchain technology to better serve our clients by maximizing efficiency and creating new opportunities in the insurance value chain  We believe strategic engagements such as this one with IBM  ACORD  and ISN will help accelerate the adoption of further Blockchain applications benefiting our clients across industries  

ISN s technical insurance lead Brett Parker noted that the insurance industry has been dependent on paper certificates of insurance  manually populated by an insurance agent  which is cumbersome to say the least 
By digitizing the policy information  the hope is that the process can be streamlined  which would save ISN s customers time to focus on their core competencies  Parker said 
The new Blockchain network is expected to go into production later this year 
Not just insurance
This collaboration on the proof of insurance effort is not the only Blockchain based solution IBM sees as fitting  Its general manager for the insurance industry  Sandip Patel  noted that IBM is committed to connecting emerging Blockchain networks to facilitate the next generation economy  
He said in a  

Vastly simplifying the process for providing proof of insurance is a key enabler of business  This is an ideal example of how Blockchain can be used on a much broader scale to drive real business results ",2018-04-17,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/big-blue-helps-bring-blockchain-solutions-to-insurance-industry-1399066,1399066
174749,396265,IBM,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch ,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1  Beige Book  Fed Speakers on Tap
The Federal Reserve s beige book at 2 00 p m  ET  a report that includes anecdotal evidence on the health of the US economy from 12 regions  will be closely watched for any subtle change in commentary on inflation following hawkish language seen in the Fed s March meeting minutes 
The minutes of the Federal Reserve s March meeting showed that policymakers agreed that gradual rate hikes would be needed as inflation is expected to reach the Fed s 2  target 
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave its benchmark rate unchanged at its May meeting but increase rates at its subsequent meeting in June 
Speeches by FOMC Member Bill Dudley at 8 30 a m  ET and 3 15 p m  ET and  FOMC Member Randal Quarles at 4 15 p m  could offer additional clues on monetary policy 
The dollar pared some of its gains against a basket of major currencies Tuesday despite easing geopolitical tensions and positive economic data  pointing to underlying strength in the U S  economy 
2  EIA Inventory Data in Focus
Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration  EIA  on Wednesday is expected to show a draw in U S  crude stockpiles 
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 1 4 million barrels in the week ended April 13 
U S crude output will also be closely watched after International Energy Agency Director Faith Birol warned that if oil prices remained elevated  U S  shale producers could ramp up output faster than anticipated 
Crude oil futures settled higher on Tuesday at  66 52 a barrel  up 30 cents  buoyed by the prospect of a draw in US crude supplies

174760,396276,IBM,Stellar Lumens XLM USD Forms Double Bottom On IBM Partnership Updates,opinion,"Stellar Lumens or XLM showed yet another outstanding performance on Monday  days after IBM s VP confirmed that Stellar is a  big  part of the company s IBM  NYSE IBM  blockchain platform strategy and relies mainly on Stellar s technology  Stellar Lumens is being used in a real world environment for the company s blockchain solutions 
But another thing that is getting people even more excited is the mention of central banks  The biggest aspect of the Stellar IBM deal is to give central banks an efficient crypto that they can work with  A possible implication of this deal is that Stellar Lumens will become the default crypto for central banks  since IBM already offers many of them tech related services 
A collaboration with central banks could also see Stellar Lumens emerge as the leader in blockchain based finance  the same market that the likes of Ripple  XRP  are going after 

On these updates  XLM USD appears to have bottomed out at the 0 18 support level for the second time since March 18th  and in the process of forming an apparent Double Bottom chart pattern on the daily format  The neckline of this pattern lies right at the lower band of the daily Ichimoku cloud and the 23  Fibonacci retracement level of 0 26  If the pair successfully breaks through this level in April  we could expect the pattern to be completed at 0 30

 It will have an enormous impact on the supply chains of manufacturing industries  Blockchain is a core platform to fuel our digital transformation   Song said 

By the end of 2018  Samsung SDS anticipates the management of 488 000 tons of air cargo and 1 million standard 20  shipping containers  which will include Galaxy S9 smartphones and diode displays manufactured by Samsung Electronics unit  The DLT system would help Samsung speed up processes and get ahead of competition especially in emerging markets like China  At the end of January  Samsung  that it had a foundry contract with a China Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer to start mass production of ASIC devices 
Samsung is not the only one seeking to actively use blockchain for the shipping industry  At the beginning of the year  A P  Moller Maersk  with  IBM   NYSE IBM  to build a DLT platform to support trade processing and cut costs 
In November last year  IBM  in partnership with air and travel services company Dnata  successfully  a blockchain system for Dubai s air cargo industry  In March  a consortium of companies operating in the freight and logistics market  including Accenture  AB InBev  APL  Kuehne   Nagel  and a Europe based customs organization  succeeded in a blockchain test focused on shipments 
 Korea is still likely to be a center for utilizing blockchain technology  as academics here warm to the technology  Cheong Tae su  professor of industrial engineering at Korea University in Seoul  said

174774,396290,IBM,IBM Turns To Blockchain For A Boost,opinion,"International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  is in a slump and the global tech giant turns to blockchain for a much needed boost to turn things around  While it is still a force to reckon with  recently  investors worry that it hit a growth problem  The stock price  which has been on a decline over the past five years  is now at less than  170 per share 
The company registered a  22 5 billion revenue in the last quarter of 2017  which even beat analysts  expected revenue of  22 1 billion  With this  the outlook of IBM is high as experts see the company s investments in cloud computing and  big data  analytics finally paying dividends  Also  IBM has now entered the blockchain ledger in cloud computing 
This makes IBM stock lucrative at the moment  Portfolio manager for Interactive Brokers Asset Management Vahan Janigian believes the company just lacks growth as evident in stagnant performances in the past years  However  he thinks things are about to change because of a strong cash flow  earnings  and large dividends 
 Growth plummeted because management was slow to recognize and exploit high growth opportunities  But that seems to be changing   he added This is why IBM s decision to venture into blockchain is the best decision at the moment  Blockchain offers a new area of growth for IBM which it sorely lacks 
So far  IBM has invested in the internet of things and artificial intelligence  Welcoming blockchain in their fold is in line with the company s strategies  and it hopes blockchain can inject the much needed boost for IBM as it had done in other companies  such as Unilever  LON ULVR  
Global consumer brand Unilever collaborated with IBM to utilize blockchain in reducing ad fraud  Because blockchain acts as a third party ledger  there is accountability and traceability in its system  Pinpointing areas of strengths and those that need improvements becomes easier  With blockchain  Unilever hopes to streamline the digital media buying process and lessen manipulation  Ad fraud costs the advertising industry some serious money as The World Federation of Advertisers predicts it could reach more than  50 billion in losses by 2025 
Alibaba  NYSE BABA  is also banking on blockchain to improve its cross border e commerce  According to Coindesk  Alibaba and Cainiao signed a deal to improve export and import of goods with the use of blockchain to trace important information on products  The move is seen as a way of Alibaba to stop the spread of counterfeit products on its platform  Aside from advertising  e commerce and cloud computing  blockchain can also be applied to other industries  and it has massive potential to change the way things are being done 
Investing in companies which adapts to blockchain is a good move at the moment  However  there is a link missing between companies  investors  and entrepreneurs  This link is now provided by Global Blockchain Technologies  OTC BLKCF   Global Blockchain allows investors access to a mixture of assets in the blockchain space  strategically chosen to balance stability and growth  Any company can claim they are accepting Bitcoin  Ethereum or any form of cryptocurrency on their platform  but how do people know it is legit and legal when the industry remains unregulated 
The founders of Global Blockchain wants to ease these fears and worries  Members will be given access to information about the latest happenings around blockchain and cryptocurrency  They can also decide which companies to invest in  Global Blockchain serves as a vehicle for them and because bogus companies are filtered  fraud and other concerns on cryptocurrency investing is minimized or completely removed 
Investors and companies need not be as big as IBM or Alibaba in order to enter the highly technical cryptocurrency and blockchain industry  Companies like Global Blockchain makes it easier for anyone without sacrificing quality or information needed to survive the highly volatile market ",2018-03-16,J.

As for the project tokenomics  only HardCap is known   approximately 50 000 ETH  Dates for the main ICO sale will be announced shortly 
Analysts of The Token Fund recommend the project for investing in the short and medium term  Already now  at an early stage  the project has concluded a number of partnerships with leading players in the Chinese and world markets  including government agencies  Such an approach can make PCHAIN one of the market leaders soon 
2  Seed  USA  seedtoken io
SEED is a decentralized marketplace for developers of conversational user interfaces  CUIs   The aim of the project is to democratize the development of AI  artificial intelligence   in particular  bots  and create an alternative to corporation monopolies that hamper the development of CUI and AI technologies  A striking example is telegram bots in the form of a regular chat  where they can buy  sell  exchange  rent components for bot building 
The Seed protocol and network operation principle is as follows 
1  You go to the platform  SEED  and sign up   create a new project 
2  You specify where the technology will be used  finance  health  etc  
3  You select the type  components and a platform for the bot hosting  Skype  Slack     
4  You model personal characteristics that determine possible scenarios of communication with people using a constructor principle  this is really easy  
Supposedly  the network will be accompanied by a virtual machine to allow to quickly evaluate the efficiency and quality of the purchased template code bot   Blacklists  and the developer reputation ranking will also be created in advance 
Blockchain in the project is required due to the need to guarantee privacy and safety of user data within the SEED network  Smart contracts will regulate the exchange  lease  conditions for the transfer of intellectual property and income distribution  Ethereum is currently chosen as a platform  but if the network is overloaded or in case of some unforeseen problems  SEED can switch to another blockchain   in particular  NEO 
The project team consists of experienced experts with a strong reputation in the market  Nathan Shedroff  CEO  is a guru of business strategy and design  Mark Stephen Meadows  CTO  and the Botanic Technologies CEO has 20 years of experience in VR  15 years in NLP and five years in blockchain  Back in 2011  he developed apps for AI in research laboratories  Xerox PARC  SRI  Waag  etc   and also advised the government  Michelle Katz is the Associate Professor at the California College of Arts  Doctor of Law and an expert in licensing and intellectual property rights

The Token Fund analytical department considers the project interesting for consideration  but the large HardCap of  100 000 000 and the protracted sail  Q2 2018 is the first stage  and Q2 2019 is the second stage  makes it impossible to make recommendations for short term medium term prospects  When opting for  long   SEED has a strong chance to show good growth ",2018-03-28,Viktor Shpakovsky,https://www.investing.com/analysis/initial-coin-offerings-to-watch-pchain-seed-200301494,200301494

But in the case of Stellar  trading volumes remain relatively low  putting the recovery in question  A spike of around 10  for all coins is not too much by the standards of crypto markets  and even in the stronger cases  worries about the next downturn are always present 
The XLM market price may ensure that Stellar soon displaces EOS from position six  if the current trends continue  Yet XLM has remained relatively flat for days  while other coins have had more robust  though temporary  recoveries  At the moment  the XLM BTC pair is still in the top 10 on  
The XLM asset has often been compared to Ripple  XRP   both for its large supply  growth from sub penny prices  but also the potential to handle payments by tokenizing real world assets 



Thus  Stellar may be positioning itself as a fintech coin  with the potential to serve decentralized exchanges  and also banks  For now  the tests and performance have been small scale 
Stellar is also making the rounds for international acceptance  spreading to the CryptoMKT exchange and getting traded in Brazil  Chile and Colombia  Additionally  the Stellar team is active in presenting on fintech conferences across the globe

Much has been made about the  IBM   NYSE IBM  tests on the Stellar network  There are expectations that central banks could test Stellar  and even use it for issuing fiat backed crypto coins  However  similar announcements have been made about Ripple as well 
So far  the story has not managed to lift Stellar trading to its December and January levels  In the long run  XLM may see a different price range  but first  the project would have to prove the use case with central banks is viable

Speaking to the AFR at IBM s THINK conference in Las Vegas  Wieck said that broader adoption of distributed ledger technology  DLT  could contribute about  3 1 trillion to the global economy  She also praised Dubai as the most active blockchain user 
Wieck noted that governments are either fully supporting the technology and the cryptocurrency concept or entirely rejecting them  South Korea  for example  is taking the toughest stance on blockchain and cryptocurrency use  while the federal government of Dubai leads in their adoption 

 There is no question that the level of blockchain activity in Dubai far exceeds just about every other place because it has made the mandate  from a government perspective  that in December of 2021 they won t be using any paper based systems   Wieck said 
 In order to do this  they are putting all documents on a blockchain   she added 

Dubai  which aims to become a smart city  launched the Dubai Blockchain Strategy via state agencies Smart Dubai Office and the Dubai Future Foundation  Both initiatives are backed by UAE Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum 
Starting in 2016  the strategy aims to make blockchain an integral part of the city s public sector by 2020  However  Smart Dubai Office head Aisha Bint Butti bin Bishr  in January that the target could be achieved by the end of 2018

174793,396309,IBM,Dow Jones And The Barron s Gold Mining Index A 98 Year Examination ,opinion,"Looking at the market at the close of this week  apparently the  policy makers  have once again gotten a handle on the financial markets  In the Dow Jones BEV chart below it did correct 10   but only for one day  February 8th  with the Dow Jones coming back since  It closed the week only 4 81  from its last all time high of January 26th  and so could easily make a new BEV Zero in the days and weeks to come  As 10  corrections go  as seen in the thirty six years of the Dow Jones BEV chart below  this wasn t much of a double digit correction 

This plus the Dow Jones Total Market Groups   DJTMG  top 20 closed the week back at 53 of 74 groups within 20  of their last all time highs 

Here s the frequency table for the top 20 below  The DJTMG s high water mark was in Barron s January 29th issue  after which the BEV Zeros  new all time highs  dropped dramatically as groups shifted lower  to the right of the table  But after the top 20 declined to only 51  groups are once again migrating upward towards the left side of the table Like I said  it wasn t much of a 10  correction in the market 

If this continues the Dow Jones and the general market may once again rise into record territory  and why not  as the  policy makers  are once again doing their  market stability  thing  as seen in the chart below 
As so many times before in the chart  the latest decline in the Dow Jones  Blue Plot  was accompanied by a spike in trading volume  Red Plot   followed by the Dow Jones increasing on declining trading volume  This is a total inversion of the law of supply and demand  so I m thinking it must be some kind of  policy initiative  

If the  policy makers  find it so easy to manipulate the stock market higher  why shouldn t we join in the party on Wall Street  With the Dow Jones so close to making a new all time high after a pitiful double digit correction  I refuse to argue the point  I m only pointing out that what the  policy makers  are doing is ultimately self destructive  as  stabilizing  the market as they do requires that debt loads on someone or something must increase  and there s a limit to how much debt an individual  a corporation  a government or an economy can carry 
Below is a chart of what I call the Real National Deficit  I take the US national debt from 52weeks before and subtract from that the national debt published in this week s Barron s  This week it was   1 000 billion    1 Trillion   illustrating the debt carried by the US Treasury increased by a trillion dollars from 52 weeks before 
That sounds pretty bad  butduring the mortgage crisis of October 2007 to March 2009 it was worse  In January 2009 the US national debt had increased by over  2 5 trillion in a 52wk period as the  policy makers  used the US Treasury s balance sheet to bailout Wall Street s big banks 

This is  implementing market stability  of a kind  the kind of  market stability  that ends in national bankruptcy  But when will that happen  When bond yields in the Treasury market rise above an unknown threshold  possibly around the 5  seen in the chart below  though that is pure speculation on my part  What isn t speculation is that bond yields  Red Plot  in the corporate  municipal  and US Treasury markets have been rising since the summer of 2016 

As they do bond prices decline  and this is the problem as Wall Street has bundled mostbonds trading in the bond markets with interest rate derivatives to  hedge interest rate risks   Right now these derivatives are worthless  But as interest rates continue to rise they will come into the money and become tens or even hundreds of trillions of dollars in liabilities to someone 
Who stands behind these derivatives  The big banks would say that they do  but as we discovered during the mortgage crisis  it was actually the US Government that ultimately did  as seen in the Real National Deficit chart above This is what we ve come to expect when we have the best Congress money can buy 
Gold is looking good in its BEV chart below  True it s not going up as we would all wish  but I m grateful it s not going down 

For another look at gold here s its step sum chart  and everything is looking good there too  There isn t much to say I haven t said for the past month  as nothing new or exciting in the gold market has really happened for weeks now  What I m waiting for is for gold to do something different than just move in its current trading range seen below  Hopefully gold s next big move will be to the upside and take out its highs of July 2016 

Last week I said the only thing I can think of when looking at the chart below was a historic market top  A week later I m beginning to change my mind  thinking of the real possibility that the Dow Jones still has some more new all time highs coming its way before its terminal bull market top 

What changed from last Friday was this week  a week that saw the Dow Jones close up in four of the five days  with two of the days moving the Dow Jones up by over 1 25   As I ve noted many times in my commentary  bull markets move upwards in tiny steps from one day to the next  And seeing the Dow Jones advance on Monday by 1 37  and again on Friday by 1 77  really isn t all that bullish 
Also I added a new column on the Dow Jones side of the step sum table below its daily volatility 200 Day Moving Average  In the past twenty five NYSE trading sessions it has increased to 0 45  from 0 34   Since 1900  118 years  seeing this indicator advance towards  and then above 1 00  has frequently been a trigger for real bear market action  So let s follow it and see if that proves to be true once again 

Unlike the Dow Jones  gold s step sum ended the week unchanged from twenty five days ago  256   as its price fell just a tad below where it was on February 2nd  As I ve said before  gold and by proxy silver and the mining shares are just waiting for their next big move  Whether it will be up or down I can t say  but I m thinking it will be up 
What I can say with certainty is that the days where gold and its step sum in the table above continue lounging around doing a lot of nothing are numbered  As gold has been trending upward since its very hard bottom of December 2015  I m anticipating the next big move in gold will be to the upside 
For a decade investing in precious metals mining has been an exercise in futility  Yes  beginning in 2001  chart below  the Barron s Gold Mining Index  BGMI  was off to a good start  then came the sub prime mortgage crisis and the miners got whacked  70  in the seven months from March to October 2008 
However  in October 2008 they broke to the upside five months before the rest of the market bottomed in March 2009  On that advance the BGMI broke above its March 2008 highs in the spring of 2011  Unfortunately  in early May 2011 they began a four year decline that took the PM miners back to where they were in 2001  declining 85  in the process   Ouch 
Their last advance began in December 2015  and believe it or not  in the summer of 2016 the gold miners were frequently the top performing group in the Dow Jones Total Market Groups  DJTMG   Red Box   Sadly  as seen in the chart below  this advance in the BGMI s proved to be short lived  For the best part of the last two years the BGMI has been in a tight trading range as it decides whether its next big move will be to the down  or upside 

All and all  the chart above tells a tale of woe for people investing in gold and silver mining for the past decade  But investing in gold mining hasn t always been this way 
In the chart s insert below the gold mining shares were a rare bright light shining in the depressing 1930s  They didn t do much during the following two decades  but beginning in the early 1960s they once again began to rise  along with bond yields  as consumer price inflation began rising 

In a bull market advance that began in the early 1960s  the mining shares peaked in October 1980  ten months after gold and silver did in January 1980  The power of that advance can be seen in the table below  comparing the BGMI to the other groups in the Barron s Stock Averages data set  a data set that was discontinued in October 1988  with the sole exception of the BGMI  which Barron s has continuously published since 1938 
Below we see from 1941 to October 1980  the BGMI   2  had outperformed all groups in the Barron s Stock Averages with the sole exception of the Office Equipment Group  the group that contained computer manufactures like IBM  NYSE IBM  The difference between the gold mining bull market of 1960 to 1980  and the bull market seen in the PM mining sector since 2001  if I dare call it that  is remarkable 

And exactly what is that difference  Maybe the chart below plotting the indexed values of the Dow Jones  Red Plot   the BGMI  Blue Plot  and Currency in Circulation  CinC  the volume of paper money in circulation   Green Plot  can cast some light on this 
Looking first at the chart s insert for 1920 70 we see the Dow Jones  Roaring 1920s bull market  a bad time for the gold miners who took losses of 60  from 1920 to 1925  However  with the arrival of the Great Depression  the BGMI proved immune to the losses taken by just about everything else trading on the NYSE 

As seen the market action of the Dow Jones and the BGMI in the insert  the 1930 s bull market for the BGMI was actually greater than the bull market for the Dow Jones in the 1920s  Here s a table giving the specifics for the Dow Jones and the BGMI from their 1920s  bear market bottoms to their bull market tops 

Back to the above chart s insert  It took the next two decades for the Dow Jones to catch up with the gains the BGMI made in the 1930s  When the Dow Jones finally caught up with the Green CinC plot in 1966  my proxy for inflation  it began a frustrating period where from 1966 to 1981  the Dow Jones attempted to break above  and stay above 1000 five times  but failed to do so as the green CinC plot advanced relentlessly upward This is an important point  how since 1966 the Dow Jones has failed to catch up to the green CinC plot  This proves the gains seen by the broad stock market have not kept up with the rate of inflation since 1966 
The BGMI was different  On a January 1920 basis  the BGMI has outperformed the Dow Jones for most of the 20th century  and from 1965 to 1996  seldom dropped below the rate of inflation as seen in the green CinC plot  However  since 2001 the BGMI twice attempted  but failed to catch up with the green CinC plot in March 2008 and again in April 2011  Currently the BGMI has fallen into the largest gap between it and the advance in CinC since 1920  as the Dow Jones is now attempting to catch up to CinC inflation  To do so the Dow Jones would have to close at 39 559 with CinC at current levels 
Well good luck to the stock market bulls for that My view on this is the Red Dow Jones plot hasn t risen above the Green CinC plot since 1966  and isn t likely to do so in the life time of anyone reading this article 
As for the BGMI  a study of the data seen above proves that the BGMI has been in the main countercyclical to the general stock market for almost a hundred years  I wouldn t be surprised to see the Blue BGMI plot sometime in the next few years once again rising above the Green CinC plot  At the current level of CinC  that would take the BGMI above 3 395  it closed this week at 477   but   NOT   until the Red Dow Jones plot once again enters into a major bear market 
As seen in the 1920s and again from 1958 to 1981  bull markets in the BGMI are not fueled by the rising CinC plot  monetary inflation from the Federal Reserve   the Dow Jones is  What drives the BGMI to record levels is deflation in the Dow Jones  which motivates refugee dollars fleeing the previously inflated  but now deflating stock market into the safety of the BGMI 
As there are a good number of companies trading daily at the NYSE whose market capitalization is larger than the combined market cap of the entire gold   silver mining industry  The potential for monster gains in the BGMI in a big bear market at the NYSE and NASDAQ is enormous 
The following chart uses the same data displayed in the chart above  but uses the CinC data to create ratios for the Dow Jones and BGMI  In effect we re seeing the market action in the Dow Jones and BGMI in terms of CinC 
When these plots rise  they are appreciating faster than the rate of inflation as seen by increases in CinC  When they decline they are underperforming the advances in CinC  When they are above the green 1 0 line  their advances since January 1920 have been greater than the increases in CinC  Below the green 1 0 line  and their advances have been less than the increases in CinC since January 1920  I find the resulting plots for the Dow Jones   CinC and the BGMI   CinC ratios remarkably insightful and I hope you do too 
I have to note my gratitude to Geoff from the Land Down Under who made the effort to obtain historical price data for Home Stake Mining from 1920 to 1938  which allowed me to push back this data to January 1920  He really made a huge difference in this and the chart above  Thanks Geoff 
I placed three triangles in the chart to identify three triggering events for bull markets in the BGMI 

The first triangle marks April 1925  when the then new Federal Reserve extended a HUGE  200 million dollar line of credit to the Bank of England  This action in  monetary policy not only ignited the Roaring 1920s bull market for the Dow Jones  but marked the bottom of the 60  bear market decline in the BGMI 
Of the two bull markets seen in the chart above for the 1920s  note how the Dow Jones inflated first  and how the bull market for the BGMI really didn t get going until after the Dow Jones began deflating from its 1929 top 
This pattern also proved true after the second triggering event in 1958  when increases in CinC finally triggered a run on the US gold reserves that didn t end until August 1971 when the US Treasury terminated the Bretton Woods  35 gold peg on the US dollar 
Looking at the Dow Jones and BGMI plots  both advanced from 1958 to 1966  but as the Dow Jones began its 1966 decline  in terms of CinC   the BGMI began its best bull market of the past 100 years  One regrettable feature of gold mining shares is their extreme volatility especially after August 1971  which is on full display in the chart above  andBEV chart below 

The third triggering event  third triangle   two charts up  was when Alan Greenspan s Federal Reserve made the decision to re inflate the stock market after the NASDAQ bubble of the 1990s burst in 2000  by inflating a bubble in the mortgage market for single family homes 
Looking at the BGMI and Dow Jones CinC ratio plots after 2001  two charts up   the BGMI was clearly the winner until May 2011  Since then the BGMI saw its deepest bear market declinesince 1920  an 85  collapse from its highs of April 2011 in December 2015  Ouch That s the bad news  But the good news is that after such a decline we can be fairly certain that the bottom was put in December 2015 
No one ever became rich by buying high and selling low  So  the trick is to find an investment class that few people want  because that s when it s cheap  and have the patience to wait until it once again becomes valuable to all  In March 2018  I believe that describes the gold and silver mining companies  And when will the world once again discovers the value of investing in these miners  That should be fairly clear to anyone who takes a few moments of their time to study the three charts above  when the stock and bond markets  now inflated to historic valuations  once again begin deflating in a historic bear market

The Big Number

Stock markets are looking rather flat this morning as we await some big news this afternoon 

Precisely one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street the US government will announce the inflation figures for the month of January  This specific print represents an excellent opportunity for those who like to trade the news and here s why   

Over the last two weeks  the global stock markets have been selling off big time  Many analysts claim that we should have expected this as a  technical correction  because over the entire course of 2017 the markets have been going in a single direction 

These three charts show the Dow Jones  the CHINA 50 and the Dax 30 over the last year and a half 



Indeed  things have been a bit one sided for a lot longer than that  Over the past decade  the central banks of the world have been overcompensating for the 2008 financial crisis by injecting more and more money into the economy and further supporting it by artificially keeping the interest rates at record low levels 

The poor stock markets have been eating this cheap money without question like veal being prepared for slaughter 

Here s a chart of the Dow Jones showing the dip through the financial crisis  Notice the large leap up in price and volumes over the last year 



What does this have to do with inflation 

Oh right  excuse my rambling 

Many believe that the pullback over the last two weeks is being caused by expectations that the Federal Reserve is about to tighten up their monetary policy 

Since low interest rates are a key driver of the upward momentum  many feel that if the rates start to go up  the markets will need to come down 

   and the key thing that the Fed is watching when deciding on those rates is the inflation data 

If inflation starts to go up faster than expected the main tool that the Fed has to slow it down is to raise the interest rates 

Analysts are  January s CPI inflation number to be 0 3  and the Core CPI to be 0 2  

Of course  if we see any numbers bigger than that it could startle investors and might drive up the US Dollar  which would benefit from larger interest rates 

What about Crypto 

During the announcement  I will personally be watching the crypto markets for any potential reaction 

In this chart  we can see that there has been a rather tight correlation between Bitcoin and the Dow Jones over the last month 



Of course  we know that both have been rising uncontrollably over the entire course of 2017  However  Bitcoin has already seen a very serious pullback of 71  while the Dow s recent low was only 13  from the peak 

In my view  the crypto pullback has already shaken out a large part of the speculation money and what we have now are more of the hard core holders  most of whom probably wouldn t sell even if we see  1000 again 

Whereas the stock market is still chalk full of speculation money  most of which has been focused on short term gains for far too long 

Any reaction to the CPI print in the crypto markets would be a clear sign that liquidity in this new market is rising and that old school investors are starting to get onboard

174850,396366,IBM,Government Shutdown Edition  VIX Implodes  SPX Reaches Fresh ATH,opinion,"AT40   66 3  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs    Day  1 of an overbought periodAT200   63 6  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   11 9Short term Trading Call  bullish
When traders closed up shop on Friday  I am guessing they assumed  as I did  that the U S  government would figure out something at the last minute to avoid a shutdown   
The volatility index  the VIX  was dropping fast  so I moved quickly to make a play on a relief in tensions in the coming week by buying a call option on ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE SVXY   The market was generous enough to let me exit my ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  call options at a profit the previous day  In my last Above the 40 post I complained about UVXY s inability to respond in kind to the rally in the VIX 

After staying elevated and gaining 9 out of the previous 10 trading days  the VIX lost 7 8  
The VIX s recent rise did not stop the upward momentum of the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   so no surprise that Friday s volatility implosion came alongside a fresh all time high for the S P 500  SPY  

The S P 500  SPY  has mostly ignored the noise and the drama on its way to a fresh sequence of all time highs 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   jumped from 63 4  to 68 3   AT40 was down big two days this week  so  once again  it has some catching up to prevent another round of bearish divergence with the S P 500 
The recent resilience of the S P 500  SPY  in the face of rising volatility has me poised to fade any fresh run up in volatility as a result of the shutdown of the U S  government  I will also be looking to buy into dips on favorite stocks unless an earnings report is right around the corner for that stock  The most attractive plays should be post earnings dips to or toward key support levels  I am betting that the resolution of the latest squabbling in Washington D C  will be celebrated by financial markets with a fresh scramble to buy  Regardless  I do not want to chase the sellers UNLESS the S P 500 breaks my line in the sand at 2 736 
STOCK CHART REVIEWS
Electro Scientific Industries Inc  NASDAQ ESIO  Keeping track of stocks and maintaining a mental list of favorites can be tedious and manual work  These days  I am trying to get better at checking out   a platform for automating the process of finding trading opportunities created by my old trading mentor  ESIO was one stock that intrigued me from    that came on January 3rd with the enticing analysis of  This is FINALLY lifting off from its 50 day moving average  It s got a nice collection of signals on this today  It s no wonder why I found it on the  Most Bullish Alerts  scan   
The next day the stock started falling and at the 50DMA I loaded up on call options  Much to my dismay  ESIO continued to sell off and my call options whittled down to a stub  Seeing no news to explain the sudden drop  I stubbornly doubled down but added a put option just in case some huge implosion was in the works  I was greatly rewarded last Thursday when the stock soared over 19  a day after jumping 9 5   I sold my position at that point 

Electro Scientific  ESO  shook off a 50DMA breakdown to gap back up its all time high 
The lessons here are not straightforward but important  Sure  a little luck helped here  Still  using options allowed me to set up an asymmetric trade with small risk and a lot of upside opportunity  Moreover  I was measured in my interpretation of the price action  I stuck with the bullish interpretation because the one day sell off failed to break the low from December  If I had not yet entered a trade  I would have assumed the sudden jump ahead of the earnings guidance was a sign that support was successfully tested and the all clear to buy was back 
In the end  the big move around earnings guidance simply returned ESIO to its previous post earnings momentum  I do not know why the enthusiasm waned only that the pullback created tremendous upside potential 
Ulta Beauty Inc  NASDAQ ULTA  ULTA is one of those stocks I regularly review  The stock is back to its 200DMA resistance  and I fully expect it to break through sooner rather than later  The stock recovered its post upgrade gain as I expected  Assuming the government shutdown generates a bit of selling on Monday  I want to add to my shares with call options 

Ulta Beauty  ULTA  looks ready for a 200DMA breakout 
International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  Speaking of earnings  IBM had a tough one last week  It was hard for IBM to deliver with such a large run up going into earnings despite its history of disappointments  I decided to take a chance and buy into this dip even though the stock gapped down right past last week s encouraging gap up  I am looking for the uptrending 20DMA to hold as support where buyers and optimists will regather themselves  Note in the chart below how neatly IBM filled its October post earnings gap up and  sloppily  held 50DMA support 

International Business Machines  IBM  failed to live up to big expectations going into earnings 
Newater Technology Inc  NASDAQ NEWA  The latest installment of crypto blockchain mania descended upon a Chinese waste water treatment company  NEWA  a recent IPO  announced a strategic partnership with NW Blockchain Limited  NWBL  

 The partners will focus on building a traceable  transparent  and highly secured platform for wastewater treatment opportunities and transactions  The partners expect to develop a blockchain token system that will be backed by the assets and the revenues from the wastewater treatment projects invested by NWBL and operated and managed by Newater  Investors will be able to purchase tokens from NWBL 
For each wastewater treatment project identified by both partners  NWBL will fund the project and purchase the wastewater treatment equipment from the Company  The Company will then manage and operate those projects  During the lifetime of the project  NWBL will pay the Company 20  of the project proceeds for managing and operating the project annually  

Note that NEWA did not publish the news on its the company website  Regardless  the mania passed much faster than other crypto blockchain run ups  NEWA gapped up 30 4  but promptly sold off from there  The stock is now trying to hold onto 50DMA support 

Newater Technology  Inc   NEWA  experienced a flash of panic buying in the wake of blockchain news  The dust cleared almost as quickly

NEW YORK  Reuters    A former software engineer for  IBM  in China was sentenced to five years in prison after he pleaded guilty to stealing proprietary source code from the company  prosecutors announced on Friday 
Jiaqiang Xu  32  was sentenced on Thursday by U S  District Judge Kenneth Karas in White Plains  New York  according to a statement from the office of U S  Attorney Geoffrey Berman  Xu pleaded guilty in May 2017 to economic espionage and theft of a trade secret 
Leanne Marek  Xu s attorney  did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Xu worked as a systems software developer for International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  Corp from 2010 to 2014  according to a public LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  profile  The company was not identified by name in court documents  and did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Xu was arrested in December 2015 after meeting with an undercover officer at a White Plains hotel  where authorities said he was recorded saying he used proprietary IBM code to make software to sell to customers  according to prosecutors 
He was originally charged with theft of a trade secret  The economic espionage charges were added in a superseding indictment filed last June 
Prosecutors said the proprietary computer code Xu stole was related to a so called clustered file system  which facilitates faster computer performance

174907,396423,IBM,Weekly Market Report   15 01 2018,opinion,"Market Summary
Asia
Asian markets got off to a good start last week  but the rally dried up by mid week  with most markets in the region falling in response to a weaker U S  dollar  The exemption to this was the Chinese linked markets  which continued climbing higher throughout the week  Australia s S P ASX 200 had the worst performance in the region as it fell 0 9  for the week  South Korea s Kospi was nearly flat  losing just 0 1   Despite falling for most of the week on a strengthening Yen  the Nikkei in Japan ended with a 0 3  weekly gain  Mainland China s Shanghai Composite rose 1 2  for the week  keeping its string of twelve consecutive winning sessions intact  The Hang Seng in Hong Kong did even better  scoring a record breaking fourteenth consecutive winning session on Friday and adding 1 9  for the week  The Hang Seng is up by 5  already in 2018 after scoring a more than 35  gain in 2017 
The strength in Chinese markets is likely to persist early in the week  although investors may become cautious after so many consecutive rising sessions  and with Chinese GDP and industrial production data due on Thursday  Rising commodity prices should help Australian markets  although the continued weakness from other sectors could keep the S P ASX 200 as a laggard  Japan s Nikkei is highly dependent on the strength or weakness of the Yen  so continued weakness from the U S  dollar will likely keep pressure on Japanese equities 
Europe
European markets also got off to a good start  but by mid week the rally had come to a screeching halt  Losses on Wednesday and Thursday weighed heavily on markets  but a gain on Friday allowed the Stoxx Europe 600 to move back into positive territory for the week  scoring a gain of 0 3  and rising for the sixth consecutive week  Things weren t as rosy in Germany  where the DAX had a weekly loss of 0 9   France s CAC 40 did well by contrast  rising 0 9   while the FTSE in London outperformed as it closed out the week at a new record high with a weekly gain of 1 4   News of an initial agreement for a coalition government in Germany sent both the Euro and Pound surging higher by more than 1  against the U S  dollar on Friday 
That surge higher for the Euro and Pound will likely have consequences as markets reopen on Monday  and if the current strength is maintained it could weigh on markets throughout the week  European markets are off to the worst start this year  despite signs of increasing economic strength  Shares of exporters will remain under pressure in the face of stronger currencies  with the Pound trading at its highest level since the Brexit vote  and the Euro trading at a more than three year high  There is no critical economic data from Europe this coming week  so markets will have to take their lead from Wall Street for the most part 
US
U S  markets had another outstanding week  although they did pause mid week  snapping the winning streak that began with the New Year  Still  by the end of the week the S P 500 had added 1 6   the Dow Industrials gained 2 0   and the Nasdaq tacked on 1 7   Just two weeks into 2018  the S P 500 is 4 2  higher  the Dow has a 4 4  gain and the Nasdaq is up by 5 2   Investors in the U S  remain exceedingly bullish  after seeing equities continue the rally that began last year  Friday saw earnings season begin  with Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  and JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  reporting mixed results for the fourth quarter  but investors had expected the results  so there were no surprises  Another good earnings season will almost certainly keep this bull market alive  but weak results could derail the good beginning to 2018

It was a fairly depressed week for cryptocurrencies  although NEO performed well  as did Ethereum  Bitcoin remained under pressure for most of the week  but a recovery was building in the crypto space on Friday  Ripple was one of the worst performing major coins of the week  dropping back below the  2 level mid week  but recovering enough Friday to trade slightly above that psychological level  Much of the bearishness came as South Korean regulators were discussing whether to ban cryptocurrency trading  This would strike quite a blow to markets as South Korea has one of the highest trading volumes in cryptocurrencies of any nation 
Performance in the cryptocurrency space this week will likely be determined by news from South Korea  If the trading ban comes into effect expect a sharp drop in markets  If South Korean regulators retract their decision to ban cryptocurrency trading we could get a strong rally  If there is little news from South Korea we expect markets to begin heading higher as well  though results could be mixed ",2018-01-15,AvaTrade,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weekly-market-report--15012018-200280175,200280175

Remember to subscribe and leave a rating on  if you enjoy the show 
IBM has reported a year over year decline in total revenues in 22 consecutive quarters  However  when the company reports its Q4 results on Thursday  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for total revenues of  21 96 billion  which would actually represent year over year growth of about 0 87  
So why is the Zacks Consensus Estimate calling for the streak to be snapped  To answer this question  Ryan turns to the Zacks Non Financial Metrics Consensus Estimates File  These estimates  which break down key earnings report items like business segment revenues  are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts 
Much has been made about the growth of IBM s cloud services and cognitive solutions categories  and these units are certainly the key growth drivers for the more than 100 year old company  But as Ryan shows with several key NFM estimates  snapping the streak will also require better than usual performance in the company s struggling divisions as well

Our latest consensus estimates are calling for CSX to post earnings of 56 cents per share and revenues of  2 88 billion  These results would represent year over year growth rates of  14 29  and  5 23   respectively  CSX s focus has been efficiency  so investors should keep their eyes on margins and free cash flow  Service disruptions could have an effect on the firm s top line  but earnings growth should still be present

174933,396449,IBM,Buffett Says Stock Ownership Became More Attractive With Tax Cut,news," Bloomberg     Warren Buffett said the U S  tax cut will make companies more valuable by giving owners a bigger share of profits 
 People who own the businesses  they now own 20 percent more of the domestic earnings   Buffett  chief executive of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc     NYSE BRKa   said in an interview on CNBC Wednesday 
Describing the change as a  big deal   he gave as an example Berkshire Hathaway s BNSF Railway 
 The government doesn t own the assets of the business   Buffett said   We own 100 percent of the assets of BNSF  but we don t own 100 percent of the profits  And we went from 65 to 79 percent of the profits of BNSF and that is a more than 20 percent increase  
Still  when asked about whether he would have pushed lawmakers to vote for or against the legislation  he chose another route 
 I would have had a different bill   he said   If I did it as a representative of Berkshire shareholders  I would have had to vote for it  
Here are some of his other comments 
On bitcoin 

Buffett said he s no fan of cryptocurrencies and is confident that the run up in their value is fleeting 
 In terms of cryptocurrencies  generally  I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending  Now when it happens  or how or anything else  I don t know  But I know this  If I could buy a five year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies  I d be glad to do it but I would never short a dime s worth  

On the stock market 

Stocks  are not richly valued relative to interest rates  
 Net we re buying   he said   We re basically buyers over time  There could be conditions under which we re sellers  For one thing  the money keeps coming so we basically keep buying  

On  IBM   NYSE IBM  

Buffett was asked whether he s been a buyer or seller of the stock  Berkshire owned 37 million shares of the company as of the end of September 
 It was advantageous if you had a loss in shares and we did in some of IBM  it was advantageous to sell last year rather than this year   he said   It would certainly mean that if we had a high cost of IBM that we were selling  we would have sold it last year  and if we had low cost  we would have waited until this year  And we had some of both  

Berkshire Vice Chairman Charles Munger joined Buffett in the interview and also addressed succession at the conglomerate  saying shareholders probably have  seven or more good years coming out of Warren  
Asked how many they had for him  Munger  94  said   Not very many  ",2018-01-10,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/buffett-says-stock-ownership-became-more-attractive-with-tax-cut-1087490,1087490

174957,396473,IBM,Why Should You Hold On To Hewlett Packard  HPE  Stock For Now,opinion,At times  it is prudent to retain certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company   NYSE HPE   seems to be one such stock  which investors need to retain if they are looking to reap long term gains  Though the stock faces several headwinds at the moment  these are transitory in nature  There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company to rebound in the long run Further  during the year to date period  the stock has gained 0 01   against the  s loss of 3 9  What s Going in HPE  Favor HPE reported modest fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  The company s non GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 29 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents and also came toward the higher end of management s guidance range of 26 30 cents  Further  the figure jumped 26 1  on a year over year basis The better than expected bottom line performance was primarily owing to cost savings  lower tax rate  favorable other income and expense as well as transactions in connection with Software spin merger HPE reported revenues from continuing operations  which includes Enterprise Group and Financial Services  of  7 660 billion  up 4 6  from the year earlier quarter s revenues of  7 324 billion We consider that divestment of Software division is in best interest of HPE  The company has sold this division to British firm  Micro Focus  in a cash stock deal worth  8 8 billion  HPE has received  2 5 billion in cash and the remaining consideration in the form of a 50 1  stake in the combined company  The software division generated fiscal 2016 revenues of  3 2 billion  down 11 8  from fiscal 2015 level  Moreover  it includes the highly controversial Autonomy acquisition that was mostly written down by the current CEO Meg Whitman It also includes other buyouts like Mercury Interactive and Vertica  Consequently  by selling assets which are not doing well and have limited growth potential  the company will be able to mobilize resources to the fast growing areas of the cloud such as software defined networks  SDN   and converged and hyper converged infrastructure Moreover  the stock looks attractive from a valuation perspective  This is because HPE currently trades at a forward P E of 11 18x compared with the industry group average of 76 30x  which signifies a huge upward potential The stock s long term earnings per share growth rate is 6 6  and it carries a  of A Concerns RemainIn a sudden move  Meg Whitman has decided to step down as the Chief Executive Officer  CEO  of HPE  leaving the company in the middle of its restructuring phase to cut costs and focus on high margin businesses Whitman has been replaced by Antonio Neri who also serves as the current president of HPE   Whitman will continue to function as a member of Board of Directors  Antonio will function as the CEO of HPE effective from Feb 1  2018 Moreover  the company issued a disappointing bottom line guidance for first quarter 2018  HPE expects non GAAP earnings per share in the range of 20 24 cents  mid point  22 cents   which was lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents The company also provided outlook for  2018  HPE expects non GAAP earnings per share for 2018 in the range of  1 15  1 25  mid point  1 2   The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at  1 17 We remain slightly cautious about the company s near term prospects due to three main challenges it is currently facing   heightened pressure from unfavorable currency exchange movements  elevated commodities pricing and some near term execution issues  These headwinds are expected to thwart overall performance in the near term Further  macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain other concerns  Competition from International Business Machines   NYSE IBM   and Oracle   NYSE ORCL   adds to woes Our TakeWe are encouraged by the company s massive restructuring initiatives  On one hand  it is offloading low margin business such as Software  which  in our opinion  will improve the company s margins over the long run  On the other hand  it is enhancing capabilities in the hybrid IT model as evident from the recent agreements to acquire SimpliVity and Cloud Cruiser  We believe the company s focus on hybrid IT model will drive growth over the long run We expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat even amid difficult times  Hence  we suggest investors to hold on to the stock at the moment Stock to ConsiderA better ranked stock in the broader

174966,396482,IBM,As energy markets evolve  blockchain powers up,news,"By Jeremy Wagstaff SINGAPORE  Reuters    Energy startups have been using blockchain to power electricity sharing in microgrid trials from Texas to Tasmania for a year or so   But now companies are moving beyond trials to commercial projects  leveraging the distributed ledger technology for payments and trading on a city wide and even national scale   What the internet did for communications  blockchain will do for trusted transactions  and the energy and utilities industry is no exception   said Stephen Callahan  Vice President  Energy  Environment   Utilities  Global Strategy  at  IBM   The trend illustrates how blockchain is swiftly moving beyond financial services and cryptocurrencies  and offers a glimpse of a growing challenge to the  2 trillion energy market   Blockchain is a database of transactions distributed among multiple computers  It solves two key problems in the online world  transacting without the need of a trusted intermediary  and making sure those transactions can t later be altered  removed or reversed  This appeals to the energy industry in several ways  As the market liberalizes and renewable energy grows  blockchain offers a way to better handle the increasingly complex and decentralized transactions between users  large  and small scale producers  retailers and even traders and utilities  Blockchain s use of tokens also offers a way to reward users for saving energy  and for small scale transactions between individual users with solar panels who are both producers and consumers   known as  prosumers   Being able to add  smart contracts  onto a blockchain would also make it possible for actions to generate automatic transactions down to the smallest level  where meters and computers could autonomously reconcile supply and demand   The prospect of being able to track particular electrons via a blockchain as they move onto or off the energy grid has captured the imagination of many companies   said Daniel Sieck of U S  law firm Pepper Hamilton   All of this would save money and could transform the way we produce  store and consume electricity  what DHL Energy president Steve Harley calls the  internet of electricity   ROOM TO GROW The World Energy Council predicts that such decentralized or distributed energy will grow from 5 percent of the market today to 25 percent in 2025  The past few years have seen proofs of concept and trials  from small microgrids to projects by big players such as Shell  L RDSa    BP   L BP  and IBM  N IBM    Few energy companies  however are making significant investments into blockchain technology  says Shane Randolph  managing director at Opportune LLP  an energy consulting firm based in Houston    The ones that are engaging in the conversation are largely doing  blockchain tourism  without developing applications    That leaves opportunities for newcomers   Power Ledger  an Australian startup which raised A 34 million   26 million  in an initial coin offering  or ICO  in October  is building platforms to enable commercial operation ofmicrogrids in Thailand and India and two commercial buildings in West Australia  It also recently launched a 200 customer trial microgrid with power retailer Origin Energy  AX ORG  in Sydney  Energi Mine  a UK based startup  has created a blockchain based platform to reward energy saving users with tokens they can use to pay their energy bills or charge their electric vehicles   It says it is already making money  albeit from the artificial intelligence side of its business  A Singapore company called Electrify has been running a price comparison marketplace as the country liberalizes its electricity market  Electrify plans to launch a blockchain based exchange for all consumers and producers next year  and is talking to one of Japan s biggest utilities about doing something similar there  Grid   a U S  startup  will launch its

Bennett  an IT industry analyst at Forrester  points to a  misunderstanding just how immature the technology is   Then there s the regulatory landscape   Because the energy sector is a regulated industry   said Pepper Hamilton s Sieck   widespread adoption of many possible blockchain use cases will require regulator buy in   There are signs of that  Singapore s Energy Market Authority

incumbents rather than disrupt them   However many individuals choose to capture  store and sell power  there will still be a lot of users who won t bother  says Hugh Halford Thompson  of BTL Group  which has this year completed gas trading pilots on its internet blockchain with BP  Eni  MI ENI  and Wien Energie    As a result we are going to see a lot of the larger firms adopting blockchain and

174992,396508,IBM,Is International Business Machines  IBM  A Great Value Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put International Business Machines Corporation   NYSE IBM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  International Business Machines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 stands at about 20 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  International Business Machines  current PE level puts it almost in line with its midpoint over the past five years  while it stands below the highs for the stock Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Computer   Technology sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at approximately 24  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that International Business Machines  forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company s share price as of now  We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  International Business Machines has a P S ratio of about 1 8  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  International Business Machines currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes International Business Machines a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  for International Business Machines is 8 3  a level that is much lower than the industry average of 15 2  Clearly  IBM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though International Business Machines might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B  This gives IBM a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one upward estimate revision in the past sixty days compared to four downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen four upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a small impact on the consensus estimate though  as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped by 0 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below International Business Machines Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineInternational Business Machines is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish Zacks Industry Rank  among Bottom 24  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past year  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we

175019,396535,IBM,Are These 5 Dow Stocks As Cheap As They Look  Part 5 of 5 ,opinion,"This is the final installment of my five part series looking at the past operating histories and valuations of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks  With this series I ve tried to cover the 30 Dow stocks in order of highest valuations to lowest  For the most part  I suggested that the Dow stocks are generally overvalued  but only a few dangerously so  With this final group  I take a fundamental look at the 5 least expensive stocks in the Dow Jones based on operating earnings P E ratios 
However  as I said in each article  valuations based on calculations like the P E ratio only tell part of the story  For starters  traditional metrics such as the P E ratio are predominantly historical  This partially explains why P E ratios reported on various financial sites often differ  In some cases  they report P E ratios based on trailing 12 months  ttm  or pure historical data  Other sites will report a P E ratio based on forward earnings estimates  And some sites such as FAST Graphs report P E ratios with a blended approach  considering past  current and the closest forecast   Nevertheless  the point is that future earnings achievements are a major valuation consideration 
Portfolio Review  5 Fairly Valued Dow Stocks
The following portfolio lists 5 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that appear undervalued based on their current low blended P E ratios  The 6th Dow constituent  DowDuPont  NYSE DWDP  is not reviewed because of the lack of historical data due to the recent merger 
However there are many ways to value a stock in addition to the P E ratio  Consequently  I suggest you also examine the price to cash flow of each of these 5 stocks  For those investors interested in dividend income  price to cash flow might be more relevant for higher yielding  dividend paying stocks  Furthermore  when assessing valuation  other factors like expected growth should also be considered  I elaborate more fully in the video below 
The following chart is presented in order of lowest blended P E ratio to highest  As an additional valuation check  note that the earnings yield  EPS Yld  of each of these 5 Dow constituents is above 7   Consequently  this particular group of stocks appears more attractively valued than what we saw in the first five parts of the series  However  low valuations don t necessarily make these the 5 best investments in the Dow Jones currently  Investors must also consider the future potential growth of both earnings and dividends 
Furthermore  low current valuations might be the only commonality among this diverse group  In other words  this is a really diverse group of Dow constituents  each with its own unique identities  attributes and histories  Therefore  individual investors should also factor in whether or not any of these Dow constituents meet their specific objectives and risk tolerances  Finally  as it relates to this series of articles  these are simply the remaining Dow constituents  The primary objective of this series was to provide the reader a clearer perspective regarding the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a proxy for the market 

Out Loud Valuations
This video presents a quick overview of each of these Dow constituents based primarily on price  relative to earnings and cash flow  However  for certain constituents  I will also evaluate other metrics  For any reader concerned with the current valuation of the stock market  this video  and the videos in Parts 1  2  3 and 4 are must watches  Furthermore  although I only provide a cursory review  perform your own due diligence   I believe you will find the video enlightening and hopefully entertaining 

Summary And Conclusions
A primary objective of this series was to provide the reader a more informed and enlightened view of what the so called  stock market  really is  Hopefully  after reviewing each of the 5 videos in this series  investors will recognize the significant difference between  for example  investing in Visa  NYSE V  versus investing in Verizon  NYSE VZ   Although both are included in the index commonly referred to as the market  they are vastly different animals from an investment perspective  In many ways  the same can be said for every other Dow constituent 
Furthermore  I am hopeful this series helps investors realize that it truly is a market of stocks and not a stock market  Even though the index continues hovering at all time highs  not every company in the index is trading at all time highs  And let s not overlook the significant variation of earnings and dividend growth  Over the past 15 years  the annual earnings growth rate of 1 Dow stock has been a  8 7    8 7  per annum   In contrast  the highest 15 year annual earnings growth rate has been 33   That difference between the growth rate of the lowest growing Dow stock versus the fastest growing Dow stock is incomparable 
In summary  there are many more differences than there are similarities between each of the 30 Dow Jones stocks  This undeniable reality is why I always recommend that investors judge their portfolios based on the merits of the individual holdings they own  Moreover  I suggest that portfolios should be built and managed one company at a time  Unless you are a passive index investor  the level of the overall market should not concern you nearly as much as the level of each of your individual holdings  As I once said  mind your  owned  businesses

175027,396543,IBM,World s First AI Run Global ETF Makes Its Own Managers Nervous,news," Bloomberg     The first global equity ETF run by robots made its trading debut even as its managers expressed anxiety about investing in an exchange traded fund lacking the human touch 
 I m going to be buying some but I m buying it as a nervous investor myself   Steve Hawkins  co chief executive officer of Horizons ETFs Management Canada  said before the Horizons Active A I  Global Equity ETF began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange Wednesday   We don t know what the computer will do  
Hawkins stressed that the artificial intelligence behind the ETF  developed by Korea based Qraft Technologies Inc   was rigorously back tested over 10 years of market moves to make sure it learned how to interpret data and make smart investments  However  unlike human portfolio managers  it will never be able to explain why it made a particular decision 
 We don t know why it s going to be making those independent decisions  but from our rigorous testing we believe that it s going to make the right decisions   Hawkins said in a phone interview 
The Horizon A I  fund  sub advised by Mirae Asset Global Investments Co   has a management fee of 0 55 percent and will be rebalanced monthly  It will invest in global equities using a basket of primarily North American listed ETFs and will make its decisions using more than 50 metrics  including six month relative performance and short interest  It trades on the Toronto bourse under the ticker symbol MIND 
The ETF opened little changed at C 25 15 at 9 44 a m  in Toronto 
Watson ETF
It s not the first robot run ETF  The A I  Powered Equity ETF of U S  stocks  driven by International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  Corp  s Watson computer  beat it by two weeks  Horizons says it s the first to invest in global equities  Toronto based Horizons  controlled by Seoul based Mirae Asset  operates 79 ETFs and has C 8 9 billion   6 9 billion  in assets under management 
Artificial intelligence may seem scary to some investors  but Hawkins said he s confident it will prove itself to be smarter than your average portfolio manager 
 AI can do the work of a team of global strategists  can look at millions of data points very quickly  where a team of strategists would have to work 24 7  365 days a year   he said   It doesn t bring in investor bias or emotion with respect to any of its decisions  and we hope to see output that will be able to consistently outperform human decision making  
That said  he doesn t expect investors to flock to the ETF  at least not initially 
 We really expect the first year to be tempered from an investor appetite perspective  but once we have proven that the computer can do things well  we expect appetite to significantly increase   he said   There are some investors who will always prefer the human touch  ",2017-11-01,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/worlds-first-airun-global-etf-makes-its-own-managers-nervous-761836,761836

175036,396552,IBM,Weighing The Week Ahead  Where Is The Fear  ,opinion,"With a light economic calendar  there is plenty of air time for pundit pontification  The record setting market still has many shaking their heads  Many  after noting the many world problems  are asking 
Where is the fear 
Last Week Recap
My last edition of WTWA  two weeks ago  asked whether earnings season could spark a big rally  That was a pretty good topic to consider over the last two weeks   And it is still quite relevant  
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  via Jill Mislinski  She notes the gain of 0 86  on the week  as well as other key comparisons  Once again  it was a week of very low volatility 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read the entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 
Personal Note

If you missed my   you might want to check it out  I cite some modern applications of the classic three door problem 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic news has been mostly positive 
The Good
Industrial production rebounded from last month s decline to a gain of 0 3   beating expectations 
Corporate earnings have been solid  with 76  of S P 500 companies beating expectations     
Conference calls have been positive   also notes strength in industrial sentiment  More than half regard industrial equities as fairly valued  with  overvalued  declining  Tax reform or infrastructure spending are not priced into the market 

Philly Fed index of 27 9 rose significantly from last month s 23 8
Existing home sales registered a slight beat of expectations with an annual rate of 5 39 million   treats anything over 5 million as  solid  
Jobless claims declined to 222K   Bespoke  New Deal Democrat s  for this series have proved accurate 


The Bad
Housing starts declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1127K  a decline from August and a miss of the expected 1160K     
Leading indicators declined 0 2  after last month s gain of 0 4   missing expectations by 0 3  

The Ugly
The 1987 market crash and allegations that 2017 is similar   has a nice explanation of the differences  including the charts below  The first is a version of one popular among those who want to make sure you are scared witless  The second uses percentage changes for a valid comparison

Buy the Dip  Buy the Rip


Be Greedy When Others Are Greedy


The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
We have a fairly light week for economic data  featuring new home sales and the first report on Q3 GDP  Earnings season continues in full swing  And of course  we do not know what Twitter will bring us  but we can be confident that it will be something 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
This week features a pretty light economic calendar  This always provides extra time for pundit pontification  Record setting markets get daily attention  but it requires little time to take note of the new high  Attention quickly turns to questions about when the rally might end and what could be the spark  Most important of all might be investor attitudes 
Expect the punditry to be asking 
Where is the fear 
Statista cites the  


Stocks are wildly overpriced   little future and crash potential  There is no fear among complacent investors 
Stocks will decline  but  there    I m seeing this carefully hedged prediction more often  
Nobel Prize winners do not understand current stock prices   see Tim Duy below

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be  of  newly minted  Nobel laureate Richard Thaler s take on risk and the stock market    while not  understanding it  believes that we are in the  riskiest moment of our lives  while the stock market is napping  Prof  Duy notes the many past historical risks  including  for example  the Cuban missile crisis  He also cites the record of another Nobel Prize winner and acclaimed expert on bubbles  Prof  Shiller

Lessons from Trading
We frequently feature Dr  Brett Steenbarger when we talk trading  He is the leading expert on psychology  performance  and many other related topics  His conclusions for traders are often quite apt for investors as well  Consider this week s   It describes many investors as well 

The one refrain I ve heard from those active traders over the past two years is  this is going to turn around  Stocks are too expensive  Rates are too low  Volatility is too cheap  Everyone wants to catch the turn and profit from the break  So stocks dip  VIX bounces  put call ratios go to the moon  and the trends continue  Moderate growth with modest inflation and low interest rates that make stocks a desirable carry instrument mean that SPY  NYSE SPY  has ground higher and vol has ground lower 
Traders  forecasts for reversals in stocks and vol have had more of a psychological grounding than a logical one  Hope is not a business plan and it s not an edge in markets 

Dividend stocks
David Fish has a  on the dividend increases from the  champion  group  He also has related updates for  and   For those seeking a consistent stream of dividend income  this is a great source to follow 
The Next Big Thing
How is value created over time   Davidson  via  provides both theory and some examples 

But  how does one forecast inventions such as the iPhone  the Internet  a cure for Hepatitis C or preventative for HIV which force forecasters to revise all their previous assumptions of earlier forecasts  How does one forecast the future of markets if one never anticipated such evolutionary discoveries  The answer lays in not trying to predict the details of the  next great discovery  but resides in understanding how individuals and society thinks and behaves 


One begins by identifying how value is created over time  Once one delves into the process of value creation  it forces one to conclude that value occurs when producers successfully meet the needs of society s relentless desire to improve its standard of living 

Big winners from autonomous driving  and what is blocking the way    
Morningstar takes a look at stocks in their   They cite important themes  rapidly growing technologies  and motes  That said  the resulting names are speculative 

Identifying the  next big thing  before it takes off takes a lot of skill  a little luck  and a leap of faith  After all  if you wait until a new product or technology is flying off the shelves  investors  optimistic expectations of future growth are likely already reflected in the stock s price 

Here are some current ideas  which include choices that will surprise many 

Personal Finance
Seeking Alpha Senior Editor Gil Weinreich has an interesting topic every day  His own commentary adds insight and ties together key current articles  As usual this week he had several good articles  but my favorite  about whether people should work longer before retirement  Gil emphasizes the help this provides for retirement expenses  and that is important to consider  I would add that enjoying your work is crucial  Some would like to continue  but with fewer hours  Others might find things they always wanted to do  and which provide a little extra income  This is really a great topic 
Tadas took a well deserved vacation  As usual  Abnormal Returns featured some interesting questions with answers from financial bloggers  They are all well worth reading  This is information that is useful  but difficult to get in any other way  I always enjoy reading the answers from colleagues and reconsidering my own  I am a little disappointed in the answers to     Many of the participants have been wrong about both methods and results  Maybe they should be doing some re examination  Consider the answers to the   If you do not think you can improve on an index fund  you must take a hard look at the value of your service  Mr  Buffett himself says that if markets were efficient  he would be on a street corner selling pencils from a tin cup  He would take his own bet   some key answers 
Watch out for  
NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA   Great company  Brilliant execution of strategy  A great company does not always make a great stock  Price is important     
Final Thoughts
There are several errors in the mainstream analysis of fear 
Just because the market has low volatility does not mean that investors are complacent  The market does not consist of a single  uninterested investor or trader  It is the result of millions of decisions  reflecting a range of viewpoints and objectives 
Asset prices of stocks are reasonable if you look at the premium of expected returns over inflation 
There are many frightened investors on the sidelines 
So many assume that a long business cycle must mean we are near the end  Wrong  No one knows how much longer it might last 
There is a lot of lightweight analysis and it is all very popular  It caters to popular conceptions of economics  markets  and experts  The challenge for investors is to look at evidence in an open minded fashion 
What worries me 
The number of ETFs and the lack of liquidity in many 
Excessive speed  Faster communications and a shortened news cycle seem fine in principle  but too many decisions of all types are made impulsively 
 and what doesn t
The Fed  We are still more than a year away from when changes in Fed policy will be important for stocks  despite the popular focus on this topic  It also does not matter  in the short run  whom President Trump selects to be the new Fed Chair  or his other appointments

175039,396555,IBM,MongoDB s Successful IPO Conceals Challenges,opinion,"The last few days have gone very well for MongoDB  NASDAQ MDB  after the company s successful IPO on Thursday  As  reports  the company finished up 34 percent for the day with a price point of over  32 compared to the IPO price of  24  A further day of trading saw the company s stock fall to  30 68  but the company has still netted  192 million from the IPO and possesses a valuation of over  1 5 billion 
But plenty of companies start strong with their IPOs and falter later  and investors now have to ask whether MongoDB is worth it at the new price point  Unfortunately  there is no compelling reason to jump in at the current  higher price point  MongoDB does have certain narratives in its favor such as positive coverage boosted by a media which will love to report on a successful New York based tech stock  But it remains yet another tech IPO with good revenue growth yet no clear path towards profitability  and those who already have this stock should be willing to sell when the lock up period expires  A better plan for now is to sit and wait 
Open Source or Not
MongoDB describes itself in its  as  the leading modern  general purpose database platform  as it works to manage other companies  databases  Some of their customers include the Department of Homeland Security  eBay  Adobe  and T Mobile  and MongoDB states it has over 4 300 customers in 85 countries 
The company wants to portray itself as the next Oracle  NYSE ORCL  in providing database services  and hopes to argue that it can do more at a fraction of the cost  MongoDB provides open source software for free like Cloudera Inc  NYSE CLDR  and Hortonworks Inc  NASDAQ HDP   two companies which developed open source database software  went public  and have struggled since 
However  investors should not necessarily assume that MongoDB will struggle for the same reasons  MongoDB is easier to use  and users have to pay a subscription if they want to use MongoDB at its full potential 
The good news for MongoDB is that it has succeeded in poaching clients away from legacy database providers like Oracle and IBM  NYSE IBM   as revenue has risen from  34 million in the 2014 fiscal year to  91 million in 2016  The bad news is that MongoDB s losses have risen from  75 million to  85 million in that same timeframe  Losses may not have increased as much as revenue  but so far MongoDB has failed to show that they have a clear path  Like far too many tech IPOs  MongoDB warns that  as our costs increase  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability  
Sustaining Growth
MongoDB had  92 million in cash before this IPO and indicated that it plans to use the raised funds to expand its corporate efforts rather than pay back debt  The company will need these funds because it faces certain challenges in sustaining its growth 
As noted above  MongoDB views its primary competition as legacy databases like Oracle  but it will have to figure out how to deal with the rise of cloud based databases like Amazon Web Services  MongoDB has done a good job here with the MongoDB Cloud Manager  and its Atlas services are available on AWS as well  And as MongoDB is a bit player compared to the huge amounts Oracle makes through its database services  it can continue to grow for some time at Oracle s expense 
But that also means the larger companies  such as Instagram  could potentially outmuscle MongoDB by offering bundles and working together with third parties  Due to its size  MongoDB must constantly stay ahead of its competitors in technology and be prepared for the latest in database and cloud technology  While it is successful for now  whether it can continue to compete over the long term is another concern 
Wait for Now
MongoDB has reasons to expect it will continue to thrive in the months to come  but investors need a bit more than optimism  MongoDB has to show in the coming months that it can keep its losses under control and move down the road towards profitability  successfully compete with Oracle  and avoid the faith of other  similar database companies 
As of right now  it has failed to do so and investors should stay away for the moment  If investors are interested in jumping in when the lock up period expires  observe whether MongoDB has succeeded in getting losses to drop as well as customer growth  If it cannot show a consistent ability to grow or tamp down losses  we could be looking at another Snap The last few days have gone very well for MongoDB Inc   NASDAQ MDB  after the company s successful IPO on Thursday  As TechCrunch reports  the company finished up 34 percent for the day with a price point of over  32 compared to the IPO price of  24  A further day of trading saw the company s stock fall to  30 68  but the company has still netted  192 million from the IPO and possesses a valuation of over  1 5 billion 
 But plenty of companies start strong with their IPOs and falter later  and investors now have to ask whether MongoDB is worth it at the new price point  Unfortunately  there is no compelling reason to jump in at the current  higher price point  MongoDB does have certain narratives in its favor such as positive coverage boosted by a media which will love to report on a successful New York based tech stock  But it remains yet another tech IPO with good revenue growth yet no clear path towards profitability  and those who already have this stock should be willing to sell when the lock up period expires  A better plan for now is to sit and wait ",2017-10-22,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mongodbs-successful-ipo-conceals-challenges-200220221,200220221

The current eight year bull market has feasted on the flood of cheap money from global central banks  More recently  we ve had a series of upbeat quarterly earnings reports from the major blue chips to keep the Dow above 23 000  On Wednesday night  for example  IBM s stronger than expected earnings report drove its shares nearly 9  higher and with it  the tech sector 
Of course President Trump has had a hand in the stock market s advance  dangling his tax cut carrot  If passed  the repatriation of up to  200 billion is expected to be directed to share buybacks and lower tax rates  which would boost bottom line earnings 
Aside from the positives  though  it s always best to look at price action and look for meaningful signs of price exhaustion and trend reversal  Bears in the market believe sufficient evidence includes 

Prices trading outside the upper Keltner Channel
RSI divergence on various timeframes and above seventy five
Decisive and clear sign of range expansion to the downside
Break below daily ascending trend channel

As you can see below  futures on the S P 500 tick most of the boxes  The last piece of evidence is more conservative and would need more pronounced confirmation 

What is clear in this bull market  however  is that the  buy the dips  mentality has been prevalent whenever we have had a move lower  Some would also argue that the market has not experienced a delusional phase or a blow off top  For sure  the 30th anniversary of that fateful day in October 1987 brings the vagaries of the market into sharp focus for traders and investors alike ",2017-10-19,Jamie Dutta,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-most-hated-bull-market-about-to-end-200219800,200219800

Asian markets were broadly higher on Monday  although many did finish off their session highs following weaker than expected inflation data from China  That data also sent the Shanghai Composite lower  making it the only falling market in the region on Monday  Japan s Nikkei was supported by a softer Yen  leading to another 21 year high for the Japanese benchmark index  In Australia  the S P ASX 200 is approaching a 9 year high as firming metals prices gave the index a boost  Markets across Asia were also supported by the soft inflation data out of the U S  last Friday  which gave hopes of a delayed interest rate hike scenario for the U S 
European markets were mostly higher on Monday  but a loss in the Spanish IBEX 35 brought on by worries over Catalan secession plans weighed on the broadest European indices  Germany s DAX hit a new record as it closed above the 13 000 level for the first time ever  Spain could be looking at an extended period of turbulence after Madrid gave the Catalan president until Thursday at 10am local time to drop the bid for independence  If a response is not received by then it will open the door for Madrid to invoke Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution and take control of Catalonia  In London  the FTSE edged lower  even though mining shares performed well and the Pound softened against rival currencies 
U S  markets moved broadly higher  once again scoring new record closing highs as investor confidence remains high heading into earnings season  Investors are expecting solid earnings results that will justify the current high levels in equity markets and so far they haven t been too disappointed  Volatility could begin to pick up however as we get deeper into earnings season as the markets try to digest hundreds of daily earnings releases 
FOREX
EUR USD 
The pair eased lower for a third consecutive session Monday  settling below the 1 1800 level as concerns over rising political risks in Spain have caused additional caution among traders  With Madrid giving the Catalan separatists until Thursday at 10am local time to abandon their independence initiative we could see further pressure on the pair leading up to that deadline 
USD JPY
Japanese traders reversed the losses seen from this pair last Friday  with the pair gapping 30 pips higher at the open  and continuing higher to end back above the 112 00 level  It is possible we could see the pair trading in a fairly tight range over the next week as traders become increasingly cautious ahead of the Japanese snap general election 
Cryptocurrencies
The cryptocurrency market remained mostly in bull mode  although some of the major coins saw declines by the end of Monday s session  Specifically  Ethereum saw a slight decline  while Ripple and DASH both fell more substantially  though both are seeing support levels hold  Capital continues to flow into Bitcoin  and this could define the cryptocurrency space until the SegWit2x hard fork occurs in mid November 
Commodities
Metals 
Precious metals fell slightly on Monday as investors remain cautious over the course of interest rate hikes in the U S   and in response to some modest strength in the U S  dollar  Gold settled lower by just 0 1   remaining above the  1 300 level  Friday saw weak inflation data released in the U S  but Sunday the Fed chairwoman reiterated that low inflation won t keep the Fed from making the right decision regarding interest rate hikes  The conflicting information has traders cautious  and could keep precious metals trapped in a tight band until further data becomes available 
Oil 
Crude gained on Monday  reaching a three week high as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East escalated  Traders already have the potential for the U S  to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal as one risk factor  but on Monday Iraqi forces moved north into Kirkuk  a region held by Kurdish separatists  and also a major oil producing region  Worries over potential disruptions to production lifted crude prices 
Indices
Dow Industrials 
The Dow added 0 37  on Monday  making it the best performing major index and taking it nearly to the 23 000 level for the first time ever  While it didn t reach that lofty height yet  it still closed at a new record high as financial and technology shares led the way higher  With earnings season expected to be healthy for the market the 23 000 level probably won t take long to reach 
IBEX 35  
Spain s benchmark index turned lower Monday as investors worried about prolonged political turmoil in the Catalan region of Spain  The worries came as Madrid issued an ultimatum to Catalonia s president to drop the push for independence or face the loss of home rule under Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution  Such a move would surely anger the more radical supporters of independence  leading to more demonstrations and potential clashes in the streets of Barcelona

IBM will be one of the first big technology companies to report third quarter earnings as they report after the bell Tuesday  It is expected that the company will once again report declining quarterly revenues  but an increase in earnings per share as it continues to move away from its traditionally hardware and software based business to a services and cloud based business model  While a case can be made for improvement at IBM  it is coming slowly  as you would expect at such a large company  Still  on a longer term chart one can see that the stock could be moving into an uptrend  although a break above the  182 79 high from the beginning of 2017 would be needed to confirm that ",2017-10-17,AvaTrade,https://www.investing.com/analysis/global-rally-continues-with-modest-gains-200219198,200219198
175105,396621,IBM,Gold s Kilonova  Ripple s Rise,opinion,"For the first time ever astronomers around the world were treated to an astonishing event in outer space called a  Kilonova  
Two dead stars known as neutrons crashed into each other at high speed  The stars were relatively small  just about 12 miles in diameter  but extremely dense  Some scientists estimate that a single teaspoon of the star s substance would weigh a billion tons on Earth 
The outcome of the collision was the creation of copious amounts of metals that are extremely rare here on earth like gold and platinum  The sight is being hailed as one of the biggest advances in astrophysics and even answers the age old question  where does gold come from  
Some bitcoin extremists on the web were quick to point out that gold may not possess as much rarity as it used to and therefore is no longer the best store of value as it was throughout history 
However  the Kilonova did take place approximately 130 million light years away  So until we invent interstellar travel gold s status as a backup monetary system and safe haven remains solid 
Today s Highlights
Dollar Strength
Carney Today 
IBM  NYSE IBM  Steps on Ripple
Please note  All data  figures   graphs are valid as of October 17  All trading carries risk  Only risk capital you can afford to lose 
Market Overview
Stocks are generally positive today as the global equity bubble reaches ever higher  As we ve mentioned most analysts feel that stocks are expensive but that this overvaluation may continue for up to two years 
The US dollar is also making a move of strength lately and is up sharply against its peers over the last 30 days 

Over the long term  though  this move in the dollar is simply a bounce against a larger downward trend that s been happening since Donald Trump took office 

Of course  Trump s weakening of the dollar could also be seen as a small reversal from the upward trend that s been forming over the past decade 

Today s Event
The highlight today will most likely be a speech from the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney  who will be testifying before the Treasury Select Committee in London 
Traders want to know if indeed Mark will be raising the English interest rates at their meeting next month  Currently the market is placing an 83  chance of a hike on November 2nd 
Furthermore  if indeed the rates are raised  investors want to understand the future path of monetary policy in the UK  Will this hike be a  one and done  or are we on the path to further hikes going forward 
In the wake of the referendum  the BoE cut interest rates near zero to try and cushion the Brexit blow  Now that it s clear that the blow is less than expected many economists feel that it s time to reverse that move 
The GBP USD is strengthening this morning in anticipation but if Carney does indeed want to sustain these moves  he s gonna need to be a bit more aggressive than he s been to date 

Ripple Short
Ripple s first annual Swell conference is well underway  No doubt everyone there is very excited about the  from the Gates Foundation that they will be using Ripple s technology in their new efforts to open the world of banking to billions of people 
Just before the conference started though there was another unrelated announcement that could affect the price as well  The tech giant IBM has just made public their new Hyperledger Blockchain with the goal of speeding up international interbank transactions 
This sounds extremely similar to Ripple s goal  which is to  replace the Swift system that banks currently use to send funds  
Now  I m no bank manager but I do believe that most big banks would be quicker to work with an established company like IBM than with even the most successful startup 
As far as the technical analysis of Ripple s XRP token goes  we are just near the top of a huge price range from 15 cents to 30 cents 

On top of all that  the top most copied Cryptotrader in eToro has just announced on his wall that he s going for a big short sell with the anticipation of a price drop 

Of course  short sell trading is risky and cryptotrading is even more risky  So as always please be sure to diversify your investments and build a proper portfolio 
Let me know if you need any help with that  Today I ll be holding a webinar to discuss the markets and portfolio positioning with our top equity clients  If you are one of them  feel free to join in at  
Let s have an amazing day

175111,396627,IBM,Commerzbank  other banks join UBS and IBM trade finance blockchain,news,"By Anna Irrera
NEW YORK  Reuters     Commerzbank AG   DE CBKG   Bank of Montreal  Erste Group Bank AG and CaixaBank SA have joined an initiative launched by UBS Group AG and  IBM   NYSE IBM  Corp aimed at building blockchain based technology to support trade finance transactions 
The platform called Batavia would help banks and their clients automate the trade finance process  which remains highly manual and paper based  the participating companies said on Wednesday 
In trade finance  banks provide funding and other services to importers and exporters to facilitate commerce 
Among other things Batavia will allow parties to track a transaction from when a shipment leaves a port to when it reaches its destination 
Blockchain  which was first developed to power cryptocurrency bitcoin  is a shared ledger of data that is maintained by computers  rather than a central authority  Over the past few years  banks have been investing millions of dollars in adapting the technology to run some of their data heavy and complex processes 
Banks have been collaborating and forming consortia to develop the technology 
Trade finance is considered a good use for the technology because it involves numerous parties such as the institutions financing the transactions  buyers  sellers  transporters and inspectors 
Currently each party maintains its own records  which can lead to mistakes and delays  The new platform aims to provide all participants with a shared record  reducing errors and driving more business 
 Trade finance is a perfect use case because there are so many participants in a trade ecosystem especially when you talk of global trade   Marie Wieck  a general manager at IBM Blockchain  said in an interview   Digitizing and creating a level of trust is a perfect accelerator  for business   
A pilot is expected to take place with the new banks in the first quarter of 2018  Wieck said  The project was first announced in 2016 
The platform would also use so called smart contracts  or computer programs on the blockchain that automatically enforce the terms of an agreement  For example the platform would release payments for a transaction along each step of the trade process 
While the finance industry continues to experiment with blockchain  it is still in its early days and some caution that it may take several years before it leads to any benefits

175195,396711,IBM,Here s how Trump s council of business titans fell apart,news,"President Donald Trump s biggest gatherings of business leaders fell apart  and according to reports Trump s own comments are to blame 
As detailed by reports  the decision to finally disband the council came after Trump s comments over the weekend that did not explicitly denounce neo Nazi and white nationalist groups at the heart of the violence in Charlottesville  Virginia 
The Strategic and Policy Forum was announced in December 2016 for business leaders to have a direct line to Donald Trump and influence his policies going forward  Critics argued it was a simple way for Trump to display a stable  pro business face  Steve Schwarzman  the Forum s leader and CEO of private equity giant Blackstone  NYSE BX   said at the time that it was an opportunity to help shape the new president s policies 
 The Forum  which is composed of some of America s most highly respected and successful business leaders  will be called upon to meet with the president frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the president implements his plan to bring back jobs and Make America Great Again   said a release announcing the formation of the council 
 For a full list of members  check out this post  
There was only one official meeting of the Forum on February 3  at which Trump promised  exciting times ahead  and said his administration was  coming out with a tax bill soon and a healthcare bill even sooner  
Following the violence in Charlottesville and Trump s initial reaction in which he said  many sides  were to blame for the events  His remarks prompted the demise of the council  Here s a breakdown of how the council fell apart according to reports from CNBC s Patti Domm and Dominic Chu and Bloomberg s Melissa Mittelman  Jennifer Kaplan  Jing Cao  and Zachary Tracer 

Sunday night  PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  CEO Indra Nooyi began to ask other members about whether the Forum remained a good idea 
Sunday night Monday morning  General Motors  NYSE GM  CEO Mary Barra and  IBM   NYSE IBM  CEO Ginni Rometty joined Nooyi in calling the other members and gauging the reaction to Trump s comments 
Monday morning  Merck  NYSE MRK  CEO Kenneth Frazier quits an unrelated council of manufacturing business leaders  prompting a wave of departures from that group and ramping up public pressure among the other members of Trump s various business groups 
Monday afternoon  Trump s statement Monday condemning white supremacists and neo Nazis cooled the nervousness of the Forum s members 
Tuesday afternoon  The straw that broke the camel s back  Trump s wild press conference walked back much of his statement from Monday and was seen by many as support for some members of the white nationalist protestors   They were appalled by what has happened since Charlottesville and yesterday was the tripwire   one Forum member told CNBC 
Tuesday evening  Calls began again between members  Barra  Rometty  Nooyi  JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  CEO Jamie Dimon  BlackRock CEO Larry Fink decided they will leave the Forum if it is not dissolved 
Wednesday morning  around 3 a m  ET  Schwarzman requested all Forum members join a conference call in the morning 
Wednesday  11 30 a m  ET  On the call  the members agreed to end the council  As many as 10 of the 12 members on the council agreed 
Wednesday afternoon  Schwarzman got in contact with the administration to inform them of the decision  according to Bloomberg the Blackstone CEO spoke with White House adviser Jared Kushner 
Wednesday 1 14 p m ET  Despite the CEOs coming to the agreement to disband the group themselves  Trump preempts a joint statement announcing the end of the council and tweets that it was his decision to end the Forum and the manufacturing council 

And so the first so called CEO president lost the counsel of the leaders of some of the world s most influential companies 
One member of the forum told Axios  Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei the CEOs  couldn t justify the capital they were spending  hoping that this guy can function in a somewhat mature and statesmanlike way  
 Everyone knew  going in  that this was the way the guy was   the executive told Axios   They were just hoping that if he got the right people and decisionmaking processes in place  he could grow into the job  He proved he has no capability to do that  
 There was such a firestorm  You don t know what s coming next or what he s going to say or do next   one Forum member told CNBC   It s striking when the president loses the confidence of America s CEOs  ",2017-08-17,Business Insider,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/here039s-how-trump039s-council-of-business-titans-fell-apart-519699,519699

175199,396715,IBM,Focus On Gold  Silver And Precious Metals Mining ,opinion,"The graphic card in my computer committed suicide Monday evening this past week  and I didn t get it back until Thursday evening  So this article may be a bit short of text and graphic than are my usual outputs  I think I ll use this as an excuse to focus on gold and silver this week 
Here s gold s step sum chart going back to November 2010  For almost a year  November 2010 to August 2011  gold s step sum saw an amazing ascent  rising from 220 to 275  55 net advancing days  in a ten month period  That s a lot  but then that s what a buying panic looks like in a step sum plot  Then came 22 August 2011  with gold closing at  1 888 70 and that was it for the advance 
The way to understand a step sum chart is realize the price plot Blue Plot  is market reality  the simple fact of whether the market is trending up or down  The step sum plot  Red Plot  is a market sentiment indicator of the most important people in any market  those who are actually buying and selling day in and day out 
Usually  market reality and sentiment are in agreement with each other  But this isn t always so  When these plots conflict with each other a step sum box forms  such as the big bear box seen below from October 2012 to March 2014 
Sometimes it s difficult seeing a box form and develop in real time  other times it s not  And there are no hard rules to follow when a box begins or ends  Basically  the only rules I follow are if I see the two plots diverge for over eight weeks  a box is forming  When the two trends undeniably synchronize once again with each other  the box is closed  and I can always change my mind should the situation require it  as sometimes it does 
Whether a box is a bull or bear is determined by the trend of the price plot  Seeing the price plot advance as its step sum trends sideways or actually declines is a bull box  Having the price trend down as the step sum plot trends sideways or actually advances is a bear box  When a box has been identified  trust the price plot  market reality   not the step sum  market sentiment   as the best predictor of the future price trend  though that isn t always true but usually it is 
If the price plot is so important  why even bother with the step sum plot  To answer that question  let s study gold s bear box below  The bear box began in October 2012  a year into a vicious four year decline  The step sum plot also began declining at this time  but nothing like the decline in the price of gold because the bulls refused to capitulate  After a down day  the bulls all too frequently only want to buy more cheap gold the following day  preventing the collapse in the step sum plot 
I placed a black rectangle around the false breakout in the bear box  from December 2013 to April 2014 when gold saw a good advance off an apparent bottom  Note the step sum plot followed the price plot up as the bulls piled into the market  At the time it would have been reasonable to have closed the box  as it appeared a bottom was made in December  However  up to this point it was a problem not seeing market sentiment  the step sum plot  collapse along with the price of gold  For a multi year bear box this was unusual  though not unheard of 
Beginning in late April 2014 gold s price plot once again turned down  but nothing like the decline of 2012 13  However  this decline broke the back of bullish market sentiment  resulting in an18 month long collapse in the step sum plot  collapse in bullish market sentiment   Where before the bulls were ready to enter the market after a decline to purchase more  cheap gold   now a decline in the price of gold only made the bulls want to join in the selling to exit their positions 
Note my second black rectangle  pointing where gold s step sum plot dropped like a rock   illustrating total capitulation by the bulls in the gold market  total exhaustion by the market s bulls at the December 2015 bottom  That s what a hard bottom looks like in a step sum chart 
Looking at the chart below  I don t believe gold will ever again trade below  1 100  If I didn t look at gold s step sum plot along with its price plot below  I wouldn t feel comfortable saying that  Take another look at the chart and consider the chart action between the price and step sum plots  Waiting for the capitulation of bullish market sentiment in a prolonged market decline is why following a market s step sum plot is so useful 

Here s the step sum chart for the Dow Jones during its 1929 32 crash  Though not exactly the same as gold s from 2011 to 2015  the similarities of the Great Depression s hard bottom below and gold s above are apparent In the early 1930s the step sum tells us the bulls remained firmly bullish in the face of a massive price decline  The collapsing step sum below identifies when bullish market sentiment finally gave way to market reality during the Great Depression crash  exactly as happened above  After the step sum bottomed in July 1932 below  selling pressure had exhausted itself  exactly as happened above 
These big bear boxes aren t everyday occurrences  but when they develop  it s worth making the effort to follow their progress 

Next is silver s step sum chart  I look at silver s step sum  but I don t do much with it as it s a weird market  Silver does form step sum boxes  but since 1969 its step sum plot has never properly collapsed   its bulls never capitulate as we see gold and the Dow Jones bulls doing above  The most likely answer to that is that silver s bulls are for the most part industrial users who are going to buy silver by the ton regardless of what price silver is selling at  as they have to 

This is actually a bullish factor in for the silver bulls in the years to come  as auto  cell phone  digital equipment and many other manufactures require silver in minute amounts in their product and aren t going to be put off by paying  500 an ounce for their silver  Practically speaking  when the cost per unit of silver for their products rises from pennies to a few dollars for something the public pays thousands of dollars for  even  1 000 silver won t result in a buyers strike from these industrialists in the silver market  But that doesn t mean they won t go to Congress and whine about the high price of silver 
Returning to gold s step sum chart above  since the December 2015 bottom gold s price and step sum plots have been in sync with each other for most of the past two years  and both trends are advancing  They may not be advancing as you or I would have them  but after the hard bottom of December 2015  that s to be expected  Never fear  ahead of us will come a time where gold and silver will do all that we would want them to do 
I haven t published the Silver to Gold Ratio  SRG  chart for a while  so here it is  What s the story we should take from this chart  With today s ratio of 75 ounces of silver for one ounce of gold  silver is damn cheap  and so a better investment than is gold 
Gold is a more concentrated form of wealth than is silver  So for anyone who is intending to purchase a few million dollars of the old monetary metals  they are going to buy gold  as silver by weight  at today s ratio will require 75 times more storage area to keep  But for anyone who is purchasing less than  100 000 in metal  storage shouldn t be a problem  So for retail investors  silver at today s price is the superior investment 

In the coming advance in precious metals  when the SGR once again descends into the 30s  the gains seen by silver will be twice that seen by gold  Should the SGR return where it was in January 1980  and it very well could  the gains seen in silver will be by a factor of 4 better than gold s Should the ratio descend to 1 1 in the chart above  the price of silver and gold would be identical  making today s purchase of silver 75 times more profitable than gold 
Is that going to happen  I can t say that it will  but I won t say it can t  Above ground availability for gold bullion is much larger than for silver bullion because the silver used in manufacturing is almost never recycled  There are thousands of years of silver production  hundreds of billions of ounces resting in garbage dumps and lands fills because people buy something containing silver  only to then throw it away without a thought 
Historically  gold was more expensive than silver as it was rarer than silver  but today that is no longer true  And today we have industrial demand for silver  something that didn t exist during the Roman  or even during the British Empires 
There are going to be some real surprises coming to the markets in the years ahead of us  One of them may be what the actual free market price of silver is  because right now no one really knows 
Here s the step sum chart for the Dow Jones  Looking at the Dow s step sum  Red Plot   since its latest bull box closed in late July  the Dow Jones has seen many more daily advances than declines  However all these advances have had little effect on the Dow Jones itself  So at the end of the week I have to ask myself   what are the stock market bulls so bullish about 

The Dow Jones began this market advance in March 2009  Expecting the stock market to continue advancing in the months and years to come may just be a bad habit the bulls picked up over the past eight years  So  on the first day of September 2017  am I calling a top in the stock market 
Dow Jones at 23 000  I don t see it  And should the  policy makers  allow the Dow Jones a proper bull market correction of say 10   can they once again get this aging  and very tired bull charging up the hill one more time 
Should the coming bear market be as ugly as I expect it to be  this is the set up for another classical bear box formation that the Dow Jones and gold saw in the two charts above  where the bulls remain stubbornly bullish inspite of a huge market decline  only to capitulate at the closing of a prolonged bear box  Review gold s and the Dow Jones bear boxes in the chart above to see what I m thinking  Will this happen  Like me you ll have to wait to see  but this is one of those things that make following a market interesting 
Personally  other than for entertainment purposes  I don t care  Investments in the stock market currently offer huge risks and little potential rewards for investors  Gold  silver and the precious metal miners seem the logical place to be at this time 
Speaking of gold mining shares  they  along with fourteen other groups  hit a new 52Wk high this week  making  9 in the DJTMG s 52Wk High and Lows performance table below 

That sounds good  but in reality it s not all that good as there are two ways for an index to reach a new 52Wk high  or low  One is to advance in to new 52Wk high  The other is to wait 53 weeks and have the indexes  stale 52Wk high collapse on the indexes  current price  as we see happen in the DJTMG Gold Mining index below 
What a lousy investment category gold and silver mining has been for decades  after almost thirty years they haven t broken above 150 in the chart below  Now in 2017  DJTMG Gold Mining Index finds itself exactly where it was in 1989  And this week it s hit a new 52Wk High  as seen below   what a hoot 

Why is anyone recommending this junk  Well  this is what happens in a  regulated  market place  a market where the prices of everything are only allowed to range within the parameters set by  policy  
There was a time when the market itself set prices  From 1938 to 1988  Barron s published their now discontinued Barron s Stock Groups  BSG   This is the antique data series that Barron s Gold Mining Index  BGMI  was originally from  From 1941 to 1980  the US Government inflated the supply of dollars  CinC  from  8 63 billion to  129 99 bil  an increase of 1400   As you see in the table below  only the top seven groups in the BSG beat the rate of inflation during these forty years  with the BGMI  gold mining  taking the  2 spot  Office Equipment manufacturers took the  1 spot  as this group included computer companies like IBM  NYSE IBM  

Here s the chart for the BGMI going back to 1938  Considering that CinC is currently at  1 56 TRILLION DOLLARS  and seeing how little this horrific inflation has effected the price of gold  silver and the BGMI seen below  I expect these precious metals investment  being held back for decades by the market s regulators   have much to make up for in the near future 

The point is  is that gold mining as an investment wasn t always such a poor choice for investors to make  as they ve become since Alan Greenspan became chairman at the Federal Reserve 
It s as I ve said before  the old monetary metals and their miners don t benefit from monetary inflation  Stocks  bonds and real estate do  If that wasn t the case  Wall Street would have no interest in inflating the money supply  What drives the old monetary metals and their miners upwards is DEFLATION in the previously inflated stocks  bonds and real estate  as FLIGHT CAPITAL is the rocket fuel for precious metal investments  If the DJTMG s Gold Mining Index and the BGMI above appears rotten  it s because Washington and Wall Street have had great success in inflating financial assets since 1989 
But there is a glimmer of optimism to be seen in the gold mining charts above  two of them actually  Twice since 1989 the gold miners have been a top performing group  and the start of these bull market began in 2000 and 2008  exactly when the general stock market began big bear markets  So  in times of deflation in the general stock market gold and silver mining is still seen as a safe harbor for flight capital 
That s good to know  because in the next bear market there is going to be a lot of capital fleeing for its life  and finding safety in the gold and silver miners  And for all the inflated market values in the financial markets since 1989  there will be plenty of rocket fuel to drive the gold and silver miners into history 
For example  take the DJTMG s Broadline Retailers in the chart below   39 in table above   Since 1989 they ve increased by over a factor of twenty  But the capital gains of the past three decades seen below are vulnerable  Business is lousy in retail  even Walmart  NYSE WMT  is closing stores  Their customer base is heavily indebted to their credit card companies and to the banks that hold their mortgages  or they re actually broke  Everyone knows the problem 

yet like a bad habit the bulls  stupid cows they are   continue paying top dollar for these shares  but that s not going to last 

When these shares  and most others groups in the DJTMG begin deflating in the coming bear market  where can refugee dollars fleeing DEFLATION in the stock and bond markets find safety  The history displayed in the DJTMG Gold Mining Index above suggests the gold mining shares  I also expect that in the coming bull market in gold and silver mining  the  policy makers  will ultimately find it impossible to stop the deflation in the general stock market  and the advance in precious metals assets ",2017-09-03,Mark Lundeen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/focus-on-gold-silver-and-precious-metals-mining-200211234,200211234
175200,396716,IBM,IBM Stock Has Dropped 20   Is It A Play For Value Investors ,opinion,"IBM  NYSE IBM  stock used to be the darling of Wall Street  For most of our grandparents and even some of our parents  IBM was a staple stock in their portfolio  You could always count on Big Blue to grow revenues  grow its stock price  and pay out a healthy dividend 
But times have changed  Thanks to technology  this tech darling of Wall Street is now a dog  Over the past 5 years  the stock price has dropped by over 20   Unless things change  IBM is going the way of other great portfolio staples 
So let s look at what the issues are for Big Blue and whether or not the company can correct them  And if they can  does this make IBM stock a play for value investors 
The History Of IBM
IBM began in 1911 as Computing Tabulating Recording Company  CTR  and was then renamed International Business Machines in 1924  The company currently manufactures and markets computer hardware and software as well as offering hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology 
Surprisingly  IBM has a made a handful of important inventions  including 
the personal computer
floppy disks
hard disk drives
relational databases
SQL programming language
dynamic random access memory  DRAM 
automated teller machines  ATM 
magnetic stripe card
UPC barcodes
In recent years  Big Blue has been shuttering its legacy services like personal computers to more modern business offerings like corporate IT services 
Issues At IBM
Earlier I mentioned that the stock price of IBM has fallen by more than 20  over the last 5 years  What has been going on  you ask  Well for starters  during this period revenues that IBM earns has consistently fallen 
And the most recent earnings report is no exception  While the company beat earnings per share estimates of  2 97 by  0 23  it missed its revenue target of  19 29 billion by  160 million  This was a drop of 5  compared to the prior year 
The issues at IBM are that old technologies just aren t as valuable any longer  Add that in with smaller companies who specialize in certain niches who are taking away customers from Big Blue 
For example  IBM packages the services it offers into a large bundle  But many of their customers may only have a need for one or two services  So instead of buying things they don t need  they head to smaller firms that  
IBM is trying to work on this issue by offering new services  but it will take time for these changes to have a meaningful impact on the bottom line 
Is IBM A Smart Value Play 
Whenever a stock drops by 20  or more  value investors ears perk up and they start to pay attention  So is IBM a stock to buy at this time 
If you just look at earnings and the stock price  the company looks very cheap  Add in the 4  dividend yield and you probably have some value investors jumping on board 
But I wouldn t get too excited  I don t see much upside for IBM in the coming years  This means you are just going to collect a 4  dividend 
There are no signs that the company is looking to make any major changes to right the ship  Instead they seem happy to just drift along 
And the company s largest shareholder  Warren Buffett  has decided  
Final Thoughts
In the end  I would steer clear of IBM  Until they signal they are ready to start taking real action to correct the issues at hand  I don t see the stock doing much of anything  other than treading water or sinking further 
Of course  they could surprise us and start acquiring some of these smaller players to more quickly correct things  In this case  now might be a good time to jump in  But there are no signs pointing at them looking in this direction

175266,396782,IBM,Internet Of Things  Stocks To Watch,opinion,"As far back as 10 years ago  analysts and market researchers were hailing the Internet of Things  IoT  as the next big thing in global industry and  by proxy  one of the major sources of opportunity for traders and investors alike  Throughout the first half of this decade  wider market interpretation of activity in the sector suggests that the IoT industry has  to a degree  failed to live up to the hype and expectation that surrounded it when it was first conceived 
This perception is largely incorrect  however 
While the IoT space hasn t moved as fast as might have been first expected  a number of companies have made considerable strides towards establishing IoT as a major global industry throughout the period in question  The important thing to recognize is that an industry like this requires an established framework from which it can grow  Over the last five or six years  some of the biggest players in the sector have allocated considerable capital towards building out this framework and   in doing so   have now opened up the door for secondary entrants to stake a claim in the space  Once again  this has presented investors with an opportunity to take a position in these secondary entrants  in anticipation of their ability to capitalize on the framework laid by the first movers 
Before we get into any specific examples and some forward growth metrics  let s quickly introduce the sector for those not familiar with the terminology 
IoT is a term used to describe the interconnectivity between devices and  to some degree  everyday inanimate objects through the harnessing of Internet network technology  One of the most commonly cited examples that is yet to be widely established  but that offers up a perfect illustration of how this sort of interconnectivity can be used at a macro scale  is town and city level waste management 
If a city s government can somehow figure out which of the waste bins across the city are full and which ones are empty  it can avoid the necessity of its workers to trawl the city checking every waste bin in anticipation of emptying those that require emptying  Under the IoT principle  this is a relatively easy system to implement and  as demonstrated  and   it is something that some of the more forward looking municipalities are already putting in place 
All it takes is a sensor in the waste bin in question and the connecting of the sensors to a citywide piece of software  Once a bin is full  it signals to the software and the waste management workers can go and empty it  It seems simple  but these sorts of time and capital saving initiatives are only now really becoming possible because of the way we can integrate previously inanimate hardware with concept driven software 
And that s the key to all this  using the internet as a tool for reducing wasted time and cost and   by proxy   increasing efficiency 
So that s an example  where is the industry going 
In a word  it s going to be huge 
Markets and Markets estimate that the IoT space will be worth  561 billion by 2022  Forbes expects the business to business  B2B  side of the industry alone to grow to  267 billion by 2020 
So where can an investor look to allocate capital as a way of capitalizing on this dramatic growth 
A number of household name stocks offer what amounts to an indirect exposure to this industry  some of which have been involved in the laying of the groundwork for forward growth and others that are just getting started in space 
International Business Machines Corp   NYSE IBM   for example  has developed its now famous Watson cognitive system that seeks to exemplify the IoT concept in a single machine  Watson is an artificial intelligence device that can apply its machine learning capabilities to a range of different social and industrial problems and   in doing so   can change the way objects interact with network systems and vice versa 
IBM expects Watson will play a leading role in its IoT efforts going forward  meaning that while the company is a somewhat indirect exposure to IoT as an industry right now  IBM should become a more direct exposure to the space over time as it allocates increased resources towards Watson and  in turn  as Watson plays an increasingly integral role in the consumer and commercial technologies that comprise its portfolio 
Texas Instruments Incorporated  NASDAQ NASDAQ TXN  is another example 
Again  this one is an indirect exposure to the space but  over time  market forces should increase the portion of Texas Instruments  operations that are rooted in the IoT industry and   by proxy   should increase the impact that growth in the IoT space has on the company s market valuation 
Specifically  Texas is positioned to dominate the commercial scale sensor technology side of the industry  Using the above illustration as an example  the company creates the types of sensors necessary to detect whether a waste bin is full and to relay this information across the network that underpins the software that serves as the interface of the concept 
So what about an investor looking for more direct exposure 
In July  Cemtrex  NASDAQ CETX  announced that it has established a new subsidiary  which it has called Cemtrex Advanced Technologies Inc  Cemtrex Advanced Technologies will focus solely on organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the IoT and wearables markets 
Many will likely already be familiar with Cemtrex  The company is a New York based technology stock that has established a considerable presence in the industrial equipment space  Specifically  the company creates instruments and emission monitors for industrial processes as well as industrial air filtration and environmental control systems for commercial and industrial clients  and it s been very successful in this market to date  Last year  twelve months to end September 2016  Cemtrex generated  93 7 million revenues  up from  56 8 million recorded during the same period a year earlier  During the twelve months to date  Cemtrex breached the  100 million revenues mark  as detailed by CEO Saagar Govil 
The IoT concept is a natural extension of Cemtrex s current operational activity and the just mentioned Govil expects IoT to underpin the company s growth to its next major milestone   500 million in annual revenues 
Additionally  and more recently  Cemtrex announced that it is working to develop a smart desk type technology  features of which will include a high resolution multi touch display with the ability to draw  scan documents directly on the desk  wireless connectivity for full access to the cloud and next generation wireless charging capabilities for mobile devices  The prototype should be ready by the end of this year and the company anticipates a sale ready product during 2018 
This is important because it represents the first product development program for the Cemtrex since announcing the formation of its Advanced Technologies subsidiary 
This  then  is an example of a company that falls into the latter of the two categories outlined above  a second mover in the space that s poised to capitalize on the framework that the bigger names have established over the last half decade  While it s a smaller company than some of the incumbents  IBM and Texas being two of such  it s a far more direct exposure to this growing industry and   if the company can execute on its strategy through the newly formed subsidiary   it could be a rewarding allocation in an IoT portfolio  Third quarter results are expected to hit press on August 14 ",2017-08-11,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-internet-of-things-has-finally-arrived-heres-which-stocks-to-watch-200206748,200206748
175280,396796,IBM,Prepare For A 30 Year Bull Market,opinion,"Prepare For A 30 Year Bull Market
Heading into 2017  Wall Street was excited by the prospect of a U S  president who sympathized completely with business  His promised tax and healthcare reforms were widely cheered by investors in the wake of his election  Yet the Congress has so far failed to deliver on those promises and investors are no longer giving the Trump administration a free pass based on the assumption that tax breaks are on the way 
This loss of enthusiasm is reflected in the long periods of dullness the market has experienced since March  While the bull market leg which began with the November election remains intact  the market has proceeded in a halting fashion and has gradually lost some of its erstwhile momentum  The following graph illustrates this principle 

Along these lines  a number of Wall Street economists have expressed the belief that if Trump s promised reforms fail to materialize  the stock market s current valuation precludes a continuation of the bull market  There are a number of reasons why this statement is likely false  however  not the least of which is that the market doesn t need a political excuse to rally  Indeed  if that were the case then China s equity market  in view of the country s Communist government  would forever be stuck in neutral  The pace of innovation and productivity in countries with a market driven economy is consistently high enough to always provide some justification for higher valuations and stock prices  regardless of the political climate 
Writing nearly 200 years ago  Alexis de Tocqueville observed that in America no matter how much the tax burden increased  American ingenuity and resourcefulness always found a way to counteract its malignant effect  He stated 
 It is certain that despotism ruins individuals by preventing them from producing wealth  much more than by depriving them of the wealth they have produced  it dries up the source of riches  whilst it usually respects acquired property  Freedom  on the contrary  engenders far more benefits than it destroys  and the nations which are favored by free institutions invariably find that their resources increase even more rapidly than their taxes    Democracy in America 
Tocqueville understood that America is unique among the nations in that its people and commercial spirit are strong enough to countervail even the most strenuous attempts by politicians at slowing commercial progress  This principle is as true today as it was then  perhaps even more so 
While many analysts are concerned by currently high market valuation indicators  the reality is that valuations can climb considerably higher before the market is in imminent danger of a bear market  The S P 500 P E ratio may be high at 26 13 by historical standards  it s still a ways from those high levels in the late 1990 s early 2000 s which preceded the death of the powerful  90 s bull market  Moreover  price earnings alone isn t a reliable measure of how undervalued or overvalued a market is  One must also take into account the investor sentiment backdrop  levels of participation among retail investors  and other technical and monetary policy factors when forming a final determination as to whether or not the market is truly  overvalued  


To illustrate how important it is to consider investor sentiment along with valuation  I reprint here the words of William Jiler  who wrote investment books in the 1960s  Using International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  as an example  he wrote 
 How could  an investor  anticipate that IBM would sell as low as 12 times its annual profit in the late Nineteen Forties and at 60 times earnings in the late Fifties  Obviously   investor confidence  went up sharply in the Fifties  And obviously  the psychology of the market   that is  the sum of the attitudes of all potential buyers and sellers   is a crucial factor for determining prices    How Charts Can Help You in the Stock Market 
The main consideration for stocks going forward is the level of participation among individual investors  With investor sentiment still neutral and few small investors actively trading  the bull market still has plenty of room to run  The informed investors who are keeping the bull market alive need someone to sell to when it finally comes time for them to unload their holdings  That someone is the uninformed public which by and large has been afraid of owning stocks since the 2008 credit crash  Until they rediscover the  joys of investing  the 8 year old bull market will continue to age  all the while maintaining its vigor 
History teaches that following a major financial crisis  a bull market lasting from around 20 to 30 years normally follows  Such was the case following the Great Crash and Depression of the 1930s  the economic and political turmoil of the early 1970s  and in other eras in U S  market history 
The last crisis in 2008 09 witnessed the birth of a new secular bull market which is already eight years old  A generation is around 20 30 years  which partly explains why bull market typically last so long until the next great crash  it takes that long for the generation that experienced the last crisis to be replaced by an entirely new one which doesn t remember it  It s only when the new generation has come of age that the mistakes which led to the previous crisis are repeated and the cycle begins anew 
Given that the current generation is still  nearly 10 years later  still averse to stocks to a large extent  the secular bull market has probably another 10 20 years to run before encountering the problems which always prove fatal to it  I m referring of course to the dangers of over participation and excess enthusiasm  Those dangers are nowhere in sight today  We can therefore assume that the long term bull market still has many more years to run before eventually reaching its terminus

175284,396800,IBM,Banks  blockchain consortium picks IBM for trade finance platform,news,"By Jemima Kelly
PARIS  Reuters    Tech giant  IBM   NYSE IBM  is building a blockchain based platform for seven big European banks  including HSBC and  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn   that is aimed at simplifying trade finance transactions for small  and medium sized companies 
Trade finance was identified by a survey of banks carried out by IBM and the Economist Intelligence Unit last year as one of the top areas where blockchain   the underlying technology behind bitcoin   could have an impact 
Blockchain technology provides an electronic record keeping and transaction processing system  which lets all parties track documentation through a secure network and requires no third party verification 
This contrasts with the present process   trade finance transactions typically involve a complicated paper trail that requires international courier services  is vulnerable to document fraud  and can take as long as a month to be completed 
 What we will have is a platform to bring buyers and sellers together and to make trade transactions very transparent from    the moment that a purchase order is issued up until payment   said Hubert Bdenoot  general manager for trade finance at KBC  one of the banks in the consortium 
 The first service that will be available for buyers and sellers is financing and risk coverage  and it will also include a track and trade system so that buyers and sellers can follow the physical transfer of the goods   he told Reuters 
The  Digital Trade Chain Consortium   which also includes  Societe Generale   PA SOGN   Natixis  Rabobank and Unicredit  MI CRDI   is aiming for the platform to be up and running and available for SMEs to use by the end of the year 
 There are over 20 million SMEs in Europe  and they provide around 85 percent of the jobs as well  so it s a critical part of the economy and so anything that can facilitate growth in the SME community is going to help a lot   said Keith Bear  vice president for financial markets and head of blockchain at IBM 
But KBC s Bdenoot said the new platform was unlikely to suddenly revolutionize the market 
 I don t think this is going to be something that enters the market and then all of a sudden half of the SMEs are on the platform   I don t think that s realistic   he said 

 I think this is something that has to grow  but which will create a halo effect in the market  ",2017-06-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/banks'-blockchain-consortium-picks-ibm-for-trade-finance-platform-499444,499444

175290,396806,IBM,Upgrade with a dab of TPP may be U S  recipe for NAFTA revamp,news,By Lesley Wroughton WASHINGTON  Reuters    Some provisions of the Trans Pacific Partnership President Donald Trump quit as part of his pledge to protect American workers from  bad trade deals  may still serve to shape a revised NAFTA trade pact  U S  officials and trade experts say  Trump threatened to ditch the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement too  but eventually decided to renegotiate the pact in talks with Mexico and Canada due to begin in mid August  On Monday U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will offer first insights into the administration s strategy when he presents Congress its objectives for the NAFTA negotiations  Several U S  administration officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the Lighthizer will outline plans for updating NAFTA rather than seek a major overhaul of the agreement  While the administration has said it hopes to complete NAFTA negotiations by the end of the year  the strategy will not set a timeline  they say  Thus far  the Trump administration offered few specifics  other than expressing its desire to modernize the pact to account for digital trade that was in its infancy in the early 1990s and to tackle festering issues on labor  environment  intellectual property rights and state owned enterprises   Since those areas have already been addressed in the TPP negotiated under Democratic President Barack Obama and agreed by Canada and Mexico  the pact provides a useful template that could help speed up the NAFTA negotiations  U S  officials say  They warn  however  that no final decision has been made on using TPP language  TPP requires members  for example  to allow independent unions  set working hours and safety standards and deter forced labor and has set higher environment standards than any other previous U S  trade deal   The pact also set a 70 year copyright term and eight years of patent protection for costly biologic drugs  significantly less than the 12 years applied in the United States  MORE AMBITIOUS DEAL Lawmakers from the U S  industrial heartland particularly want to see enforceable labor standards that would lift Mexico s chronically low wages  which they blame for U S  factories migrating south of the border   A lot of the negotiators were just in the room a few years ago doing this stuff  They know where the bodies are buried   said one business executive with knowledge of NAFTA deliberations  Some lawmakers want a more ambitious deal than TPP   Donald Trump promised to get a better deal than TPP  and Americans are going to be deeply disappointed if he doesn t follow through on NAFTA negotiations   said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and an influential voice on trade matters  In particular  Canada and Mexico should be able to agree to U S  proposals on digital trade and environment that got watered down in the final TPP text  Wyden told Reuters   This is a once in a generation chance to rewrite NAFTA  Trump can t squander this opportunity   The demands the Trump administration makes in the talks could have far reaching implications for U S  trade relations across the globe  with China keen to make inroads with Mexico and Canada if the United States is seen to be pulling back  One area to watch will be the so called rules of origin that determine how much regional content a product must have to be exempt from tariffs  U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has frequently said NAFTA needed to tighten those rules to prevent China from using the trade bloc as a tariff free  back door  to the U S  market  Analysts say any U S  demands for more specifically U S  rather than broadly North American content for autos or other manufactured goods would be a tough sell  though Mexico has indicated it could be ready for some concessions to strengthen the region s defenses against Asian competition  Christopher Padilla  former U S  under secretary for international trade at the U S  Commerce Department now at  IBM   NYSE IBM   believes that merely  tweaking  the rules of origin would be enough to satisfy Trump s political agenda  but it still may require companies to alter their supply chains  The clarion call from U S  business groups in the lead up to the talks is  do no harm   U S  and international companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars building integrated North American supply networks and Trump rang alarm bells in corporate boardrooms in April when he threatened to terminate the pact  Trump backed off after a furious lobbying effort  but analysts say he may still choose a  hard exit  if the talks fail to achieve his goal of shrinking the U S  trade deficit with Mexico  NAFTA has quadrupled trade between the three countries  surpassing  1 trillion in 2015  Over a decade through to 2010  however  the United States lost nearly 6 million manufacturing jobs  a figure that resonates with Trump  U S  trade balance with Mexico also swung from a small surplus in 1994 to deficits that have exceeded  60 billion for most of the past decade   Graphic   Fred Bergsten  a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics  said the administration would risk derailing the talks if it focused on reducing the trade imbalance with Mexico  like it has threatened to do   We re talking about an imbalance of  60 billion and there is no way under the sun that Mexico can eliminate that or even make a big dent in that without doing some really massive uneconomic distortion of trade flows

175305,396821,IBM,IBM s Watson Could Be Destroying Shareholder Value,opinion,"IBM s second quarter results  published earlier this week  make for dismal reading  Big Blue unveiled its 21st straight quarter of revenue contraction  and even though the company topped analysts  expectations for profit  once again the bottom line was boosted by some one off figures  something the company has become increasingly dependent on to meet targets in recent years  Pro forma earnings per share of  2 97 beat expectations of  2 75 but a one off tax benefit in the quarter added  0 18 to earnings per share 
The results also showed that growth at IBM s so called  strategic imperatives  divisions slowed significantly  from 13  in the first quarter to just 7  after adjusting for currency swings  The  strategic imperatives  are the cloud  analytics  mobile  social and security businesses on which Big Blue has pinned its hopes for future growth  and without growth here  prospects for the technology giant look dim 
IBM has pinned its hopes for growth on the success of its strategic imperatives and Watson supercomputer  which it hopes will become the go to provider for businesses looking to expand their AI and deep learning capabilities  However  analysts at investment bank Jefferies aren t so sure that this will be the answer to all of IBM s problems 
IBM s Watson Worth Less Than The Cost 
According to a new research report on IBM from Jefferies  Watson has dominated the company s investor communications over the past few years clocking up a staggering 200 mentions in prepared remarks and earnings calls since the first quarter of 2013  What s more  the company has spent an estimated  15 billion developing the initiative  excluding  5 billion spent on data acquisitions since 2015  This spending  as well as the academic input from IBM employees  has created  in the words of Jefferies   one of the most complete cognitive platforms available in the marketplace today   However  while the platform is enormously powerful Jefferies  analysts write that  many new engagements require significant consulting work to gather and curate data  making some organizations bulk at engaging with IBM  

This lack of user functionality would be acceptable if IBM was the largest and only player in the game  but the company is operating in an increasingly crowded and commoditized space  Many major companies are making significant investments in AI  and private capital formation is booming  growing over 50  to  4 3 billion in 2016 per CB insights  with nearly 1900 startups in the space tracked by Venture Scanner   These are conservative forecasts  In the bull case the market could grow by as much as 40 times from  1 4 billion in 2016 to  60 billion by 2025   Jefferies  analysis of job listings also suggests  IBM appears outgunned in the  war  for AI talent  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   for example  has more than 10x the job listings of IBM  

Add all of the above together  and it s starting to look as if IBM will ever struggle to make Watson a significant part of its business without making massive changes  Tens of billions of dollars are being invested in AI technologies around the world  and if IBM s Watson is the most complex platform to use  no matter how brilliant the system is  IBM will have to lower costs to draw in customers  reducing the payback period for investment  The company has already gone down this path  dropping the price of IBM s Watson Conversation over 70  from  0 0089 to  0 0025 per API query per month in October of 2016  Jefferies  analysts reach the following damning conclusion 

IBM disclosed very little on Watson s financial performance  However  based on market research data  public filings  and our checks  we built financial models to evaluate the impact of Watson on IBM over the long term  We looked at whether IBM s investments were likely to generate shareholder value and the potential impact to EPS  We believe the results of this analysis should be somewhat disappointing for investors  Even under generous assumptions in the Base case IBM is barely recouping its cost of capital  In the Bear case value is being destroyed 

 
From an EPS perspective  it seems unlikely to us under almost any scenario that Watson will generate meaningful earnings results over the next few years  In our Base case  Watson and associated  pull through revenue  contributes 3  to Consensus EPS in 2019  in the Bull case  it s still only 5   ",2017-07-20,Rupert Hargreaves,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibm’s-watson-could-be-destroying-shareholder-value-200202458,200202458

NEW YORK  Reuters    A former software engineer for  IBM  in China pleaded guilty on Friday to stealing proprietary source code from the company  federal prosecutors announced on Friday 
Jiaqiang Xu  31  pleaded guilty to economic espionage and theft of a trade secret before U S  District Judge Kenneth Karas in White Plains  New York  prosecutors said  He is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct  13 
Leanne Marek  Xu s attorney  declined to comment 
Xu was arrested in December 2015 after meeting with an undercover officer at a White Plains hotel  where authorities said he was recorded saying he used the code to make software to sell to customers 
He was originally charged with theft of a trade secret  The economic espionage charges were added in a superseding indictment filed last June 
International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  Corp was not identified by name in the complaint  But a LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  profile for Xu said he was employed as a system software developer at IBM during the period in question 
Prosecutors said the proprietary computer code Xu stole was related to a so called clustered file system  which facilitates faster computer performance 
Xu  who began working at IBM in China in 2010  had full access to the source code before voluntarily resigning in May 2014  prosecutors said 
According to the criminal complaint filed in 2015  the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2014 received a report that someone in China was claiming to have access to the code and using it for business ventures  prompting the investigation that led to the arrest

methodology  a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  when combined with a positive Earnings ESP has chances of an earnings beat  A Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  is best avoided going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  However  the stock saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter  Analysts raising estimates right before earnings   with the most up to date information possible   is a pretty good indicator  Additionally  the earnings track record is respectable  with an average earnings surprise of 2 18  for the last four quarters  Further  IBM boasts a top Value and Growth Style Score of A each and a solid Momentum Style Score of B  read    According to the analysts compiled by Zacks  IBM has an average target price of  167 19 with 28  of the analysts having a Strong Buy or a Buy rating and 50  having a Hold rating ahead of earnings  This indicates an 8 4  upside to the current price of IBM What to Watch Investors will be closely watching revenues from the company s strategic growth areas including cloud computing  security software  data analytics and artificial intelligence and whether these offset the slowdown in the company s hardware and technology services

175382,396898,IBM,Cryptoeconomics   The Opportunities And Challenges Of Blockchain,opinion,"While the activities using the peer to peer cryptocurrency bitcoin swing between legal and illegal  the attention has been increasingly shifting to the technology underlying bitcoin  known as blockchain  The mechanics and economics of bitcoin have been reviewed in a previous Bruegel blogpost  In this blog review we explain  or at least attempt to  what blockchain is and whether it contains the extraordinary innovation potential that its proponents believe it to have  or perhaps such hype is oversold 

What is blockchain 
The  explains that in order to understand how blockchain works  first we need to distinguish between three things  the bitcoin  the cryptocurrency  the specific blockchain underlying it and blockchains in general  bitcoin is the largest  most known project that uses this technology  but numerous other large cryptocurrencies are emerging based on blockchain  Blockchain is a trusted public ledger without single user control or centralized authority  where the participants themselves collectively keep track of the system  bitcoin s blockchain  for instance  keeps track of the transactions continuously and prevents double spending 

 explains on the MIT blog that blockchain  like the internet in its early years  is hard to understand and predict  In a blockchain  transactions are recorded chronologically and form a  block  which can be data of many types  currency  digital rights  identity  property titles to name a few and these data are then formed into  chains  and distributed across many participants in the network  Increasingly  the attention is shifting from bitcoin to Blockchain and it s not solely about the use of the digital currency anymore  but rather what other applications blockchain technology could create in the future 

Source  
Why use blockchain 
 finds two types of costs that blockchain can reduce for business   the cost of verification and the cost of networking  Businesses and organizations engage in many types of transactions and verifications that demand some kind of review of credentials and verifications  these and related audit processes can be costly and labour intensive  Blockchain  instead has recorded all these attributes and when the need for verification arises  you can do them without incurring any cost 
There will be no need for Paypal or audits to verify information anymore  Blockchain can reduce costs of running a secure network  Even though the sharing economy created a more distributed exchange of goods and services and gave rise to Airbnb and Uber  these platforms are still intermediaries  Using blockchain technology can be a step closer to a radical re think of the way we conduct business and engage in competition  Blockchain as a general purpose technology could have many applications in various industries  such as banking  finance  money transfer  microfinance  identity and privacy  ownership and internet of things  robotics and artificial intelligence  However  he says  like internet at earlier stages  the blockchain s potential will unfold over many years  But in some industries  such as finance  the disruption might come sooner than the other industries 
These disruptions already seem to be taking hold  A  report states that IBM  NYSE IBM  has been hired by seven European banks to create a blockchain system for small and medium sized companies  SMEs  to access cross border trade finance  The plan for the banks is to start offering trade finance to SMEs through the system  The platform will further add banks  shippers  freight forwarders and shippers and allow SMEs to track orders  make payments and record deliveries 
 from Harvard Business Review write that the fundamental advantage of the blockchain system is that it resolves problems of disclosure and accountability between individuals and organizations whose interests might not be the same  Mutually important data is recorded in real time without a single entity organizing and controlling this process  So far a lot of discussion on the application of the blockchain technology has been centered around the financial sector  but it could also be a potential test case for global value chain systems  Use of blockchain technology in supply chains could be realized through chip and sensor technologies that could translate data from automated movements of physical goods 
For instance  the Everledger start up has uploaded unique data on a million individual diamonds to a blockchain ledger in order to build a verification system and help jewelers comply with regulations against  blood diamonds   The main obstacle with the blockchain technology is its governance challenge  Inevitably  the issue of private  closed ledgers run by a consortium of companies will arise  Therefore  it is crucial to design blockchain applications that ensure free access  competition and open innovation in public blockchains with no single entity controlling it 
 Why think twice 
 write that the interest in the blockchain technology is still in its infancy and has not extended much beyond banks and other financial institutions  Public networks of distributed record keeping like blockchain can be very beneficial where there is a lack of private sector involvement or where competition is scarce at the moment  such as reaching out to the poorest in our societies and meeting their needs to borrow  make payments and save  But the authors remain sceptical that blockchain could compete against big clearinghouses that dominate wholesale payments and settlements 
Today s wholesale payment systems and electronic trading platforms are much safer  more efficient and cheaper and most importantly they exploit the economies of scale  Whereas blockchain s advocacy of eliminating the  third party  could sacrifice the economies of scale that third party clearinghouses generate  Nevertheless  the authors point out that surely the current system has not reached its technological plateau and the burden of proof lies with the innovators 
of the FTAlphaville writes that at heart of the problem  as always  lies the governance challenge  namely who dictates and enforces the rules as well as who do we hold accountable when things go wrong  What the techies are failing to understand is that the public wants to place trust in the institutions operating the  conventional  platforms  especially when they are operated by real people  so that they could be held accountable  For instance  Airbnb was built on a notion that people organize and arrange themselves  but soon enough the trust issues emerged   bad consumer experience  fraud  vandalism etc  Soon Airbnb found itself transformed from a tech company and a platform to rules and standard authority  As long as blockchain s governance challenges are not thought through  blockchain s truly transformative potential will fail to be realised 
According to   traditional cash has the useful property of having no memory  The economy does not need a memory of every transaction  which is something that blockchain will create  Moreover  the current set up of banks and financial institutions providing transaction services to people allows for competition and innovation and is better able to provide privacy and anonymity in transactions ",2017-07-03,BRUEGEL,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cryptoeconomics-–-the-opportunities-and-challenges-of-blockchain-200198768,200198768
175383,396899,IBM,Goldman  GS  Plans To Turn Simon Into A Neutral Platform ,opinion,"The Goldman Sachs Group Inc    NYSE GS   is planning to sell part of Simon   its online platform for retail bond investors  The app was introduced two years back and is currently valued at  75 million  per The Wall Street Journal 
The platform has greatly helped the retail brokers who invest on behalf of their clients  It helps them know about the structured investments online  saving time that would otherwise been wasted by discussing about the products over telephone 
However  Simon has not been in demand by the rivals of Goldman  JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM   has partnered with International Business Machines Corp    NYSE IBM   to bring forth another platform similar to Simon  Further  Barclays PLC   NYSE CS   and Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  Group AG   NYSE CS   use their own brokerage houses to sell structured notes 
Per the report  some of the rivals refrain from paying fees to Goldman while others feel the need of a neutral platform which is not being headed by a single bank 
Thus  the company has set out not only to find investors but also to provide brokers with more options to choose from  However  there is no surety to whether a deal would be made 
Lately  the company s has been undertaking several initiatives to become technically advanced  These include its online personal loan providing platform Marcus  secure messaging service across the Wall Street through Symphony and the upcoming robo advising service  Such strategic moves are likely to bolster Goldman s performance 
Shares of Goldman have gained 55 1  over the last one year  marginally underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s rally of 56 5

175404,396920,IBM,Technically Speaking  A Simple Method Of Risk Management,opinion,"Yesterday  I addressed the issue of how market innovations and  crowding  into specific trades have been signs of market excesses in the past  

 That is the cycle of innovation in the financial marketplace  Despite the best of intentions  and advances in innovation  humans will always seek out the comfort of other humans in times of distress  The rising notoriety of Robo advisors and the crowding of investors into  passive indexing  are the current symbols of excess in the markets today  They will also be the  whipping boy  of the next decline as  passive indexing  is realized as a  foolish  investment strategy   



 I have been around long enough to see many things come and go in the financial world  and there is only one truth   The more things change  the more they stay the same   

Just recently   also made an interesting point with respect to the  psychological  influences that drive behaviors in the longer term 

 One problem investors face is the concept of the  anchor  price  first described by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky  Regardless of the value of a share of stock  we tend to believe that value must be close to the only bit of information many of us have   the current price  This anchoring effect makes it easier to justify paying a wildly inflated price for a company that is operating at a loss or for a market that is hugely overvalued by any objective measure 
Another common fallacy investors face is  herding   or the tendency to use the actions of others as a measure of sensible behavior  Fads  fashion  and stock market bubbles are three examples of this mindset  When investors lose the sort of hard nosed skepticism and difference of opinion that marks a healthy market  it becomes fashionable  and nearly unavoidable  for too many investors to buy too many stocks that have too little going for them  

The psychology behind  market exuberance   is an issue that has recurred with regularity in the financial markets and was always dismissed as  this time is different   Unfortunately  for investors  it never was 
As Scott notes 

 If it were just psychological quirks that lead to runaway stock market rallies  the bubble might deflate itself slowly as the anchor price is gradually lowered and as financial fads and fashions change 
But the stock market isn t a purely psychology exercise  too often the real world intrudes  Each modern stock market crash has been precipitated by a catalyst that has little to do with finance and that catches us off guard  These catalysts push a system barely able to maintain equilibrium into chaos  

Actually  it s every time 
The market always  prices in  events or issues it is aware of such as economic data  earnings estimate changes  and even geopolitical events  In other words  it isn t the thing that markets are aware of  but the unexpected event which sends traders  and algorithms  rushing for the exits  But  as Scott notes 

 And the raw material for a crash is a buoyant stock market  

Despite the fact we know this is the issue and that such will happen again  according to the financial media  there is simply no way to avoid it  so we must simply  ride it out  
Why 
Because we are told we can t do better 
You Can Manage Your Risk
For years  the investment industry has tried to scare clients into staying fully invested in the stock market at all times  no matter how high stocks go or what s going on in the economy  Investors are repeatedly warned that doing anything otherwise is simply foolish because  you can t time the market   As I noted yesterday  there is a reason for this 

 Wall Street firms  despite what the media advertising tells you  are businesses  As a business  their job is to develop and deliver products to investors in whatever form investor appetites demand Wall Street is always happy to provide  products  to the consumers they serve 
As Wall Street quickly figured out that it was far more lucrative to collect ongoing fees rather than a one time trading commission The mutual fund business was booming  and business was  brisk  on Wall Street as profits surged  

Here is the interesting question as I noted in 

 Every day the media continues to push the narrative of passive investing  indexing and  buy and hold   Yet while these methods are good for Wall Street  as it keeps your money invested at all times for a fee  it is not necessarily good for your future investment outcomes  
You will notice that not one of the investing greats in history ever had  buy and hold  as a rule 
So  the next time that someone tells you the  only way to invest  is to buy and index and just hold on for the long term  you just might want to ask yourself what would a  great investor  actually do  More importantly  you should ask yourself  or the person telling you   WHY   

The reason is simple   getting back to even  is not an investment strategy 

Every great investor has one facet of their investment discipline in common   loss avoidance  Why  Because avoiding major drawdowns in the market is key to long term investment success  If I am not spending the bulk of my time making up previous losses in my portfolio  I spend more time compounding my invested dollars towards my long term goals 
The reason that the finance industry doesn t tell you this is because it is NOT PROFITABLE for them  The finance industry makes money when you are invested   not when you are in cash  Therefore  it is of no benefit to Wall Street to advise you to move to cash 
A Simple Method Of Risk Management
Now  let me be clear  I am discussing  market timing  which is specifically being  all in  or  all out  of the market at any given time  The problem with trying to time the market is consistency  Being all in  or out  of the market will eventually put you on the wrong side of the  trade  which will lead to a host of other problems 
As I stated  there are no great investors of our time that  buy and hold  investments  Even the great Warren Buffett occasionally sells investments   He just recently sold almost his entire stake in Walmart  NYSE WMT  and IBM  NYSE IBM   True investors buy when they see value  and sell when value no longer exists 
While there are many sophisticated methods of handling risk within a portfolio  even using a basic method of price analysis  such as a moving average crossover  can be a valuable tool over the long term holding periods 
Will such a method ALWAYS be right  Absolutely not  
Will such a method keep you from losing large amounts of capital  Absolutely 
The chart below shows a simple moving average crossover study  The actual moving averages used are not important  but what is clear is that using a basic form of price movement analysis can provide a useful identification of periods when portfolio risk should be REDUCED  Importantly  I did not say risk should be eliminated  just reduced 

Again  I am not implying  suggesting or stating that such signals mean going 100  to cash  What I am suggesting is that when  sell signals  are given that is the time when individuals should perform some basic portfolio risk management such as 
Trim back winning positions to original portfolio weights  Investment Rule  Let Winners Run
Sell positions that simply are not working  if the position was not working in a rising market  it likely won t in a declining market   Investment Rule  Cut Losers Short
Hold the cash raised from these activities until the next buying opportunity occurs  Investment Rule  Buy Low
By using some measures  fundamental or technical  to reduce portfolio risk by taking profits as prices valuations rise  or vice versa  the long term results of avoiding periods of severe capital loss will outweigh missed short term gains  Small adjustments can have a significant impact over the long run 
This is shown in the chart below  There is always a big difference between market prices and the impact of losses on an actual dollar based portfolio  Buy using a simple method to avoid losses  the differential over the long term on  1000 is quite significant   Chart below is capitalization only for example purposes  

As shown in the chart above  this method doesn t avoid every little twist and turn of the market  But what it does do is help avoid a bulk of the major market reversions  While it may not be possible to  time  the market  it is possible to reach intelligent conclusions about whether the market offers good value for investors on a risk reward basis 
Yet  despite two major bear market declines  it never ceases to amaze me that investors still believe that somehow they can invest in a portfolio that will capture all of the upside of the market but will protect them from the losses  Despite being a totally unrealistic objective this  fantasy  leads to excessive risk taking in portfolios which ultimately leads to catastrophic losses  Aligning expectations with reality is the key to building a successful portfolio  Implementing a strong investment discipline  and applying risk management  is what leads to the achievement of those expectations 
Conclusion
There are many half truths perpetrated on individuals by Wall Street to sell product  gain assets  etc  However  if individuals took a moment to think about it  the illogic of many of these arguments are readily apparent 
Chasing an arbitrary index that is 100  invested in the equity market requires you to take on far more risk that you realize  Two massive bear markets over the last decade have left many individuals further away from retirement than they ever imagined  Furthermore  all investors lost something far more valuable than money   TIME needed to achieve their goal 
To win the long term investing game  your portfolio should be built around the things that matter most to you 
Capital preservation
A rate of return sufficient to keep pace with the rate of inflation 
Expectations based on realistic objectives   The market does not compound at 8   6  or 4  every year  losses matter 
Higher rates of return require an exponential increase in the underlying risk profile  This tends to not work out well 
You can replace lost capital   but you can t replace lost time  Time is a precious commodity that you cannot afford to waste 
Portfolios are time frame specific  If you have a 5 years to retirement but build a portfolio with a 20 year time horizon  taking on more risk  the results will likely be disastrous 
The index is a mythical creature  like the Unicorn  and chasing it has historically led to disappointment  Investing is not a competition  and there are horrid consequences for treating it as such

175425,396941,IBM,Blue Chips To Soar Ahead  Buy These 5 ETFs ,opinion,"When almost the entire market is worried about overvaluation  billionaire investor Ron Baron simply walked opposite  Recently  Ron Baron told CNBC that there is no bubble fear in the market  Going by Ron Baron s interview  CNBC added that stocks are  cheaper than they should be  and he predicts in 13 years the stock market and economy are going to double  
Investors should note that Baron Opportunity Fund   the S P 500 as the former gained about 29 2  against the blue chip index s 9 6  returns  as of June 19  2017   This data may entice investors to seriously consider Baron s view 
The S P 500 s bull market went past eight years in early March and in a transition phase from policy easing to tightening  Baron believes that interest rates and oil prices would remain lower in the coming days  which would help the economy soar  much faster than it would have otherwise  
In this context  investors should note that though the Fed enacted the fourth rate hike almost after a decade and the second rate hike of this year last week  U S  Treasury yields remain subdued mainly on political uncertainty  Several developed economies are practicing super easy money policies and even some emerging markets are aggressively cutting rates  This should really keep the rates at lower levels for long 
Coming to the oil patch  prices have been under pressure in the last three years  Though the OPEC  pursuing an output cut deal this year  ample U S  shale oil supplies are keeping a lid on the oil prices  And as of now  there is no hint of a material improvement in oil prices 
Baron finds GDP    at the current level Most recently  the World Bank kept its forecast for global growth in 2017 and 2018 unchanged at 2 7  and 2 9   If attained  the global economy will witness  high growth next year 
ETFs to Play 
If you want to bet on Ron Baron s view  you can try a few large cap blend ETFs  Blend because it offers the best of both value and growth  Historically  value funds emerged winners in the S P 500 s bull run  read

175440,396956,IBM,A Shot Across The Bow For  Passive Indexers ,opinion,"I wanted to pick up on a discussion I started in this past weekend s missive  with respect to both Friday s rout in technology stocks as well as Monday s rather nasty open  While the issue seemed to be a simple short term rotation in the markets from large capitalization Technology and Discretionary stocks into the lagging small and mid capitalization stocks  the sharpness of the  Tech Break  on Friday revealed an issue worth re addressing  To wit 

Both Discretionary and Technology plunged on Friday as a headline from Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  questioning  tech valuations  sent algo s running wild  The plunge was extremely sharp but fortunately regained composure and shares rebounded  A  flash crash  
One day  we will not be so lucky  But the point I want to highlight here is this is an example of the  price vacuum  that can occur when computers lose control  I can not stress this enough  
This is THE REASON why the next major crash will be worse than the last 

I am not alone in this reasoning  Just recently John Dizard wrote for the Financial Times 

The most serious risks arising from ETFs are the macro consequences of too much capital being committed in too few places at the same time  The vehicles for over concentration change over time  such as the  Nifty Fifty  stocks back in 1973  Mexican and Argentine bonds a few years after that  internet shares in 1999  and commercial property every other decade  but the outcome is the same  Investors  cash goes to money heaven  and there is a pro cyclical decline in productive investment 
Risk concentration always seems rational at the beginning  and the initial successes of the trends it creates can be self reinforcing  Since US growth stocks such as Avon  NYSE AVP   the cosmetics company  Polaroid  the photography group  and IBM  NYSE IBM   the computer company  outperformed the market  growth orientated portfolio managers raised more money in the early 1970s  which then led to more cash going to buy the same stocks 

Andrew Lapthorne from Societe Generale  PA SOGN  also weighed in 

The sell offs themselves are not particularly unusual  but the uniformity of the price moves all on the same day indicates a market driven by price chasing momentum  with investors heading for the door all at the same time 
Indeed  those S P 500 stocks which sold off on Friday were almost all from the strongest performing decile over the previous 12 months  the r squared on the S P 500 line in the chart below is 85    Within Nasdaq  the relationship is even stronger at 95  

Such a uniform sell off strikes us as systematic  especially as the relationship weakens once you look at the broader and less liquid Nasdaq composite  For price chasing investors  Friday s plunge serves as a warning  when it s time to head for the door  you better move fast 

These points are absolutely correct  as I addressed in the Passive Indexing Trap 

At some point  that reversion process will take hold  It is then investor  psychology  will collide with  margin debt  and ETF liquidity  It will be the equivalent of striking a match  lighting a stick of dynamite and throwing it into a tanker full of gasoline 
When the  herding  into ETF s begins to reverse  it will not be a slow and methodical process but rather a stampede with little regard to price  valuation or fundamental measures 
Importantly  as prices decline it will trigger margin calls which will induce more indiscriminate selling  The forced redemption cycle will cause catastrophic spreads between the current bid and ask pricing for ETF s  As investors are forced to dump positions to meet margin calls  the lack of buyers will form a vacuum causing rapid price declines which leave investors helpless on the sidelines watching years of capital appreciation vanish in moments  Don t believe me  It happened in 2008 as the  Lehman Moment  left investors helpless watching the crash 



Over a 3 week span  investors lost 29  of their capital and 44  over the entire 3 month period  This is what happens during a margin liquidation event  It is fast  furious and without remorse 
Currently  with complacency and optimism near record levels  no one sees a severe market retracement as a possibility  But maybe that should be warning enough 

Warning Shot
As was seen on Friday  and again on Monday  the consequence of a  rush for the exits  can leave investors a bit flat footed in the process  However  don t mistake the importance of that statement 
One of the biggest problems facing investors is ultimately when  something goes wrong   When this happens  the initial response is paralysis  followed by a bit of panic  before ultimately falling prey to the host of emotional mistakes that repeatedly plague investors time and again  
This time is likely to be no different 
Currently  I do not believe that we have begun the next major corrective cycle  In fact  the current rout has all the earmarks of another  buy the dip  move to feed the ongoing bullish mantra 
While there is certainly damage being wrought in the Technology and Discretionary sectors  the rotation to Financials  Energy  Small and Mid Capitalization areas are offsetting the correctionary process  As shown below  the markets remain confined to the bullish trend currently while the overbought condition is being reduced 

However  this should be a clear  warning shot  to investors who have piled into ETF s in the hopes indexing will offset the penalties of not paying attention to the risk they have taken on  

While passive indexing works while all prices are rising  the reverse is also true 

Importantly  it is only near peaks in extended bull markets that logic is dismissed for the seemingly easiest trend to make money  Today is no different as the chart below shows the odds are stacked against substantial market gains from current levels 

As my partner  Michael Lebowitz  noted in a recent posting 

Nobody is going to ring a bell at the top of a market  but there are plenty of warped investment strategies and narratives from history that serve the same purpose   remember Internet companies with no earnings and sub prime CDOs to name two 

Once prices fall enough the previously  passive indexer  becomes an  active panic seller   With the flood of money into  passive index  and  yield funds   the tables are once again set for a dramatic and damaging ending 
In the near term  over the next several months or even a year  markets could very likely continue their bullish trend as long as nothing upsets the balance of investor confidence and market liquidity  However  of that  there is no guarantee 
As Ben Graham stated back in 1959 

 The more it changes  the more it s the same thing   I have always thought this motto applied to the stock market better than anywhere else  Now the really important part of the proverb is the phrase   the more it changes  
The economic world has changed radically and will change even more  Most people think now that the essential nature of the stock market has been undergoing a corresponding change  But if my clich  is sound  then the stock market will continue to be essentially what it always was in the past  a place where a big bull market is inevitably followed by a big bear market 
In other words  a place where today s free lunches are paid for doubly tomorrow  In the light of recent experience  I think the present level of the stock market is an extremely dangerous one 

He is right  of course  things are little different now than they were then 
What is important to remember is that for every  bull market  there MUST be a  bear market   While  passive indexing  sounds like a winning approach to  pace  the markets during the late stages of an advance  it is worth remembering it will also  pace  just as well during the subsequent decline  
Oh so you say you re going to  sell  those  passive ETF s  before that happens

Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at  9 854 billion The year over year decline was mainly due to reduced server unit sales  decline in software sales  competitive pricing  heightened commodities pricing pressure  unfavorable exchange rates  soft market condition and some execution issues  Adjusted for currency exchange rates and divestures  the company s revenues from continuing operations were down just 5  year over year  Unfavorable currency exchange rates adversely affected revenues by 80 basis points  bps  During the reported quarter  the company witnessed uneven global demand across all regions  In the U S   sales were stable as the impact from reduced software and Tier 1 server sales were offset by improved sales of core servers and strong growth in networking business  Europe s contribution remained weak  while the Asia Pacific and Japan  APJ  region registered mixed demand  with encouraging performance in Japan and India that was more than offset by dismal performance in the rest of Asia Segment wise  revenues at the Enterprise Group were down 13  from the year ago quarter to  6 2 billion  However  adjusting for divestures and currency  segment revenues

while financing volume dipped 7  year over year Operating ResultsHewlett Packard Enterprise s gross margin contracted 20 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 28 9   The year over year gross margin contraction was mainly due to competitive pricing  elevated DRAM pricing  unfavorable currency  as well as stranded costs and short term dilution from the recent acquisitions Moreover  the company s non GAAP operating margin declined 130 bps to 7 8  mainly due to a lower gross margin which was partially offset by a decline in non GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues

plunged year over year  The company s revenues also declined significantly on a year over year basis  Hewlett Packard Enterprise s fiscal third quarter guidance was also disappointing The lackluster fiscal second quarter overall performance  along with a dull outlook raises concerns over the company  future prospects among investors  As a result  shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise fell

175459,396975,IBM,Delphi takes stake in companies to profit from data in connected cars,news,"SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Car parts supplier and integrator Delphi Automotive on Thursday announced investments and partnerships in three privately held companies to help carmakers profit from the increasing amount of data produced by the growing number of vehicles connected to the internet 
As cars are equipped with new capabilities  from staying in lanes to driving themselves  they are using and producing vast amounts of information  including where they drive  Delphi said automakers need a single strategy for handling the data as cars become more complex 
Delphi s chief technology officer  Glen DeVos  told reporters in a briefing that Delphi wanted to partner with data related companies in three key areas  inside the car itself  as data moves from the car to the cloud  and organizing that data in the cloud so it can be used to generate revenue 
Delphi said it took minority investments in Israeli companies Otonomo  a connected car services company  and Valens  a chip maker  It also entered into a strategic partnership with Germany s Rosenberger  which makes ethernet connectors 
Terms of the deals were not disclosed 
The latest investments complement Delphi s purchase earlier this year of Movimento  which provides over the air software updates and data management  In 2015  Delphi bought Control Tec  a data analytics company 
Otonomo s platform takes data generated by connected cars  strips it of personal identifying information and lets carmakers offer the data for sale on a marketplace accessed by third party suppliers 
 They re a data broker  they re providing enabling technologies allowing the  automaker  to market their data across a wide array of services and vendors   said DeVos  such as retailers  fleet transport services  or vehicle repair services like tow trucks 
Drivers who did not want to share their data could opt out  DeVos said 
Detroit automaker General Motors Co  NYSE GM  has been working on similar technology through a partnership with International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  Corp s Watson artificial intelligence software 
Using its Onstar system  GM s product allows third party marketers to deliver targeted offers  such as nearby coffee shops  reminders about shopping list items  or paying for fuel from the car dashboard 
Delphi said Valens  technology would help deal with the increased bandwidth and wiring required for cars with infotainment  such as navigation systems and entertainment  and advanced driver assistance systems like collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control 
The Rosenberger partnership will help in transferring greater amounts of data at faster rates  Delphi said  given the company s expertise in automotive radio frequency connection systems ",2017-04-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/delphi-takes-stake-in-companies-to-profit-from-data-in-connected-cars-472018,472018

175462,396978,IBM,Banks scramble to fix old systems as IT  cowboys  ride into sunset,news,By Anna Irrera NEW YORK  Reuters    Bill Hinshaw is not a typical 75 year old  He divides his time between his family   he has 32 grandchildren and great grandchildren   and helping U S  companies avert crippling computer meltdowns  Hinshaw  who got into programming in the 1960s when computers took up entire rooms and programmers used punch cards  is a member of a dwindling community of IT veterans who specialize in a vintage programming language called COBOL  The Common Business Oriented Language was developed nearly 60 years ago and has been gradually replaced by newer  more versatile languages such as Java  C and Python  Although few universities still offer COBOL courses  the language remains crucial to businesses and institutions around the world  In the United States  the financial sector  major corporations and parts of the federal government still largely rely on it because it underpins powerful systems that were built in the 70s or 80s and never fully replaced   GRAPHIC    And here lies the problem  if something goes wrong  few people know how to fix it  The stakes are especially high for the financial industry  where an estimated  3 trillion in daily commerce flows through COBOL systems  The language underpins deposit accounts  check clearing services  card networks  ATMs  mortgage servicing  loan ledgers and other services  The industry s aggressive push into digital banking makes it even more important to solve the COBOL dilemma  Mobile apps and other new tools are written in modern languages that need to work seamlessly with old underlying systems  That is where Hinshaw and fellow COBOL specialists come in  A few years ago  the north Texas resident planned to shutter his IT firm and retire after decades of working with financial and public institutions  but calls from former clients just kept coming  COWBOYS AND YOUNGSTERS In 2013  Hinshaw launched a new company COBOL Cowboys  which connects companies to programmers like himself  His wife Eileen came up with the name in a reference to  Space Cowboys   a 2000 movie about a group of retired Air Force pilots called in for a trouble shooting mission in space  The company s slogan   Not our first rodeo   Of the 20  Cowboys  that work as part time consultants many have reached retirement age  though there are some  youngsters   Hinshaw said   Well  I call them youngsters  but they re in their 40s  early 50s   Experienced COBOL programmers can earn more than  100 an hour when they get called in to patch up glitches  rewrite coding manuals or make new systems work with old  For their customers such expenses pale in comparison with what it would cost to replace the old systems altogether  not to mention the risks involved  Antony Jenkins  the former chief executive of  Barclays   LON BARC  PLC  said for big financial institutions   many of them created through multiple mergers over decades   the problems banks face when looking to replace their old technology goes beyond a shrinking pool of experts   It is immensely complex   said Jenkins  who now heads startup 10x Future Technologies  which sells new IT infrastructure to banks   Legacy systems from different generations are layered and often heavily intertwined   Some bank executives describe a nightmare scenario in which a switch over fails and account data for millions of customers vanishes   The industry is aware  however  that it cannot keep relying on a generation of specialists who inevitably will be gone  The risk is  not so much that an individual may have retired   Andrew Starrs  group technology officer at consulting firm Accenture PLC  said   He may have expired  so there is no option to get him or her to come back   International Business Machines Corp  which sells the mainframe computers that run on COBOL  argues the future is not so bleak  It has launched fellowships and training programs in the old code for young IT specialists  and says it has trained more than 180 000 developers in 12 years   Just because a language is 50 years old  doesn t mean that it isn t good   said Donna Dillenberger  an  IBM   NYSE IBM  Fellow  But COBOL veterans say it takes more than just knowing the language itself  COBOL based systems vary widely and original programmers rarely wrote handbooks  making trouble shooting difficult for others   Some of the software I wrote for banks in the 1970s is still being used   said Hinshaw  That is why calls from stressed executives keep coming   You better believe they are nice since they have a problem only you can fix   he said  Hinshaw said the callers seem willing to pay almost any price and some even offer full time jobs  TURNING POINT Oliver Bussmann  former chief information officer of UBS AG  said banks usually tap into their networks of former employees to find COBOL experts  Accenture s Starrs said they go through a  black book  of programmer contacts  especially those laid off during or after the 2008 financial crisis  The industry appears to be reaching an inflection point  though  In the United States  banks are slowly shifting toward newer languages taking cue from overseas rivals who have already made the switch over  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  for instance  replaced its core banking platform in 2012 with the help of Accenture and software company SAP SE  DE SAPG   The job ultimately took five years and cost more than 1 billion Australian dollars   749 9 million   Accenture is also working with software vendor Temenos Group AG to help Swedish bank Nordea make a similar transition by 2020  IBM is also setting itself up to profit from the changes  despite its defense of COBOL s relevance  It recently acquired EzSource  a company that helps programmers figure out how old COBOL programs work  In the meantime  banks  scramble has revived careers of those who retired or were let go  and whose expertise  until recently  was considered obsolete  One COBOL programmer  now in his 60s  said his bank laid him off in mid 2012 as it turned to younger  less expensive employees trained in new languages  In 2014  the programmer  who declined to be named to avoid jeopardizing current professional relationships  was brought in as a contractor to the same bank to fix issues management had not anticipated   The call back to the bank was something of a personal vindication for me   he said

175489,397005,IBM,The Week Ahead  Will The Fed Change Course ,opinion,"We have yet another quiet week for economic reports  and it is in front of a holiday  Don t worry  Pundits will find something to fill the empty time and space 
It is possible that we will have another week of political stories  but I expect a shift  Many will find it time to digest the recent economic data with a focus on the Fed  I expect many to be asking 
Will the Fed alter its policy path 
Last Week
Last week the economic news was good  but the Wednesday decline dominated  As expected it was all about the political controversies 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted that accusations about President Trump would hijack the financial news coverage  including comparisons to Watergate  In my  final thought   where I put my own opinions  I concluded that the controversy did not represent a downside risk  but there would be concern about the prospects for tax policy  This was one of my most accurate guesses about the week ahead  Those who read it properly   what a big news story really means for their investments   should have found it helpful during the Wednesday selling 
Those who looked only at the story s  accurate  headline  or interpreted it as political commentary  or think that everyone should ignore potential threats to their pocketbook   these people will not be successful investors  For many  the comments seemed to offer an emotional outlet rather than an investment discussion  The Fear   Greed Trader s  captured the essence of the investor problem   the political side show versus fundamentals 
I cannot help readers who would rather discuss politics than investing  As I explained in last week s introduction  I do not choose the media focus for the week  I merely try to help in coping with it  Here is one of the    an expert source  reaching my conclusions  but after learning more information 
Let me ask this  Would you have been helped more by an investing site that did not even consider the biggest story of the week ahead 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  of the S P 500 from Doug Short via Jill Mislinski  She notes the news driven Wednesday decline  the recovery to a modest loss on the week  and the continuing near record status 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read the entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
Once again  the economic news last week was good  but the market reaction was negative  Of course  there were other considerations 
The Good
Industrial production was up 1   beating expectations  and up 2 2  year over year  Steven Hansen    reports with a more nuanced viewpoint 
Philly Fed s Index registered a blowout 38 8  Steven Hansen    notes the trends and reminds us of the best methods for interpreting this volatile series 


Revenue growth  Those complaining about the inaccuracy of earnings growth often turn to revenue  Brian Gilmartin has an  showing information on this topic  by sector  Not only is growth increasing  so are expectations 
Home Owner s Equity is Rising  Marginal Revolution sees balance sheets in  good shape  
Leading indicators rose 0 3   matching expectations  but reassuring to fans of this method 
Homebuilder confidence continues the upward trend   has the story  including this chart 


The Bad
Brazilian stocks and related ETFs  especially iShares MSCI Brazil Capped  NYSE EWZ   plunged on new corruption reports   has an interesting analysis 
Building permits declined to 1229K from a prior annualized rate of 1270K  This was also a miss of expectations 
The yield curve is flattening a bit notes  in his analysis of high frequency indicators 
Housing starts decreased to an annual rate of 1 172 million   that the change was mostly in multi family  with single family starts up 7  YTD  Bill is maintaining his expectation that starts will increase 3 7  for the year 
The Ugly
North Korea is threatening to retire my  ugly  award  Complicating the problem is a general lack of knowledge on the part of Americans  A lack of information does not stop people from forming an opinion  of course   reports that only 36  of Americans can find North Korea on a map  Those who can are more likely to favor diplomacy over military action  Take a try and then check today s conclusion to compare your choice with that of others 


The Illinois budget situation and the need for public schools to increase borrowing is also pretty ugly 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  This week s award goes to   via CXO Advisory  One of the most pervasive traps for investors doing their own research is evaluating the record of forecasters and pundits  They often claim selective  cherry picked credit  CXO Advisory for some years maintained a  guru grades  feature  The Bailey team has re ranked the market forecasters after adjusting for specificity and time frame  In general  the scores are not very impressive  but your personal favorite might be an exception  Here is the summary 

The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
We have a very light week for economic data 
The  A  List
New home sales  T   Current strength continuing in April 
Michigan sentiment  F   The final figure for May is expected to remain at a peak 
Existing home sales  W   Not as important for first order economic impact as new homes 
Initial jobless claims  Th   Continues with record low levels 
The  B  List
Durable goods  F   Volatile April data with weakness expected 
Q1 GDP second estimate   F   Not much change expected  and attention has already turned to Q2 
Crude inventories  W   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
There is plenty of FedSpeak on the schedule  We also have President Trump s travels and the continuing news flow about various controversies 
Next Week s Theme
Once again  we have an economic news vacuum  and it is heading into a holiday  The A Teams will be eager to head for the beach  Almost anything could grab the news cycle  making it a risky guess for next week s theme  I expect some reflection and digestion of recent economic data  with a focus on the Fed 
Pundits will enjoy a return to a favorite topic  asking 
Will the Fed Change Course 

As always  there are several viewpoints  Most observers seem to expect two more rate increases this year  beginning with next month 
The Fed missed its chance to raise rates a few years ago  and now is hopelessly behind the curve 
Economic data have been soft  A rate increase now is likely to create another recession 
Economic data have improved  The so called  soft data  is catching up with other reports  A change in Fed policy is a close call 
The key for the Fed is whether to reduce the balance sheet or to raise rates 
The economy is stronger than most think  Three rate increases are still in play   as is balance sheet reduction 

As usual  I ll have more in my Final Thought

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Chuck Carnevale s important article    The discussion on this topic has been so one sided that many might be tempted to conclude   case closed   As he always does  Chuck mixes analysis with some excellent examples  He raises questions about what it means to be active  and how it is measured  But that is just the start  Here are a couple of the key points 

And even more to the point is the undeniable reality that there are numerous investing strategies and many of them are not designed to beat the market  Instead  and for example  there are strategies designed to produce income  there are strategies designed to mitigate risk and there are strategies designed to meet specific investor objectives   and many more  Therefore  I consider the raging debate of active versus passive investing nonsensical  Attempting to define the broad universe of investing strategies as either active or passive is simply too restrictive and or general to be of any real value 

And 

Furthermore  where is it written that as an investor I should have the singular goal of beating the overall stock market on a total return basis  What if I need more income than the S P 500 index is capable of generating for me  Therefore  if I build a stock portfolio that produces significantly more dividend income than the S P 500  have I somehow failed as an investor because my capital appreciation component may be lower  Personally  I think not 


Moreover  if I am judging my success or failure based on outperforming a benchmark such as the S P 500 on a total return basis  this could prove problematic to my goals and objectives  The problem with total return investing is that I become subject to the vagaries of short term price action  As an income investor  it is possible that I would be forced to harvest shares during a bad market in order to meet my income needs  Therefore  I would be invading my principal and doing it at a time when I might be better served to simply hold  But since I need current income  invading my principal is really not a viable option 

And much more 
Stock Ideas
Retail  Really  Anyone looking at this sector must never have heard of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Vito J  Racanelli takes a contrarian stance in   I have listed the nine stocks selected as  survivors  but you should not jump in blindly  Take a careful look at the article and the reasoning 

Those interested in this idea should also read   Providing a good lesson for those wanting to learn screening and backtest techniques  he begins with a hypothesis of what makes for a good retailer  selecting underlying characteristics for return on equity  ROE   Once again  you should read the analysis carefully before rushing to buy his survivors 


I found the contrast interesting  and I hope you will as well

Personal Finance
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  If you are a serious investor managing your own account  this is a must read  Even the more casual long term investor should make time for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his  As usual  investors will find value in several of them  but my favorite is about US Household debt  now back at 2008 levels  The overall debt level is a worry for many  but the  that Americans  finances are better 
Seeking Alpha Senior Editor Gil Weinreich has returned from his travels  He is back to providing advisors and investors alike with intriguing ideas and links  I particularly enjoyed  of whether the lack of financial literacy meant that more personal finance education is necessary  If you believe the answer is obvious  read and consider his argument 
Watch out for 
Mall REITs   sees a continuing  elevated risk   He looks at the group through the lens of a single day s trading  Then he turns to the exposure to specific retailers  It is an interesting approach that encourages you to look more deeply into how a given name is trading compared to the group 
Final Thoughts
The Fed story may well command attention  I classify it as an important story  but not an urgent one  I have some strongly held viewpoints 
The exact timing of rate hikes is not important for long term investors  The Fed has been following a policy of rate increases in line with economic data  While many do not believe this  the data are supportive   on recent strength 
That said  the rate increases have second  and third order effects  The perception of the pace of hikes impacts exchange rates  The weaker dollar affects major corporate earnings   in both directions  This makes the Fed news worth watching 
Current data are stronger than widely thought  but much depends upon how one views the Q1 softness meaningful or aberrant  Recent Fed speeches suggest a moderation in the rate hike path     
Rates will be increased more slowly  but the balance sheet will be reduced 
As was the case last week  there could be a lot of noise next week   both from politics and from Fed speculation  If you have taken profits or are looking for trades  the week ahead might be one of opportunity

Verizon s decision to launch FiOS Prepaid and FiOS Internet service  and zero rate its FiOS Mobile App data have helped it gain subscribers in the wireline segment in the first quarter of 2017  At the end of first quarter 2017  FiOS video subscriber base was 4 681 million  up 0 1  year over year   FiOS Internet subscriber count was 5 688 million  up 3 3   while FiOS digital voice residence connections totaled 3 887 million  down 0 8    Moreover  Verizon Communications is also forging ahead to strengthen its presence in the Internet of Things  IoT  and fiber space through different deals 
On the flip side  spectrum crunch is a major issue in the U S  telecom industry and Verizon continues to operate in asaturated and competitive wireless market  Expenses related to Verizon s promotional plans and lucrative discounts to lure more customers might impact the wireless segment s EBITDA and EBITDA service margins in the first quarter of 2017  Segment EBITDA decreased 7 5  to  9 414 million in the reported quarter  EBITDA margin was 45 1  compared with 46 2  in the prior year quarter 
The company s wireline division continues to struggle with persistent losses in access lines owing to competitive pressure from voice over Internet protocol  VoIP  service providers and aggressive triple play  voice  data and video  offerings by cable companies  Notably  total revenue in the first quarter of 2017 decreased 7 3  year over year to  29 814 million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  30 504 million  These are weighing on the company s revenues and margins  We believe these factors have led to the company s below par price performance 
Over the past three months  share price of Verizon lost 5 5  compared with the Zacks categorized U S   industry s loss of 5 1  

A legal notice from the city of New York in Mar 2017 in relation to its FiOS  Fiber Optic Service  rollout in the city came as a major setback  This shows the company s failure to stand up to its commitments

175537,397053,IBM,Chaos Theory And The Financial Markets,opinion,"A butterfly flaps its wings    a hurricane strikes miles away 
According to Chaos Theory  a seemingly irrelevant action can precipitate  and contribute to  a major event  The right set of factors comes together and a major event takes place 
It s easy to imagine a fanciful chain of events that would initiate a market move 
A housewife attends to her crying child who has tripped over the newspaper  and in doing so  leaves the refrigerator open during an unseasonably warm day  It breaks down  and the family needs a new one 
To get funds for a new refrigerator and some added home repairs  she sells off a large chunk of IBM  NYSE IBM  stock that her parents gave her as a wedding present 
By pure chance  at the moment that she sells the stock  a specialist monitoring the action gets it in his head that the sale of a large chunk of stock means something  so he sells off his positions in the tech sector 
Next  a financial reporter sees the sale and tries to interpret it  He reports that it reflects a shortage of silicon and suggests investors unload their tech stocks immediately 
Many people follow his advice and a massive sell off takes place 
Perhaps it seems a little unlikely that all of this can happen  but you get the idea 
Just like how scientists claim  according to Chaos Theory  that a butterfly can start a hurricane  you can imagine that a few key seemingly minor events can start a major market move
Is It Economic Factors  Or Fear And Greed 
Many investors view the markets from a traditional long term buy and hold strategy  They look at the markets in terms of fundamental variables  such as consumer confidence  demand  and general economic factors that impact a stock price 
If a company makes profits that are in high demand  the price goes up 
Market timers though  realize that many market moves are the result of psychological factors  such as opinions or emotions of fear and greed  In the short term  anything can happen  and it is vital to keep this in mind 
Nothing is certain in the markets  but is this something to worry about 
Not if you take precautions  By precautions  we mean  following a strategy that uses the ups and downs  trends  of the market itself to generate buy and sell signals  
This way you are always in the current trend  never miss a trend  and are never trading against the market s trend 
Worry Can Be The Doom Of Market Timers
Indeed  a potential chaotic event can be a good thing 
The initial event that set off a market move isn t important  Who cares why the masses buy or sell  for example  as long as you take advantage of the move 
Market timers must learn to view such moves as opportunities to profit 
If you have a timing signal that is ruined by an unexpected adverse event   the chaotic nature of the markets coming to the forefront    there is no reason to worry 
In fact  it is absolutely  going to happen   Signals will go against you  Accept this and you will profit  Worry so much that you jump out of a tried and true strategy because of a losing trade or two  and you will eventually fail at timing the markets 
If you are following a trend  and it unexpectantly reverses  the  trend following  strategy will quickly reverse and place you right back on the right path 
It is necessary to accept that trading can be chaotic  Anything can happen  but it doesn t need to be a source of worry  As long as losses are kept small  and profits are allowed to run  you will beat the markets 
Worry can be the doom of market timers and traders  but if you accept the fact that uncertainty and chaos are part of the inherent nature of the markets  you will accept it when it occurs and recognize that this same chaos is what will make you profitable in the end 
A losing trade here  A losing trade there  All meaningless in the big picture  By following trends  which is FibTimer s market timing specialty  you are always profitable over time 
You profit in  all  of the big trends  By following trends  you are always with the big market moves when they occur   and there is always a big move  trend  just around the corner ",2017-05-07,Frank Kollar,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-butterfly-flaps-its-wings...-chaos-theory-and-the-financial-markets-200187489,200187489

175583,397099,IBM,DTCC to rebuild credit default swaps processing platform with blockchain,news,"By Anna Irrera
NEW YORK  Reuters    Post trade provider the Depository Trust   Clearing Corporation  DTCC  will use blockchain technology this year to rebuild its platform that processes  11 trillion worth of credit default swaps  as Wall Street intensifies efforts to take advantage of the emerging technology 
 IBM   NYSE IBM  Corp and technology startups Axoni and R3 CEV have been selected to work on the project which is set to kick off this month  DTCC said on Monday  It expects the new blockchain enabled Trade Information Warehouse to go live in early 2018 
The project is one of the largest implementations of the nascent technology in mainstream financial markets to have been made public to date  Blockchain is a shared record of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet 
The project is being developed with input from market participants and infrastructure providers including  Barclays   LON BARC  Plc   Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C    Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  Group AG   Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn   JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   UBS Group AG   Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co  IHS Markit Ltd and Intercontinental Exchange Inc  DTCC said 
Blockchain will reduce the costs and complexity of managing credit default swaps  which are essentially contracts that insure bond holders against losses if the bond goes bad 
DTCC s platform keeps track of the security throughout the lifecycle of the associated bond  Blockchain can simplify the process by automatically maintaining a shared electronic record of the security which is visible to all relevant parties 
The decision to implement the technology follows a test conducted by DTCC and banks in 2016 which proved some of the advantages of using blockchain  said Michael Bodson  president and chief executive officer of DTCC 
 The test showed that distributed ledger technology could handle all the various types of events processing needs for credit default swaps and it showed that it could be done at a lower cost point than what can be done with our existing infrastructure   Bodson said

175595,397111,IBM,Steer Clear Of The Ugliest Earnings Streak In Tech,opinion,"It s Friday in the Wall Street Daily Nation  If you re a newbie  that means I m skipping the long winded analysis  Instead  I ll let some carefully selected graphics speak for me 
We re on the cusp of an earnings onslaught  Peak reporting season hits on April 27  when 72 S P 500 companies report results  So I figured there s no better place to focus our attention 
After all  nothing possesses more power to consistently move stock prices dramatically higher  or lower  than an earnings report 
We re going to start with the ugliest  most depressing earnings trend in existence  Yes  it s a caveat emptor situation 
Then it s time to pivot to an opportunity hiding in a shiny  contrarian wrapper  Let s get to it 
In Desperate Need of Reinvention
Oh  how far this tech giant has fallen 
Founded in 1911  International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  has long been synonymous with tech dominance  Nowadays  Not so much 
Case in point  The company just posted its 20th consecutive quarter of declining revenue 

That s no streak to celebrate  And that s why investors are high tailing it for the exits 
Shares fell 5  in the immediate aftermath of the report 
Until this trend reverses  steer clear 
Thankfully  all stocks aren t as dangerous as IBM this earnings season  Let me explain 
It Pays to Be a Contrarian
In February  I shared three charts to prove once again it pays to be contrarian 
Heading into earnings seasons  I m convinced that we re staring at the next situation set to become a case study in gold to prove this axiom 
You see  analysts and institutional investors are universally negative 
As The Wall Street Journal s Chris Dieterich notes   Stock market bulls have all but disappeared over the past six weeks as optimism wanes for swift enactment of economy boosting tax cuts and infrastructure spending  
In terms of specific data  look no further than analyst sentiment spreads 
Per Bespoke Investment Group  the number of negative analyst EPS revisions continues to exceed positive revisions  The spread is widest in the energy and telecom services sectors  hint  hint  

As for institutional investors  they think U S  stocks are too expensive  In turn  the share of fund managers  underweight  U S  stocks hit a net 20   according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch s latest Global Fund Manager Survey 
That s a massive 21 point swing from the reading last month and the most underweight stocks the  smart money  has been since the financial crisis 

Here s the rub   this bearishness is coming at precisely the wrong time   right after taxes 
The Tax Man Cometh and Goeth
While the S P 500 traditionally sucks wind heading into tax day  it typically rallies afterward  according to the latest number crunching at Bespoke 
 Equity returns have been overwhelmingly positive in the days and weeks after the tax deadline   says Bespoke  And they re not exaggerating 
The index posts positive returns 80  of the time the week after the tax deadline and 75  of the time in the two week period afterward 
Talk about a post tax day gift 

So where should we be on the lookout for opportunities  In sectors where the negativity runs rampant  naturally 
Energy and telecom services top that list  as the spread between analyst expectations is the widest 
In case you re still too nervous to bet against the crowd   I said it was profitable  not easy   take comfort in this early stat  It single handedly justifies taking a contrarian  i e   bullish  bent 
So far  about 60 companies in the S P 500 have reported results 
Although early  the earnings beat rate stands at 75 4  and overall profits are on track to grow 10 8   If these early stats hold  it would mark one of the highest beat rates and biggest profit growth rates in five years

Q1Earnings Scorecard  as of Thursday  April 20th 

	Including all of this morning s releases  we now have Q1 results from 82 S P 500 members that combined account for 21  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 82 index members are up  15 4  on  4 9  higher revenues  with 72  beating EPS estimates and 59 8  beating revenue estimates 

	This is better earnings and revenue growth performance than we have seen from this group of 82 S P 500 members in other recent periods  even after adjusting for the strong growth from the Finance sector which has a heavy presence in the results at this stage 

	For the Finance sector  we now have Q1 results from 47 7  of the sector s market capitalization in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Finance companies are up  23 4  from the same period last year on  7 7  higher revenues  with 69 2  beating EPS estimates and 57 7  beating revenue estimates  This is better earnings and revenue growth rate for the Finance sector than we have seen in other recent periods  though most of these stocks have been struggling lately as a result of the downtrend in interest rates 

	Excluding the Finance sector  total earnings for the rest of the S P 500 companies that have reported would be up  8 7  on  3 7  higher revenues from the year earlier level 

	Looking at Q1 as a whole  combining the actual results from the 82 index members with estimates from the still to come 418 companies  total earnings are expected to be up  8 8  from the same period last year on  6 2  higher revenues  the best earnings and revenue growth pace in more than two years 

	Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including IBM  Abbott and Dow Chemical 

IBM  shares did reasonably well this year  but the stock has lost ground following the disappointing quraterly report that appear to have raised fresh doubts about the company s ability to reposition itself for the changing technological landscape  Although IBM has been expanding product portfolio into newer technologies like Blockchain  Quantum computing and Containers through frequent acquisitions  these are still in a nascent stage and will take some time to contribute meaningfully towards top line growth  However  sluggish IT spending particularly on on premise and data center hardware and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns   You can     

	Shares of Abbott have gained  8 1  over the last three months  outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharma sector which has gained  5 7  over the same period  Abbott exceeded expectations on both the earnings and sales fronts during the first quarter  The Zacks analyst likes how Abbott has been reshaping its portfolio through strategic acquisitions divestitures for long term growth  The St  Jude Medical buyout will complement its cardiovascular devices business  Also  the company s plans to focus on selling its portfolio in core therapeutic areas  Meanwhile  weakness in the nutrition business in China and sluggish growth in the Venezuelan market is a concern   You can     

Dow Chemical  shares have gained  7 7  over the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry  up  3 6  over the same period   The Zacks analyst likes the planned merger with DuPont  NYSE DD   which is expected to create significant synergies  Dow should also gain from cost synergies associated with Dow Corning Silicones business and its strategic investments in the U S  Gulf Coast and the Middle East  Estimates for first quarter 2017 have also been stable of late  However  Dow s agriculture business remains affected by depressed crop commodity prices  The company also faces pricing headwinds  feedstock cost pressure as well as weak demand in the energy market  Earnings estimate for the first quarter 2017 has been stable of late   You can

175634,397150,IBM,Exclusive  Koch investment arm nears deal for stake in Infor  in tech push   sources,news,"By Liana B  Baker and Greg Roumeliotis
 Reuters    The private investment arm of Koch Industries  the industrial conglomerate of the billionaire Koch brothers  is nearing a deal to acquire a significant minority stake in Infor Inc that will value the business software company at roughly  10 billion  according to people familiar with the matter 
The deal  if completed  would mark the largest investment for Koch Equity Development LLC  the Koch Industries affiliate that invests excess cash from the parent company  It would also represent Koch s largest push into the technology sector 
The transaction could be announced as early as next week  the people said on Saturday  asking not to be named because the talks are private  As with any deal negotiation  talks could fall apart at the last minute  the people cautioned 
Koch s investment will be a mix of preferred and common equity  according to one of the sources 
Infor s majority owner  Golden Gate Capital  declined to comment  Infor and Koch Industries did not respond to requests for comment 
Koch Industries  which owns brands such as Brawny paper towels  Dixie Cups and Lycra  is controlled by Charles and David Koch  two of the world s richest men 
Based in New York  Infor helps companies automate business processes  It offers specialized software licenses to specific sectors  as opposed to selling one product to all its customers across industries  It competes with Oracle  O ORCL   SAP SE  DE SAPG  and  IBM  Corp  N IBM  
Koch Equity previously invested preferred and common equity in Solera Holdings Inc  a technology provider to insurance companies  alongside technology focused private equity firm Vista Equity  which bought the majority of the company last year  It also invested preferred and common equity into home security firm ADT Corp  which was bought by Apollo Global Management earlier this year 
In taking a stake in Infor  Koch Equity prevailed over private equity firms such as Blackstone Group LP  N BX   CVC Capital Partners LTD  UL CVC   Leonard Green   Partners LP and Apax Partners LLP that had been vying to buy either a minority or majority stake in the company  according to people familiar with the matter 
Those firms all declined comment or could not be reached for comment 
The transaction would give Golden Gate Capital a chance to cash in on a portion of its long held investment in Infor  though it would continue to control the company  Golden Gate has a perpetual buyout fund structure with no finite investment period or fund life 
Summit Partners  a private equity firm that also owns part of Infor  could not be reached for comment 
Reuters first reported in September that Infor had retained  Morgan Stanley   N MS  to help the company explore options after receiving investment interest 
Golden Gate has owned Infor since 2002  when it acquired one of its predecessor companies  Agilisys  The company changed its name to Infor in 2004  when Agilisys acquired German firm Infor Business Solutions AG 
Under Chief Executive Officer Charles Phillips  a former president of Oracle  Infor has sought to shift its business model to software as a service  or software subscriptions delivered over the cloud to customers  as opposed to software installed on computers 
 This version of the story has been refiled to make clear in headline that private investment arm of Koch Industries and not parent company is taking stake in Infor ",2016-11-12,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive:-koch-investment-arm-nears-deal-for-stake-in-infor,-in-tech-push---sources-440195",440195

175648,397164,IBM,IBM Profits Down By 13   Shares Sink,opinion,"Profits of International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  fell by 13  during the first quarter of the year in spite of the development and upgrade in their business unit with the Watson artificial intelligence operations where CEO Ginni Rometty has placed her bets on helping the company catapult higher
The computing company delivered a net income of  1 8 billion on a revenue of  18 2 billion during the first quarter and lower than the revenue of  18 7 billion in the same period last year  IBM confirmed that this would mark as the twentieth consecutive quarter that the company s total revenue declined in the middle of their rising efforts to prevent up and coming businesses and startups to take over well known and established companies at a rising rate 
Meanwhile  IBM was able to slightly beat consensus analysts estimates of  2 35 EPS reporting an earnings of  2 38 per share 
New Revenue Sources
IBM  which is known for their various computer products and services including both software and hardware and providing traditional corporate computing facilities has been losing customers in the past years as more and more consumers and company shift to cloud computing 
In a press release  Rometty stated that both the IBM cloud and their cognitive solutions have grown strongly and has helped boost the company s strategies and fueled robust performance 
The company also has been upgrading areas of their businesses such as artificial intelligence  security  mobile technology  and cloud computing and is believed by IBM to help boost and open up new revenue streams for the company and will match the changing preferences of the public 
While IBM s systems revenue was down by 16 8  to  1 4 billion  revenues from their Watson cognitive solutions were up by 2 1  to  4 1 billion in revenue  IBM s global businesses services declined by 3  and its technical services and cloud was down by 2 5  to  8 2 billion  Revenues from global financing also declined by 1 3  compared to the same quarter a year ago

Specifically  the S P was down 0 17  to 2338 2  while the Dow slipped 0 58  to 20 404 5 thanks largely to IBM  Though well off the highs of the session  the NASDAQ still finished on the plus side by 0 23  to 5863  as the Russell advanced 0 38  to 1367 1

175690,397206,IBM,International Business Machines  Is IBM A Good Value Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put International Business Machines Corporation   NYSE IBM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  International Business Machines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 55  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 27  While International Business Machines  current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 11 29 over the past five years  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  This suggests that it could be a good time to enter into the stock Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Computer   Technology sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 81  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that International Business Machines  forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company s share price as of now  We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  International Business Machines has a P S ratio of about 2 03  which is lower than the S P 500 average that comes in at 3 08 right now  This makes the stock undervalued from the P S aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  International Business Machines currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes International Business Machines a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though International Business Machines might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives IBM a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Notably  the company s recent earnings estimates have been somewhat encouraging  The current quarter and full year estimates have seen one and two upward revisions  respectively in the last sixty days  compared to no downward revisions However  this has had a negligible impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate remained unchanged in the past two months  while the full year estimate climbed 0 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below International Business Machines Corporation Price and Consensus    Given these mixed factors  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which makes us expect in line performance from the company in the near term  Nonetheless  the slightly bullish sentiment should work in the company s favor  in the long run Bottom LineAll said  we believe International Business Machines is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 21  out of over 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall Though the Zacks classified Computers   Integrated Systems industry has underperformed the broader market in the last two years  the industry has been gathering momentum since the beginning of 2016  hinting at revival prospects  In fact  in the last one year  the Zacks classified Computers   Integrated Systems industry has outperformed the broader market  which is clearly reflected in the chart below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader industry factors and analyst sentiment to gather some more momentum  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Best   Worst of Zacks Today you are invited to download the full  up to the minute list of 220 Zacks Rank  1   Strong Buys   free of charge  From 1988 through 2015 this list has

175711,397227,IBM,The Astonishing Truth About IBM Earnings And Options,opinion,"PREFACE

Two seemingly contradictory phenomena are equally true for International Business Machines Corp  NYSE IBM  stock  and together they have created a wonderful option trading result for years 

STORY

Selling out of the money puts is an option investment that has a very clear belief system  The underlying stock simply will not go down a large amount  If that reality exists  the returns can be substantially larger than simply owning the stock  In this case  a low volatility stock  like IBM  can represent opportunity   that s one phenomenon   but the other appears contradictory 

This is a two year stock chart for IBM  with the blue  E  icons denoting an earnings event 



We have highlighted several occasions where IBM stock has not done well off of earnings releases   often times showing abrupt moves down from the reports  This is the second phenomenon  If we take all of this together  here is how selling out of the money spreads in IBM every month has done over the last 2 years 



While the stock itself has been up 15   selling the put spreads has actually been a loser  But  remember those two phenomena we discovered   IBM could be a wonderful trading vehicle for options  if we could eliminate the risk of earnings  Here s how test that idea with the tap of the mouse 



And here are the staggering results 



Yep  we have seen an 8  loser turn into a 145  winner by simply avoiding earnings  That 145  return compares to 15  for the stock  or nearly a 10x return  We have accepted the two phenomena surrounding IBM   i  it has been a relatively low volatility stock and  ii  the first phenomenon is true only when we remove the risk of earnings 

IT WORKS CONSISTENTLY

What we need to do now is look at this short put over various time periods  We see that it has worked over the last two years  now let s look at the last year 



A 45  return has been increased to 109   and the second approach takes less risk by avoiding earnings 

The results aren t a magic bullet   it s just access to objective data 

For completeness  here is the side by side comparison over six months 



What Just Happened

This is how people profit from the option market   it s preparation  not luck  and simply having easy access to data can mean the difference between losing wealth and gaining it  To see how to do this for any stock or ETF and for any strategy  with just the click of a few buttons  we welcome you to watch this 4 minute demonstration video

175712,397228,IBM,Book Review  Aldridge   Krawciw  Real Time Risk,opinion,"Real Time Risk  What Investors Should Know About FinTech  High Frequency Trading  and Flash Crashes  Wiley  2017  by Irene Aldridge and Steve Krawciw is in large measure an advertisement for AbleMarkets  of which the authors are  respectively  president and CEO  That said  and it is a major caveat  the book provides insight into the often overlooked  or inaccessible  world of market microstructure 
Let s start with front running s cousin  pre hedging  Front running is illegal  but pre hedging or anticipatory hedging  though forbidden on the CME  is allowed in the FX market  and equities regulators allow the use of derivatives to pre hedge  Let s say you  a sophisticated trader  place an order to sell shares in IBM  NYSE IBM   Your broker may buy  put options on IBM before executing your order  with the explicit purpose of protecting itself against your information asymmetry    The seemingly innocuous options purchase by the broker has wild ramifications in today s interconnected markets  Aggressive high frequency traders   continuously scan markets for arbitrage opportunities and will see the temporal discrepancy between the options activity and the still lethargic IBM stock  your order still has not hit the markets   The HFTs will take off the price you saw when you placed the order just before your order had a chance to execute   thereby widening the spread and increasing volatility through the larger bid ask bounce 
The authors tackle the causes of flash crashes  both market wide and in individual stocks  Market wide  they pin the blame primarily on broad based ETFs such as SPY  NYSE SPY   According to the law of one price  the basket of securities making up the S P 500 should have the same price as SPY  and normally stat arb traders quickly eliminate any disparity in price  But consider the following scenario  An S P 500 stock falls sharply  Stat arb traders bring SPY into line  But once SPY s price falls   a new force comes to influence the markets  potentially causing widespread contagion among other financial instruments in the markets  This new force is macro arbitrage    Once the price of the ETF drops  most of the securities in the underlying basket are revalued by the macro traders and algorithms  dragging down the prices of most individual securities in the basket  The basket is now once again priced below the corresponding ETF  Next  the vicious cycle repeats itself   And  once the flash crash begins in a particular market  it can rapidly spread to other instruments  affecting markets across all asset classes and continents  The recovery can be just as swift  All it takes is for one market participant or system to realize the artificial absurdity in the present crash and the low valuations of the securities to begin to repurchase the underpriced instruments  
To be able to predict intraday risks one has to understand market microstructure  The authors claim that  in addition to the risks associated with HFT  understanding market microstructure can help predict flash crashes days ahead  minimize slippage when placing trades  and  of course  predict short term price movements in the markets   And so  they conclude   incorporating the market microstructure analytics into financial decisions is no longer an option but a requirement for sound portfolio management   AbleMarkets is  of course  a market microstructure analytics firm ",2017-03-29,Brenda Jubin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/aldridge---krawciw,-real-time-risk-200180545",200180545

It seems that a lot of the time this year so far the market has been driven more by news than the technicals  That s why it was gratifying to see my call for a higher close work out last Friday as the market pushed even higher into record territory The 20K Dow level is starting to look like decent support  We now enter February op ex week as well as the final week of the Night Owl  After this week  we ll be history  But until then  let s see what s on the table for Monday 
The technicals
The VIX  Last Thursday night I wrote of the VIX that  it looks to me like there s still at least a bit of room to run lower again  and I d say that Friday s 0 28  loss just about fits that bill  This time though we re left with a nice doji star  With the VIX now oversold and very close to multi year lows  I m now going to reverse course and claim that a move higher is looking to be in the cards pretty soon   sometime this week 
Market index futures  Sunday night  all three futures were higher at 12 26 AM EST with ES up 0 15  
ES daily pivot  Sunday night the ES daily pivot rose again from 2299 92 to 2310 50  Even with that  ES remains above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish 


All the indicators are now overbought but we posted some solid gains last Friday on the heels of Thursday s range breakout  Also the trans continue to outperform  copper continues to rise and market bellwether IBM  NYSE IBM  looks rather bullish  Is that a cup and handle I detect there  Add in futures that are running higher again in the overnight jut as they were last Thursday night and I m going to have to call Monday higher

Last night I was worried about the short term overboughtedness of the market but with a solid four day win streak going I didn t want to stand in front of that buss so I called Wednesday higher  Good thing too because the Dow just kept on chugging  making it six in a row now  including the small doji that started this all off on the eighth   We are now in one of the steepest rising RTC s I ve ever seen  with a Pearson s of 0 991  Now as we near op ex on Friday and our penultimate market call  we re just looking for signs that this rally might be over and done  Let s see what the charts have to say about it 
The technicals
The VIX  In what was perhaps my worst prediction of the year  or all time  last night I said of the VIX that  I see nothing bullish about this chart   Well I still don t  but that didn t prevent the VIX from posting a giant 11 45  gain on Wednesday  its biggest since last November 3rd  It was most peculiar since the rest of the market also moved higher  I ve never seen such a large disconnect between the VIX  which is usually inversely correlated  and the market as a whole  Just look at this chart  What to make of this giant green marubozu that erased two weeks worth of losses in one day  I m really not sure  All I know is that we re now close to overbought while the stochastic just completed a bullish crossover  This is really odd 

Market index futures  Wednesday night  all three futures were mixed at 12 27 AM EST with ES down 0 07  but NQ up 0 05  
ES daily pivot  Wednesday night the ES daily pivot rose again from 2331 50 to 2344 42  So ES continues above its new pivot  though not by much at this point  and this indicator continues bullish 

That big jump in the VIX on Wednesday can t just mean nothing  And the market is getting extremely short term overbought  with the Dow s RSI at 94 and the SPX hitting 100  Unfortunately  that s about all I ve got in the bear department  The trans continue to outperform and the cup and handle I noted in IBM  NYSE IBM  two days ago is paying off nicely  But this winning streak is getting pretty old in the tooth and with op ex coming right up  things could get a bit wacky  Right now I m wanting to call the market lower but I really can t without some good old fashioned bearish candles  So once again I ll have to settle for Thursday uncertain  Such is life

Information Technology   IT Services   Reports January 19  After Market Closes
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  4 93 on  21 71 billion in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and nearly  100 million on the top
IBM s continued focus on cloud computing  Big Data  analytics and mobile are expected to lead the company into the future
Near term headwinds including a sluggish PC market  weaker IT spending  currency headwinds should takes its toll on earnings
IBM prepares to announce fourth quarter results Thursday after the market closes  For over 8 quarters the tech giant failed to deliver positive growth largely due to weak IT spending  waning PC sales and a slow transition to the cloud  A return to growth this quarter would involve a sharp uptick in cloud and cognitive computing along with robust software sales  Early indications point to another weak quarter as financial performance continues to trend downward 
Analysts at Estimize are calling for  4 93 on the bottom line  1  higher than the same period last year  That estimate along with revenue has remained relatively flat since IBM s most recent report 3 months ago  Revenue for the period is forecasted to decline by 2  to  21 72 billion  marking yet another quarter of negative growth  Considering comps consistently drop below zero it s not surprising that shares historically decline by 3  through an earnings report 

Cloud computing was one of the lone bright spots in the second quarter report  Cloud as a service revenue for the quarter increased 66  to  7 5 billion while overall cloud revenue edged higher by 44   Analytics  mobile and security sectors made equally impressive strides  rising 16  from a year earlier  Cloud computing remains one of the most competitive markets though  with Amazon and Microsoft leading the charge  If IBM can t establish a solid footprint in the space then its days are numbered 
IBM can unfortunately count on further declines in IT spending particularly in on premise and data center hardware  Meanwhile volatile exchange rate fluctuations and intensifying competition in the industry pose additional headwinds to IBM s legacy business 
IBM continues to make strategic acquisitions to offset some it losses and expedite the transition to the cloud  Many of these moves led to incremental revenue gains and a more favorable product portfolio  A strong balance sheet consisting of robust cash flow provides IBM with the flexibility to pursue additional takeovers in a changing computing landscape ",2017-01-19,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibm-prepares-for-another-quarter-of-negative-growth-200172879,200172879

Commentary I had hoped that the inauguration of Donald J  Trump as the 45th President of the United States would provide a catalyst to nudge the market into the direction of its next big move  No such luck  It was another blah day on the market as the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   gained 0 3  with the high of the day neatly stopping near the top of the current trading range 

What big event  The S P 500  SPY  barely responds to the Trump inauguration 
  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   bounced back from the drubbing it took on Inauguration Eve  The close at 59 4  still keeps my favorite technical indicator locked into its current downtrend and maintains the on going bearish divergence with the market 
Interestingly  the volatility index  the VIX  DID make a big move  The VIX plunged 9 7  to drop toward its recent lows  It never even occurred to me that the last rise in volatility was related to lingering anxieties over the inauguration  Otherwise  I would have proposed fading volatility as part of a very short term trade  similar to the post Fed fade of volatility 
The volatility index  the VIX  takes a post inauguration plunge 
The currency markets were another focal point given Trump s earlier comments about the excessive strength of the U S  dollar  DXY0   The index fell 0 5  in a move that could be the beginning of a confirmation of resistance at the still uptrending 50DMA 

The U S  dollar index  DXY0  is struggling to hold onto its 50DMA uptrend 
Since Trump s views on the dollar are all about trade  I am most interested in the behavior of the trade sensitive dollar pairs like the dollar vs the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY  and the U S  dollar versus the Canadian dollar  NYSE FXC   For the last two days  USD JPY rallied only to get stopped cold at 50DMA resistance  That resistance now coincides with a downtrending 20DMA 
The technical pressures are running against USD JPY  However  if USD JPY manages to jump above all this resistance  I will get aggressively bullish on this pair and significantly add to my currently small long position 

USD JPY seems on the verge of confirming its 50DMA breakdown  This pair is an extremely important one to watch as the Trump presidency kicks off 
The Bank of Canada released   The press conference was full of talk of the impact of Trump s economic policies  This report was likely an extremely important turning point for the Canadian dollar  so I hope to cover the details in another post  For now  it is important to note that the Canadian dollar has notably weakened since the Bank of Canada released its report  The week closed with USD CAD below 50DMA resistance so the jury is still out 
Since reaching a low in early May  USD CAD has ground higher ever so slowly  December s initial response to the Fed and now the response to the Bank of Canada suggest that a new breakout is very much in the cards 
With inauguration in the rear view mirror  the wildcard returns to earnings season  International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  delivered quite a display of post earnings resiliency in the background of the inauguration  Headline results appeared weak once again with IBM notching an incredible 19th straight year over year decline in quarterly revenue  IBM opened higher  dipped to the bottom of the recent trading range  and then surged into the close with a 2 2  gain  IBM now sits at a 1 1 2 year high 
International Business Machines  IBM  prints a post earnings 1 1 2 year high in a potentially significant display of resiliency 
So  if IBM is any sign  plenty of buyers are lurking around ready to buy the slightest of dips  I will be watching for similar behaviors in the coming two weeks of earnings  In the meantime  I am sticking with the short term bearish trading call in deference to the on going bearish divergence driven by T2108 s downtrend 
I am still not doing anything aggressively bearish  but I am looking for a good excuse to do so  My short term trading call will flip to neutral if T2108 returns to overbought conditions on new all time highs for the S P 500  A flip to bullish will depend on other signals 
Daily T2108 vs the S P 500

Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes

175757,397273,IBM,Even The Adoption Of Innovation Is Different,opinion,"As with all innovation  the roots of any specific trend usually cast back a very long time  In terms of Enterprise computing solutions  Software as a Service  SaaS  dates to the earliest days of the internet  In the middle 1990 s Application Service Providers started popping up  but they were largely erased in the dot com bust  not without good reason   For the longest time investor disdain for the idea in any form prevented a better marriage of what businesses really wanted out of IT with what was possible as being deliverable   the balance of efficiency with risk 
Throughout most of the 21st century  on premise was the deciding factor hardware as well as software in being able to control risk at the expense of efficiency  These were legitimate concerns  of course  including and especially security but not exclusively so  Enterprise control is still today in many ways the overriding factor  What may have been changed is how IT vendors have been enabled to offer different products and ideas to allow better control but with SaaS efficiencies 
As  written for ComputerWorld in June 2004 claims  it was ironically the dot com bust and the recession that followed it that planted the seeds for transition toward this model 

As the effects of the stalled economy swept over enterprises at the beginning of this decade  resource challenged IT departments  out of necessity  creatively looked for new models to reduce the internal work docket  IT departments began thinking pragmatically in terms of business processes and workflow that needed to be accomplished and not of the purchase of discrete applications  As a result  enterprises became receptive to business models that would reduce software maintenance costs and move not only applications and transactions but also complete business processes outside of the enterprise to increase efficiency and lower costs 

SaaS has not solved all the problems with the operating model  but starting around 2012 that no longer seemed to matter as much  Like the early 2000 s  cost became more important in striking the IT balance  only now to the point that in many ways it appears to be the only consideration  Better to save money under SaaS and worry about security holes and potential outages than to elicit the ire of upper management who without revenue growth can only give out directives further squeezing IT budgets and overall cost efficiencies 
No technological shift occurs free of those on the losing end  and so IBM has been the primary candidate for the often barbaric nature of competition in this format  To exercise Enterprise control used to mean a business would buy upfront the hardware as well as the software  Under SaaS  IBM  NYSE IBM  can sell hardware increasingly only to other SaaS providers  forcing IBM to transition itself while its customers do the same 
In the recently released fourth quarter earnings estimates  IBM reports yet another negative quarter for revenue  In Q3 2016  revenues were so close to being flat in what was thought at the time to be perhaps the last of the topline minus signs  Instead  sales for the whole company  GAAP  fell 1 4  from Q4 2015  the 19th straight quarterly contraction in revenue  Even without the  strong dollar  as much weighing on results last year  it is the those 19 quarters that draws our attention as a measure of transformation  but more so the reasons for it 

There are many who believe that IBM no longer matters  a dinosaur that has no place in the mobile world of the cloud  despite IBM largely offsetting lost revenue in hardware with rapid growth in SaaS like its own cloud platform  becoming one of the biggest players in that trend finally   My own view has been that IBM was  regardless of industry changes  a macro warning because of them  very much in the same manner as  brick and mortar  stores were in the sudden sharp turn  last year 
When IBM s sales started falling in the middle of 2012  first clue   it was a negative sign that businesses were being pressured by the failed recovery to move up SaaS regardless of still open questions about it  when Department Stores saw their sales drop off dramatically last year it was notice that consumers had finally felt the same extremes finally filter out through labor market realizations of the same processes so as to finally let go of similar reservations in the form of shopping without tangible touch 
IBM s revenue in Q4 2011 was  29 5 billion  in Q4 2016  it was  21 8 billion  an astonishing 26  decline across five years  IBM s misfortune is the global economy s  though to a degree that is all its own  What is truly relevant about that downturn is not that it may finally be ending or at least flattening out  but that like almost everything else it hasn t shifted robustly in the positive direction even as it gets strung out quarter after quarter  Like online sales growth that isn t enough to offset customers withdrawing from Department Stores  SaaS and cloud at IBM still aren t enough to overcome the overriding drag of the same bad economy 
You would think five years would be enough time to pull out if it  but like the global economy post Great  Recession  IBM appears to have permanently shrunk  Big Blue is therefore a metaphor for the global economy and its potential even when factoring innovation  These industry changes don t appear accretive or contributory  but rather redistribution as a matter of necessity  There s a big difference ",2017-01-24,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/even-the-adoption-of-innovation-is-different-200173355,200173355
175758,397274,IBM,Employment Boom  10 Companies That Have Promised To Add Jobs In The U S ,opinion,"One of the primary things that Trump s presidency will be judged upon is his ability to encourage the creation of good paying jobs for American workers  and so far the results have been quite promising  Since Trump s surprise election victory in November  a whole bunch of companies have either promised to bring jobs back into the country or have pledged to create new ones  Ultimately time will tell if those jobs actually materialize  but for the moment there is a tremendous amount of optimism in the air  In fact  I don t know if we have ever seen anything quite like this at the beginning of a new presidency  The following are 10 companies that have promised to add jobs in the United States since the election of Donald Trump 
 1 Kroger  NYSE KR  says that it intends to fill 10 000 permanent positions in the United States this year 
 2 IBM  NYSE IBM  has announced that it will be hiring an additional 25 000 workers in the United States over the next four years 
 3 Foxconn Tech  TW 2354  is considering setting up a 7 billion dollar plant in the United States that would create between 30 000 and 50 000 jobs 
 4 Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  has pledged to add 100 000 full time jobs in the United States by mid 2018 
 5 Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  has announced that it plans to add approximately 10 000 retail jobs in the United States in 2017 
 6 Sprint Corp  NYSE S  has announced that 5 000 jobs will be brought back to the United States instead of going overseas 
 7 After meeting with Trump  the CEO of Softbank Corp   T 9984  stated his intention to create 50 000 new jobs in the United States 
 8 After a phone call from Trump  industrial manufacturing giant Star Bulk Carriers Corp  NASDAQ SBLK promised to keep hundreds of jobs in the United States instead of moving them out of the country 
 9 Hyundai Motor Co  DE 05380  has promised to spend 3 1 billion dollars supporting their current factories in Georgia and Alabama  and they have said that they are now considering adding an additional factory in the United States as well 
 10 General Motors Company  NYSE GM  has pledged to invest a billion dollars in U S  factories and to add or keep 7 000 jobs in the United States 
Unlike most politicians  so far Donald Trump seems determined to actually keep many of the promises that he made during the campaign  And on Monday he kept a very important promise by pulling the U S  out of the Trans Pacific Partnership  If you are not familiar with the Trans Pacific Partnership  the following is a pretty good summary from USA Today 

The TPP is a comprehensive trade agreement among 12 Pacific Rim countries  not including China  that was signed last year by President Obama after seven years of negotiation  But the Senate had not yet ratified it  The 30 chapter pact  which also needed to be ratified by other countries before Trump s order Monday  primarily aims to boost exports  remove tariffs and non tariff barriers  open access to more markets and usher in transparency in trade rules 

The 12 nations that were to be included in the Trans Pacific Partnership collectively account for approximately 40 percent of global GDP  So it was going to be a very big deal  and it is something that Barack Obama had been working on for many years 
But with one stroke of a pen it is over  and as I will explain below that is a very good thing 
Trump is also promising to keep his pledge to renegotiate NAFTA 

On Nafta  Trump said Sunday that he ll meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to begin discussing the deal  which he has routinely blamed for the loss of U S  jobs although there was little change to employment in the U S  in several years after it went into effect  Trump signaled that he s willing to work with the U S  s closest neighbors 
 We re going to start renegotiating on Nafta  on immigration  and on security at the border   Trump said at the start of a swearing in ceremony for top White House staff   I think we re going to have a very good result for Mexico  for the United States  for everybody involved  It s really very important  

Nobody is suggesting that we shouldn t trade with the rest of the world  but what Donald Trump understands that so many other politicians do not is that many of these  free trade deals  have been extremely destructive to the U S  economy 
For years  we have been buying far  far more from the rest of the world than they have been buying from us  As a result of our massive trade deficits  there has been a continual flow of cash  jobs and businesses leaving the country 
Over the past several decades  formerly great manufacturing cities such as Detroit have been reduced to urban hellholes  Meanwhile  China has become exceedingly wealthy and gleaming new factories have sprouted like mushrooms in their major cities 
This didn t happen by accident 
Bad decisions lead to bad results  And if we had kept on doing the same things  we would have continued to systematically impoverish our nation 
For   I have been hammering home the message that our trade policies have been absolutely killing us  So I am quite thankful that we finally have a president that understands these things 
Of course there is much more to fixing our economy than just addressing our trade deals  As I discussed yesterday  our rapidly growing debt   and that is going to present quite a challenge for Trump 
But for the moment  we should definitely celebrate the fact that Trump has gotten us out of the TPP and that he plans to renegotiate NAFTA 
Donald Trump understands business  and it is going to be fascinating to watch how a businessman handles the position of the presidency  It has only been a few days  but already some of his former critics seem to be coming around a little bit  For instance  just consider  

The Dallas Mavericks owner and entrepreneur is  playing it by ear  when it comes to the effect President Donald Trump s policies will have on the stock market  But he thinks there s possible upside 
 I think the discussed economic programs are potentially a big plus for public companies and the overall economy   Mr  Cuban said in an e mail Monday morning 
The potential policies Mr  Cuban is optimistic about  corporate tax cuts  getting rid of the  friction  for small businesses  and reducing and simplifying administrative activities 

Considering our current trajectory and the immense amount of long term damage that was done during the Obama years  it is hard to be optimistic about the future of the U S  economy 
However  I am certainly willing to give Donald Trump a chance to show what he can do 
At least he is doing things differently than his predecessors did  and that is to be greatly applauded because the road that we were on clearly would have ended in economic oblivion 
We may very well end up there anyway  but there is certainly nothing wrong with being hopeful that Trump can somehow turn things around ",2017-01-24,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/employment-boom:-10-companies-that-have-promised-to-add-jobs-in-the-unit-200173365,200173365
175759,397275,IBM,Reaons To Short IBM,opinion,"IBM  NYSE IBM  stock has spiked up Friday  yesterday and today because the company released Q4 and full year earnings which  beat  the Street estimates   by design and by the heavy application of GAAP earnings management 
But here are the facts 
 1  Revenues year over year for the full year dropped 5 9   quarter over quarter they dropped 1 3    this was the 5th year in a row of annual declines and the 19th quarter in a row of year over year quarterly declines 
2  Gross and operating margins continue to shrink  pre tax earnings  this is important  plunged  literally plunged  22 7  for 2016 vs  2015 
3  Long term debt increased 3 5  year over year   it was 43 4  of revenues in at the end of 2016 vs  40 8  of revenues at the end of 2015 
4  Cash generated by operations  from the statement of cash flows  plunged 49 3  in Q4 2016 vs  Q4 2015   it dropped 2 3  for the full year  see below for significance  
 5  Despite the heavy application fo GAAP management  net income dropped 10  in 2016  with a small quarter over quarter net income gain of 1   which would have been a decline if IBM had not applied subjective GAAP manipulations 
With regard to IBM s liberal application of GAAP earnings management techniques  the Company arbitrarily applied a 9 6   effective  tax rate in Q4 2016 vs  the 12 5  utilized in Q4 2015  The Company claimed a 3 6  GAAP tax rate for 2016 vs  16 2  in 2015  Manipulating the  effective  GAAP tax rate is the very first lesson taught in any high quality forensics accounting class 
I give IBM an A  for its maneuvers in this regard  But the  devil in the details  and fact that the cash generated from operations plunged 49  quarter over quarter should raise a huge red flag for any financial analyst  Wall Street pimps of course will turn a blind eye to that glaring financial  tumor   
The stock popped today on IBM s announcement that hit would hire 25 000 people in the U S  in an obvious maneuver to avoid the stock deadly  Trump tweet   However  the Company has continued to maintain on analyst conference calls that the hiring is part of its normal operations and should not be differentiated from its cost cutting layoff plans  But the hedge fund algos only care about the 25k hiring headlines 
Interestingly  IBM heavily promoted the success of its cloud business and artificial intelligence business  the revenues from which increased 13  in 2016  But this business can not be very profitable  otherwise IBM s gross  operating and pre tax net margins would not have dropped  This achievement is less than dubious 
Additionally  20  of IBM s revenues are derived from its global business services unit  As Trump escalates the trade war with the rest of the world  specifically China Asia  this unit s revenues  which dropped 4 1  quarter over quarter  will get hit even harder 
IBM is an American corporate dinosaur that is dying a slow  painful death from terminal business cancer  The Company has done well to survive this long  Amazon and Oracle have ignited a pricing war in the cloud space that will eat IBM s cloud business alive  The cloud business is quickly become a highly commoditized product with no limit to capacity constraints and almost zero pricing power or real product differentiation  It s quite similar to the fiber optic business that soared then crashed and burned last decade 
IBM s current legacy  like most large corporations   US corporate debt has tripled since 2006 and is at record levels   is issuing debt to buy back shares and skimp on payments into its pension in order to generate GAAP net income  It s an American tragedy in the making  The stock market is historically overvalued now and is set up for a big sell off  which I believe will occur this year 
While the Dow and SPX have been flirting with record all time highs  IBM sits 18 6  below its all time high reached in 2013  It was IBM s turn to be used as prop for today s Dow rally  as IBM has been one of biggest contributors to today s Dow gains  As I ve shown above  there has been zero fundamental factors behind IBM s stock move over the last three days ",2017-01-25,David I.

175773,397289,IBM,Blind athlete runs desert marathon unassisted using smartphone app,news,By Matthew Stock The physical and mental endurance required to run an ultramarathon in the scorching desert is a daunting challenge for even the most accomplished athletes  But doing it unassisted without the sense of sight seems practically impossible   Simon Wheatcroft lost his sight at the age of 17  but this hasn t stopped him from competing in some of the most extreme running events in the world  In May he attempted a 150 mile ultra marathon across the desert in Namibia  managing 100 miles before having to pull out because of the extreme heat   A veteran of numerous city marathons  Wheatcroft is normally accompanied by a running partner to keep him on course and stop him bumping into objects and other runners  But ahead of embarking on the desert marathon  Wheatcroft partnered with  IBM   NYSE IBM  to build an app that would help him navigate on his own  According to Wheatcroft  simplicity was key    To run in the right direction all you need is a bearing  so it may be 40 degrees north that you need to run for a certain amount of time  So we created an app that would notify me if I deviated from the desired bearing  And the way it did that was using beeps  much like parking sensors  so the further you deviated from the bearing the higher the frequency of the beeps   Wheatcroft told Reuters  In his day to day life  Wheatcroft is normally accompanied by his guide dog  Ascot  So it was fitting that the app he co developed with IBM was named in the labrador s honor   We decided to name the app  eAscot  because I do have a guide dog that helps me out on a day to day basis  who s named Ascot  But we felt he wouldn t really survive the heat of the desert  so he stayed at home and we took the electronic version instead   said Wheatcroft  But developing an app that could accurately track Wheatcroft s precise position step by step and relay information to him via headphones was no mean feat  The app uses satellite navigation  but with a user interface more like a car s parking sensor  according to IBM   The major challenge was  we re trying to build something that is a mix between a GPS tracker and something that helps you park in your car  So we kind of needed to come up with the math to detect how far you are off the track and to think about how often we need to do that and how quickly does the app need to respond   explained Tim Daniel Jacobi  from IBM s Bluemix Garage in London  To avoid over loading Wheatcroft with sounds  the interface needed to be aurally lightweight meaning short beeps instead of synthesized speech  The pitch of the beep also changes depending on his position  so if he veered too far left it beeps in a different pitch than if he was too far right  The app was field tested as Wheatcroft ran the Boston marathon in April  weeks before he headed out to Namibia  He had a running partner to help him avoid other runners  but the app itself successfully helped guide him through the route   After the Namibian marathon  Wheatcroft was thrilled with the way the app successfully helped him run solo through the desert  He concedes  however  there are some things that the app would never be able to help with  such as monitoring the ground for uneven terrain and relaying that information to him in a way that he would have time to react  Wheatcroft and IBM are continuing to develop the technology  with plans to incorporate haptic devices into his clothing that relay navigation information via touch   Wheatcroft said this could eventually help him run city marathons without worrying about obstacles    The key improvement is to definitely take it to the city marathon  So the app for the desert used GPS as the navigation system  So now can we create a system which can identify the objects and then translate that information to me  That s what we re working on now  some kind of sensor detection system that uses haptic to vibrate different parts of my body   he said  Completing the Namibian ultra marathon proved a feat too far this time around  with the rough terrain and heat forcing Wheatcroft to quit after about 100 miles  But he s determined to return   Yeah  I d absolutely love to go back  It s definitely unfinished business  The race is happening again next year  I do intend on entering   Wheatcroft said   OLUSINT Reuters US Online Report Internet News 20160729T153624 0000,2016-07-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/blind-athlete-runs-desert-marathon-unassisted-using-smartphone-app-417443,417443
175774,397290,IBM,Remote control   LoRa offers a cheaper link to the Internet of Things,news,"By Jeremy Wagstaff LAUNCESTON  Australia    Reuters    The future of communications may be 5G  where mobile networks push bandwidth heavy video to phones and pull data from self driving cars  but some firms see an alternative  farm irrigation equipment  donation boxes and oysters  connected by a technology called LoRa  LoRa  for Long Range  is among a clutch of narrow band technologies that connect devices cheaply over unlicensed spectrum and vast distances  needing very little power  The catch  they can only send small parcels of data rather than the gigabytes most wired and mobile standards aspire to  But  advocates say  that may be more than enough   It turns out you don t need that huge an infrastructure  and it can be driven by small devices that are very smart and not very expensive   says Mike Cruse  CEO of Definium Technologies  which is building LoRa based devices for farmers  universities and mines  The so called Internet of Things  IoT  has long promised to hook up devices  from aircraft to hair dryers  enabling owners to monitor  control and collect data from them remotely  Spending on the IoT will hit  6 trillion between 2015 and 2020  according to PricewaterhouseCoopers  But the reality has been slow catching up  Ericsson  ST ERICAs  this year almost halved the number of connected devices   including smartphones   it sees by 2020 to 28 billion  Part of what s holding things back  critics say  is that solutions are too expensive and elaborate for what is needed  Most involve cellular connections  which are either impractical in rural areas or beyond a user s budget  Take Richard Gardner  who runs a 2 500 hectare  6 178 acre  farm in Tasmania and pays A 1 200 per sensor for a cellular based soil moisture measuring system  He s working with Definium to design one costing a tenth of that   There s a lot of technology out there that works now  it s just very expensive  We ve got something now that we think has better attributes and is cheaper   says Gardner  who has invested in Definium and says he already has other farmers keen to buy the company s products  LORA AND FRIENDS Making all this possible is LoRa  a narrow band standard adopted by the likes of Cisco and  IBM   NYSE IBM   where the thumbnail sized radios that send and receive data sell for a dollar or less  Dutch enthusiasts are building a global community of open source LoRa gateways  called the Things Network  Nodes send and receive messages   about a tenth of the size of an SMS   every couple of minutes to once every few hours  Followers have rolled out their own experimental networks using the community s software in cities from Colombia to Russia  Founder Wienke Giezeman says a  300 gateway   the router connecting the LoRa nodes to the Internet   will be available next month  Half a dozen would be enough to cover an average sized city   This   he says   is going to push the next phase of growth   And LoRa isn t the only narrow band technology in town  Weightless  a British based alliance  is one  Another is a proprietary U S  technology run by a company called Ingenu  as is Sigfox  a French firm  which has raised  150 million from companies including Samsung Electronics  KS 005930   POTENTIAL LOSERS The biggest potential losers are the telecoms companies  the traditional gatekeepers to the coverage these networks now claim  Ericsson says only 1 5 billion of the 16 billion IoT devices it reckons will be connected in 2021 will rely on cellular networks  Some telecoms firms are counting on NB IOT  a narrow band standard adopted by the industry that would use their existing cellular networks  Others are hedging their bets by building LoRa and other narrow band networks  SK Telecom  for example  has rolled out a network across South Korea which it said would cost users a tenth of what they would pay to attach devices to its 4G network  Lagging  however  is how best to use these networks   Charles Anderson  an analyst at IDC  says governments and companies are still pondering what might work  and what end users might want   In the meantime  smaller players are feeling their way  One visitor to a booth at a recent IoT show in Singapore suggested connecting donation collection boxes so she d know when they need emptying  Rishabh Chauhan of The Things Network says the community is still experimenting   from remotely monitoring mouse traps to whether moored rowboats have filled with water   It seems people have a use case  but want to see it on a small level  They re still prototyping   he said  CITY LIMITS Much of the pioneering work is outside cities  where existing networks are poor  Gardner  the farmer  for example  sees the potential for monitoring water flow and levels  the voltage in his electric fences  or his crop sprinklers  Knowing whether they re working properly would save two trips a day and cut fuel bills  he says  In a back room lab  Definium s Cruse shows some of the sensors he s designing for clients  all of which could easily connect to a LoRa network

grounded about 2 000 Delta  N DAL  flights this week because major carriers have not invested enough to overhaul reservations systems based on technology dating to the 1960s  airline industry and technology experts told Reuters  Airlines have spent heavily to introduce new features such as automated check in kiosks  real time luggage tracking and slick mobile apps  But they have avoided the steep cost of rebuilding their reservations systems from the ground up  former airline executives said  Scott Nason  former chief information officer at  American Airlines Group  Inc  O AAL   said long term investments in computer technology were a tough sell when he worked there   Most airlines were on the verge of going out of business for many years  so investment of any kind had to have

to always reach back into the old core technologies to retrieve a reservation or to figure out who flies between Dallas and New York City   When a power outage shuts off that reservations system   as happened on Monday to Delta Air Lines Inc s  Deltamatic  system   TPF falls out of sync with the newer technologies that passenger service agents use to assist travelers  Edwards said  Airlines are then forced to cancel flights as demands from stranded customers flood their employees   who meanwhile are handling bookings on an older platform without their familiar  modern tools  he said   Several years ago  it took United six hours to recover from a test shutdown  thanks to complications with the many add ons built atop TPF  Edwards said  Other recent disruptions include one in July that prompted Southwest Airlines Co  N LUV  to cancel over 2 000 flights and two outages last summer at United Continental  IBM Senior Vice President Tom Rosamilia said in a statement that TPF  was not named as the source or issue in any of the recent outages  and that it  is one of the most modern and reliable systems in the airline infrastructure   Rosamilia added that the vast majority of airlines use TPF  to process up to a million complex transactions per second  uninterrupted by frequent feature updates or the failure of other systems    PRESSURE FOR PROFITS Delta spokeswoman Kate Modolo said in a statement that a small fire on Monday resulted in a  massive failure  at the airline s technology center  Delta was forced to cancel flights because critical systems did not switch over to backup power as intended  she said  Reuters sent Delta and other major carriers detailed questions on TPF infrastructure and their technology investments   Modolo did not answer whether Delta relies on TPF  but said  the functionality of the IT programs we use  was not an issue  She had no comment on whether Delta had decreased or increased its spending on back end technology over the past decade   We have a new CIO who has a go forward plan to ensure Delta is on the cutting edge of customer service technology while strengthening our IT infrastructure so that it is reliable  redundant and nimble   she said in a statement  Most big airlines  including the four largest in the United States   American  Delta  United and Southwest   rely on TPF in some form  industry experts said  In response to questions from Reuters  those airlines did not answer whether their aging systems put them at risk of future disruptions  but all stressed that they are upgrading their technology and are focused on reliability  Southwest  for example  said it is in the process of replacing its reservations system   Earlier this week  in a video statement  Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said   Over the last three years  we have invested hundreds of millions of dollars on technology infrastructure upgrades and systems including backup systems to prevent what happened yesterday from occurring  I m sorry that it happened   U S  and Canadian airlines are projected to spend an average of 3 percent of their revenue on information technology this year   compared to 8 percent by commercial banks and 4 percent by healthcare firms  according to Computer Economics  a firm that tracks IT spending  Nason cautioned that comparing technology spending by airlines to some other industries  including banking  can be tricky  Banks have lower capital costs and they rely more heavily on information technology for their core business  Still  technology experts say that level of spending by the major airlines is not sufficient  pointing to the recent failures as evidence  Part of the challenge is that U S  airlines are under pressure from investors to top recent record profits and boost stock prices  even as economic troubles overseas have reduced travel demand  Delta  for example  is looking to boost its operating profit margin to between 17 percent and 19 percent by 2018  That s up from last year s margin target of 14 percent to 16 percent   FEAR OF FAILURE Airlines have also held off on making major network upgrades out of fear that systems could fail during the transition  making them feel that they cannot afford to take them down to add equipment  install patches and perform other maintenance  said Gartner analyst Mark Jaggers  Some consumer groups have called on airlines to do a better job at planning for disruptions like the one this week at Delta  which affected hundreds of thousands of passengers over four days   It is unfair to the traveling public that the cost of under investment in needed equipment be shifted and placed on the back of air travelers   said travel consumer advocates Paul Hudson and Charlie Leocha in a letter to the heads of the U S  Transportation Department and U S  Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday  Henry Harteveldt  founder of the travel consultancy Atmosphere Research Group  said some airlines are choosing to risk outages that might cost them  20 million to  40 million rather than invest  for example   100 million on technology upgrades  He believes investors and the general public will apply increasing pressure on airlines to avoid outages at any cost   We cannot afford  as a nation  for any of our airlines to be rendered useless by a technology failure   Harteveldt said  Yet it can be hard to convince airline management that the cost benefit analysis justifies the major investments to make their computer systems truly fail safe  said Edwards  the former United chief information officer

175781,397297,IBM,Wealth Creation Is Another Name For Poverty Reduction,opinion,"How much lower would the world s poverty rate be if Warren Buffett s skills in identifying value in the corporate sphere had evaporated decades ago  How many fewer families living hand to mouth would be suffering if  in 1980  IBM  NYSE IBM  didn t offer a young Bill Gates and his fledging company the opportunity to develop an operating system for Big Blue s then radical idea of producing personal computers for the masses 
No one knows the answer  of course  since those events never took place  But we can speculate  and on that basis it s hard to imagine that poverty would be lower because both men were now living comfortable but uneventful lives as upper middle class citizens  But Oxfam International would like you to think that there s a clear and direct link between reducing the number of super successful entrepreneurs and people living in poverty 
 New estimates show that just eight men own the same wealth as the poorest half of the world   Oxfam charges in a new report published this week  based on Forbes  data base that tracks billionaires   As growth benefits the richest  the rest of society   especially the poorest   suffers   the group writes in 
Oxfam s executive director  Winnie Byanyima   The New York Times that  it is obscene for so much wealth to be held in the hands of so few when 1 in 10 people survive on less than  2 a day   She asserts that  inequality is trapping hundreds of millions in poverty  
Reality  however  is more complicated than Oxfam s narrative implies  Reducing the net worth of the wealthy  either after the fact or as a policy going forward  is unlikely to solve the crisis that is poverty  which has been around for far longer than savvy investors and tech entrepreneurs have been plying their trades  But this much we know  the single biggest source of poverty reduction is directly bound up with wealth creation  which is a direct function of capitalism  warts and all 
No one should confuse the free enterprise system with perfection or an easy ticket to eliminating poverty  The number of things that are wrong with capitalism in its current form could fill a small library  But capitalism  fueled by the globalization in recent decades  has been instrumental in taking a bite out of the planet s poverty rate 
Consider the World Bank s 2016 report  which observes that  both the extreme poverty headcount ratio and the total number of the extreme poor have steadily declined worldwide since 1990  

The world had almost 1 1 billion fewer poor in 2013 than in 1990  a period in which the world population grew by almost 1 9 billion people  Overall  the global extreme poverty headcount ratio dropped steadily over this period  Despite more rapid demographic growth in poorer areas  the forceful trend in poverty reduction culminated with 114 million people lifting themselves out of extreme poverty in 2013 alone  in net terms  

A complete solution is still far off and so more much more is necessary to alleviate suffering  The good news is that a degree of progress is conspicuous in recent decades  as the chart below illustrates  The question is why  What s the source of this progress and how can the world generate more of it 

The answer is inextricably linked to economic growth  which is necessarily accompanied by greater inequality  There s room for debate about how much inequality is too much and what can be done to alleviate its negative side effects  But on some level  more inequality is a good thing because it reflects the fact that some share of the population is becoming wealthier  And that s the goal expanding the pool of wealth 
There are other factors driving lower poverty rates  of course  ranging from increased spending on education  health  and social safety nets  But most if not all of the necessary funding drivers for programs that are designed to lift people out of poverty are also bound up with expanding economic activity 
The main source of poverty eradication is employment  and offering more and better jobs on a broad scale is everywhere and always a function of an economy that s on the rise  The critical question  then  is how to promote and support growth  We can start by considering the conditions that appear to be associated with the progress over the last several decades 
It may be politically incorrect to point this out  but the decline in poverty rates since 1990 has been accompanied by a rise in globalization  lesser capital controls  a liberalized financial sector  and lower tax rates on higher incomes  Incidental  Unlikely  Meantime  the historical record on doing the exact opposite on those fronts doesn t offer an encouraging profile as the basis for a poverty eradication policy 
None of this means that the rise in economic inequality is irrelevant  or that policy makers should ignore the growing gap  But if you view the challenges of economic deprivation primarily if not wholly through the prism of inequality  and that lesser inequality is always good and a primary goal  there s a risk of overlooking the mechanism and the means that s been crucial in the progress for reducing poverty in recent decades 
Redistribution of wealth can play a role in alleviating poverty  of course  but it s destined to play a minor and temporary role at best  The great lesson of history  over long stretches of time and during the past generation in particular  is that there s no substitute for an expanding global economy for bringing more prosperity to a greater share of the population  The main focus should be on how to accelerate and deepen growth as a tool for furthering progress on poverty reduction 
To some extent  the historical record on what s worked  and what hasn t  should guide us  The World Bank s  Taking On Equality  notes that  the substantial decline  in poverty since 1990  is mostly explained by the lower number of the extreme poor in two regions  East Asia and Pacific  71 million fewer poor  and South Asia  37 million fewer poor     A large portion of that success is due to China s embrace of a market economy and India s economic liberalization  Overall   the world had almost 1 1 billion fewer poor in 2013 than in 1990  a period in which the world population grew by almost 1 9 billion people  
It essential to recognize that inequality will rise whenever economic progress is present  That s the nature of success on this front  It s hardly an excuse for mindlessly promoting tax cuts as the only solution or assuming that fertile conditions for large corporations is the answer  Paring the poverty rate is destined to be a complicated affair going forward  in part because the low hanging fruit has largely been picked  thanks to the previous shift to market oriented economics from command economies in China and elsewhere 
But now what  There are no easy answers or simple solutions  But there are some clear lessons that deserve respect  including the recognition that wealth generation isn t the enemy  The details on how wealth is created matter  of course  Nonetheless  if there s no agreement on the big picture theme that has been instrumental in poverty reduction over the last several decades  the essential task of keeping the trend alive will be even tougher than we think ",2017-01-17,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wealth-creation-is-another-name-for-poverty-reduction-200172673,200172673

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

3 Stocks that Propelled the Dow to Fresh All Time Highs

	The Dow hit a fresh all time high on Wednesday after stocks shrugged off early losses and moved steadily higher over most of the day  The blue chip index has now registered gains over 18 of the last 22 trading sessions  The Dow Jones transportation average also surged to an all time high  sparking speculations that the  Dow Theory  is taking effect 

	Most analysts and market watchers now believe that the index is likely to move higher over the rest of the year and even further  While financials have largely powered the Trump rally as well as the Dow  other highly weighted components are also responsible for the index s continuing ascent  Analyzing the reasons behind these gains could help us to ascertain whether they are sustainable and likely to continue going forward 

Dow Theory in Play 

	Even as the Dow closed at a record level for the successive session  the Dow Jones transportation average also closed at an all time high  The Dow transports gained 2 5  to close at its highest level since Dec  29  2014  The index also hit an intraday high for the first time in two years 

	A section of analysts now believe that since both indexes are creating new milestones  the  Dow Theory  is now in play  This factor is leading stocks to move even higher  One of the leading tenets of Dow Theory  which is the forerunner of modern technical analysis  is that market indexes should move in the same direction in order to determine whether a bull or bear market is in operation 

	This principle  originally applied to the Dow Industrial and Rail Averages  is now being utilized by some to explain the recent movement of the index and the transports  The relevance of such an inference is usually questioned since the economy of today is a highly segmented one 

	However  Trump s promises to boost infrastructure spending and loosen financial regulations have acted as strong tailwinds for the transports  This in turn is expected to result in growth for the economy as a whole  lending further credence to the theory 

Rally Likely to Continue

	Other market watchers have put forward alternative theories to support the claim that the index and markets could continue to move higher  Some analysts think that investors caught unawares by the sudden rally which began after Trump s victory will continue to rotate into stocks 

	Additionally  the short lull experienced during last week may have convinced them to remain invested in the rally  Alternatively  investors who were expecting to hit a trough in November may now be shy of pulling out of stocks 

	Another section thinks that stocks have moved within a narrow band over the last two years  They believe that the Trump rally is only a month old and is likely to continue into the year end  Meanwhile  historical selling patterns are likely to break down this time around following expectations of tax cuts under a Trump administration  This is making investors wait until the New Year before relinquishing the positions they have built up 

3 Primary Catalysts

	With the broader market latching onto the Trump fueled rally  only six of the 30 Dow components have declined over the last month  However  the strength gained from major components has propelled the index 6 6  higher over the last one month  Here we are examining the performance of the three largest components of the price weighted index 

Performance of the Three Largest Dow Components  1 Month 

The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc     NYSE      is the largest component of the Dow by weight  at 8 25   and has also registered the highest gains over the last one month  At 29 5   it stands head and shoulders above the 17th largest component JPMorgan Chase   Co   NYSE      which has notched up the second largest gain of just over 20  over the same period 

	Several market watchers suggest that Goldman Sachs alone has largely propelled the Trump rally  Promises of financial sector deregulation  including the proposed repeal of the Dodd Frank Act as well as an imminent rate hike has helped the stock hit its own all time high 

	Goldman Sachs  forward price to earnings  P E  ratio for the current financial year  F1  is 15 35  lower than the industry average of 17 17 Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 2 1  over the last 30 days  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 

3M Company  NYSE      is the second largest Dow component by weight  making up 6 17  of the total index  The stock has mopped up gains of 3 7  over the last one month which may seem limited compared to its Dow peers  However  market watchers believe that concerns over Trump s policies have abated to a great extent  It was earlier believed that 3M would suffer as a result of the new administration s policies  Its globally diversified business and exposure to healthcare were being viewed as major causes for such losses 

	However  most analysts now believe that a mix of fiscal stimulus measures and tax cuts is likely to benefit the conglomerate  These measures are also likely to delay a recession  resulting in further upside for the stock 

	3M has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   It has expected earnings growth of 5 9  for the current year 

IBM Corp   NYSE      is the third largest Dow component and carries a weightage of 5 77   With gains of 5 8  over the last one month period  the tech major has contributed substantially to the Dow s record breaking spree  As can be seen from yesterday s strong gains  tech stocks have now recovered from the reverses suffered since election results were declared

	Additionally  IBM is an undervalued stock in a sector usually known for its high growth potential  The stock s forward price to earnings ratio is well below the S P 500 s forward earnings multiple of 18  Its transition to a cloud based model and attractive dividend of 3 4  also indicates that it will continue to mop up gains 

	IBM has a Zacks Rank  3  The stock has a P E  F1  of 12 20  lower than the industry average of 12 90

175864,397380,IBM,Can Dow ETFs Stay On The Record Breaking Path ,opinion,"The Dow Jones industrial average appears to be on cloud nine  having crossed 19 000 for the first time in its  history on November 22  Not only Dow  the other two key U S  equity gauges   the S P 500 and NASDAQ Composite   also hit record highs 
The tailwind was the Trump induced rally triggered off by the pledges of higher fiscal spending and tax cuts  Specially  the industrial sector deserves a special mention on the president elect s plans of increased infrastructure spending  With republicans taking control of both the House and Senate  Trump is expected to enact all his  policies seamlessly  read     
Can Dow Hit 20 000 in the Near Term 
The answer can be give by both oil and Trump 
Investors should note that though several market watchers believe that there is little to no correlation between oil and stocks  this belief has been changing lately as the broad based market movement has been oil driven to a large extent  read    
This was especially true for Dow Jones Industrial Average  Recently  on a particular day of oil rout  the decline in Dow Jones was steeper than that of the S P 500    crude oil and the Dow Jones Industrial Average index moved almost in line  So  if the OPEC cuts an output curb deal this month  Dow may gain 
Also  manufacturing numbers point to a recovery in the U S  Upswing in the manufacturing sector can act as a strong tailwind to Dow Jones Industrial Average s forward growth  After all  SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF   V DIA   invests about 19 83  weight   the highest allocation   in the industrial sector  read    
Another bullish argument   that a transition is ongoing from an interest rate driven market into an earnings driven one   was presented by a chief investment strategist at   This can be a winning case for Dow Jones  As per an article published on    the consensus earnings estimates of Wall Street analysts started predicting Dow 20 000 within the upcoming year  
Some analysts are highly optimistic about Dow stocks and their projection is a 5 3  increase to  
Is There Something to Worry About DOW 
Despite the bullishness surrounding Dow Jones  there are concerns as well  Investors should note that the index spent around two years to cover another 1 000 points as it reached the 18 000 mark in December 2014   notified that  this was the seventh longest stretch of time between such round number marks   Moreover  it went on to explain that  the latest 1 000 point climb was the result of average gains of about 0 01  each trading day  
What s more concerning is that the height reached by Dow in recent times was unsusstainable  The 16000  17000 and 18000 Dow records were all snapped in less than  sessions after the earlier 1 000 point level was first reached 
Last but not the least  hasn t the market already priced in a Trump win  After all  key U S  indexes logged a pretty decent ascent following the election 
Now  it all depends on how Trump delivers on his promises and oil prices shape up  Till then  investors believing in the Dow rally can invest in these ETFs mentioned below

The fund seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index and is thus the first choice to play the index  The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank  2  Buy

175865,397381,IBM,Sleeping And Napping Through Investment Bubbles,opinion,"We have lived through many investment bubbles in our history  and unfortunately  most investors sleep through the early wealth creating inflation stages  Typically  the average investor wakes up later to a hot idea once every man  woman  and child have identified the clear trend right as the bubble is about burst  Sadly  the masses do a great job of identifying financial bubbles at the end of a cycle  but have a tougher time realizing the catastrophic consequences of exiting a tired winner  Or as strategist Jim Stack states 

Bubbles  for the most part  are invisible to those trapped inside the bubble 

The challenge of recognizing bubbles explains why they are more easily classified as bubbles after a colossal collapse occurs  For those speculators chasing a precise exit point on a bubblicious investment  they may be better served by waiting for the prick of the bubble  then take a decade long nap before revisiting the fallen angel investment idea 
Even for the minority of pundits and investors who are able to accurately identify these financial bubbles in advance  a much smaller number of these professionals are actually able to pinpoint when the bubble will burst  Take for example Alan Greenspan  the ex Federal Reserve Chairman from 1987 to 2006  He managed to correctly identify the technology bubble in late 1996 when he delivered his infamous  irrational exuberance  speech  which questioned the high valuation of the frothy  tech driven stock market 
The only problem with Greenspan s speech was his timing was massively off  Stated differently  Greenspan was three years premature in calling out the pricking of the bubble  as the NASDAQ index subsequently proceeded to more than triple from early 1997 to early 2000  the index exploded from about 1 300 to over 5 000  
One of the reasons bubbles are so difficult to time during their later stages is because the deflation period occurs so quickly  As renowned value investor Howard Marks fittingly notes 

The air always goes out a lot faster than it went in 

Bubbles  Bubbles  Everywhere
Financial bubbles do not occur every day  but thanks to the psychological forces of investor greed and fear  bubbles do occur more often than one might think  As a matter of fact  famed investor Jeremy Grantham claims to have identified 28 bubbles in various global markets since 1920  Definitions vary  but Webster s Dictionary defines a financial bubble as the following 
A state of booming economic activity  as in a stock market  that often ends in a sudden collapse 
Although there is no numerical definition of what defines a bubble or collapse  the financial crisis of 2008   2009  which was fueled by a housing and real estate bubble  is the freshest example in most people minds  However  bubbles go back much further in time   here are a few memorable ones 
Dutch Tulip Mania  Fear and greed have been ubiquitous since the dawn of mankind  and those emotions even translate over to the buying and selling of tulips  Believe it or not  some 400 years ago in the 1630s  individual Dutch tulip bulbs were selling for the same prices as homes   61 700 on an inflation adjusted basis   This bubble ended like all bubbles  as you can see from the chart below 

Source  The Stock Market Crash net
British Railroad Mania  In the mid 1840s  hundreds of companies applied to build railways in Britain  Like all bubbles  speculators entered the arena  and the majority of companies went under or got gobbled up by larger railway companies 
Roaring 20s  Here in the U S   the Roaring 1920s eventually led to the great Wall Street Crash of 1929  which finally led to a nearly  90  plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial stock index over a relatively short timeframe  Leverage and speculation were contributors to this bust  which resulted in the Great Depression 
Nifty Fifty  The so called Nifty Fifty stocks were a concentrated set of glamor stocks or  Blue Chips  that investors and traders piled into  The group of stocks included household names like Avon  McDonald s  Polaroid  Xerox  IBM and Disney  At the time  the Nifty Fifty were considered  one decision  stocks that investors could buy and hold forever  Regrettably  numerous of these hefty priced stocks  many above a 50 P E  came crashing down about 90  during the 1973 74 period 
Japan s Nikkei  The Japanese Nikkei 225 index traded at an eye popping Price Earnings  P E  ratio of about 60x right before the eventual collapse  The value of the Nikkei index increased over 450  in the eight years leading up to the peak in 1989  from 6 850 in October 1982 to a peak of 38 957 in December 1989

The Next Bubble
What is are the next investment bubble s   Nobody knows for sure  but readers of Investing Caffeine know that long term bonds are one fertile area  Given the generational low in yields and rates  and the 35 year bull run in bond prices  it can be difficult to justify heavy allocations of inflation losing bonds for long time horizon investors  Commercial real estate and  could be other potential over heated areas 
However  as we discussed earlier  identifying and timing bubble bursts is extremely challenging  Nevertheless  the great thing about long term investing is that probabilities and valuations ultimately do matter  and therefore a diversified portfolio skewed away from extreme valuations and speculative sectors will pay handsome dividends over the long run

Will this trend continue  Or will IBM be able to break out from here and put some distance between its performance and the S P 500   Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers 
Recent Earnings
 IBM reported third quarter 2016 non GAAP earnings of  3 29 per share and revenues of  19 23 billion  which comfortably surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 21 and  19 01 billion After declining for 17 consecutive quarters  revenues were almost flat on a year over year basis driven by strong growth from strategic imperatives and cloud  However  earnings declined 1 5  from the year ago quarter due to a lower gross margin base and higher research   development expenditure IBM has been moving away from its traditional businesses to newer  read more lucrative  business avenues like cloud and data analytics  Though IBM s strategic imperatives are performing well  third quarter results showed that these are not sufficient to compensate for the weakness in its traditional businesses yet Segment Revenue DetailsTotal software revenue increased 3  year over year to  5 7 billion Cognitive Solutions  solutions software and transaction processing software  revenues grew 4 5  year over year to  4 24 billion  Software solutions registered growth of 8   driven primarily by analytics  Watson platform  Big Data  Information Integration   Cloud was up an impressive 74   Acquisitions continue to cushion growth Revenues at the Global Business Services  includes consulting  global process services  application management  segment were  4 19 billion  roughly in line with the year ago quarter  Segmental revenues pertaining to strategic imperatives were up 13  Revenues at Technology Services and Cloud Platforms  includes infrastructure services  technical support services  integration software  grew 2 4  to  8 75 billion  Segmental revenues pertaining to strategic imperatives surged 45  driven by robust performance of hybrid cloud Revenues at Systems  systems hardware and operating systems software  fell 21  on a year over year basis to  1 56 billion  Hardware revenues tanked 25   while operating systems slumped 11  Global Financing  includes financing and used equipment sales  revenues declined 7 8  to  412 million Strategic ImperativesIBM s strategic imperatives  cloud  analytics  mobility and security  revenues surged 16  on a year over year basis to  8 3 billion in the quarter  Cloud revenues jumped 44  while Analytics revenues increased 15  during this period  Revenues from mobile and security increased about 19  and 11   respectively Per IBM  strategic imperatives now represent 40  of the company s top line and have delivered revenues of almost  32 billion over the last 12 months IBM continues to expand its cloud footprint by announcing new cloud centers in South Korea and Norway during the quarter  The company now has 49 cloud centers During the quarter  IBM entered into a partnership with Workday and an extended relationship with VMware  Workday will now use IBM cloud for software development and testing purposes  while the extended relationship with VMware will enable easy hybrid cloud adoption Expanding Watson OfferingsIBM continues to expand its Watson offerings  During the quarter  the company introduced Watson Conversation Service and Watson Virtual Agent for Customer Service  The service has already been selected by the likes of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group  LON RBS  plc Additionally  IBM launched Watson for Drug Discovery and Watson Health Core  The company also entered into a partnership with Siemens to help healthcare providers deliver value based care to patients with chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer IBM believes that the partnership with Siemens will accelerate adoption of Watson s Population Health Management offerings in the U S  Further  the company noted that it has won customers in China  South Korea  Finland and the United Kingdom IBM is focused on developing capabilities around th Blockchain technology  It is now working with almost 300 clients including the likes of CLS and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi  Moreover  the company announced a Blockchain innovation center in Singapore GuidanceFor full year 2016  IBM continues to project non GAAP earnings to be at least  13 50  Further  the company continues to anticipate generating free cash flow at the high end of the earlier expected range of  11 billion to  12 billion 
 
How have estimates been moving since then 
Following the release and in the last month  investors have witnessed a downward trend for fresh estimates  In the past month  there have been seven revisions lower for the current quarter compared to zero higher  a pretty negative trend overall 
VGM Scores
At this time  IBM s stock has just an average Growth score of  C   however  its momentum grade is doing a lot better with an  A   Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of  B  on the value side  putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy  
Based on our scores  the stock is primarily suitable for momentum investors while also being suitable for those looking for value and to a lesser degree growth 
Outlook
While estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  Interestingly shares of IBM have a Zacks Rank   3  hold   so we are expecting a continued in line performance from IBM in the next few months 
We think the company is just a hold right now  IBM could be considered a decent choice for value investors  but the lack of growth on the earnings estimate front is definitely concerning and needs to be monitored closely

175913,397429,IBM,Augusta National masters art of minimal sponsorship,news,"By Rick Horrow AUGUSTA  Georgia  Reuters    Sports sponsorship deals  even multi million dollar ones  follow a pretty basic process  This applies nearly everywhere  but not at the Masters golf tournament  In most corners of the world  a property and a brand get together in a conference room  The property tells the brand how much money it will require to attach the brand s name to a team  building or event  Negotiations follow concerning the deal s duration and payment schedule  before marketing agency reps and lawyers handle the fine print  Hands are shaken and an announcement is made  But at Augusta National Golf Club  the permanent home of the Masters  business is conducted quite differently   and almost all of it is shrouded in secrecy  For Masters chairman Billy Payne and Augusta National s leadership  less has always been more when it comes to attaching sponsors to one of one sport s prestige properties  At virtually every other golf tournament on the planet  an abundance of sponsors is considered a positive   there is always room for another logo somewhere on the course  At the Masters  which this week celebrates its 80th edition  sponsors are limited to five  global sponsors AT T  NYSE T    IBM   NYSE IBM   and Mercedes Benz  and international partners UPS and Rolex  All five are estimated to pay upwards of  6 million annually to have zero signage in view on property  share a combined four minutes of ads per broadcast hour  and follow extremely stringent  narrow rules about how their association with the world s most exclusive golf tournament can be promoted  Take IBM  for example  The Rochester  New York computing stalwart is responsible for developing and maintaining the Masters official website  and handheld and iPad apps  as well as providing data services and analysis  courtesy of its  Watson  mega computing system  that broadcasters use on air   A small IBM logo sits atop the top right hand corner of each digital display  but that is as heavy handed as the branding gets  And IBM does not swap these technology services in exchange for a sponsorship platform  To the contrary  it pays millions of dollars each year for the privilege of providing them  Why  As Forbes has noted   the digital platforms provided to the Masters as part of IBM s robust sponsorship of the event serve to show potential business partners the capacity of the 21st century IBM    not the bulky business computing of old  TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC The Masters and the U S  Open  which it also sponsors  are the perfect events to reach IBM s target demographic  business owners  In 2014  Mercedes Benz upgraded its corporate involvement at the Masters by replacing ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  as one of the tournament s three global sponsors  Mercedes had been a partner since 2008  ExxonMobil had been a Masters global sponsor since 2005   and true to Augusta National form  was tightlipped about its reasons for dissolving the partnership thereafter  While the German luxury automaker also sponsors the British Open and PGA Championship  it craved the exclusivity of the limited commercial space in Masters domestic telecasts   The Masters is the most prestigious golf tournament in the world  It is a great honor for Mercedes Benz to now be associated with the Masters Tournament as one of the three global sponsors   Joachim Schmidt  the company s executive vice president of sales and marketing  said at the time  Beyond TV ads  Mercedes has capitalized on its existing relationship with former Masters champion Adam Scott on social media  and its autos are also marketed at Augusta National  Right after last year s tournament concluded  AT T did not waste any time capitalizing on the first Masters win by American young gun Jordan Spieth  the only player the telecom giant has backed since its short lived relationship with Tiger Woods  Although the terms of each sponsor s agreement are not disclosed  sponsorship analyst IEG has calculated the total annual global contribution to be near  18 million  and that was before international partners UPS and Rolex joined the party

Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa  shareholders to launch vigorous defenses of an aggressive private equity partner and a maligned mobile home unit  as his conglomerate recorded robust profits  The world s third richest person and a revered investor  Buffett also injected himself into the contentious 2016 U S  presidential campaign  lambasting candidates who talk down the nation s economic future as  dead wrong    an apparent jab at Republicans and frontrunner Donald Trump  Buffett  who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton  also raised a political issue dear to Democrats in his widely read letter by calling climate change a  major problem for the planet   although not one for Berkshire s future   Buffett  85  also made no mention of who might succeed him at Berkshire  which he has run for a half century  and in passing said he expects to be around at age 100  The Omaha  Nebraska based company reported a record full year profit of  24 08 billion  up 21 percent

The agreement  to be announced later on Tuesday  means the two companies will jointly sell Pivotal Cloud Foundry  which helps developers build and run software on the cloud  and Cisco s Metapod  a service that lets companies make their data centers more cloud friendly 
Pivotal s service helps companies deploy a free  but hard to use open source technology also called Cloud Foundry  much as the free operating system known as Linux generally requires services of a consultant like Red Hat Inc  N RHT  
Pivotal Cloud Foundry competes with services such as  IBM  s  N IBM  Bluemix and HP Enterprise s  N HPE  Helion  while Mirantis competes with Metapod 
The so called cloud has become a broad term for quick delivery of data over the Internet  often by sharing computing resources with other companies

 IBM   N IBM  made a range of announcements today promising to rapidly advance the use of distributed ledger technology across multiple industries around the world  The news follows the earlier Japan Exchange Group  JPX  announcement that the trading venue will start conducting proof of concept on distributed ledger technology with the help of IBM Japan 
IBM says new blockchain services on its cloud will help create and manage blockchain networks to power a new class of distributed ledger applications  Using IBM s new blockchain services available on Bluemix  developers can access fully integrated DevOps tools for creating  deploying  running and monitoring blockchain applications on the IBM Cloud  Blockchain applications can also access existing transactions on distributed servers and z Systems through APIs to support new payment  settlement  supply chain and business processes 
Using its Watson IoT Platform  IBM will make it possible for information from devices such as RFID based locations  barcode scan events  or device reported data to be used with IBM s Blockchain  Devices will be able to communicate to blockchain based ledgers to update or validate smart contracts  For example  as an IoT connected package moves along multiple distribution points  the package location and temperature information could be updated on a blockchain  This allows parties to share information and the status of the package as it moves among multiple parties to ensure the terms of a contract are met 
Finally  to help accelerate the design and development of blockchain applications  IBM Garages will open in London  New York  Singapore and Tokyo to enable IBM experts to collaborate with developers on the design and implementation of blockchain for business  IBM Global Business Services will also expand its blockchain consulting practice for clients in banking and financial services and logistics  IBM Interactive Experience will also engage clients to co design new use cases for blockchain in more than 25 IBM Studios around the globe 
 In just a few short months  IBM s vision for making blockchain a powerful new business solution across multiple industries is becoming a reality as our clients begin piloting innovative new code  services and z Systems optimized for distributed ledgers   said Arvind Krishna  Senior Vice President  IBM Research   These advancements are making it easier for developers to move from understanding the potential of blockchain  to actually using it to change their business processes in powerful new ways  ",2016-02-16,FinanceMagnates,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/ibm-to-open-blockchain-garages-in-london,-new-york,-singapore-and-tokyo-384958",384958

On Wednesday  U S  crude for February delivery fell more than 6  to an intraday low of  26 19  slipping to its lowest level since May  2003  Crude prices have fallen precipitously this week following Iran s return to global markets after a group of Western Powers lifted longstanding economic sanctions against Tehran over the weekend  As a result  oil futures have tumbled more than 20  since the start of the new year in the face of mounting concerns related to excessive supply on global energy markets 
The Dow lost 249 28 or 1 56  to 15 766 74  while the NASDAQ Composite index ticked down 5 26 or 0 12  to 4 471 69 on a frenzied day of trading when both indices receded to their lowest levels since last summer s flash crash  The S P 500 Composite index  meanwhile  fell 22 00 or 1 17  to 1 859 33  as stocks in nine of 10 sectors closed in the red  Stocks in the Energy and Utilities industries lagged  each falling more than 2  on the session  Stocks in the Health Care sector led 
At one point  the S P 500 slid to its lowest level since February  2014  as nearly 90  of the index traded in correction territory  Since the start of the new year  the S P has lost approximately  2 trillion in market capitalization 
The top performer on the Dow was UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  N UNH   which added 2 21 or 1 96  to 114 79  The nation s largest healthcare insurer topped the Dow for the second consecutive day after reporting a 30  increase in fourth quarter revenues on Tuesday  The worst performer was International Business Machines  N IBM   N IBM   which tumbled 6 25 or 4 88  to 121 86  following an 8 5  decline in quarterly earnings  amid a strong dollar and sluggish IT spending 
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Celgene Corporation  O CELG   which jumped 4 50 or 4 37  to 107 49  after the company reported mixed forward guidance in spite of strong forecasts with its blockbuster lymphoma drug Revlimid  During fiscal year 2015  Celgene  O CELG  expects Revlimid sales to surge by more than 15   The worst performer was Micron Technology Inc  O MU   which lost 0 75 or 6 94  to 10 05  Micron  which fell to a 52 week low on Wednesday  is down by more than 60  over the last year due in part to weak demand and falling pricing trends in the semiconductor industry

176072,397588,IBM,Israel brings tech expertise to protecting connected cars,news,"By Ari Rabinovitch TEL AVIV  Reuters    Building on its expertise in technology  Israel is emerging as a leader in the race to keep cars secure and prevent the nightmare scenario of a hacker commandeering your vehicle  Most cars today are equipped with some level of connectivity and self driving vehicles are being developed  Given this level of sophistication  protecting cars from contamination with malicious software has become big business   We view this as a potential  10 billion market opportunity over the next five years   said Daniel Ives  an analyst with FBR Capital Markets in New York   As we have seen with cyber security over the past decade  the lion s share of the innovation going after this market is from Israel and Silicon Valley   The threat appears real enough   Fiat Chrysler  N FCAU  recalled 1 4 million vehicles to install new software last year after cybersecurity researchers showed they could turn off a Jeep Cherokee s engine as it drove  Software manipulation  albeit intentional  was also behind Volkswagen s emissions scandal  From its headquarters in Tel Aviv  Check Point  one of the world s largest cyber security firms  pioneered the computer firewall two decades ago  It hopes to repeat that success with a security capsule for vehicles  Connected cars need a two pronged defense  First  they must make sure nothing bad gets in  like a virus sneaking through a navigation system  Then they have to keep internal communications secure to allow functions like side view mirrors which angle down when vehicles are put into reverse  Check Point is focusing on protecting the car s external gateway  said Alon Kantor  vice president of business development  After two years of meeting carmakers and their top suppliers  he said they now have a working  proof of concept    The car manufacturers didn t know exactly what cyber security was  We had to study the networks in different cars  It was mutual learning   Kantor said  With Check Point s system  everything going in and out of the car passes through the company s cloud based network  where it is inspected in real time and malware is blocked   The idea is to prevent the next recall and handle all security and updates over the air   Kantor said  VULNERABILITIES Experts warn that hackers may eventually try to track driving patterns  interfere with fleet management or falsify information passed electronically to insurers   Automakers are working to keep pace with the dynamic nature of cyber threats by incorporating security by design  developing internal expertise  and cultivating partnerships    both procedural and operational    with organizations specializing in cyber defense   says the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  a Washington based association of 12 of the largest car makers  Some 420 million connected cars will be on the road in 2018  and the number has risen 57 percent annually since 2013  according to market researcher IDATE   Technology companies are alive to the business opportunity  Last week  Harman International Industries  N HAR   a maker of connected car systems  said it was buying Israeli founded cyber defense start up TowerSec to protect its products with market ready platforms  Israeli media estimated the deal at  70 million   Technology giants like  IBM   N IBM  and CISCO have asked their teams in Israel to work on protecting cars   What makes cars so vulnerable to attack is that they are such complex systems   said Yaron Wolfsthal  head of the IBM research center in the desert city of Beersheba  Premium cars  put together from a complex supply chain  can run on up to 100 million lines of software code    about 12 times more than in the new F 35 stealth fighter jet  Like other global technology firms  IBM set up a branch in Beersheba two years ago when the military began moving operations there  including elite intelligence and cyber warfare units whose graduates are behind many of Israel s private sector successes  IBM has developed a comprehensive prototype  Wolfsthal said  and is looking to integrate it with a car manufacturer  The program will be connected to other IBM systems that can spot patterns of broader security breaches  NEW SKILLS None of the handful of companies in Israel that spoke with Reuters would give the names of carmakers with whom they are talking  But the pitching process can include exposing them to the vulnerability of their own models  Check Point said it showed executives from a few large automakers that it can hijack their car s external communication channel using a handheld transceiver and frequency jammer  both of which can be bought on eBay for a few hundred dollars  and a laptop computer running open source software  Also based in Tel Aviv  Argus Cyber Security developed a defense system that protects a car s internal networks as well as the external wireless connection  The start up was founded by graduates of the military s cyber intelligence unit and in September raised  26 million  including from auto supplier Magna International  Yoni Heilbronn  the company s head of marketing  was the only foreigner to appear at a closed door session last year in the U S  Congress discussing how to protect connected cars  
 Car manufacturers for the last 100 years simply built cars and were very good at doing that  Cyber security is generally not their core competence   he said   This is where it comes back to Israel  ",2016-01-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/israel-brings-tech-expertise-to-protecting-connected-cars-379498,379498

176104,397620,IBM,In latest retail tech  Carrefour lights have eyes,news,"By Dominique Vidalon and Emma Thomasson LILLE  France BERLIN  Reuters    The strip lights in the hypermarket know where you are  and can tell you where to go  The new technology being trailed by French retailer  Carrefour   PA CARR  tracks your movements and beams data to your smartphone via light pulses undetectable to the eye  to guide you to the right shelves for tailored special offers  It is the latest attempt to combine the online and real world shopping experience  regarded as the holy grail for the industry at the moment   As part of a new loyalty scheme launched last month  for example  Britain s Marks and Spencer  L MKS  is sending promotional text messages to shoppers who are in or near its stores   but only those who have agreed to receive them  In fact almost three quarters of British retailers are using technology  including facial recognition software  to track customers in stores  according to a survey of retail executives by IT services firm CSC  It is mostly for security purposes  but also to help provide a more personalized service  Even in Germany  where privacy is particularly closely guarded  major retailers have been signing up to U S  app Shopkick  which rewards consumers with points when they enter participating stores and scan products with their phones   But retailers must tread with caution  especially among older customers   We are already flooded with offers on smartphones  We are being tracked to death  I guess I m old school  but I want to keep my privacy   said Yves  50  an insurance executive shopping at the Carrefour store that is testing the new lights  The Carrefour project   a one year joint trial with Dutch tech firm Philips   is at the sprawling store next to the train station in the northern French city of Lille  chosen for the test because of the young and urban crowd it attracts  The Euralille hypermarket replaced its fluorescent lighting with Philips LED lights that can transmit data via pulses which are registered by smartphone cameras  at this stage only iPhones   NEW TOYS  Customers who have downloaded the  Promo C ou   Where is the special offer  app can let their smartphone camera point up so the lights in the ceiling determine their location  A blue arrow on the phone screen then guides them to the right shelf   We want to facilitate the shoppers  experience and be more convivial   said Carrefour store manager Thierry Demettre  The service helps direct busy shoppers to the 200 to 300 different items on promotion each week  he said  Carrefour said the app was being used about 50 100 times a day in a store which serves 11 000 customers a day  It is recruiting students to help customers use the app during the busy holiday season  When Reuters visited the store  it was hard to find shoppers who knew about the app  despite banners advertising the service in the aisles  Karine  a 40 year old civil servant who works nearby  said she could imagine using the app   I could save time when shopping   she said  adding she did not mind sharing her data   They would not be the first nor the last to send us messages    Eight in 10 consumers around the world are willing to share key pieces of personal information with brands  but only about 8 percent feel they are receiving better offers as a result  according to a survey of 20 000 people in 11 major countries conducted by marketing and loyalty company Aimia   Marketers have got lots of new toys in the toy cupboard but the risk is you end up doing cleverer

to work out how to make the best use of the mountains of data they are gathering and make money from it  When IBM analyzed customer data for a coffee chain  for example  it found the air temperature point at which people tend to order cold drinks over hot drinks was several degrees lower than the chain had expected  Laughlin said   They were sending promotions for hot drinks when they should have been sending promotions for cold drinks   he said  Lasse Bolander  chairman of Denmark s largest supermarket chain Coop  said offering targeted discounts was particularly difficult for grocery retailers as customers shop so frequently and for a huge range of items  That explains why some retailers   like British upmarket supermarket Waitrose   are allowing loyalty card holders to pick the items on which they want special offers  But Bolander  whose Coop chain is owned by more than 1 5 million Danish customers who share their data in return for discounts  says retailers need to be careful  
 We have to make it transparent what we use the data for and easy to opt out   he said   Until we are absolutely certain we can give people the right offer at the right time we should take a step back   otherwise people will get annoyed  ",2015-11-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/we're-watching-you:-carrefour-lights-have-eyes-370980,370980

176174,397690,IBM,After VW  Germany needs EU friends to join its party,news,"By Alastair Macdonald  Barbara Lewis and Tom K rkemeier BRUSSELS  Reuters    Nazi swastikas billowing under the triumphal arch that overlooks Brussels  European Union district drew the odd gasp from guests of Berlin s EU mission at an evening to celebrate 25 years since German reunification  The image was fleeting  a prologue to a sound and light show that was a German  thank you  for peace and unity with fellow Europeans since the Berlin Wall fell  But as it fetes the merger of East and West on Oct  3  1990  that made Germany the Union s dominant power  the flashback was a reminder of its struggles to reassure neighbors who again wonder if Berlin can be trusted   Today s rows  over refugees  austerity or Volkswagen  XETRA VOWG  cars  are a world away from Europe s bloody 20th century  But recent events have raised new questions about German fair play and credibility  putting pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel to win back EU allies as a series of crises saps her support at home  Merkel and French President Francois Hollande will attend the European Parliament together on Wednesday  symbolically reprising a visit by their predecessors Helmut Kohl and Francois Mitterrand to the Strasbourg assembly after the Wall came down in 1989 and Europe began to fret about a reunited Germany   Germany was always the linchpin in compromises   Fabian Zuleeg  who runs the European Policy Centre think tank  said of the EU s early decades   Now Germany will closely consider what is our national interest and then act accordingly  It s changing the whole dynamics of decision making at a European level   What we are seeing is Germany behaving much more like other countries  But because it s Germany  it has a different impact   A reunited population gave Germany clout in Brussels greater than former peers France  Britain and Italy  Economic power in the euro  once seen in Paris as a tool to rein in Berlin  and a new self confidence have seen Germany eclipse struggling EU co founder France in a bloc whose center of gravity has shifted firmly eastward with the accession of new ex communist members  No one suggests Berlin s EU leverage    via voting weights  cash and Germans in key posts    has been put at risk by its handling of crises on Greek debt and migrants or by misdeeds at its flagship Volkswagen car manufacturer that have highlighted single minded German stonewalling of EU anti pollution measures  Yet each of these three dramas over the past few months has been a reminder of the limitations even Merkel faces unless she can build substantial consensus across the 28 nation Union  CRISES  THEN SCANDAL In the crisis over Greece s debt  it was Athens which ended up isolated  But Germany s handling of the negotiations  whether in its hard line on austerity measures or even in its occasional hints at compromise  drew plenty of grumbling around the bloc   Migration has proven even more divisive  Merkel s unilateral suspension of EU rules to offer a welcome to Syrian refugees angered neighbors who accused her of encouraging the migrants  treks across Europe  A poisonous row in which national quotas for taking refugees    a key German demand    were imposed by majority vote has also raised questions about Berlin s will to build EU consensus  But for some in Brussels the Volkswagen scandal  while its full extent remains unclear  could have most impact by stiffening resistance to Berlin s efforts to shield its key industries from more rapid environmental protection legislation and  more broadly  by calling into question the credibility of German leadership  The admission last month by Volkswagen  Europe s largest carmaker  that it cheated diesel emissions tests has rocked the global auto industry and the German establishment   You can t get more German than Volkswagen   one senior EU diplomat said   Berlin has thrown its weight about in Brussels to protect these manufacturers and now this  It s very bad  People are angry  They can t get things all their way again   Privately  diplomats from other states and some EU officials have said the scandal could strengthen their hand against Berlin  though there is also concern that it weakens the EU s collective claim to global leadership on environmental policy  Philippe Lamberts  a Belgian former  IBM   NYSE IBM  executive who is a leading Greens member of the European Parliament  said cheating by a company so close to the German state showed a degree of hypocrisy and could strengthen resistance to Berlin s interests   Germany had a renewed assertiveness that it did not have before reunification  The weight of World War Two was now gone and rightly so   Lamberts said  But he added   Germany was a hegemon because other member states allowed it to be  Germany was lecturing Greece     Germany has to stop lecturing    Pierre Moscovici  a former French finance minister and now economics commissioner on the EU executive  publicly dismissed suggestions the Volkswagen case weakened Germany in the bloc   It does damage to the image of the company itself  It raises questions about broader issues   he said in Berlin   But it will not limit German influence at all in Brussels   FRIENDS IN NEED David Marsh of the OMFIF think tank said a loss of trust in Germany in some areas could dent its authority elsewhere   Trust is a valuable commodity   he wrote   If the Germans disregard their own rules in environmental technology  other people are not likely to heed Germanic strictures in economics   In forthcoming discussions about austerity throughout Europe  heads of government and finance ministers will find themselves talking  however improbably  about diesel emissions   German officials are at pains to stress their reluctance to strong arm EU partners   Germany is in the driver s seat because we re the biggest country  the richest country   Merkel s European affairs minister Michael Roth said in Brussels   We have to take responsibility   he said with particular reference to the refugee crisis  But he added   I don t want to blackmail our partners     Germany should not be too tough   Merkel herself will have an opportunity in Strasbourg to talk up that cooperative spirit and partnership with France  Officials say her joint address with Hollande was long planned    though it was only squeezed into the assembly s public agenda just after the Volkswagen scandal broke two weeks ago   Germany is completely committed to defending European unity   the parliament s German speaker  Martin Schulz  assured the crowd at the Brussels reunification party  He singled out Hungary  Merkel s bete noire in the migration crisis  to thank for its role in prizing open the Iron Curtain in summer 1989  And as Germans celebrate their unity this weekend  they can expect to hear more encouragement to remember their neighbors   Germany has to accept that     it cannot get everything it wants   said the EPC s Zuleeg  warning that a resort to outvoting smaller countries on sensitive issues such as immigration was fuelling a  general breakdown of trust

In our opinion  Selipsky s appointment is a sound choice  given his profound experience in the cloud computing platform space over the years  We expect the new CEO of Tableauto better understand the overall strengths and weaknesses of the business as he has in depth knowledge of the market dynamics 
According to his LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  profile   Selipsky helped take AWS from a pre revenue position to a business with more than  10 billion in revenue while growing the team size from fewer than 10 to thousands    His experience is expected to benefit the company and is expected to take the business to the next level

176231,397747,IBM,IBM revenue falls for 13th straight quarter  shares dip,news,"By Abhirup Roy and Anya George Tharakan
 Reuters    International Business Machines Corp s  N IBM  revenue fell for the 13th consecutive quarter and missed the average analyst estimate  as it continued to shed low margin businesses and the strong dollar weighed on Big Blue s results 
Shares of the world s largest technology services company fell about 5 percent in after market trading on Monday 
 IBM  is deep in transition  and has been selling businesses such as low end servers  cash registers  and semiconductors to focus on high growth areas like security software  cloud services and data analytics 
The company  which sold its x86 server business to  Lenovo Group Ltd   HK 0992  last year  has continued realigning its operations by paying contract chipmaker Globalfoundries Inc to take over its loss making semiconductor unit this month 
Revenue from what the company calls  strategic imperatives   which include cloud and mobile computing  data analytics  social and security software  rose about 20 percent  yet the new businesses have so far failed to make up for revenue lost to divestitures 
IBM said it expected third quarter revenue to be the same as revenue from the first quarter  or about  19 6 billion 
Revenue from its software business fell 10 percent to  5 8 billion from a year earlier 
Revenue from global technology services such as outsourcing fell 10 percent  hurt by weak discretionary IT spending by clients 
 Traditional software and services remain under pressure across IT  and we believe M A remains one of the only glimmers of hope to restore growth back to these traditional tech giants that are starving for growth   Daniel Ives  an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  said 
Armonk  New York based IBM s total revenue fell to  20 81 billion in the second quarter ended June 30  from  24 05 billion a year earlier  missing the average analyst estimate of  20 95 billion  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
IBM s quarterly results were also hurt by the strong dollar  The company  which gets more than half its revenue from overseas  said it expected a slightly greater currency impact in the second half of the year 
Consolidated net income dropped to  3 45 billion  or  3 50 per share  for the second quarter  from  4 14 billion   4 12 per share  a year earlier 
Excluding items  IBM earned  3 84 per share  beating the average analyst estimate of a profit of  3 78

176237,397753,IBM,Is Cisco s Dividend Payment Safe ,opinion,"Each week  I will be taking a look at the dividend safety of a major company  This week  I will be breaking down technology giant Cisco  Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO   
My full thesis on Cisco can be seen here  but I will focus primarily on its Dividend Safety Score in this article 
Before analyzing the company s dividend  let s quickly recap how Cisco makes money  After all  one of the best pieces of  is to only invest in simple  easy to understand businesses 
Cisco has been in business for more than 30 years and is one of the biggest tech companies in the world 
The company s products  77  of sales  and services  23   are primarily sold to businesses to help them connect computing devices to networks or computer networks with each other 
 are Cisco s largest product segments and help connect communications devices and manage the flow of data between networks 
Cisco s reach is global in nature with approximately 40  of revenue generated outside of the Americas Cisco s Dividend SafetyAs I noted in my recent analysis of Caterpillar s dividend  my intention is to never own a company that reduces its dividend payment 
The three dividend portfolios in our newsletter have been successful so far  These portfolios have collectively enjoyed over 60 dividend increases and avoided any dividend cuts since they were started 
Companies usually give off a number of warning signs before they actually cut their dividends 
The companies most likely to cut their dividends usually have some combination of high payout ratios  weak free cash flow generation  declining sales and earnings  weak balance sheets  and no proven commitment to paying and growing dividends over time 
Tracking these key metrics is time consuming  which is why I created Dividend Safety Scores to help me keep tabs on all of these factors for companies I am interested in 
Our Dividend Safety Score analyzes 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to answer the question   Is the current dividend payment safe  
We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and free cash flow payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  profitability trends  and more 
A Dividend Safety Score of 50 is average  75 or higher is considered excellent  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Most companies that end up cutting their dividends score below 25 for Dividend Safety prior to announcing their dividend reduction 
Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI   Potash  BHP Billiton  LON BLT   and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  all scored below 20 for Dividend Safetybefore announcing their dividend cuts 
Fortunately  dividend investors who own shares of Cisco for income can sleep well at night 
Cisco s Dividend Safety Score of 87 indicates that the company has one of the safest dividend payments in the market 
Unlike   Cisco only started paying dividends in 2011  How can the company score so well for Dividend Safety with such a limited track record 
I m glad you asked 
Cisco s strong Dividend Safety Score begins with its healthy payout ratios  Over the last 12 months  Cisco s dividend has consumed 46  of reported earnings and 38  of free cash flow 
While the company s payout ratios have meaningfully increased since Cisco began paying dividends  see below   their current level is very safe  Even if Cisco s earnings were unexpectedly cut in half  the company s payout ratio would still be below 100  Source  Simply Safe DividendsSource  Simply Safe Dividends
And Cisco s earnings are at very little risk of being chopped in half  The company performed relatively well during the last recession  which also impacts its Dividend Safety Score 
Cisco s sales fell by 9  in fiscal year 2009  and its free cash flow per share dropped by 14   Technology spending is certainly correlated with GDP growth  but many of Cisco s solutions are mission critical for businesses to continue operating 
In future years  Cisco s performance during economic downturns could be even stronger  The company is shifting more into recurring software and services revenue  which improves Cisco s cash flow stability and business forecasting 
To put some perspective behind Cisco s ongoing mix shift  an analyst from Oppenheimer  that Cisco s recurring revenue has doubled since fiscal year 2008 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Sales growth doesn t do a company much good if it fails to generate free cash flow  Free cash flow is the money that is leftover after a company has reinvested back into the business to keep it competitive 
Without free cash flow  a company cannot sustainably pay dividends over the long term  As seen below  Cisco s free cash flow generation has been outstanding 
The company has generated free cash flow each year for more than a decade  and its free cash flow per share has more than doubled since fiscal year 2005  Consistent cash flow generation adds further strength to Cisco s dividend payment Source  Simply Safe Dividends
So far  we have seen that Cisco s strong Dividend Safety Score is backed up by the company s healthy payout ratios  relatively strong performance during the last recession  and consistent free cash flow generation 
Another major factor influencing dividend safety is financial leverage  Companies will always make their debt and interest payments before declaring dividends 
Businesses with high debt levels can be at greater risk of cutting their dividend if they unexpectedly fall on hard times  During such periods  earnings can be significantly reduced and existing cash must be preserved 
Cisco s balance sheet is in excellent shape  As seen below  the company has more cash   63 5 billion  than debt   24 9 billion  on hand 
If the company paid off all of its debt and only used its remaining cash on hand to pay dividends  it could continue making its dividend payments for more than nine years before needing other funds  It s hard to find a better balance sheet than Cisco s 

Finally  it s always worth reviewing a company s recent sales and earnings trends to make sure no nasty surprises are brewing 
 showed adjusted revenue growth of 3  and a 6  increase in non GAAP diluted earnings per share 
The company also commented that it was pleased with the progress it was making on its continued transition to more software and subscription revenue 
Unlike some old technology giants  see IBM  NYSE IBM    Cisco continues to hold its own in an ever changing world 
By now  it is quite evident that Cisco s dividend payment is very safe  Management last raised the company s dividend by 24  earlier this year 
Cisco s quarterly dividend payout has more than quadrupled since 2011 and continues to have double digit growth potential 
With a healthy dividend yield of 3 4   Cisco offers a unique blend of safety and growth Closing Thoughts on Cisco s Dividend SafetyThe technology sector is generally not a great hunting ground for dividends because of its fast pace of change and numerous opportunities for growth  which makes companies less willing to pay out dividends 
However  Cisco is a clear exception because of its large size and mature rate of growth  The company is generating more cash flow than it can profitably reinvest  which allows management to shower higher dividends on shareholders 
Cisco s dividend payment is extremely safe  While the company s track record of paying and growing dividends isn t as long as some of my other favorite dividend stocks  Cisco s dividend scores very well for safety and growth 
The company s low payout ratios  consistent free cash flow generation  hoard of cash  mission critical products  and stable sales and earnings growth all make Cisco a safe bet for dividend growth investors ",2016-08-01,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-cisco's-dividend-payment-safe-200145345,200145345

	IBM continues to reel under the effects of a painfully long drawn business transition that has been wreaking havoc on sales and profitability  Sales have now shrunk for 17 straight quarters  IBM has been moving away from its traditional businesses to newer  read lucrative  business avenues like cloud and data analytics  Though IBM s Strategic Imperatives are performing well  these are not enough to make up for the weakness in its traditional business yet 

Segment Details

	From the first quarter  the company has changed its reporting segments to provide a better insight into its strategic imperatives performance  The company s new segments are as follows 

	Cognitive Solutions  solutions software and transaction processing software  revenues grew 3 5  year over year to  4 7 billion  IBM reported that Software solutions registered strong growth of 6   driven primarily by analytics and security  Cloud was up an impressive 54   Acquisitions continue to cushion growth 

	Revenues from Technology Services and Cloud Platforms  includes infrastructure services  technical support services  integration software  fell 0 5  to  8 9 billion  Segmental revenues pertaining to Strategic Imperatives grew 35

INTL BUS MACH Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise




   


Guidance

For 2016  the company continues to projects non GAAP earnings to be around  13 50  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at  13 50  Also  the company continues to expect to generate free cash flow at the higher end of the earlier expected range of  11 to  12 billion 

Our Take

	IBM is having a tough time  given the ongoing and heavily time consuming business model transition to cloud  Further  sluggish IT spending particularly on on premise and data center hardware and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns Also  intensifying competition in the industry is a major headwind 

	Nevertheless  IBM s strategic growth initiatives  including its Big Data   business analytics  cloud computing  mobile and social business are expected to drive growth  Reportedly  IBM estimates SoftLayer to generate  1 billion in revenues in 2016  SoftLayer is the primary infrastructure of IBM s cloud operations 

	In addition  IBM s policy of making strategic acquisitions  it has acquired over 150 companies since 2000  will lead to incremental revenues  strengthening its technology leadership and resulting in a more favorable mix of business  The acquisitions have also increased its scale of operations globally  This year IBM has made 11 acquisitions so far  worth over  5 billion  which include Bluewolf Group  Resilient Systems  Truven Health Analytics  Optevia and The Weather Company s B2B  mobile and cloud based web properties  Strong cash flow generation is expected to provide the financial flexibility required for strategic investments in achanging business environment 

	IBM has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Better ranked tech stocks include MeetMe  Inc   Match Group  NASDAQ MTCH   Inc  and Blucora  Inc   MeetMe has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  while Match Group and Blucora are Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks

Investors who are long the stock will need management to announce more positive developments if they want to see shares prices continue their upward trend 
IBM shareholders welcomed the Truven acquisition  even though the company paid a hefty 35x EBITDA multiple  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  followed the acquisition announcement by upgrading the stock to  Overweight  and set a price target of  140 
Now with the stock trading above  155  investors should be cautious ahead of earnings as the company s financial performance has been anything but stellar  IBM s Q1 16  of  3 298 million fell to its lowest level since Q1 03   yes  2003 The chart below highlights IBM s earnings surprises over the last four quarters 

It s not wise to rely solely on  because this metric can easily be distorted  For example  IBM s Q1 16 net income benefited from a  95  tax rate due to a tax refund   not indicative of the company s true underlying earnings  Now notice the lackluster EBITDA performance which is a good proxy for calculating the true underlying cash flows of a company 
Wall Street expects IBM s Q2 16 revenues to reach just over  20 billion   4  growth   and EBITDA to be  4 775 million   3  growth YoY   Using the Street s consensus forecast into various valuation models  shown in the image below  highlights a  of  153 per share  implying little margin of safety 

Shares of IBM have rebounded from its 5 year February low even as the company reported its worst quarterly EBITDA figure since 2003  The recent financial woes will need to change quickly for prices to remain at current levels  Look to the earnings announcement on July 18th to provide a signal ",2016-07-12,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-ibm-continue-its-rebound-look-to-earnings-200141413,200141413

176390,397906,IBM,IBM May Be Knocking On The Rally s Door,opinion,"IBM  NYSE IBM  has had a wild ride since its Watson artificial technology made a big splash on Jeopardy back in 2011  After that victory  IBM embarked on a long  downward trajectory that lasted until February 2016  After a minimal bounce it settled into a range again in April 
And it looks like that range has persisted to this day    until you take a closer look  which reveals that IBM has made a series of higher highs since May against a stable low  a broadening wedge   Many think this is a bearish reversal pattern  But the fact is that its range can resolve either to the down or upside  And the preponderance of evidence today points to the upside 

Monday s chart shows that expanding wedge with price at the top  It also shows the Bollinger Bands  giving some room higher  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising  And the MACD is crossed up and rising  A pattern break here would look for a move up to 169 or so  There is also a gap to fill to 172 above  And the Measured move would target about 168

176440,397956,IBM,Buffett Wishes He Could But These Stocks,opinion,"Do you know why Warren Buffett recently added to his position position in International Business Machines Corp  NYSE IBM NYSE  and The Kraft Heinz Co  KHC NYSE  and has long held a position in behemoth Wal Mart Stores Inc   NYSE WMT NYSE   In the latter case  it s not because the world s largest retailer is an untold secret  or growing earnings at 35  annually  it s not   or because Buffett got a sweetheart deal  he didn t   It s simple  Buffett bought more shares in International Business Machines Corp  IBM NYSE  and The Kraft Heinz Co  KHC NYSE  because they are really  really big 
Yes  Wall Mart is a solid company  But the law of large numbers tells us it is far more difficult to double profits from  15 billion than from a base of  1   5  or even  17 million  Perhaps that is one reason he has been trimming his position of late 
For Buffett  bigger is better
Toward the beginning of Buffett s investing career  it wasn t uncommon for the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha to post 30  or 40  annual returns in Berkshire Hathaway s  BRK B NYSE   equity portfolio  But as the size of the capital base at Buffett s disposal grew larger  those stock returns began to shrink   We do need to deploy cash  but we can t put many billions to work every year in spectacular businesses   Buffett said   To move the needle at Berkshire  they have to be big transactions  
In the aftermath of the 2009 and in recent years  Buffett s biggest investments were in blue chip behemoths like Johnson   Johnson  NYSE  NYSE JNJ    Wal Mart  WMT NYSE    and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC NYSE   
Those were all solid investment in great companies  to be sure  but it is unlikely they will propel Buffett s portfolio to those 40  annual returns he generated in the past  And they certainly won t help Buffett realize the 50  annual returns he famously stated he could achieve if he had less money to invest   and could invest in great small cap stocks 
 Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling  The highest rates of return I ve ever achieved were in the 1950s  I killed the Dow  You ought to see the numbers  But I was investing peanuts then  It s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money  I think I could make you 50  a year on  1 million  No  I know I could  I guarantee that     Warren Buffet
Unfortunately  Buffett understands his predicament all too well   Size is always a problem   Buffett told The Wall Street Journal s Jason Zweig   With tiny sums  to invest   it s extraordinary what you can find  Most of the time  big sums are one hell of an anchor  
Anchors aweight 
So what would Buffett buy if he weren t relegated to the realm of blue chips  We think he d be scooping up shares of great small cap stocks  After all  they have historically outperformed large cap stocks   a gap that has widened over the past 35 years 
Undoubtedly  Buffett could get these higher returns   and better  Unfortunately  it s impossible for him to buy small cap stocks  But before we get to why Buffett can t buy small caps  let s look at why small caps outperform in the first place 
Massive potential returns 
By definition  smaller companies have much more room to grow  With annual revenue of about US 482 billion  Wal Mart probably won t be tripling that number anytime soon  The relatively tiny independent auto repair shop operator  Boyd Group Income Fund  BYD UN TSX   BFGIF US OTC  US 57 59 on the other hand  one of the longest standing stocks on KeyStone s Focus BUY List  has more than quadrupled its revenue over the past 8 years  increased earnings by more than 6 times  and its stock price skyrocketed as a result 
For comparison purposes  below we see that Wal Mart was a decent buy in 2008 as the financial crisis hit and its shares traded in the  55 range  Over the past 8 5 years the stock has returned around 52  including dividends 
But the Small Cap s gains are astonishing over the same period  The Boyd Group and its simple car repair business which was recommended to KeyStone s Premium Small Cap Research clients in November of 2008 at  2 30  has seen it shares rocket to recently close at CDN 73 30  In fact  over that period the company has created such strong cash flow it has distributed over CDN 3 00 per share in distributions  dividends  to shareholders on top of the tremendous share price gains  Again it has paid us CDN 3 00 in cash and we bought the shares for CDN 2 30 
On top of their room to grow  small caps don t attract much attention from Wall   Bay Street analysts  In fact  in 2008  KeyStone was the only research firm covering the Boyd Group  This means savvy investors are more likely to find mispriced stocks when fishing in small cap waters  It appears that Bay Street is finally beginning to catch on to the Boyd Group story  but there are still dozens of compelling small cap companies monitored by just one or two analysts or zero   and many more that receive no analyst coverage at all 
Size Matters
So why doesn t Buffett buy underfollowed small cap stocks that could very well triple  It s simple  He can t 
Let s revisit Buffett s quote from earlier in the article   We can t put many billions to work every year in spectacular businesses   Buffett said   To move the needle at Berkshire  they have to be big transactions  
Even after the Boyd Group had seen its  share price rocket over 30 fold over the past eight years  its market cap is is barely US 1 billion  Only about  2 million worth of stock trades hands each day  Buffett couldn t buy a stake in the company without driving the share price up significantly  And even if he were to buy the company outright  that  1 billion purchase would barely register in Berkshire  US 130 billion investment portfolio 
In other words  researching a small cap company like the Boyd Group  no matter how promising its prospects  simply isn t worth Buffett s time 
But it s definitely worth our time
Individuals who invest dollar amounts in the thousands  however  should be scouring the markets every day for the next Boyd Group  It s the only way to even approach those 30  or 40  annual returns 
But be forewarned  Just because a company is small and underfollowed does not guarantee Boyd Group  like returns 
That s why in addition to great growth prospects and limited  or no   analyst coverage  our team of experts at KeyStone s Small Cap Research seeks out small caps that have 
A strong balance sheet
Positive cash flow
Attractive Valuations
Potential for a dividend  or dividend increase 
A management team with a significant share ownership 
A business we can understand 
Operations in relatively safe jurisdictions 
A positive industry outlook or niche outlook 
Potential for hidden assets
Market beating potential over the next three to five years 
Unknown  Profitable Small Cap BUY Under  4 00  Great Balance Sheet   Great Software Margins   Growth
In fact we just published research today on on a growing  cash rich NYSE listed software company with over a quarter of its value in cash and no debt 
A recent quarterly earnings miss pushed the shared to correct 20    we view this as a long term opportunity for this profitable  cash producing software business with 90   customer retention rates that trades at half the value of its peers 
Our client are buying shares today and the stock is up 10   but still offers good long term value and growth rates in the range of 20 25  over the next 3 5 years 
Plus  this little software firm pays a dividend 
And it trades for under  4 00

176487,398003,IBM,IBM dismisses Forbes report of massive layoffs,news," Reuters    IBM  N IBM  dismissed on Monday a Forbes magazine report claiming the technology firm is preparing to cut about 26 percent of its workforce  which would represent its biggest ever layoffs 
IBM is cutting jobs  as disclosed in its latest earnings report last week  but those reductions will affect  several thousand  employees  a  small fraction  of what Forbes reported  according to an emailed statement from IBM to Reuters  Forbes had said as many as 112 000 employees could be laid off 
The technology giant has been steadily reshaping its 400 000 plus staff for several years  laying off workers in some areas and hiring in new growth businesses 
A report last Thursday on Forbes  website by pseudonymous Silicon Valley technology gossip columnist Robert Cringely said IBM planned to break with that gradual approach and suddenly lay off 26 percent of its global workforce 
IBM did not issue a categorical denial of the report  but strongly suggested it was inaccurate 
 IBM does not comment on rumors  even ridiculous or baseless ones   the company said in the email   If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements  or had simply asked us  they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a  600 million charge for workforce rebalancing  This equates to several thousand people  a small fraction of what s been reported  
Last week  Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told investors on IBM s fourth quarter earnings conference call that the company was taking restructuring charges of around  580 million  but he did not specify the number of jobs affected 
 We are not going to replicate the same level of restructuring that we had last year   Schroeter said in response to a Wall Street analyst s question   It will be a lower amount  
IBM does not disclose the amount of layoffs it makes each year  but one Wall Street analyst estimated that this year s restructuring charge suggests about 8 000 people  in line with recent years 
 For each of the last seven years  IBM has taken annual restructuring charges of between about  450 million and  1 5 billion  which we estimated have resulted in workforce reductions of between 6 500 and 21 500 per year   Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients on Monday  He said the Forbes report was  puzzling  
IBM said it had 431 212 employees at the end of 2013  slightly down from 434 246 employees in 2012  The company has not yet disclosed its overall employee headcount for the end of 2014

However  in contrast to the oil shocks that occurred from 1973 1974  or during 1979  1980  1990 and 2003 2004  the current sharp drop in oil prices is conveying benefits to the average worker who has been struggling to see a real increase in wages  according to Chad Morganlander  portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors   With the average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline near  2 55 last week  the sudden fall in energy prices positively affects consumers  income and increases spending   Morganlander said in a note to clients Monday

 Fewer people bought homes last month despite interest rates being at their lowest levels of the year   Lawrence Yun  NAR chief economist  said in the report   The stock market swings in October may have impacted some consumers  psyches and therefore led to fewer November closings  Furthermore  rising home values are causing more investors to retreat from the market  
The report also showed the median existing home price for all housing types last month was  205 300  5 percent higher from a year ago  which marks the 33rd consecutive month of year over year price gains

176542,398058,IBM,U S  corporations winning fight over human rights lawsuits,news,"By Lawrence Hurley  WASHINGTON  Reuters    A landmark U S  Supreme Court decision in 2013 that made it all but impossible to sue foreign companies in U S  courts for alleged roles in overseas human rights abuses is proving to be a boon for U S  firms too  court documents show   In the roughly year and a half since the ruling in Kiobel v  Royal Dutch Petroleum Co  U S  companies such as Chiquita Brands International Inc  N CQB   IBM Corp  N IBM  and Ford Motor Co  N F  have successfully invoked the Supreme Court s reasoning to fend off lawsuits alleging they were involved in human rights abuses in South Africa  Colombia and elsewhere   In the seven cases involving U S  companies that federal appeals courts have decided since the Supreme Court rulings  corporate defendants have won five  according to a Reuters review of the court documents  Only one ruling was an outright win for plaintiffs   A similar pattern has played out in lower courts  with judges citing the Kiobel decision in favor of defendants in seven of eight human rights cases involving U S  companies that have been decided since the ruling  With rulings tending to favor companies  human rights lawyers are thinking twice before filing new lawsuits  The Reuters review shows only one new human rights lawsuit filed against a U S  company since the ruling came down in April 2013  In the 1990s and 2000s  up to half a dozen cases were filed every year against U S  or foreign corporations   Paul Hoffman  a leading Venice  California based human rights lawyer who argued Kiobel for the plaintiffs  said he has been fighting to keep his existing cases alive rather than planning new ones  He has been presenting legal arguments explaining why the Supreme Court decision does not mean his lawsuits should be dismissed    People are waiting to see what the landscape is going to look like   he said   Lawyers on both sides of the issue say the Supreme Court might yet have to take another case to clarify exactly when U S  companies can be sued   TORTURE  MURDER  In the Kiobel case  the court unanimously threw out a lawsuit by 12 people from Nigeria that accused British and Dutch based Royal Dutch Shell Plc  L RDSa  of aiding state sponsored torture and murder   The court said the law under which the Nigerians brought the case  the 1789 Alien Tort Statute  was presumed to cover only violations of international law occurring in the United States  Violations elsewhere  Chief Justice John Roberts wrote  must  touch and concern  U S  territory  with sufficient force to displace the presumption    Before the Kiobel ruling in April 2013  the law had been the primary vehicle for bringing human rights cases for more than 30 years  not just in the United States but globally    Human rights litigators have lost a significant weapon   said John Bellinger  a Washington based lawyer at the Arnold   Porter law firm who has played a prominent role advocating for corporate defendants  Bellinger was the top legal adviser to the U S  State Department under President George W  Bush when it filed briefs in various cases arguing that the scope of the law should be pared back   OTHER OPTIONS  The Supreme Court ruling means human rights lawyers now have to look more seriously at alternative ways to seek redress for alleged abuses   Human rights lawyers can sue multinational companies in other countries  which has happened in Canada  the United Kingdom  and a handful of other countries  but that option is usually only viable if the defendant is based in one of those countries  Bringing suit in a developing country where alleged violations occurred is often less appealing to plaintiffs  as such countries often have troubled judicial systems   In theory  some of the major cases against U S  companies filed before the Supreme Court ruling could go ahead on other grounds because the lawsuits cite other legal claims   There is also the possibility that alleged human rights victims could sue companies in U S  state courts  under common law theories of wrongdoing such as assault and battery  But that too has its drawbacks for plaintiffs  including a shorter window in which to file lawsuits  which are often based on alleged conduct that doesn t come to light until years after it occurs   Also  lawyers on both sides say such cases would lack the headline grabbing punch of a case filed under the Alien Tort Statute alleging human rights violations   A limited number of Alien Tort Statute cases could still move forward in the United States even under the new restrictive interpretation   In the one clear victory for plaintiffs since the Supreme Court ruling  an appeals court in Virginia said in June that Iraqi nationals who complained of mistreatment at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad could sue a subsidiary of U S  based CACI International Inc  N CACI   a military contractor that worked at the site   
Judge Barbara Keenan wrote that the plaintiffs had alleged sufficient connection to the United States to  require a different result than that reached in Kiobel      Reporting by Lawrence Hurley  Editing by Amy Stevens and Ross Colvin ",2014-12-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-corporations-winning-fight-over-human-rights-lawsuits-319980,319980

Healthcare stocks fell on Friday as investors sold for profits locking in several sessions of gains  which brought broader stock indices lower on Friday  though losses were limited 
Data released earlier revealed an uptick in retail sales and consumer sentiment  a sign that falling oil prices have brought down gasoline prices to the point that individuals and families may be seeing more discretionary income

Oil prices rose on Friday amid talk that OPEC countries may trim output at their November meeting  though they still remain subdued  moving off four year lows earlier Friday 
Oil ministers from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have recently resisted calls to lower production  while Libya  Venezuela and Ecuador have asked for action to prevent further price declines 
The 12 member oil cartel is scheduled to meet in Vienna on Nov  27 to discuss whether to adjust their production target for 2015 
Saudi Arabia has hinted at a willingness to let prices slide on the presumed expectations that U S  shale producers will halt operations as a result  as such production costs more than traditional drilling 
Once U S  shale producers table their operations for profitability reason  prices would presumably rise as the global economy absorbs excess supply 
By Friday  sentiments that prices may be falling too low for even Saudi Arabia sparked talk of a possible OPEC move to shore up prices  which boosted oil prices  though they still remain low from a longer term view 
The International Energy Agency reported earlier that prices could slump even further in 2015

176555,398071,IBM,Shell wins India tax case,news,"MUMBAI  Reuters    The Bombay High Court on Tuesday ruled in favor of the Indian unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc in a multi million dollar tax dispute  the latest verdict against the tax department that has been vigorously pursing claims against foreign firms in India 
Shell  L RDSa  had challenged the largest ever claim in an Indian tax case related to transfer pricing    the value at which companies trade products  services or assets between units across borders  a regular part of doing business for a multinational 
A rash of high value tax claims on foreign firms including IBM Corp  N IBM  and Nokia Oyj  HE NOK1V  in the past year has sparked criticism that overly zealous tax authorities could undermine foreign investment in India 
In the Shell case  the tax office alleged in February last year that the company s Indian unit under priced shares transferred to the parent by about  2 5 billion  1 59 billion pounds   demanding tax on the interest the Anglo Dutch oil company would have earned 
It did not disclose the value of the claim 
The Bombay High Court favored Shell on the grounds that issuance of shares by an Indian company to its foreign parent was not taxable under the transfer pricing provisions  said Mukesh Butani  a lawyer for Shell India in the case 
The court felt the tax department  clearly exceeded its jurisdiction   Butani  who is managing partner of Indian law firm BMR Legal  said in a statement 
Tax department officials in Mumbai were not immediately available for a comment on the court verdict  It was not immediately known if the department would approach a higher court to challenge the verdict 
Shell India welcomed the Bombay High Court decision 
 This is a positive outcome which should provide a further boost to the Indian government s initiatives to improve the country s investment climate   Shell s Indian unit said in a statement 

Last month  an Indian court ruled in favor of Vodafone Group Plc  L VOD   the biggest foreign corporate investor in India  in a long running transfer pricing dispute with the local tax department

176574,398090,IBM,Bears Take A Leap Of Faith,opinion,"Technical Outlook 
SPX followed up with Friday s afternoon recovery with a bounce to the upside yesterday that saw price reclaim the 20 day moving average and stall out at the 5 day moving average  
Technically  very little improvement  On the 30 min chart of SPX  the rally simply took price straight into the neckline resistance of the head and shoulders pattern that has its roots back to mid April 
Volume on the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  yesterday was pathetic  Another red flag  There was no enthusiasm for the rally  and little participation as well 
SPY is looking at a significant gap down this morning  Don t put too much stock in it though  Of late  these have been major opportunities for the bulls to buy the dip and rally the market higher in the days that follow 
But if the bears can build on the day s weakness and drive the market lower  then you may very well have a change in the character of this market 
There really hasn t been any significant sell offs of late  minus the price action from 4 28  Most of the selling gets bought up before the end of the trading session  thereby limiting the scope of the downside 
VIX was absolutely crushed yesterday  dropping 6 5  down to 14 63 and feeling the rejection at the base breakout at its highs of the day 
Last week marked the first time in eleven weeks where SPX finished below the previous week s trading lows 
Yesterday officially kicks off the  Sell in May  Go Away  theory  Last year the market peaked in May before trending lower the rest of the year 
Historically the May through October time frame is much weaker than the rest of the year 
It is very important to be aware of the potential for a strong pullback here and to manage your long position risk accordingly 
Yellen s dovish outlook as it pertains to rate hikes has been  in large part  the reason for the massive rally off of the February lows

 They need to narrow their focus  get their A game on  and any distractions from a core business perspective  such as this deal  need to be put in the rear view mirror   FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives told Reuters 
 From an IBM and investor perspective  it takes one troubled area out of the core franchise  
IBM has been reducing its presence in the hardware industry  The company completed its  2 1 billion sale of the x86 server business to Lenovo Group Ltd  HK 0992  earlier this month 
In 2005  Lenovo acquired IBM s consumer PC laptop business for  1 25 billion 
The business being sold focuses on chip design and manufacturing and is housed in the company s systems and technology unit  which accounted for about 11 percent of total sales in the third quarter 
Silicon Valley based Globalfoundries said it would take over IBM s manufacturing operations in East Fishkill  New York and Essex Junction  Vermont  and offer jobs to substantially all IBM employees affected by the deal 
Globalfoundries Chief Executive Sanjay Jha said the company would invest  10 billion between 2014 and 2015 to develop 10 nanometer  14 nanometer and radio frequency technologies 
 As  IBM s  assets become part of Globalfoundries  they will benefit from the scale   Jha  the former CEO of Motorola Mobility  told Reuters 
Globalfoundries is owned by the Mubadala Development Co  the Abu Dhabi government s investment fund 

The deal is expected close in 2015

176597,398113,IBM,Fed Doesn t Budge On Rates,opinion,"The long awaited move towards higher rates still isn t happening any time soon as we heard from our fearless leader  Ms  Yellen  who said that rates will be data dependent  We ve heard that line month after month  and what it really means is she s not going to be raising rates any time soon  She doesn t want to spoil the good tidings she has created with her actions over the past several years  which started with fed Bernanke  Keep the ship moving along by keeping rates low enough not to offer any alternatives for folks  So today there were folks out there who thought she would change to a more hawkish stance regarding rates  but they were once again let down by her ruling of  forget about it  it s not happening any time soon  speech  You get the feeling she wants to do it  but you know her hands are tied 
Normalizing rates would be spectacular  but why bother when she doesn t have to  Keep things as they are  Now we get some truth handed to us  The market moved up and down as the announcement came out  It steadily moved higher as the day wore on  Then in the last fifteen minutes it fell back down some  but the S P 500 and Dow closed higher while the big laggard  the Nasdaq  fell decently for the day  Will the market try once again to make it through 2116  or will it crumble from here  Has the market had enough of trying higher based on this nonsense by the fed  or will it continue to celebrate the no alternative way of playing  I haven t a clue  but  thus far  her actions have led to a market trying to maintain price  and slowly but surely work its way higher  The next few days are critical  so we ll know more soon  Buckle up as things get very interesting from here 
Earnings have been poor this quarter  but if you play the market long enough you begin to recognize that earnings are the least important aspect of whether a market moves higher  even though the majority of folks feel otherwise  Markets don t really move on earnings  They move on current economic conditions as well as future economic conditions  or they move on perception  such as we ve seen for many years now  They can also move on whether there are really any other solid alternatives  If you study P E s and relate them to stock price  it ll become very clear that true earnings have next to nothing to do with market movement  In a bull market bad reports are often forgiven over time 
What falls hard short term will recover weeks down the road  International Business Machines Corporation  NYSE IBM  took almost no time at all  even though they had a horrible report  Others can take a few months  but ultimately they are forgiven  Earnings rarely match the truth of stock market movement  You need to look much deeper as to what really moves a market  This bull entirely moved by fed actions  not earnings  That has never been more obvious than it is now  but really most of this seven year bull has been this way  Most bull markets are  So don t waste too much time trying to understand why this market is moving higher in to mostly bad reports  It s not earnings  It s fed action and fed action only  If you use your head  you ll be sorely disappointed  Earnings and stock market prices are rarely in step 
Now we watch two key pivot points on the S P 500 for further understanding about what s next up for this market short term to medium term  If we can close over 2116  we should then make a quick run towards the old high at 2134  If we lose 2070  things can get nasty quite fast for the bulls  So much support comes at that level from gap  horizontal support and trend line  The bears would score a major victory if they can take out 2070  So that s the only game in town  S P 500 2070 and S P 500 2116

176617,398133,IBM,Oracle s Ellison took smaller pay package in fiscal 2014,news," Reuters    Oracle Corp s   N ORCL  Larry Ellison  who is stepping aside as chief executive officer  took less money home in fiscal 2014 that the year before following criticism of his compensation and concerns about the software company s struggles against smaller rivals 
Ellison received  67 3 million as compensation in 2014  a 15 5 percent drop from a year earlier  according to a filing with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission 
Oracle surprised Wall Street last week with the announcement that Ellison  who the cofounded the company four decades ago and owns a quarter of it  would be replaced by Presidents Safra Catz and Mark Hurd 
Compensation for Catz and Hurd stood at  37 7 million each for the fiscal year ended May 2014  also less than in the previous year  according to the filing 
For fiscal 2015  Oracle is reducing the number of stock options granted to the three senior executives and introducing performance stock units  which will be awarded based on Oracle s success against rivals including SAP and IBM  N IBM  
Ellison  whose 2013 compensation was  79 6 million  will take over as executive chairman and chief technology officer 
In recent years  some investors have opposed Ellison s pay packages  complaining that the world s fifth richest man makes too much money as his company struggles 
While Ellison  Catz and Hurd took home less total pay last year  their stock options and other incentives are still generous  said Michael Pryce Jones  an analyst at CtW Investment Group  which advises union pension funds and has been a critic of Ellison s compensation 
 Careful scrutiny and caution are warranted because we re still looking at awards with huge economic value  You ve got Catz and Hurd on a huge number and Ellison hasn t taken a huge dip either   Pryce Jones said 
Oracle s compensation committee reduced Ellison s stock option awards for 2015 to 2 25 million shares from 7 million shares in fiscal 2014  the filing showed 
Catz and Hurd were granted a special one time stock option award for 500 000 shares each  taking the options for 2015 to 2 75 million shares each  down from 5 million the year before 
Last year  a  majority of shareholders opposed Ellison s pay in a non binding vote  While the voting result requires no changes from the company  it underscored concern among shareholders about high pay as the company struggles to fend off smaller  aggressive companies offering software and Internet based products at prices that often undercut Oracle 
 The issues remain the same  Oracle has misexecuted and shown disappointing numbers to the street for the better part of the last few years   said FBR analyst Daniel Ives 

In fiscal 2014 Ellison collected a salary of  1  with the rest of his compensation coming mostly from stock options

However  in the battle for positive reporting  Bloomberg reports  
Curiously  when I click on that link  I see this headline   IBM Earnings Show It s Still Struggling With New Product Growth  

IBM reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts  estimates  though a first time breakdown of sales of newer offerings showed that growth in those areas still isn t increasing fast enough to make up for a long decline in traditional products 
Adjusted earnings  excluding some items  fell 19 percent from a year earlier to  2 35 a share  International Business Machines said in a statement Monday  Analysts estimated  2 09 on average  Sales fell 4 6 percent  dropping for the 16th consecutive quarter  to  18 7 billion  compared with the average analyst estimate of  18 2 billion  Currency dragged on revenue by less than three percentage points  while the Armonk  New York based company had previously forecast a three to four percentage point impact 
IBM received a tax refund in the first quarter of more than  1 billion  which Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter had said was already factored into the full year earnings forecast of at least  13 50 a share 
The tax benefit will be fully absorbed by costs incurred due to job cuts 

Four Year Turn Around

Instead of changing the title as Bloomberg did  the Journal simply offered this subtitle   Still  adjusted per share profit rises above analysts  expectations  

International Business Machines Corp  s Virginia Rometty is still looking for a sales turnaround more than four years into her tenure as chief executive 
The Armonk  N Y   company on Monday reported first quarter revenue of  18 68 billion  down 4 6  as the company s products have become increasingly under threat by the move to computing services delivered over the Internet  The company has now posted revenue declines for four years straight

176632,398148,IBM,Ford  IBM win dismissal of 12 year lawsuit over apartheid abuses,news,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters    A Manhattan federal judge has dismissed a 12 year old lawsuit accusing Ford Motor Co  N F  and IBM Corp  N IBM  of encouraging human rights abuses in apartheid era South Africa  reluctantly concluding that the case does not belong in U S  courts 
U S  District Judge Shira Scheindlin on Thursday said the black South Africans who brought the case did not show  relevant conduct  by Ford and IBM within the United States to justify holding the companies liable 
The plaintiffs had accused Ford  IBM and other companies of having between the 1970s and early 1990s aided South Africa s former apartheid government in abuses such as killings and torture  by having made military vehicles and computers for government security forces 
 That these plaintiffs are left without relief in an American court is regrettable   Scheindlin wrote   But I am bound to follow  legal precedent   no matter what my personal view of the law may be  
The case had been brought under the Alien Tort Statute  a 1789 law that lets non U S  citizens pursue some cases in U S  courts over alleged violations of international law 
In April 2013  the U S  Supreme Court said that law was presumed to cover only violations in the United States  or violations elsewhere that  touch and concern  U S  territory  with sufficient force  
Four months later  the federal appeals court in Manhattan applied that holding  and said the Ford and IBM cases should be dismissed altogether 
In April  Scheindlin nonetheless gave the plaintiffs one more chance  to meet the new standards imposed by those higher courts 
But in Thursday s decision  she said the bar proved too high  and that any alleged international law violations were by Ford s and IBM s South African units  and occurred abroad 
 It has been 12 years  We re really disappointed  devastated by the decision   said Diane Sammons  a partner at Nagel Rice in Roseland  New Jersey  who represents some plaintiffs 
 The end result of the ruling is that corporations can act abroad with impunity  even if they re totally controlling the activities of their foreign subsidiaries   she added   I don t think the Supreme Court s decision was that narrowly defined  
She said the plaintiffs had not decided whether to appeal 
Jonathan Hacker  an O Melveny   Myers partner who represents Ford  did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Keith Hummel  a Cravath  Swaine   Moore partner who represents IBM  did not immediately respond to similar requests 
Germany s Daimler AG  DE DAIGn  and Rheinmetall AG  DE RHMG  were dismissed as defendants in December

176635,398151,IBM,The Coming Debacle Will Be Magnified By Derivatives Causing Banks,opinion,"Gold and silver markets showed serious disrespect to Janet Yellen while she was speaking on  monetary policy  Wednesday on CNBC  I couldn t say exactly what happened  but I liked it 

This was particularly impressive as the usual suspects have been continually flooding the market with promises to deliver gold they neither have nor could possibly obtain  As seen below  since January 25th they ve been flooding the COMEX with an additional 108 285 gold contracts  Blue Plot   Each contract promises to deliver 100 ounces of gold  so actually we are seeing the supply of fictional gold increase by 10 825 500 ounces  Seeing an actual risein the price of gold under the onslaught of this massive fictitious supply increase  Red Plot  is remarkable 

Gold and its step sum are still behaving bullishly  Seeing gold s step sum  Red Plot below  beginning to turn down as its price  Blue Plot  holds firm is a very positive sign  Remember  the step sum is just market sentiment  while the price action is market reality  A littlefear of rising prices after the past four and a half years of blatant market manipulation is only to be expected 

I really like gold s Bear s Eye View  BEV  chart below showing its 1999 2016 bull market   and yes gold is still in a bull market  It highlights the gargantuan effort by the  policy makers  to contain the price of gold since August 2011  However since its December 2nd low  BEV  44 24     1 053   it s recouped  209 as of Wednesday  11 BEV points   It goes without saying that for the bulls this means little if this doesn t continue 
But the main policy tool used in suppressing the price of gold and silver is the banking system  The hand these banks are playing is clearly a bluff on being bearish on the price of gold and silver  This is made clear by the banks  deteriorating financial positions over the past few decades  How many times has the US Government bailed them out since 1987  Three by my count with a fourth pending  The big banks are insanely leveraged in positions that will one day prove to be foolish speculation  I can t say exactly when gold will take off but one day it will and you ll be glad to be holding some  as well as silver  when it does 
That said  so far the recent advance in gold looks really impressive  and should it correct back to its BEV  37 5  line   1 180  after the gain we ve seen below  it wouldn t be a cause of concern  Personally I d hate to see that happen  but just look at the BEV plot from 1999 to present  Over the past seventeen years when has the price of gold evergone up so far and fast as it has since early December without a correction  If the price of gold continues advancing as it has for the past three months  it maybe an indication of a volcanic price event building  However it s still too early to be predicting that  We d first need a rumor of a momentous event  something like a major Wall Street house to fail or being bailed out before I d begin to think along those lines 

The Dow Jones is doing better than I was expecting  It s approaching its last all time high of last May without much of a pause 

However I still have to wonder exactly why the Dow Jones is rising so briskly  Looking at the rising Inventory to Sales Ratio below  there is good reason to expect a market downturn in the not too distant future  And since 1986 each time the ratio has risen the banking system found itself in need of help from their friends in Washington 

Looking at the Dow Jones  BEV chart below we see it broke above its BEV  5  line this week and is now approaching its  2 50  line  Last time it broke above the  2 5  line was this past November and the bears used that as an opportunity to sell into market strength  The one thing to keep in mind is that since its lows of February 11th the Dow Jones has advanced 1 942 points for a gain of 12 42  in only twenty six trading days 
This market action is unlikely to be repeated again over the next twenty six trading days  so at this point both bulls and bears are now expecting a market correction  The difference is that the bulls are expecting to see the Dow Jones resume its advance to new all time highs after the correction  while the bears are expecting the correction to result in a decline deeper than its February 11th low  It s hard to predict what will happen  with the massive manipulation we ve come to expect over the past few years  but if forced to guess I would have to side with the bears 

Since their 13 Dec 1937 issue Barron s had published market averages for basic stock groups  the Barron s Stock Averages  BSA   Over the following fifty years the BSA has changed along with the markets  For example I ve included the Television Average in the list below  but actually the television average only began to be included in Barron s 04 April 1949 issue  By the time Barron s discontinued this data series in October 1988 there were few  if any television manufacturers trading on the NYSE  This is to be expected as financial markets evolve with the economy  When Barron s first began publishing the Dow Jones Total Market Groups  DJTMG   the week after their 17 Oct 1988 issue  it had two separate categories for computers  one including and one without IBM  NYSE IBM   Today the DJTMG doesn t list computers at all  but publishes a separate digital equipment index 

With the sole exception of the gold mining average  relabeled the Barron s Gold Mining Index  BGMI  the BSA was discontinued  I don t blame Barron s  the economy as described by the stock market had been altered beyond recognition over the fifty years spanning 1938 to 1988  Back in 1938 high tech consisted of Radio Corporation of America  RCA  and rail road equipment  steam locomotives  was still a widely held stock sector  Neither was true by October 1988  but its bank stock average can still be useful when stitched together with the data from the DJTMG  which I ve plotted below 
From 1938 through 1978  chart insert  banking stocks were anything but glamorous  Great Depression era banking legislation  Glass Steagall  saw to that  Banks were for taking deposits and making short term commercial loans  Banking wasn t sexy  but it was profitable for all concerned  All that changed after the US dollar was  liberated  from its Bretton Wood s  35 gold peg in 1971  and after the repeal of Glass Steagall during the Clinton Administration 

Butlong before 1971 the  35 gold peg had already become a joke  By the time Professor W H  Hutt said the following  the US Treasury had already issued more than 100 paper dollars for each ounce of monetary gold it held in reserves 

 How can businessmen coordinate the private sector of the economy effectively when the most important measuring rod of all  the monetary unit has been left with no reliable defined value  Units of length  volume  and weight have been universally defined with meticulous care  but dollars  lire  francs and pounds have been allowed to change in every significant attribute over time      The technique of inflation demands that governments and their agencies shall continuously deceive the public about the fact  the speed and the duration of inflation intended  Ministers of finance have no option but to employ what has been called  the necessary untruth  

  Professor W H  Hutt  New Individualist Review  1966 Winter Issue
Note how back in 1966 it was widely accepted that the private sector was controlled by businessmen  not by academics at the Federal Reserve  However in the past fifty years these same academics at the Federal Reserve have now inflated the money supply by printing 5 400 paper dollars for each ounce of monetary gold held by the US Treasury  unverified since 1953   greatly diminishing the role of businessmen and wage earners in the economic life of America 
Beforethe 1970s future contracts were primarily used for hedging risks associated with agriculture  However even before the dollar was depegged from gold  monetary inflation was already creating instabilities in interest rates and bond yields  currencies and share prices  causing chaos in financial markets  In response to the instabilities created by inflationary money printing  futures exchanges were only too happy to offer future contracts  derivatives  on financial assets  interest rates and currencies to assist commerce in hedging risks introduced by the FOMC s inflationary monetary policy  It s painfully apparent that the worse academics and bankers became at managing  monetary policy   the more opportunity was created for big banks to generate revenue thereby increasing their annual bonuses 
Then Wall Street invented the Mother of All  Derivatives  interest rate swaps and credit default swaps  Barron s 19 August 1985 issue headlined interest rate swaps  the  150 Billion Baby  In truth they were a bit puzzled by them  Little did they suspect that twenty two years later these swaps and other types of derivatives would become ground zero in a market crash which began with sub prime mortgages  Currently the Bank of International Settlements  BIS  is reporting the notional value of all interest rate swaps at 320 TRILLION DOLLARS  an increase by three orders of magnitude  plus a double since 1985 
The sub prime mortgage debacle showed what these credit default swaps actually were  a fraudulent insurance scheme in which the underwriters accepted fees and premium payments  but failed to maintain the reserves necessary to honor their counterparty obligations  As it turned out the United States government  at the behest of Treasury Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke made good on these payments  costing taxpayers many trillions of dollars  People should have gone to prison for fraud  Instead Wall Street was able to pay out the expected end of year bonuses  Looking back at the banking chart above  it s obvious that since 2007 the game has changed 
From Barron s 1985 issue above through January 2007  banking stock index steadily increased from about 300 to more than 2 750  fueled largely with revenues generated bundling derivatives with financial assets for the purpose of  hedging risks  that for the most part didn t even exist prior to August 1971  From the January 2007 peak  the banking stock index crashed all the way down to 399 83  not far above where it had been in 1985 Since then banking stocks have recovered about half of their credit crisis losses  but have begun to decline again since last June 
Here s a Bear s Eye View chart of the banking average  I highlighted the span of time when gold was pegged at  35 an ounce  1938 71   a period when the banking stock average never declined more than 35  from a previous all time high on market downturns  Back in April 1942 the banks were down only 35 during a 52  Dow decline  that s a big difference  After 1971 the banking stocks began to experience evenlarger declines than the Dow Jones during times of market distress  Without a doubt  decoupling the dollar from gold and the Clinton era banking deregulation has greatly destabilized the banking system 

Below I ve taken a spread of the BEV data from the Banking Average and the Dow Jones from the attack on Pearl Harbor through the bottom of the 1937 42 bear market  The positive spread in the table illustrates the superior performance of the banking stock average during this bear market  when the banks declined just 35  from their last all time high compared to the Dow Jones 52  decline 

The following chart plots the BEV spread above from 1938 to present  Keep in mind this plot is constructed from BEV data  each new all time high is equal to 0 00   and never more  This means that the plot is only a comparison of declines banking stocks endured relative to the Dow Jones  Positive values indicate banking stocks have declined less than the Dow Jones from their respective all time high  negative values that banking stocks have declined more  and when the plot rests on the red 0 00  line  the banks and Dow Jones are equidistant  whatever that may be  from their last all time high 
The plot illustrates how banking shares have become more volatile relative to the general market  as defined by the Dow Jones  since the end of the Second World War  This is easily explained  During the Great Depression new legislation  Glass Steagall  and memories of the recent 1929 32 crash had put the Fear of God into bankers  They were content just making profits with their traditional functions of recycling dollars flowing between consumers and producers  employers and wage earners accepting deposits from savers and making loans to viable businesses 
However  after World War Two  inflationary monetary policy and banking deregulation made recycling monetary inflation into the financial markets  creating bull markets  and marketing derivatives by the hundreds of trillions to  hedge  the downside risks in these  bull markets  became Wall Street s mainline of business  Seeing the BEV spread crash to historic lows during and after the credit crisis is an indication of just how profound the current problems in banking must be 

That this metamorphosis in the banking industry was made under the supervision of Washington s political class and their market regulators best explains the establishment s current deranged reaction to the prospect of either Senator Ted Cruz or Donald Trump becoming the next President  They must fear the consequences of one of these strong willed outsiders appointing officials loyal to themselves   and not to the current clique now in control of Washington s financial and criminal investigating apparatus  to key positions in the Federal bureaucracy  Small wonder a number of supposedly  conservative  Republicans have publicly professed a preference for Hillary Clinton as our next president rather than Donald Trump 
All in all  there is far more reason to be bullish on gold and silver than on financial markets  This summer and autumn should prove to be interesting ",2016-03-20,Mark Lundeen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-coming-debacle-will-be-magnified-by-derivatives-causing-banks-200122211,200122211

Is it a good time to buy IBM 
The stock is cheap  trading at less than 10 times the earnings when the industry average is around 40  And  IBM s price to sales ratio is at 1 68  whereas the computer hardware industry s price to sales ratio is at 23 8 
I like to look at charts to see where the key support prices are  That gives me an idea of what the IBM stock has done in the past during similar price declines  IBM stock started to rally when there was a similar decline as the current decline in 2012 to 2013  Based on the Dylan Wave Theory and fundamental information  buying IBM stock between  130 and  135 is a good strategy 
 IBM is focused on long term growth goals  and these goals should start to pay off soon  For example  IBM s artificial intelligence computing system Watson requires training the system  a process that can take years  Watson is being used in a variety of industries  including healthcare and finance 
IBM s dividend yields are an attractive 3 71   and if the stock appreciates  40 in value that will be an impressive 32  gain  
The company has huge cash flow  and its Global Business Services  GBS  had a revenue increase of  8 billion  It has a service backlog of  121 billion  which is up 1  adjusting for currency 
One of the biggest issues for the company in 2015 was a strengthening US dollar  IBM is a global company  and the strength of the U S  dollar has translated into fewer U S  dollars over the course of the year  There are signs that the dollar is weakening  so without doing much IBM earnings should go up 
IBM continues to invest heavily in its profitable units  and at the same time turning around the non profitable units  I think IBM s strategy of long term thinking is about to pay off with at least a 32  gain when the stock rallies  40 ",2016-03-15,Michael Dylan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibm-32-potential-gain-200121622,200121622

Benjamin Durant  37  was charged with two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy  while Daryl Payton  38  was charged with three securities fraud counts and one conspiracy count 
Both were arrested during the morning  and later pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court  Their lawyers declined to comment following the arraignment 
Three people have already admitted to sharing and trading on secret information provided by a corporate lawyer working on IBM s purchase of software maker SPSS Inc in 2009 
The lawyer  who has not been charged  was identified in a related U S  Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit on Wednesday as Michael Dallas  a former associate at the New York law firm Cravath  Swaine   Moore 
IBM s full name is International Business Machines Corp  A Cravath spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment  nor did an employer listed for Dallas on his LinkedIn page  Dallas could not immediately be reached 
Authorities said Dallas shared information about the SPSS deal with his friend Trent Martin  an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC  LONDON RBS   who then told his roommate Thomas Conradt  who worked at Euro Pacific Capital Inc of Westport  Connecticut 
Prosecutors say Conradt and a trading colleague  David Weishaus  bought call options on SPSS before IBM s bid was announced  and Conradt tipped Durant and Payton 
Martin  Conradt and Weishaus pleaded guilty last year to charges related to the trades  and agreed to cooperate in the investigation 
Payton and Durant were also working for Euro Pacific at the time of the trading  according to public records kept by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority 
FINRA records show they left Euro Pacific at the same time the SEC informed the firm it was investigating them for options trades they made  The firm is not named in the indictment  which describes it as  Securities Trading Firm 1  
Andrew Schiff  director of marketing at Euro Pacific  said the firm cooperated in the investigation and has terminated employees who were implicated  He said the firm has received no indication from the SEC or FINRA that it might be a target 
According to the indictment  Durant said he had heard about SPSS while researching investment opportunities on Fidelity com  while Payton claimed to hear about the stock from Durant 
The men then refused to answer further questions about the trades and were fired  the indictment said 
The indictment also cited an unnamed co conspirator at Euro Capital who also bought options based on the inside information  resulting in a profit of  44 250  That person s identity could not be immediately determined

Tableau s early success comes as no surprise  as today s businesses are generating large sums of data that require seamless analysis  Tableau s model  which challenges conventional platforms  has led to its torrid growth  with the company beating revenue estimates each of the past 8 quarters 
This quarter  the Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 19 and revenue of  204 94  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a projected YoY increase in revenue of 44  but decrease in EPS of 51  
While Tableau is seeing early success  its products still lack the robustness to completely replace incumbent platforms  As the company continues to grow  it must work to displace more established competitors in addition to smaller contemporaries 


With a feature set not quite on par with established giants like Oracle  N ORCL  and IBM  N IBM   Tableau remains a helpful complement to incumbent systems but not robust enough to replace them  That said  the firm has an edge over established intelligence platforms in usability and data source compatibility

The People s Bank of China and the finance ministry are examining whether the country s commercial banks are too dependent on IBM  Bloomberg reported Tuesday  citing sources  adding that the findings will be submitted to a group on Internet security led by President Xi Jinping  China s move closely follows its exchange of accusations with the U S  over spying on government networks earlier this month  

 We haven t heard about the order   an official at one of the banks  IT departments said  according to Reuters  adding   There aren t any locally made hardware around that can handle the massive amount of data in the banking industry  
The Chinese government also has reportedly ordered state owned companies to break ties with American consulting firms  Bloomberg reported citing The Financial Times  Last month  China s government excluded the order of Windows 8 operating systems  stating security reasons 
 Security trumps everything   Duncan Clark  chairman of BDA China Ltd   said  according to Bloomberg  adding   China doesn t need the U S  companies in the way it did for the last few decades

176672,398188,IBM,Seritage Growth Properties  Warren Buffett Bought WHAT ,opinion,"Leave it to Warren Buffett to keep us guessing  The Oracle  N ORCL  of Omaha just reported 8  stake in Seritage Growth Properties  N SRG   a REIT spinoff of struggling old line retailer Sears Holdings Corporation  O SHLD   SRG owns a portfolio of 266 Sears properties  some of which it owns via joint ventures  But it s essentially a dumping ground for Sears real estate and a vehicle for Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert to extract as much value as he can from a sinking ship   I wrote about this earlier this year  see article  
So  why would Warren Buffett want a piece of SRG  When I saw the news  I legitimately thought it was a joke  I actually had to  to verify 
Interestingly  Mr  Buffett is not alone here  Contrarian value investor Bruce Berkowitz had amassed a   though he s been trimming back recently  Berkowitz has been a large shareholder of Sears Holdings for years  In fact  it s his single biggest holding  So if he sees value in Sears  it s not shocking that he would also see value in Sears  spun off property portfolio   I wrote about Berkowitz and his highly concentrated value portfolio earlier this year  see Seven Masters of the Universe  
Both Warren Buffett and Bruce Berkowitz have had some high profile mistakes in recent years  Sears has been a disaster for Berkowitz  and Buffett has lost a fortune in IBM  N IBM   But both of these gentlemen have absolutely crushed the market over their careers  so when they make a large new position  it s worth picking into the details 
First  we should clarify a point on size  Yes  Berkshire Hathaway  N BRKa  now owns 8  of SRG  and Berkowitz s fund owns 10   But SRG is a tiny REIT with a market cap of about  1 billion  So Berkshire Hathaway s position  which had a cost basis of just  70 million  is a tiny drop in the bucket  Berkshire Hathaway has a market cap of well over  300 billion  So while the SRG purchase looks big in the headlines  it s pretty much pocket change for Warren Buffett  the equivalent of buying a Cherry Coke  Buffett s favorite   for the rest of us 
Likewise  while Berkowitz owns 10  of SRG  it only accounts for less than 4  of his portfolio 
Still  might there be some value here  Let s take a look 
Seritage is a new REIT that only began trading in July  so there is not a lot of history to it  And to date  SRG has yet to pay a dividend  though it has promised to do so before year end 
Looking at the financial results  nothing particularly jumps off the page   Normalized  funds from operations   FFO   last quarter came in at   Annualizing that  SRG trades at a price FFO multiple of 19  That s not particularly cheap though not completely out of line for the industry  It also suggests a dividend yield in the 3  4  range is doable 
Normally  I m somewhat skeptical of  specialty  REITs that are spun off from a single large property holder  To start  there is major concentration risk  What if Sears finally goes belly up 
And you have to legitimately ask if a spinoff REIT is truly to be run independently for the benefit of its shareholders or if it is little more than a funding vehicle for the former parent company  For example  might Seritage give Sears preferential treatment with below market rents  Maybe  maybe not  But questions like these should normally cause a spinoff REIT like SRG to trade at a discount to its more diversified and more independent peers 
That was my initial thought  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that 22  of SRG s rental income comes from tenants other than Sears  And that number should grow over time  presumably allowing for respectable growth in rents as non Sears tenants pay market rates 
So while a discount to larger peers like Realty Income Corporation  N O  would still be warranted  that discount should definitely close with time 
When Eddie Lampert first took control of Sears  we all more or less assumed it was his intention to unlock its real estate value while slowly allowing the retail business to wither and die  It might have all gone according to plan had the 2008 meltdown and Great Recession not hit  But with his launch of SRG earlier this year  it looks like Mr  Lampert is still more or less doing what he had always planned to do   See Is Sears the Next Berkshire Hathaway  
I wouldn t be a buyer of SRG at today s prices  The shares are up about 15  on the news of Warren Buffett s position  and I think it s likely that shares drift back down once the news properly sets in  But SRG might be a REIT to watch  In particular  look for progress in the coming quarters in reducing exposure to Sears Holdings and look for dividend guidance in the next quarterly report

176674,398190,IBM,The Chinese Silver Fox,opinion,"I recently had a long and very interesting conversation with John Embry of Sprott Resources  It is always good to speak with him as I consider him one of the five sharpest economic precious metals minds I know of and certainly value his opinion  John s name came up a couple of days ago when someone asked  where is all this silver coming from  to meet the outsized physical demand  I said  this is the number one question John Embry and Eric Sprott have been asking for about a year now  
Our conversation was quite broad but let s zero in on the  silver supply  aspect because I believe it is more important than anything else in our world today  That is a very big statement but stay with me as you will see toward the end why I believe this  John asked where IS all the silver coming from  Let me first say what follows was my best educated  guess  and I know of no one who has the firm and hard answer  I told him during the 80 s and early 90 s the amount of  scrap  could be a very logical explanation  Then during the 90 s and early 2000 s the silver deficit could be explained by the huge amount of silver recovered from the  Manhattan Project  estimated to be nearly 1 billion ounces  I also believe the Chinese lent somewhere around 300 million ounces of silver to the U S  back in 2003 for a 10 year term which expired in that  magical year  2013  If this was true  it would explain the massive paper takedown in May of 2013 because the lease was  up   I believe silver had to be taken down as the price was getting away and threatening  50  A collapsing price would allow the U S  to say  don t worry  you will get your silver back as we have the price under control  
Here is where I believe the silver to meet delivery has come from  CHINA  But why  First and foremost  China was a  silver nation  and had used silver as money for longer and in greater quantity than any other nation  In other words  the silver has come from the only place it could have because China had it  OK  but even if China was the only large stockpile  why would they  throw good money after bad  if they were already defaulted on  I believe they wanted the crowned jewel of the West  Gold  They had silver but the West had the gold accumulated during the 1900 s and especially after WWII  Yes the U S  dishoarded in the 50 s and 60 s but we did still have 8 000 plus tons left and are  were   custodian for other Western gold holdings  It is my contention a deal was made where silver has been supplied by China to prevent the Achilles heel  silver  from defaulting and blowing up everything  In other words  keeping the game going for longer would allow China to accumulate gold and drain what is left  had the game blown up in 2013  China would not have had the ability to accumulate what they have since then  Call this  dropping pennies to pick up dollars  
Getting back to what I said at the beginning where I said  silver is more important than anything else in the world   please follow this through  Silver is a very small market  some would say unimportant except for its various technological  medical  etc  uses  However  in no way could silver s price get away to the upside without dragging gold with it  Were the price of gold to get away to the upside  demand would explode  particularly in China where they are known as speculators and  chasers    Were this to happen  the existing supply would be chewed up and the uncomfortable request  please deliver my gold  would become prevalent  At this point the game would be over as the scam of fractional reserve gold  and silver    and everything else  would be public knowledge 
You see   trust  is at the heart of it all  Our entire financial system is based on trust  Trust in government  trust in fiat currency  trust in cross trading partners  trust in your bank or your broker    it is ALL TRUST  What would happen to this trust if it turned out that a Ponzi scheme turned up somewhere  Not just any Ponzi scheme like Madoff but one where the exchange itself was running a fractional reserve fraud and could not deliver  Trust    IN EVERYTHING would fail 
As usual I am sure I will be trolled for the above and called an idiot but I must ask you this  If global gold supply has not met demand for 20 years or more  where can the metal have come from to meet the deficit  The same goes for silver and even more so because the supply demand deficit has been even more severe and longer in duration  The answer is most obvious  the metal had to come from the only place available  above ground supplies  For gold  that can only mean  official  stockpiles  vaults   For silver  I believe the only large above ground stockpile left was legacy silver in China 
Please do not point at the price and say  see  there are no shortages  as we have seen shortages  rationing and backwardation in both silver and gold over the last two years  If you gave me 100 billion counterfeit shares of IBM  N IBM  I could sell whenever I wanted  I am pretty sure I could make IBM look like a falling down drunk whenever I wanted and the price would certainly be depressed  Herein lies the fault  gold nor silver can be  printed  and when all is said and done investors holding receipts for same will be in for a very big and very bad surprise 
To finish  if I am correct about the silver for delivery coming from the most likely of all places  China  then I believe this will be looked back on by historians as  the Chinese silver fox in the West s golden hen house  Am I correct  I don t know but we will soon see as the global paper financial edifice is quaking on its own  John Embry told me   of all the many theories I have heard so far  yours makes the most sense and is the most logical   I mentioned this topic to Jim yesterday and he told me when we first talked about it six months back he was skeptical but the more he has thought about it    the silver can ONLY be coming from where it exists   Chinese legacy silver 
I think China has done some very intelligent maneuvering particularly since the 2008 crisis  They figured out our fractional reserve scheme was toast but they played along anyway  They even levered up as much or more than we did since then  However  with this increase in credit they have built infrastructure in the form of roads  bridges  cities  plant and equipment    all for and with future uses  The West on the other hand has thrown a  standard of living party  and neglected infrastructure to the point of dilapidation  Yes China s financial system will implode with all the rest  they may even lead it  But  they will be left with new infrastructure and  money   our gold  to get started again  President Xi has even said this to his people and to the world  He said the short term would be difficult but the long term beneficial  I think he is telling the truth ",2016-01-14,Bill Holter,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-chinese-silver-fox-380032,380032

I am quoted in TheStreet about Berkshire s forthcoming earnings  November 5  2015  as follows 

 The bottom line may look very good  but this is a one time event   said David Kass  a professor of finance at the Robert H  Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland and author of a blog dedicated to Berkshire Hathaway   It s certainly a real number  a real profit that s being earned by Berkshire  and so it will make their earnings report look good  But I think the concern that many analysts might have  they will be focusing on continuing earnings  the operating earnings  what has occurred in the last quarter  and what s likely to occur in subsequent quarters in the near future   
 He always puts a lot of weight on book value  which will depend heavily on the value of the stocks in his portfolio   said Kass 
 As of the end of the second quarter  Berkshire Hathaway s book value was  149 735  Kass said he doubts it would be moving very far from that number in the third quarter   
 As Berkshire has acquired large companies rather than pieces of companies as stocks in their portfolio  book value has become a smaller percentage of intrinsic value and therefore a less accurate estimate of the value of the firm   Kass said   
 That doesn t mean book value can be discounted completely  especially as it has also been established as a basis for determining repurchases  Berkshire s board has approved a plan in place since 2012 to buy back its shares when they trade at a less than 20  premium to book value   It sends a message to investors   Kass said   It results in basically creating a floor for the stock  ",2015-11-08,David Kass,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/third-quarter-net-earnings-double,-but-operating-earnings-decline-3.7-270591",270591

176703,398219,IBM,3 Dividend Stocks Worth  A Look,opinion,"There are a number of shares currently available with low PE ratios but offering higher yields for the dividend  That is normally regarded as a winning combination for any dividend stock  However  there are also other factors that weigh while taking a decision on buying a dividend stock  For instance  a company might be having heavy debts or witnessing a falling trend in profits  That might suggest that stocks are available for a bargain whereas the surface look is totally different  Similarly  there are some stocks with a solid track record of paying a dividend but are currently facing some speed bumps  Buying such stocks would provide twin opportunities  One is dividend yield if the business continues to face bumps  and the other is that if the turnaround happens  its share price too will grow  Let s discuss three such stocks  International Business Machines Corp   NYSE N IBM   United Technologies Corporation  NYSE N UTX  and Gap Inc   NYSE N GPS  
Opportunity To Grow
One of the stocks Warren Buffett preferred was International IBM  though the stock has yet to repay the confidence reposed in it  However  Buffett did not bother about the near term and looked for long term gains  For that  he is ready to bear the short term pain of losing value  The company took steps to divest most of the less profitable hardware  as well as chip making businesses  The tech firm reinvested them in technology services and more profitable software businesses  However  it has yet to see the effects of such exercises  Its revenue is predicted to fall to  83 billion in the current year from  106 9 billion recorded four years back  The next two years are expected to remain flat as far as sales are concerned 
If IBM s valuation is taken into consideration  its PE is just nine times the projected EPS for the next one year period  That is below the PE ratio of 16 for the S P 500  In the last one year  shares of the company dropped 25   As far as the yield is concerned  it was 3 5  compared to the broader index s 2 2  
Investing In New Technologies
International Business Machines is investing in promising new technologies like digital security  social media  data analytics  and cloud computing  Last year  the company was able to generate  25 billion in revenue from these divisions  This is estimated to reach  40 billion by the year 2018  As a comparison to the total revenue  these segment contributions will increase to 40  of sales from 27  in the last year  The company expects these divisions to boost the overall profitability and margins 
While the Street expects the profit of IBM to drop 4 8  in the current year  they are confident of growth resuming next year  As a result  its EPS will grow to  16 12 next year from  15 73  Also  the company has been able to generate solid cash flow to fund any additional share repurchase program or pay higher dividends  Fort Pitt Capital s investment advisor  Kim Forrest  said that IBM is a misunderstood and unloved stock  However  it has a good story  Buffett too said that he would rather buy when the shares go down rather than get panic 
Promising Turnaround Candidate
United Technologies Corporation is another stock that is looking to be a promising candidate for a turnaround  One of the problems it faces now is that over 60  of sales happen in the overseas markets  and sales in China and the European Union have slumped due to their market conditions  Added to it was the strong Greenback in the last several quarters  Its dependence on foreign markets has hurt its profit since converting to the dollar has become expensive  A strong currency has been a big issue for export and was one of the reasons for the Fed to delay the interest rate hikes  Any increase in rates would strengthen the Greenback  thus impacting companies dependent on overseas sales 
However  UTX has a strong line up of products  and remaining patience would be rewarded in the future  Most recently  the company divested its Sikorsky helicopter business for  9 billion  As a result  profits will take a hit as analysts estimate EPS to fall to  6 20 in the current year from  6 82 achieved last year  However  analysts expect the company to turn towards reporting profit growth in the following years  The company made its intentions clear that it would use most of the cash proceeds to repurchase its shares  which would boost its EPS 
There is also  5 billion cash available on its balance sheet  and UTX might involve in acquisitions to increase growth pace  It has PE of 15 based on next year earnings  which is modestly lower than the broader index  The shares provide a dividend yield of 2 7   which is above average 
Another Potential Turnaround Firm
Gap is a clothing retailer that witnessed 26  fall in the current year  Sales were not growing as it was losing to  fast fashion  retailers like Zara and H M  In the current fiscal year  analysts expect 1 3  fall in sales to  16 2 billion  Only four out of 32 analysts have assigned the stock as a  Buy  or  Strong Buy  rating  The company s CEO  Art Peck  said that the company is working on a fix  As a result  it would shut down 175 poorly performing stores and focus itself on more profitable outlets  The company also appointed a new chief designer to give a new look to its clothing lineup 
Significantly  Gap is responding to the trends more quickly  It has a promising lineup for women that are racking up robust sales  The company s actions could be reflected in fiscal year 2017 results only  Currently  the stock is trading at 11 times the projected year ahead EPS  which is 30  less than the broader index PE  Shares of the company provided a yield of 2 9   That provides an opportunity for investors to earn dividends while waiting for revival to take a strong hold  Morningstar analyst  Bridget Weishaar  said that the stock has upside potential 
Conclusion
The three stocks  namely International Business Machines  United Technologies  and Gap offer enough opportunities  That is for both dividends  as well as stock price ",2015-10-22,InvestCorrectly,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-dividend-stocks-worth-looking-at-international-business-machines-corp.-268964,268964

176733,398249,IBM,Momentum Waning In Recent Bull Move,opinion,"The bulls would be wishing that Oprah Winfrey had the capital to take sizeable stakes in stocks with heavier weightings than Weight Watchers  N WTW  on the S P 500  I d also imagine there would be a few hedge funds keen to get her on the payroll  given the stock market has effectively endorsed her as the world s most powerful women 
Moves in US markets have provided Asia with little to work with today   both equities and fixed income were subdued  In fact  implied volatility in the equity market has really come off sharply  with the VIX trading below 15  for the first time since 19 August  I would be watching these volatility metrics quite closely from here  as we can t rule out a sharp pick up in volatility over the coming weeks
One aspect of the market I have been looking at is positioning  Specifically  we have seen a 50  reduction of USD long holdings this year from speculative funds  largely as a result of tightening financial conditions turning the Federal Reserve more dovish and the market moving to push out its pricing for the first rate hike until May 2016  Does this present itself with a good longer term entry point for USD exposure  I am still skeptical  and think we need to get the October Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  meeting  Q3 US GDP  both on 29 October   and potentially even the next US payrolls  7 November  out of the way before we get more fundamental clarity 
The S P 500 itself has rallied over 8  in the last 14 days  and the gains have been broad based  During the move from 1871 to 2034  the percentage of companies trading above their 50 day moving average has risen from 10   a level I generally see as great contrarian buying  to currently stand at 65   Short positions in S P futures were reduced 12  last week by the fast money speculative accounts  so there has been a strong element of short covering in the market  and as long as the USD finds sellers  then it seems risk assets can find buyers  As goes the USD  as goes risk appetite 
Earnings are rolling in  with 25  of the S P 500 announcing this week  IBM  N IBM  have a 5 8  weight on the Dow  so the fact that they fell nearly 5  in the post market suggests the Dow should underperform the NASDAQ or S P 500 today  Looking at IBM from a technical perspective  it s interesting to see the 38 2  retracement of the July to August sell off at  153 05 being so respected lately  This was the clear line to look at short positions  Today  however  we are more likely to see the 25 August low of  140 62 being tested  although the hourly chart is grossly oversold and I would expect traders look to try buy this low on open 

Traders will also be keen to watch out for modest improvement in US building permits and housing starts today  although neither should rock the risk barometer wildly  On the earnings front  I expect clients to be most active in Yahoo  O YHOO   who report after the close   given the huge volatility seen in prior quarterly reports  Analysts are expecting 3Q earnings per share  EPS  of 16c  on revenue of  1 02 billion  They do have a good pedigree of beating consensus EPS  so good numbers should add to the 75  of companies who have already reported earnings beats 
On a side note  and something I highlighted last week   there have been some sizeable moves in short term US rates  specifically the US T bill maturing 12 November  Over the last few days  this issuance has traded between zero and 16 basis points   which is huge  This is worth watching  given this instrument seems to be the new proxy of systematic risk after US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warned the debt ceiling deadline falls on 3 November  and many feel cash balances would be exhausted by around the 10th  There could be good selling  yields higher  of the short term bills in the weeks ahead  and some fireworks here 

In Asia  US futures have seen net selling and are looking a little vulnerable  with our European equity market calls looking modestly weaker  Asia has been generally mixed  with small buying in Japan  while Hong Kong  China and Australia have seen a weaker tape  The ASX 200 seems a little lost at present and indecision is prevalent on the daily chart  A break of the 28 August high of 5305 is needed to get everyone excited that perhaps we can rally into the 200 day moving average  5568   On the other side of the coin  a move through the 14 October low of 5164 would suggest another tilt at the 5000 level 
My personal bias is neutral and I will turn more bullish on a break of 5305  or bearish on a break below 5164 
It s worth pointing out that we have seen modest net buying of AUD USD today and today s Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  minutes have largely helped   although 56  of all open positions are positioned for downwards move in the pair  Implied probability of a 3 November rate cut has fallen from 28   from around 40  yesterday   Judging from today s RBA minutes  this pricing seems fair  We have also seen net buying of Canadian dollars  although USD CAD has popped on news of Justin Trudeau s Liberal Party claiming victory in the Canadian election  I don t see the victory as a major catalyst for the CAD  and focus should now fall on tomorrow s Canadian central bank meeting for real direction ",2015-10-20,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/momentum-waning-in-recent-bull-move-268642,268642
176734,398250,IBM,European Futures Plagued By US Earnings ECB Meeting Under Focus,opinion,"European futures are trading lower this morning after the disappointing earnings in the US impacting the sentiment  IBM  N IBM  released their third quarter number and it wasn t something that you want to keep looking at  The company s revenue came much below the expectation and they blamed this on two ongoing issues  Firstly  the strength of the USD  Finally  the slowdown in Asia  Most of the bad print in their earnings report was predominantly from the Asian region and as long as the situation does not start to strengthen there  it is difficult to knit a scenario how the firm will be able to win this battle 
Commodity prices may remain under pressure once again after the well decorated GDP number which was released in China on Monday  The number has caused extreme sell off in the commodity space  especially  for copper  We are expecting this sell off to continue and industrial metals may lose more attraction amid investors 
Although  the main event for this week is the upcoming ECB meeting and there is no question that the focus is very much on the action s which Mr Draghi will take  It is widely expected that his tone will be very dovish given the Eurozone region is swimming in a sea of deflation and in order to fight the thorns of deflation  more stimulus is needed  Market participants are largely expecting some sort of announcement under which the ECB will provide more details on new instrument through which they will be able to inflate their balance sheet 
The strength of the euro is something that the ECB must be feeling uncomfortable  especially any level above 1 15  The ECB policy member did not hesitate to communicate their thoughts and indicated that the bank need to add more instruments to inflate its balance sheet to spur growth in the region  His comments had a direct action on the euro rally and this took some wind out of the it  The currency could see some intense selling pressure if the central bank embarks on cutting the interest rate even lower  Mr Draghi has repeatedly said that the bank will use all instruments at its disposal to get to where they need to be 
However  the odds are not stacked high enough for the ECB to use this option and they may use an alternative route rather than pushing the negative rate even lower  The alternative path is to inflate their QE program  The bank can achieve this by extending the end date or alternatively just increase the firepower of their guns and start loading more  Nonetheless  ahead of this meeting  we are expecting more pressure for the euro against the dollar

176753,398269,IBM,Book Review  Superforecasting,opinion,"We all crave knowledge of the future  Is it going to rain this weekend  Where will the equity markets be in a year  Next week  Five minutes from now  Predictive models  many using big data and statistical algorithms  have begun making inroads into this problem  But IBM  NYSE IBM  Watson s chief engineer  David Ferrucci  doesn t think that machines will ever completely replace subjective human judgment  In forecasting  combinations of machines and experts may prove more robust than pure machine or pure human approaches   So   say the authors of Superforecasting   it s time we got serious about both    p  24 
Philip E  Tetlock  a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co leader of a multiyear online forecasting study  the Good Judgment Project  and Dan Gardner  a journalist  teamed up to produce one of the best books I ve read this year  Superforecasting  The Art and Science of Prediction  Crown Publishers  2015  argues that  it is possible to see into the future  at least in some situations and to some extent  and that any intelligent  open minded  and hardworking person can cultivate the requisite skills    Foresight isn t a mysterious gift bestowed at birth  It is the product of particular ways of thinking  of gathering information  of updating beliefs    pp  9  20 
It s pretty easy to get started learning to forecast more accurately  A tutorial for the Good Judgment Project covering some of the basic concepts in this book and summarized in its Ten  actually eleven  Commandments appendix  took only about sixty minutes to read and yet it improved accuracy by roughly 10  through the entire tournament year   And never forget that even modest improvements in foresight maintained over time add up  I spoke about that with Aaron Brown  an author  a Wall Street veteran  and the chief risk manager at AQR Capital Management  a hedge fund with over  100 billion in assets   It s so hard to see because it s not dramatic   he said  but if it is sustained   it s the difference between a consistent winner who s making a living  or the guy who s going broke all the time     p  20  Did that get your attention 
Admittedly  Superforecasting doesn t focus on the financial markets because the authors recognize that they are rife with aleatory uncertainty  the unknowable   not just epistemic uncertainty  the unknown but potentially knowable    Aleatory uncertainty ensures life will always have surprises  regardless of how carefully we plan  Superforecasters grasp this deep truth better than most  When they sense that a question is loaded with irreducible uncertainty say  a currency market question they have learned to be cautious  keeping their initial estimates inside the shades of maybe zone between 35  and 65  and moving out tentatively    p  116  Note that  even here  superforecasters don t just throw up their hands and say 50 50 
In a second reference to the markets  the authors compare superforecasting investing to black swan investing  Playing the low probability  high reward card is not the only way to invest   A very different way is to beat competitors by forecasting more accurately for example  correctly deciding that there is a 68  chance of something happening when others foresee only a 60  chance    It pays off more often  but the returns are more modest  and fortunes are amassed slowly    p  195 
At its core  Superforecasting teaches its readers how to think probabilistically  something that doesn t come naturally to most people  We tend to use a two  or three setting mental dial  Something will happen  won t happen  or may happen  But this way of thinking gets us into trouble  The  will  and  won t  settings reflect a faulty view that reality is fixed  Even death and taxes may not be certain someday  And the  maybe  setting  has to be subdivided into degrees of probability    The finer grained the better  as long as the granularity captures real distinctions meaning that if outcomes you say have an 11  chance of happening really do occur 1  less often than 12  outcomes and 1  more than 10  outcomes    p  117 
What does it take to be a superforecaster  Well  for starters  a lot of time and mental energy  Those who have a superabundance of both can join the thousands of people predicting global events at the   The rest of us can use this book to improve our own  most likely more modest predictions  If  that is  we have  or are willing to cultivate  certain qualities  Superforecasters are foxes  not hedgehogs  They look at problems from multiple perspectives  They tend to be  among other things  cautious  humble  nondeterministic  actively open minded  intellectually curious  reflective  numerate  pragmatic  and analytical  with a growth mindset and grit   The strongest predictor of rising into the ranks of superforecasters is perpetual beta  the degree to which one is committed to belief updating and self improvement  It is roughly three times as powerful a predictor as its closest rival  intelligence    p  155 
Superforecasting is a must read book for everyone who is sick to death of  the guru model that makes so many policy debates so puerile   I ll counter your Paul Krugman polemic with my Niall Ferguson counterpolemic  and rebut your Tom Friedman op ed with my Bret Stephens blog     p  24  As the authors write   All too often  forecasting in the twenty first century looks too much like nineteenth century medicine  There are theories  assertions  and arguments  There are famous figures  as confident as they are well compensated  But there is little experimentation  or anything that could be called science  so we know much less than most people realize  And we pay the price  Although bad forecasting rarely leads as obviously to harm as does bad medicine  it steers us subtly toward bad decisions and all that flows from them including monetary losses  missed opportunities  unnecessary suffering  even war and death    p  42  It s time for a change for all of us to change ",2015-09-27,Brenda Jubin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/tetlock---gardner,-superforecasting-266307",266307
176754,398270,IBM,Warren Buffett s Favorite Macro Indicator,opinion,"Warren Buffett hasn t been on his A game over the past couple years  It s too early to say how his most recent large acquisition   Precision Castparts  N PCP    will end up performing  But his last major stock market buy   IBM  N IBM    has been such a lousy performer  we actually shorted it in Boom   Bust 
Ouch 
All the same  Mr  Buffett is still a living legend and his market calls have usually been pretty prescient  Today  we re going to look at the valuation tool he has repeatedly called  probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment  
And that would be the ratio of total market cap to U S  GDP  Data site GuruFocus tracks the data back to 1970 using the Wilshire 5000 as a proxy for the  total  market cap 
So  how s it looking  After the third quarter correction  might stocks be at least modestly cheap 
Not a chance 
U S  stocks are valued at 118  of GDP  That s down from the highs earlier this year of 125  and certainly a far cry from the 148  we saw during the  nutty  looney  extremes of the 1990s tech bubble  But it s still extremely expensive  The ratio would have to drop by another 8  just to get back to the levels of 2007  before the 2008 meltdown started 
So suffice it to say  the market is far from cheap  And that implies lousy returns for the next several years  Let s dig into the numbers 
Investment returns are a product of three factors  Dividend yield  economic growth and change in valuation  None of the three look great right now  Market dividend yields are a puny 2  these days  and GDP growth has been pretty uninspiring  A 2  dividend and 2    3  economic growth would get us to 4    5  stock returns  While not exciting  that s not a terrible return in this interest rate environment 
But then we get to valuation  Assuming that the market returns to its long term average market cap to GDP ratio  we re looking at lean years ahead  GuruFocus crunched the numbers and based on current valuations  the market should return a measly 0 5  per year over the next eight years 
Now  a lot can happen in eight years  But it s safe to say that the odds are not in your favor right now if you re a buy and hold investor  If you want to earn a respectable return over the next several years  you re going to need to be a lot more active and consider strategies you might have never considered before ",2015-10-12,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/taking-a-look-at-warren-buffett’s-favorite-macro-indicator-267874,267874

176759,398275,IBM,IBM Misses Revenue Targets Again After Losing Footing In China,news,"By     Reuters    IBM missed revenue expectations for the fourth straight quarter as it grappled with weakening demand for servers and storage in emerging markets such as China  Shares in the world s largest technology services company fell 3 5 percent to  181 68 in after hours trade 
Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty and her team will forego their annual incentive payments for 2013 as IBM failed to increase revenue  Particularly in China  the government owned corporations that IBM relies on for a large chunk of revenue are putting the brakes on IT spending 
China accounts for about 5 percent of IBM s business  about 40 percent of which is hardware sales  The country s economy  the world s second largest  is tough to read  executives said  A new government headed by Xi Jinping is spearheading significant structural reforms that are affecting state owned companies 
 China is going through a very significant economic set of reforms   IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeder told analysts   While they have slowed  we don t think that this opportunity has gone away    We ll be on a trajectory to growth as we exit 2014 and we re comfortable that we get back to mid single digits across the growth market regions by the end of the year  
IBM  for years a tech infrastructure provider of choice for large corporations and government agencies  is expanding into higher margin software and cloud computing services as its hardware business sputters  Revenue in that business  which includes server and storage products  fell for the ninth straight quarter as more companies switched to the cloud from traditional infrastructure 
Sources said IBM and China s Lenovo have revived discussions about a sale of Big Blue s low end server unit  though executives did not mention that on Tuesday  Some analysts said a backlash against U S  government spying in emerging economies contributed to plummeting demand at IBM  Asia Pacific revenue fell 16 percent  while that from Brazil  Russia  India and China fell 14 percent in the quarter 
 Their growth markets were everything but growth   Forrester analyst Andrew Bartels said   They have had quite a bit of success with sales of hardware in these emerging markets  but these markets are not doing well  They re facing competition in those markets  
IBM forecast that full year 2014 adjusted profit would beat analysts  expectations and also affirmed its 2015 target for operating earnings of at least  20 per share  Some analysts said they thought IBM would need to grow non hardware revenue substantially to hit that mark  Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson told Reuters the company would need solid performance in software and services to meet its target  since expectations are that hardware will not contribute to profit in 2014 
 Assuming a normalized tax rate  this doesn t leave a lot of room for error to meet the  18 EPS target   he said 
Total revenue fell 5 percent to  27 7 billion in the fourth quarter ended December 31  missing analysts expectation of  28 25 billion  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S   In view of the company s overall full year results  my senior team and I have recommended that we forgo our personal annual incentive payments for 2013   CEO Rometty said in a statement 
For 2013  her base pay was  1 5 million and annual incentive payment target was  4 million  Revenue from IBM s system and technology unit  which includes servers and storage  fell 26 1 percent to  4 26 billion  Revenue from global technology services  its largest business  fell 3 6 percent to  9 92 billion  Software revenue was the only bright spot  It grew 2 8 percent to  8 14 billion in the quarter 
IBM and rivals such as Oracle and SAP are racing to meet surging demand for web based software products  better known as cloud computing  Moving to the cloud allows businesses to cut costs by ditching bulky servers for network based software and using remote data centers run by technology companies instead 
The global cloud services market last year grew by almost a fifth to an estimated  131 billion  according to research firm Gartner  IBM Markets Intelligence estimates the market could be as big as  200 billion by 2020  Net income for the fourth quarter rose to  6 2 billion  or  5 73 a share  from  5 8 billion  or  5 13 per share a year earlier  It got help though from a lower tax rate of 11 2 percent in the fourth quarter  down 14 3 points from a year ago  On an adjusted basis  it earned  6 13 per share  above analysts  estimates of  5 99 per share

176779,398295,IBM,Does Berkshire Hathway Make The Cut As A  Retirement Stock  ,opinion,"Warren Buffett has made his investors a lot of money over his career  Over the past 35 years  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  has grown its book value at a compounded rate of return of 19 0   Over that same period  the S P 500 has generated total returns of only 11 8   For a manager as large and as closely followed as Buffett  those returns  spread out over three and a half decades  are nothing short of amazing 
Buffett has evolved over the years  moving from a deep value  cigar butt  investor into one who buys great businesses at reasonable prices  He also transformed Berkshire Hathaway twice  First from a textile mill into a diversified insurance company and then into the vast conglomerate it is now  But while no one questions Buffett s investment acumen or his ability to transform both himself and his company  whether or not Berkshire Hathaway makes the grade as a retirement stock is another question entirely 
Let s start with the basics of what makes a good stock a  retirement stock   To start  it should be a stable company in an industry or industries that are not too susceptible to technological upheaval  Remember  we re looking for something to hang on to throughout your golden years 
Buffett has said that he buys companies that he would be comfortable holding if the stock market were to close for five years  In the age of smartphones and Uber taxis  those companies are harder to find  But they are definitely out there  and I would include Berkshire Hathaway among them 
Berkshire Hathaway has individual holdings   even large ones   that are under attack from evolving technology  Perhaps the most visible is IBM  NYSE IBM   As IBM s businesses has come under attack from cloud based competitors  its sales have taken a hit  as has its share price 
But here is the beauty of Berkshire Hathaway  While IBM is one of its largest publically traded holdings  it makes up only 12  of Berkshire Hathaway s portfolio and only 3 5  of Berkshire s market cap   Remember  much of its value comes from its non publically traded holdings   The vast majority of Berkshire Hathaway s holdings are indeed  technology proof  or at least technology resistant  A fine example is Buffett s latest acquisition  Precision Castparts  NYSE PCP   Precision Castparts is well exactly what it sounds like  A precision maker of industrial parts and machinery for everything from aircraft to surgical implants  That s not something a trendy smartphone app out of San Francisco can easily disrupt 
Another nice aspect of Berkshire Hathaway is that Warren Buffett is all too aware of his own mortality and has assembled a fine company that will likely survive and prosper decades after his eventual death or incapacitation   I intentionally avoided saying  retirement  because there is no retirement for men like Buffett  He will die in the saddle with his boots on  and God bless him for it   Berkshire s myriad of subsidiary companies essentially run themselves with minimal oversight from Buffett 
But despite all of this  I can t in good faith consider Berkshire Hathaway stock a good  retirement stock   per se because it fails one of my fundamental criteria  It doesn t pay a dividend 
I don t fault Mr  Buffett for hoarding his cash  For a man of Buffett s talents  a dollar doled out as a dividend is a waste of capital  Buffett can reinvest that dollar better than you or I can  But dividends are critical to a retirement portfolio  Without them  you have to sell shares to realize income 
That s not a problem in a raging bull market  But in a down market  it can massively deplete your capital  Even the mighty BRK A lost over 40  of its value during the 2008 meltdown  and from June 1998 to August 2003 the shares traded sideways  not earning its shareholder a nickel  Had Berkshire paid a regular dividend  a retired shareholder could have lived off the dividends during those dark times rather than having to sell the stock at fire sale prices to meet living expenses 
Here s the thing  I suspect that once Mr  Buffett is no longer running the company  Berkshire Hathaway will initiate a dividend  and it will probably be a handsome one  But that day will  hopefully  be many years from now  So for now  Berkshire Hathaway is not suitable as a retirement stock  It s still worthwhile to own  mind you  but it s not one that I would recommend for investors already in retirement unless their income needs are already met elsewhere

176863,398379,IBM, 3 High Dividend Growth Stocks For 2015,opinion,"Looking for the sweet spot between dividend growth and dividend yield  We parsed the data from S P 500 dividend stocks through April 30  2015  to find out which dividend stocks have had strong dividend increases in 2015 
Sector wise  Consumer Discretionary and Tech S P 500 stocks had the best combination of overall performance and dividend increases  Even though Healthcare has been the leading sector for ages  it s not known for having a lot of dividend paying stocks  In addition  this sector s dividend increases haven t kept pace with its rising share prices  which has also contributed to a lower overall dividend yield  We found 3 prospects which had a good combination of dividend yield and dividend increases in 2015  Ford Motor Company  NYSE F   International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  and Valero  Valero   NYSE VLO   is listed as a Basic Materials stock  but  in addition to wholesaling its refined crude oil products  such as gasoline and ethanol  through bulk and rack marketing network  it also markets them through approximately 7 400 outlets under the Valero  Diamond Shamrock  Shamrock  Ultramar  Beacon  Texaco  and other names  so it reaps the benefit of cheaper crude oil feedstock prices  when it sells gasoline to consumers  Although these aren t necessarily high dividend stocks  they all have a dividend yield above the current S P average yield of 2 03   Next Quarterly Dividend Dates 
Options  If you re looking to ramp up your dividend income  all 3 stocks have fairly high option yields  ranging from 6 15  annualized for Ford  up to 12 81  annualized for VLO 
VLO s September  62 50 call strike pays  2 36  nearly 6 times its   40 quarterly dividend Our  is now tracking these 3 call selling trades  and over 30 others  Here are the main 3 scenarios for the Ford covered call trade  which has a  16 strike that s   80 above its price share  and thus offers you price gain potential  as well as call option income 
Put Options  If you re more conservative  and you want to wait for a lower entry price  selling cash secured puts offers you a way to potentially achieve a lower breakeven  via getting paid a put premium now  when you sell puts below the stock s price share 
These put option premiums offer you even higher income than the covered call options  they re over 3 to 7 times the amount of these stocks  next quarterly dividends  Earnings Estimates  Although Ford has the lowest and most undervalued PEG value   please see Valuations below   VLO wins the prize for increasing analyst estimates  2015 average estimates have increased all the way from  5 62 90 days ago  to around  6 92 within the past 7 days  It s also interesting to note how analysts have steadily underestimated VLO s earnings over the past 4 quarters  which may imply that their estimates for this and next year may be too low 
Valuations  VLO and IBM s P Es are closer to the low end of their 5 year ranges  while Ford is at the high end of its 5 year range  Financials  Other than IBM s outsized ROE   thanks to a huge share buyback program   VLO compares a lot more favorably to its industry averages in all of the following categories  including having much less debt  Performance  VLO has handily outperformed the S P 500 in all of the following categories  while IBM has outperformed over the past month and year to date  Ford has lagged in all these time perods

176884,398400,IBM,The Shocking Truth About Share Buybacks ,opinion,"Introduction
The value and benefits  or lack thereof  of share buybacks to the future fortunes of a company and their shareholders is one of the most hotly debated subjects on popular financial blogs such as Seeking Alpha   Unfortunately  at least based on my own personal experience  most of the arguments are predicated on opinions and beliefs in lieu of the facts  
Consequently  the primary thesis behind this article is to provide a more fact based discussion regarding the desirability of share buybacks devoid of emotional or opinionated arguments   Stated more directly  my objective will be to answer the question posed in the title of this article  to buy back shares  or to not buy back shares  that is the question 
My Inspiration Was Not Positively Instigated
My inspiration for penning this article  which I feel was long overdue  came as a result of a loyal reader of my work sharing a rather one sided  prejudicial and opinionated article on share buybacks that he she read on MorningStarAdvisor   The article was authored by Rex Nutting of MarketWatch on April 24  2015 with the provocative title  Update  How the Stock Market Destroyed the Middle Class    From my perspective  this article represents a classic example of an opinionated and prejudiced argument lacking a factual representation as evidenced by the following provoking excerpt 
 But one under appreciated factor is a pervasive business model that encourages top managers of American corporations to loot their company for short term gains  depriving those companies of the funds they need to build and enlarge  and invest in their workers for the long haul 
How do they loot their company  By using large stock buybacks to manage the short term objectives that trigger higher compensation for themselves  By using those stock buybacks to manipulate the share price  which allows them to use inside information to time their own stock sales  By using buybacks to funnel most of the company s profits back to shareholders  including themselves    They use the stock market to loot their companies  
In my opinion  pun intended  this article clearly expressed the author s negative and prejudiced opinion and view of share buybacks while simultaneously alleging that they are destructive to the economy and the middle class   There were facts presented  and I m going to accept that they were accurate  however  I do not accept the fact that they supported his economic destruction thesis   The reader can form their own opinions by following this link to the entire article  
The truth is that share buybacks are neither good nor bad in their own right   Under certain circumstances and in certain instances  share buybacks can be a very bad or poor use of corporate capital   Under other circumstances and instances  share buybacks can be the most prudent and beneficial use of corporate capital   Therefore  prejudging all share buybacks as bad or destructive is just as wrong as holding prejudiced views or judgment about people based on race  creed or color 
When Share Buybacks Are Good and When They Are Bad
In his 2011 letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   renowned investor Warren Buffett wrote extensively on his and partner Charlie Munger s position on share buybacks   Here  to the full letter  but what follows are a few important excerpts that relate to the subject of this article 
 Charlie and I favor repurchases when two conditions are met  first  a company has ample funds to take care of the operational and liquidity needs of its business  second  its stock is selling at a material discount to the company s intrinsic business value  conservatively calculated  
Personally  I believe that Warren Buffett succinctly hit the nail on the head with this one sentence   However  the first condition can be very difficult to accurately assess  and admittedly open to some debate   On the other hand  that is not to say that it cannot be properly evaluated  it just takes a little work and digging under the hood of a company  the competitive landscape of its industry and its business model to correctly ascertain 
The second condition is easier to determine and evaluate  and represents the primary financial subject that I have dedicated my professional life to sound valuation   It is a prudent  sound and long term profitable tactic when a company can repurchase shares at sound and attractive valuations   In contrast  share repurchases can represent a very unsatisfactory and destructive use of capital when valuations are unsound or high   In the same letter  Warren Buffett had this to add on the subject 
 We have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test  Sometimes  of course  infractions   even serious ones   are innocent  many CEOs never stop believing their stock is cheap  In other instances  a less benign conclusion seems warranted  It doesn t suffice to say that repurchases are being made to offset the dilution from stock issuances or simply because a company has excess cash  Continuing shareholders are hurt unless shares are purchased below intrinsic value  The first law of capital allocation   whether the money is slated for acquisitions or share repurchases   is that what is smart at one price is dumb at another   One CEO who always stresses the price value factor in  repurchase decisions is Jamie Dimon at J P  Morgan  I recommend that you read his annual letter   
Interestingly  Warren Buffett then went on to use one of his large holdings  International Business Machine  IBM  NYSE IBM    as his example to illustrate his points more comprehensively   I found this interesting for a couple of reasons   First of all  because I am also long IBM  and because I authored two articles on the company  and that created quite a stir and large and lively comment threads  
The second reason I found this interesting  is based on the date in which Warren Buffett made the comments  his 2011 letter  and the subsequent corresponding share buyback behavior of IBM s management team   Next I will share Warren Buffett s comments on IBM and its management relative to their share repurchases behavior  and then I will provide factual evidence utilizing the fundamentals analyzer software tool to provide supporting evidence of the veracity of his words 
 Let s use IBM as an example  As all business observers know  CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisano did a superb job in moving IBM from near bankruptcy twenty years ago to its prominence today  Their operational accomplishments were truly extraordinary  But their financial management was equally brilliant  particularly in recent years as the company s financial flexibility improved  Indeed  I can think of no major company that has had better financial management  a skill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders  The company has used debt wisely  made value adding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash and aggressively repurchased its own stock 
Today  IBM has 1 16 billion shares outstanding  of which we own about 63 9 million or 5 5   Naturally  what happens to the company s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us  Beyond that  the company will likely spend  50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares  Our quiz for the day  What should a long term shareholder  such as Berkshire  cheer for during that period  
I won t keep you in suspense  We should wish for IBM s stock price to languish throughout the five years 
Let s do the math  If IBM s stock price averages  say   200 during the period  the company will acquire 250 million shares for its  50 billion  There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding  and we would own about 7  of the company  If the stock conversely sells for an average of  300 during the five year period  IBM will acquire only 167 million shares  That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding after five years  of which we would own 6 5  
If IBM were to earn  say   20 billion in the fifth year  our share of those earnings would be a full  100 million greater under the  disappointing  scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higher price  At some later point our shares would be worth perhaps  1 1 2 billion more  1   billion dollars  than if the  high price  repurchase scenario had taken place 
The logic is simple  If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future  either directly with your  own money or indirectly  through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares   you are hurt when stocks rise  You benefit when stocks swoon  Emotions  however  too often complicate the matter  Most people  including those who will be net buyers in the future  take comfort in seeing stock prices advance  These shareholders resemble a commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases  simply because his tank contains a day s supply  
Warren Buffett s Math Was Correct
I find it fascinating  but not surprising  that Warren Buffett s math in 2011 was prophetic and almost precisely correct   As it turns out  his statement that it would leave about 990 shares outstanding after five years came out almost exactly as he prophesies   As the following FUN Graph  fundamental underlying numbers  illustrates  IBM had 988 million shares outstanding at the end of its second fiscal quarter 2015 

Warren Buffett s Wishes Were Fulfilled
Regarding the price action that he hoped for  his wishes were fulfilled and then some   Here is what he hoped for 
 Charlie and I don t expect to win many of you over to our way of thinking   we ve observed enough human behavior to know the futility of that   but we do want you to be aware of our personal calculus  And here a confession is in order  In my early days I  too  rejoiced when the market rose  Then I read Chapter Eight of Ben Graham s The Intelligent Investor  the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock prices  Immediately the scales fell from my eyes  and low prices became my friend  Picking up that book was one of the luckiest moments in my life  
Since 2011 IBM s stock price has languished between the  175  200 range since he made his wish  he and partner Charlie should be quite happy   The following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  on IBM since 2011 illustrates the undervaluation that supported their share repurchase activity 

Intermediate Consensus Estimates for IBM
Later in that same letter  Warren Buffett went on to point out that his investment in IBM will be determined primarily by its future earnings as follows 
 In the end  the success of our IBM investment will be determined primarily by its future earnings  But an important secondary factor will be how many shares the company purchases with the substantial sums it is likely to devote to this activity  And if repurchases ever reduce the IBM shares outstanding to 63 9 million  I will abandon my famed frugality and give Berkshire employees a paid holiday  
The following  Forecasting Calculator  based on consensus intermediate term earnings estimates for IBM represents an attractive opportunity out to year end 2017 

Long Term  3 to 5 Year  Consensus Estimates for IBM
Since Warren Buffett understands that his future returns will be a function of future earnings growth  the longer term  3 5 year  consensus trend line earnings growth rate for IBM is even more promising   It seems logical to me that if IBM comes close to meeting those earnings estimates  then the combination of potential P E ratio expansion and earnings growth promise to be quite rewarding 

Two High Valuation Cases Where Share Buybacks May Be Imprudent  Nike  NYSE NKE  and McDonalds
There are two other high profile companies that have been aggressively buying back their shares  they are Nike  NKE  and McDonald s  MCD    With the first example  Nike  there are a couple of facts that should clearly support current overvaluation   First of all  Nike grew earnings at the strong rate of 12 2  since 1996   But more importantly  the company s stock price rarely traded above a P E ratio of 20  the dark blue line on the graph  over that timeframe   However  since the beginning of 2013  Nike s stock price has continuously traded at a P E ratio valuation significantly above the long term norm 

What is really both amazing and confusing about Nike s recent high valuation is the fact that its earnings growth rate has actually fallen dramatically to 9 2  since fiscal year 2009  May    Clearly  Nike s stock has become popular  but that popularity is not clearly supported by any surge or acceleration in its operating results 

Nevertheless  in spite of Nike s current high valuation  management has been aggressively repurchasing shares outstanding   The share count has fallen from 948 million in fiscal year 2010  to only 863 million during their last quarter   If Nike s stock price were to revert to the mean  as logic would indicate it should  then significant shareholder capital would be destroyed   Consequently  where I would give IBM a high grade on their buyback program  I would give Nike a very low grade  and potentially even a failing grade 

My second example looks at McDonald s  who also has been repurchasing shares at a high valuation   However  in this case  I believe the argument could be made that McDonald s and its shareholders would be better served investing capital directly in their business   Their recently announced turnaround plan somewhat supports my contention 
Just as I did with Nike  the following earnings and price correlated graph followed by McDonald s share repurchase activity supports my contention   Once again  we see a case where management may be misguided by purchasing shares when valuations are high   Especially considering the fact that this company may  in fact  require capital investment in order to right their ship 

Determining Effective Capital Allocation   Invest or Buyback
Sound and effective capital allocation strategies and behaviors are complex   I would argue that it is na ve to believe that corporations can simply throw money at their company in order to stimulate or instigate greater growth   Consequently  when companies do not have investment opportunities that are greater than their cost of capital  it is both prudent and rational for them to return cash to the shareholders 
The two primary methods of returning cash to the shareholder are through share repurchases and or dividends   When a company needs their capital to grow  they should retain more capital and invest accordingly   However  as companies become large and mature  investment opportunities that will improve the growth of their businesses decrease   Consequently  it is common that management teams of large and mature companies do not require retaining all their earnings to fund growth or maintain their businesses 
On October  2009 J P  Morgan published a report titled    and in that report they presented a new capital allocation framework that provides insights into the complexity that corporations face when deciding how to best utilize their capital as follows 

In 2007 a  in the Journal of Applied Corporate Finance that provided additional insights into the challenges facing corporate management teams and directors for analyzing capital allocation strategies that create shareholder value   The following are a few excerpts that are appropriate to the thesis of this article 
 In this article  I begin by presenting a relatively simple life cycle valuation model that is rooted in both discounted cash flow  DCF  principles and the economic concept of competitive corporate life cycles  Then  with the aim of grounding corporate governance in sound principles of value creation  I recommend that corporate boards undertake a dialogue with management about the content of a periodic Shareholder Value Review  SVR   Although mutual agreement is expected  the board must insist that management respond to the board s oversight authority 
The Life Cycle Valuation Model
Ever since Miller and Modigliani published their explanation of how discounted cash flow  DCF  principles can be used to value a firm  DCF has been at the core of much valuation modeling  Broadly speaking  DCF says that the value of a firm is the sum of its future expected stream of net cash receipts  operating cash flows less cash outlays for reinvestment  discounted to a present value at the firm s cost of capital 
When investors expect a company to achieve returns on future investments that are just equal to the cost of capital  those new investments create zero additional economic wealth in which case  the firm s total market value would be roughly equal to the value of its existing assets  To the extent investors expect returns on future investments to be greater than the cost of capital  those investments will create value  and to the extent returns are expected to fall below this standard  value will be destroyed 
Moreover  for companies where future investments are expected to earn returns above the cost of capital  greater wealth is created when more capital is invested  especially when such wealth creating opportunities can be extended farther into the future  In this sense  a company s current value depends on competitive life cycle patterns that reflect expected future economic returns and reinvestment rates 
As illustrated in Figure 1  the idea of competitive life cycles is based on the premise that competition and capital flows operate over the longer term to force companies  economic returns toward the cost of capital  This relationship was succinctly summarized by George Stigler in 1963  when he wrote 
There is no more important proposition in economic theory than that  under competition  the rate of return on investment tends toward equality in all industries  Entrepreneurs will seek to leave relatively unprofitable industries and enter relatively profitable industries  
The primary point being  that as corporations become big and mature  it becomes exceedingly difficult to find suitable places to invest their capital that will in actuality create shareholder value   The following  Corporate Competitive Life cycle  graphic from the above paper presents a simplified model of this phenomenon 

Summary and Conclusions
Share buybacks are neither good nor bad  because in reality they can be either or both   When a company s stock is being highly valued by the market  buying back shares at those high valuations can lead to long term shareholder capital destruction   The rules and principles of only investing when valuation is sound equally apply to the corporation as it does individual investors   If it s a bad idea for us to invest in a stock at a high valuation  it s also a bad idea for the company to behave that way 
On the other hand  when valuations are sound  or better yet  excessively low  the best investment opportunity a company may have is to invest in their own stock   Therefore  we as investors should not hold a prejudicial view of share buybacks   Instead  we should evaluate and judge a company s share buyback policy on an individual case by case basis   Prejudging anything in the general sense is both illogical and wrong 
Furthermore  as it is with all matters regarding investing  decisions should always be driven by a rigorous factual based analysis  There is no room  nor should there be  for opinion or broad prejudicial generalizations   Clearly the answer to the question whether a company should buy back their shares or not can simply be stated as   it depends

176885,398401,IBM,Facebook IBM In Commerce Collaboration,opinion,"Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  have entered into a partnership to develop enhanced marketing solutions  The Facebook IBM Commerce collaboration is intended to develop people based marketing solutions that would also maximize the value for brands 
Marketers and brand managers will be able to leverage Facebook s customer insights from its rich user base and Custom Audience  an ad targeting feature  along with IBM s marketing cloud and analytics capabilities to offer more personalized and targeted advertisements for users  Furthermore  the combined capabilities of Facebook and IBM will allow brands to strategically select users that are more likely to respond to advertisements thereby allowing them to communicate more effectively 
Additionally  brands can benefit from IBM s Journey Designer offering that is designed to enhance customer engagement while adding value to user experience  Journey Designer is complemented by Journey Analytics in order to draw deeper insights from customer response  All in all  the two companies have come together to allow brands to create improved and responsive ads that will provide value to their customers 
Most importantly  Facebook will be the first company to be a part of IBM Commerce THINKLab  a novel research and collaboration environment that allows companies and brands to come together for the development of advanced technologies for offering more customized user experiences  THINKLab will serve as a platform for bringing people from different domains like researchers  social media experts  designers as well as other professionals under one roof 
The advertisement industry is evolving with more and more retailers and companies moving to social media platforms to market their offerings  Advancement of technology and increasing adoption of social media across the world have given brands a platform to reach customers directly and improvise their offerings according to the latter s requirements  This is a win win strategy for both the brands and their customers  While customers will have a personalized experience  brands will benefit from increased loyalty and brand value 
According to research firm  eMarketer  social network ad spending is expected to reach  35 98 billion by 2017 that is 16  of global digital ad spending 
So it is no wonder that most of the social media companies are vying to pull more ad dollars to their platform  In fact  last year  IBM had partnered with Twitter  NYSE TWTR  in order to integrate the micro blogging site s data into its own products for predicting market trends for its clients 
We believe that the aforementioned collaboration is a positive for both Facebook and IBM  Of late  Facebook has been putting in a lot of effort to improve the quality of its advertisements  This initiative  it seems  is in perfect alignment with the company s growth plans  IBM  on the other hand  has been investing in higher growth markets like cloud computing  Big Data  mobile etc  This collaboration is a positive for the company as it furthers its plans to emerge as a key provider of advanced technological solutions

176907,398423,IBM,IBM Feels The Heat from FX Headwinds  Analysts Offer Mixed Ratings,opinion,"International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  released first quarter 2015 earnings on April 20  IBM s earnings pointed to signs that the company is successfully transitioning into a Cloud based service  though earnings were significantly impacted by a strong U S  dollar 

IBM reported non GAAP diluted earnings per share of  2 91  above the analyst consensus of  2 81 and marking a 9  year over year increase  Big Blue posted quarterly revenue of  19 6 billion  just shy of analysts  estimate of  19 7 billion  Revenue decreased 12  year over year  but IBM pointed out that it is a flat year over year difference when adjusting for currency and divested businesses  Looking forward  IBM expects to post full year 2015 GAAP diluted earnings per share between  14 17 and  14 92  and non GAAP diluted earnings per share between  15 75 and  16 50 

This is the eighth report out of nine quarters that IBM has missed the revenue mark  though many investors were pleased with the company s posted earnings per share  Foreign currency headwinds  as IBM noted in its report  had a sizeable impact on earnings because a substantial amount of IBM s business is outside the US 

IBM has been transitioning from a traditional hardware business into a Cloud and software based company  Software business has been declining  with revenue down 8  year over year to  5 2 billion  However  revenue from strategic imperatives increased 30  year over year  with Cloud revenue specifically up 75   Furthermore  IBM s business analytics revenue increased 12  year over year  but IBM notes it as a 20  year over year increase when adjusting for currency and divested businesses  Many analysts are confident that these figures illustrate the success of IBM s transition to the Cloud  despite IBM being a late comer to Cloud technology  Martin Schroeter  IBM CFO  commented in a conference call   We re transforming our business and seeing signs that our transformation is succeeding  

IBM s report triggered a slew of mixed ratings from analysts who were eager to weigh in the stock 

After IBM released earnings  analyst  of Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of  198  White noted IBM s  healthy  first quarter performance believes  this performance is especially encouraging given a fierce foreign exchange headwind and a volatile macro environment   White continued   Given scepticism around this turnaround and continued negative sentiment around IBM  the stock is trading at just 10 0x our CY 16 EPS estimate with an attractive 2 7  dividend yield  

White has a 70  success rate recommending stocks with a  18 6  average return per recommendation 

Separately  analyst  of Credit Suisse  NYSE CS  reiterated an Underperform rating on IBM after first quarter earnings with a  125 price target  Garcha is bearish on the stock because he still believes IBM faces  secular and structural challenges   Consequently  he continued   guidance could again be challenging to achieve operationally   Garcha anticipates a  multi year painful turnaround  for IBM and consequently slightly lowered his 2015 EPS estimate though slightly raised his 2016 EPS estimates  His concern is that  as the mainframe cycle fades the secular issues remaining with Software and Services remain a headwind for the business  Garcha has a 51  success rate recommending stocks with a  8 2  average return per recommendation 

Also following the report  analyst  of UBS reiterated a Neutral rating on IBM but raised his price target from  160 to  170  Milunovich commented   The stock may be bottoming along with free cash flow  but we consider it too soon to declare victory and remain at Neutral   The analyst still has several concerns    1  CFO Schroeter provided more cash flow detail  including a larger than expected  2bn positive swing from less cash tax hit this year but indications it would be a headwind in 2016   2  software was down 2   a slight improvement but reflecting market share loss   3  GBS revenue was soft due to weakness in the US  and GTS pretax was off by 26  YoY   4  loss rate and reserve coverage are rising in Global Financing

International Business Machines  NYSE IBM 
IBM crapped the bed following its earnings report in October and has not cleaned it up yet  The last 6 months has been a tight consolidation between 150 and 165  with the price action since January showing a series of higher lows  Some promise  A break higher now would give a target of 180 on a break of the ascending triangle higher over 165  Heading into earnings it is testing the top of the channel and horizontal resistance at 165 with the RSI pushing into the bullish range  while the MACD is turning higher  There is support lower at 159 and 154 followed by 150  There is resistance above at 165 and 170 followed by 178 67 and a gap fill to 180  The reaction to the last 6 earnings reports has been a move of about 3 83  on average or  6 35 making for an expected range of 158 75 to 171 50  The at the money weekly April Straddles suggest a similar  6 15 move by Expiry with Implied Volatility at 40  above the May at 22   Short interest is moderate at 2 8   Open interest is big at the 165 Strike and below at the 160 Strike  but big enough from 152 5 to 175 that it may not influence it this week

176924,398440,IBM,European Futures Higher Ahead Of Zew,opinion,"European markets have recovered some of their losses yesterday which took place last week but we are still far away from home and we need some serious momentum and strength from investors if we are going to surpass the previous highs  With Greece  being the thorny issue for traders  stout commitment is missing its charm  If there was a time when the u certainty about the Greek future was anchored towards its peak  it must be during these days  as investors have no clue what the Greek finance minister has hidden under his sleeves this time and if the Greek government will be able to find a reliable solution with its creditors which will give them a reasonable breathing space While we have bond market on one extreme end   Germany  where investors are willing to pay to lend their money with most of the bond yields trading below zero and on the other side  we have the bond yields sky high  Greece  where the 10 year yield is above 13   Both GG are traveling in a complete opposite direction representing that bond market is out of whack  Time is not on their side  with day and every second passed  there is only beat playing and it s keeps on getting louder that Greece will default on its debt and a strong possibility exist that they can be kicked out of the euro  Although  we maintain our view that such an activity cannot be without its consequence and could bring a much bigger episode of uncertainty than Lehman crisis Back in the U S   the strong dollar remains the major concern among export based companies  IBM  NYSE IBM  earnings were depressed yesterday and a major dent took place on the back of a strong dollar  As more and more companies will report this week  investors will get much clear idea how well these companies have hedged their currency risk and how badly the stronger dollar has made them less attractive In terms of economic calendar  we have the German Zew economic data due this morning and the forecast is for 55 6  A better number could certainly help the DAX to recover its losses

176937,398453,IBM,WANdisco  Alignments Could Make It An Obvious Strategic Target ,opinion,"Hadoop battle lines being drawnWandisco s Plc  LONDON WAND  full year results were as expected  with the late surge in big data deal flow driving 18  bookings growth  Revenues grew by 40   while increased investment widened the EBITDA loss to  17 9m  We see the company s joining of the Open Data Platform initiative as positive long term  However  there is a risk that the drawing of battle lines in the Hadoop ecosystem will prolong decision cycles in the near term  as could a recent restructuring of the sales team  We adjust our estimates to reflect this 

Aligning with the Open Data Platfom  ODP  campThe battle lines in the roll out of big data Hadoop were drawn recently with the formation of the Open Data Platfom by a number of major big data vendors  including Pivotal  EMC  NYSE EMC   WANdisco partners  Hortonworks  NASDAQ HDP   IBM  NYSE IBM  and now WANdisco  Cloudera  also a partner  which  along with MapR has increasingly focused on adding proprietary features to its distribution  was a notable absentee  The company s sales collaborations will now be focused principally on ODP vendors   an initiative that should be supported by the launch of WANdisco Fusion  a product that promises to bring the benefits of WANdisco s technology across multiple open and ODP compatible Hadoop platforms   as well as being able to connect with systems outside the ODP  such as Cloudera  Ultimately  we feel that the ODP should provide a powerful platform for WANdisco and the company reports that its pipeline has strengthened since joining  However  it will take time for the ODP to bed down  and purchasing decisions may be delayed in the meantime Estimate revisionsWe adjust our estimates to reflect this  Our FY bookings figure is reduced by 4   all on the ALM side of the business   but with big data bookings likely to be more H2 weighted  the drop through of bookings to revenues is lower  Hence FY15e revenue is reduced by 7   This is offset by lower costs  so at the EBITDAC  after capitalized R D  level  losses are reduced by 6  but  with a higher percentage of costs likely to be expensed  EBITDA loss increases by 10  to  18 9m Valuation  Potential to scale and strategic valueWANdisco s EV sales ratio of 7 5x clearly demands a continued rapid scale up in bookings and revenues and then earnings  However  we believe the market opportunity in big data should support very rapid growth  while the company s IP underpinned  indirect model should support strong margins  The alignment of WANdisco with the ODP  alongside other much larger infrastructure software players  could potentially make the company a more obvious strategic target

176940,398456,IBM,Equity Pair Trade  Long Conoco Phillips  Short Chevron ,opinion,"For some time  stock prices of two oil and gas majors Conoco Phillips  NYSE COP  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  have approximately tracked each other   The result has been a fairly flat price of the equity pair  long Chevron  short Conoco  The graph below shows the performance of a pair ratio of 1 Chevron  long  to 2 Conoco  short  

Over the last week  the Conoco price rose 3 6   to  63 84  whilst Chevron firmed 5 3   to  107 03  to give a 1 7  increase in the price of the pair  This was accompanied by a flat fair value of the pair  analyzed in the table below  


As can be seen  the pair was well hedged to movements in its drivers  particularly the US dollar and oil price 
An excess of price increase over fair value increase would normally be a signal to sell or go short the pair  ie  short Chevron  buy Conoco   Following this signal over the last 90 days would have provided an annualized gain  on gross   long plus short   exposure  of 35 7  with volatility of 14 9   before trading costs  
We have also applied this methodology to a number of other pairs of related stocks   NYSE IBM   NYSE Oracle    NYSE Wells Fargo   NYSE JPMorgan    NYSE AT T   NYSE Verizon  and  NYSE XOM   Royal Dutch Shell   The portfolio of all these pairs traded using the disparity between price and fair value change  as above  has returned an annualized 17 3  with volatility of 5 8  over the 90 day back test period 
We find a fair value of the Chevron Conoco pair below the current price  suggesting that the pair is overvalued and confirming the signal analyzed above  Trading the pair using this indicator over the 90 day back test period showed a 41 4  annualized return with volatility of 14 8  
Volatility
The graph below shows the sensitivity of the pair s fair value to its drivers  

The graph suggests that the pair is reasonably well insulated from driver shocks  This is reflected in our finding that  on its own  the volatility of the pair  traded as suggested in this article  was only 2  points higher than the S P 500  The return was 25  points higher 
As can be seen  the Chevron Conoco pair is slightly negatively correlated to the US dollar  Our fair value indicators suggest some short term upside in the US dollar index which would assist the pair trade recommended above 
The historical volatility of the pair over the last 90 days  at 15   is lower than the volatility of each of Chevron  24   and Conoco  28   individually  This reflects positive correlation between the two stocks and hence risk netting by pairing them 
Held as part of a US equity portfolio  lower volatility and higher return may be achieved  A portfolio of 5  allocated to the pair  traded as recommended in this article  and 95  allocated to the S P 500 index had a volatility of 12 3  over the last 90 days vs 12 8  for 100  in the S P 500  The annualized returns were 9 1   5  allocated to pair  vs 8 2   100  S P 500  ",2015-03-23,Philip Baker,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/equity-pair-trade:-long-conoco-phillips,-short-chevron-245871",245871

176944,398460,IBM,China Just Crossed A Landmark Threshold,opinion,"Back in July 2013  the think tank  predicted that China s outbound investment 

   could very well exceed  80 billion  by the end of the year  and is on course to breach  100 billion by about 2016 

With all due respect to the Heritage Foundation  China just beat the forecast by a couple of years  exceeding the  100 billion mark at the end of 2014  For the first time  in fact  China invested more capital outside its own borders than it did inside  As legendary Major League Baseball player and coach Yogi Berra once quipped   It s tough to make predictions  especially about the future   Be that as it may  it s now estimated that within the next decade  China will have invested a staggering  1 25 trillion into the global market  It was once said that the sun never sets on the British Empire  Now the same might be said of China s growing influence around the world   As China s domestic infrastructure expansion matures and the yuan s purchasing power rises  Chinese companies are seeking overseas opportunities so they re not pigeonholed in any one marketplace   says Xian Liang  one of our China region portfolio managers When you consider world economies using  China has actually surpassed America in the second half last year  One of the most headline worthy developments is China s  16 3 billion infrastructure initiative intended to revive trading routes along the centuries old Silk Road  Thousands of miles of railways  roads and pipelines will link Beijing to major markets all over Asia  Africa and Europe  Many are already likening the new Silk Road undertaking to the Marshall Plan  the large scale U S  program that aided Europe following World War II and helped secure America s role as the world s leading superpower 
Into Africa
We all know that China is a big place with lots of people  As such  it requires unfathomable amounts of resources  for which it s spending historic amounts of money  Between 2005 and June 2013  China spent  202 billion globally on energy and power   100 billion on metals and  18 billion on agriculture  Much of this capital is being channeled into Africa  home to about 60 percent of the world s uncultivated arable land  If irrigated and optimized properly  Africa s land has the potential to supply the same percentage of the world s food needs  The continent is also home to 30 percent of the world s minerals  with a large percentage of the deposits being platinum  diamonds and gold  Since 2005  China s spending in Africa has jumped 30 percent  and in 2009 it became the continent s largest trading partner  surpassing the U S  Every year it exchanges around  160 billion in goods with Africa  but with China s middle class growing in number and demanding a higher quality of living  we expect that figure to surge  Its largest trading partner among all African countries is South Africa  Some economists are suggesting that Africa is shaping up to be  China s Second Continent   the title of New York Times journalist Howard W  French s 2014 book  Just as the Roman Empire reshaped and brought together disparate European cultures through its sophisticated network of roads  China s presence in Africa promises to have a long lasting effect on the continent s financial wellbeing  Roads  mines  hospitals  schools and other important infrastructure are being financed and built at a rapid pace  Last November  for example  China Rail Construction Corp  signed a  12 billion high speed rail construction deal with Nigeria  
Funneling Capital Around the World
Back in December  I discussed at length Premier Li Keqiang s desire to turn China into the go to country for the world s high speed rail construction  The country also shows signs of becoming a major creditor on the scale of the World Bank  According to  it s already overtaken other nations as a  primary source of credit for the developing world   The article continues   When China invests in one country  it quickly becomes the biggest creditor  sometimes to the extent of altering the economic and diplomatic scenario   Many developing countries now owe China many times more what they receive from the International Monetary Fund  Last week  for instance  we learned that Chinese President Xi Jinping promised  250 billion in investment in Latin American countries over the next decade  China will be buying copper from Chile and Peru  oil from Venezuela and soybeans from Brazil and Argentina  Xi and Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner also agreed on a deal that would see China cooperate with the Latin American country on two nuclear power plants  It s not just developing countries China has invested in  Since 2007  the U S  has received around  72 billion  Among the American brands that Chinese companies have purchased are AMC Entertainment Holdings  NYSE AMC    IBM s  NYSE IBM  personal computer division and meat giant Smithfield Foods  WH Group  HK 0288   which owns the Shuanghui brand  acquired Smithfield in 2013 and is now introducing imported U S  pork to the local Chinese market   Because of various food related scandals in the last five to seven years  the average Chinese citizen tends to trust foreign food brands more than domestic brands   Xian says  This is just one of many examples of the Chinese preferring American brands to others  Buick  General Motors Company  NYSE GM    the best selling automobile manufacturer in the Asian country  sold 1 million vehicles in 2013 810 000 of those in China  
China Ramping up Business Creation 
Indeed  the U S  continues to be the engine of the world in a time of Chinese and European deflationary risks  Having said that  I m troubled by the fact that American business start ups have been steadily declining over the past 30 years  For the first time in 2008  the  death rate  of businesses crossed above the  birth rate   Although Gallup says that  there has been no definitive answer as to why the rate of U S  startups has declined so precipitously   it seems likely that ever expanding and restrictive government regulations play a huge role  Now compare this to what s happening in China  Back in October  I pointed out that China has slashed hundreds of lines of red tape in an effort to jumpstart economic growth and encourage business startups  Even though its real GDP growth is slowing  the country has become much more efficient at fostering business activity  Disclosure  Past performance does not guarantee future results  Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure  as well as economic and political risk  By investing in a specific geographic region  a regional fund s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio  The Emerging Europe Fund invests more than 25  of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil   gas or banking industries  The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund s performance more volatile  Fund portfolios are actively managed  and holdings may change daily  Holdings are reported as of the most recent quarter end  Holdings in the China Region Fund and Emerging Europe Fund as a percentage of net assets as of 12 31 2014  AMC Entertainment  Inc   China Rail Construction Corp  2 00  China Region Fund  International Business Machines Corp  0 00   Smithfield Foods 0 00   WH Group 0 00   All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice  Some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor  By clicking the link s  above  you will be directed to a third party website s   U S  Global Investors does not endorse all information supplied by this these website s  and is not responsible for its their content ",2015-02-09,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-just-crossed-a-landmark-threshold-241357,241357

176974,398490,IBM,2015  Why It Won t Be A Good Year To Own Stocks,opinion,"When you take all the fluff out of the markets  like artificially low interest rates and other easy monetary support from the Federal Reserve  we need to realize  at the end of the day  that stocks trade on a fundamental called corporate earnings  And going into 2015  as I ll detail below  corporate earnings are weak at best 
Earnings Guidance Dismal  Growth Rate in Slump
As of December 12  106 companies on the S P 500 have issued guidance on their corporate earnings for this final quarter of 2014  Of these companies  85 have issued negative guidance  while only 21 have issued positive guidance 
In other words  for every one company issuing positive guidance  there are more than four issuing negative guidance  Of all the S P 500 companies  80  that are issuing guidance for 4Q14 expect their earnings to be dismal   Source  FactSet  December 12  2014  
Analysts are cutting estimates very quickly  too  At the end of September  for 4Q14  analysts were expecting corporate earnings for the S P 500 companies to grow by 8 4   This rate has now dropped to just three percent a decline of more than 64  in estimates   Source  Ibid  
And the real problem is revenue growth it s just not there 
For the fourth quarter we are in right now  revenue for S P 500 companies is expected to grow by just 1 4   This is below the average of 3 5  over the last three years telling me that American companies aren t able to sell more 
Earnings Delusion and Trickery
As real earnings and revenue growth is a struggle  companies resort to stock buyback programs to push per share earnings higher a grand illusion 
In the third quarter of 2014  S P 500 companies spent  143 4 billion on share buybacks up 16  from the same period a year earlier  On a trailing 12 month basis  S P 500 companies spent  567 2 billion on share buybacks  representing an increase of 27  year over year   Source  FactSet  December 16  2014  
In the third quarter of this year  an astonishing 75  of the S P 500 companies bought back their shares 
Here s just one example of how share buybacks give investors a false impression 
For the first nine months of 2014  International Business Machines Corporation  NYSE IBM  a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average reported net income of  6 44 per diluted share  In the same period a year ago  this company reported net income of  9 27  Looks like IBM s earnings declined by 30 5  on the surface   Source  International Business Machines Corporation  October 20  2014  
But digging deeper  we find that in the first nine months of this year  IBM reduced its share count by 8 6  from 1 11 billion shares to 1 01 million shares outstanding  If IBM didn t purchase any of it shares  its earnings per share would be  5 88 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2014  a decline of 36 5   With the help of its stock buyback program  IBM essentially improved its earnings per share by 16  
I can t stress this enough  the only thing that s keeping key stock indices alive is the Federal Reserve  For some time now  my belief has been that the easy money policies of the Fed have supported the stock market  And stock buybacks are one way that has happened by keeping interest rates artificially low for so long  public companies have been able to borrow billions of dollars on the cheap to buy back their own shares and support their market valuations 
If the S P 500 is already trading near a record high price earnings multiple of 20 08  while corporate earnings are growing at only three percent  supported by stock buyback programs  and revenue growth is only 1 4   a less manipulated number   how can stocks continue to move higher 
The stock market bubble will burst  It is only a matter of time

177002,398518,IBM,The Global Economy s Last Gasp,opinion,It is difficult to find the motivation to write about the state of the global economy these days  if only because there is not much left to say  I feel like I am composing multiple obituaries for the same long dead corpse  Most of the Liberty Movement and I suspect a small portion of the mainstream market understand that there is no tangible or legitimate recovery  let alone a stable fiscal ladder to rest our feet upon  There is literally nothing left to the financial system but rigged statistics  false promises  and ever expanding debt  In fact  the concept of debt creation is the only thing holding our facade of an economy together You and I probably find this rather strange  We come from a long forgotten school of economics  in which demand  supply  and savings actually mean something in terms of our fiscal health  I have come across many mainstream economic acolytes and cultists in recent months who disregard ALL logic and reason  forsaking the realities of demand based trade and immersing themselves in a grand delusion in which central bank generated debt and inflation are the real source of  prosperity   I feel sorry for them in a way  because the truth is right in front of their faces  and yet  they will never see it  not until they are buried alive in it Nothing makes this problem more apparent than the behavior of equities in the past month Stocks are  of course  a sham of the highest magnitude  but they do still say something about the greater truth behind our financial condition  The fact that many market traders clearly KNOW that it s all a farce  and are actually banking and betting on the scam  tells me exactly how close we are to the end of the line  The recent near 10  drop in the Dow at the beginning of Fall must have certainly been a shock for the day trading community as well as mainstream pundits  The assumption for the past few years has been that central bank stimulus guarantees a constantly growing bull market  and to experience a considerable decline in equities even while QE was still in action was at least a noticeable wake up call I suspect that this decline in markets was not necessarily planned by the central banks  and was a stumble in their scheme to keep stocks elevated until after the QE taper had settled  It was also a stumble I expected a little earlier  around the end of Summer to be exact  Since the drop  central banks and the mainstream media have reacted forcefully to manipulate public perception as well as investor optimism  but this cannot go on for much longer In almost every instance of market decline  financial news group Reuters has injected false rumors of more stimulus from the European Central Bank  This was also the case in October as markets began to crash  These rumors were later dashed by the Financial Times  but not before the mere mention of more fiat stimulus from any central bank sent stocks soaring yet again This also occurred when middle management Federal Reserve member John Williams hinted in interviews of the possibility of  QE4  if the economy began to show signs of regression  Williams  of course  has no say in the decision to reintroduce QE  but this did not matter to investors  who immediately latched onto the meaningless news like anxious children  and threw their money back into stocks again And  most recently  Japan s central bank announced a sudden and surprising re ignition of stimulus measures to the tune of 80 Trillion Yen a year  This announcement  once again  sent global stocks skyrocketing  even though it was a stark admission by Japan s financial elite that all their inflationary printing efforts for the past several years have failed miserably  As I have warned in the past  when bad news becomes good news because bad news promises more central bank intervention  the economy is truly on the verge of a reckoning Hopefully  we can all see the trend taking place here  With the end of the Federal Reserve taper now complete  and questions circling as to when interest rates will be raised  a market volatility not seen since 2008 2009 is returning  The ONLY measure that has slowed the crash is the use of false news stories hinting at further stimulus  as well as futile efforts by other central banks to pick up where the Federal Reserve left off  This shows that the investment world is so thoroughly addicted to QE that even the mere hint of another small fix of their favorite drug is enough to get them out of bed and excited  They know that the entire system is rigged by central banks  and they don t care  In fact  they revel in it  The only goal of your average day trader now is to profit on the scam for as long as humanly possible  even though the ultimate conclusion of the scam will mean the utter destruction of their profits and the end of their way of life I hate to use a cinema analogy for a very real threat  but investors today remind me of Joe Pantoliano s character in  The Matrix   the guy who is fully aware that the Matrix is an illusion  but wants to experience the pleasure of the illusion all the same  So much so that he doesn t mind being exploited like a slave by the system  and is willing to sacrifice all measure of truth and even the future just to get a taste of the fantasy again But what is the reality that the central banks are trying to hide  and why  This I have written about in detail on literally hundreds of occasions  so I will only cover the very latest news briefly here  and why I think the overall dynamic is about to change for the worse Global exports  and thus consumer demand  are plunging  Germany  the only pillar left to prop up the failing European Union  has experienced a severe decline in exports not seen since 2009 China  the largest exporter and importer in the world  and Chinese companies  have been caught in a number of instances using fraudulent invoices to artificially inflate their own export numbers  in some cases reporting 50  more exported goods than had actually existed China s manufacturing has also declined for the past five months  exposing the nature of its inflated export stats and indicating a global slowdown The Baltic Dry Index  a measure of global shipping rates for raw goods  and thus a measure of demand for shipping  continues to drag along near historic lows The U S  consumer  the only economic asset the U S  has besides the dollar s world reserve status   has seen declines in spending as well as wages In the meantime  long term jobless Americans continue to fall off welfare rolls by the millions  making unemployment numbers look good  but the overall future picture look terrible as participation rates dissolve into the ether of government statistics How is such poverty being hidden  Foodstamps  Plain and simple  Nearly 50 million Americans now subsist on food stamp programs today  and this number shows no signs of dropping  In states like Illinois  two people sign up for food assistance for every citizen that happens to find a job But this is all rudimentary  Most analysts in the Liberty Movement agree that our fiscal structure is on the edge of collapse  what they tend to bicker about is HOW and WHEN the structure will collapse Guessing market declines has been extremely difficult in the midst of a fiat soaked fiscal environment  Nothing is ever quite what it seems  My predictions of a 10  drop by the end of Summer were off by three weeks  Because of the nature of QE stimulus manipulation of the Dow  our only real guide has been the timeline of the Fed taper  and the fact that major banks have been relying on fed fiat to continually cycle capital into equities through the use of low interest loans to corporations and the stock buyback scam  Company buybacks have given steady boosts to the markets at least since 2008  and many corporations are using up to 50  of their  profits  just to continue buying their own stocks This strategy  however  is reaching a point of diminishing returns as many companies are issuing too much debt in the process  International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  is a perfect example of a company that has hit the ceiling on stock buybacks  This odd coordinated attempt by corporations and central banks to keep markets propped up even as companies sacrifice whatever debt stability they had left indicates a state of collusion between such institutions that goes far beyond the mere idea of  mutually assured greed   Since at least 2008  there has indeed been a  conspiracy  amongst banks and international companies to generate a massive stock bubble designed to keep the masses calm and placated  However  these groups understand  better than many give them credit for  that such measures will have to end  or be revealed With the taper finished and QE money drying up  it is important to ask a few questions  For example  how are companies going to continue to accumulate capital to dump into their own stocks if fed money is becoming scarce and consumer spending is in decline  And  if they can t continue stock buybacks because of a lack of funds or an overburden of debt  how are equities markets going to stay afloat And what about government debt  As it stands now  foreign interest in U S  treasury bonds is waning  The vast majority of new bonds sold are short term  Until now  the Fed has been the primary buyer of long term debt  snapping up 10 year bonds from the market while other investors lose confidence in America s ability to pay off liabilities in the future  Now that QE is over  who is going to buy the ever expanding U S  government debt  I aimed this question recently at a Fed cultist and his response was  Well obviously somebody will buy it    though he couldn t specify The spike in short term debt purchases after the end of QE3 was also predictable  but it can only be sustained IF stocks begin to fall considerably yet again  Think about it  interest in U S  debt has been on the decline for years  not just because foreign banks are shifting away from the dollar  but also because stocks have been a much more attractive investment with greater returns guaranteed by Fed QE  The taper announces a violent change in circumstances  The only way for interest in U S  debt to be energized  even for a short time  is for stocks to crash  leaving bonds as the only safe haven left  I discussed this development in detail in my article  The Final Swindle Of Private American Wealth Has Begun  at the beginning of this year  All other investment avenues seem to be in decline  from foreign markets and forex  to commodities like oil  Even gold and silver have taken a hit  For the average investor  if a rout in stocks occurs  they will immediately jump into bonds  This plays into my theory on the coming financial end game  which I will be discussing in my next article Investor s are counting on an eventual QE4  but I think this might also be wishful thinking At the end of 2013  I predicted the Fed would indeed follow through with the taper of QE3  and that they would drastically reduce stimulus measures  I believe this is in preparation for a major implosion of U S  markets in particular  The whole point of the taper is to support the illusion that the U S  economy has recovered  and that the Fed has  accomplished its mission   When a crash does take place  I think it will be ALLOWED to move freely and that new QE intervention will not be taken  I have no doubt this crash will be blamed on an outside force or act of fate  the ebola outbreak  which is doubling in cases every three weeks  is a perfect possible catalyst   and that banks will be absolved of all blame in the mainstream A coming crash is not only my personal view  It is important to note that behind the background noise of the recovery party  international bankers are sending a very different message about economic health On the same day as the Federal Reserve announced the end of QE3  former chairman Alan Greenspan gave a speech to the Council On Foreign Relations in which he lamented that the QE unwind would be painful  that stimulus measures had not achieved their goals in the past  and that gold might be a good investment today The International Monetary Fund and the ECB also released statements warning that  accommodative stimulus policies  could contribute to economic volatility  That is to say  stimulus might be setting the stage for fiscal instability  The IMF claims that  bold action  is required to  reset  the global system And  the ever present overlords at the Bank Of International Settlements have posted a stark warning about our financial future  predicting a  violent reversal  in markets  The last time the BIS made such a prediction was in the summer of 2007  just before the derivatives crash  But this is the M O  of the central banks  to warn of coming calamity just before the event  but not long enough before the event to make any difference  They present themselves as prognosticators of economic future  but in reality  they are the instigators of every disaster they predict I do not know how the markets will react to the likely landslide  victory  by Republicans in mid term elections  can one ever be  victorious  in a rigged contest    but what I do know is that a Republican majority offers an even greater opportunity for further collapse  Negative movements in markets that have been obstructed through manipulation can now be unleashed and then blamed on  government gridlock   or the inability of conservatives to  compromise  fiscally  A Republican shift in government only offers more cover for a collapse that is slated to occur regardless I believe that the admissions of financial danger by internationalists  the sharp drop in stocks at the beginning of fall  the reversal of the political theater  and the fact that mainstream investors now recognize the illegitimacy of the markets yet continue with the scam anyway  signals the last gasp of the global economy  I expect increasing market instability from this point on  as well as numerous geopolitical distractions which will be blamed for the fiscal chaos  I have left out my explanation of the final end game so that I can cover it more fully in my next article  Needless to say  the coming storm is a deliberately engineered one  meant to achieve very specific goals  including a fearful and panicked populace  easy to manipulate as the system goes off the rails for the last time

EURO STOXX  XETRA SDJE50  begins a Panic decline 

The EuroStoxx 50 Index fell through all Model supports and is very near triggering its Broadening Wedge formation at 3020 00 The reversal may be especially bearish due to the failure to make a new high for the second time and the Broadening Wedge pattern that has a high 94  success rate  source  Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns  by Thomas Bulkowski  P 72  
 Bloomberg  Tumbling oil prices and the worst rout in Greek equities since 1987 sentEuropean shares for their biggest weekly slump in more than three years 
Today s 2 6 percent plunge in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index was the largest in almost two months and extended the week s losses to 5 8 percent  That s more than double the five day drop in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index and Standard   Poor s 500 Index 
With oil tumbling to a five year low  European energy companies slumped to their lowest level since April 2009 and commodity producers had their worst week since May 2012  In Greece  anxiety that voters will kick out leaders committed to the nation s bailout sent the ASE Index down 20 percent  making it this year s worst performing equity market after Russia

The Yen had a reversal week  closing above the Weekly Cycle Bottom support at 83 97 The Panic Cycle Pivot last weekend had its effect The rally that follows may take XJY back to 110 00 or higher  It appears capable of extending its rally through mid January  This means a major source of market liquidity is drying up 
 Businessweek  The yen had its biggest weekly advance against the dollar in 16 months as the market contagion from the rout in crude oil prices drives investors to haven currencies and Japan prepares for national elections

The Nikkei also reverses 

The Nikkei has achieved its Cycle Top resistance at 18113 60  then fell toward Model supports It appears that the upper trendline of its Orthodox Broadening Top has provided stiff resistance  The Broadening formations represent a market that is out of control and has a highly emotional public participation Last weekend s dual Trading Cycle Pivot appeared to have enough force to stop the rally

Crude exceeded an intermediate term target for this week that was given to subscribers  Minor Wave 5 is incomplete and may be an Ending diagonal that could require one more brief bounce back to 60 00followed by a panic decline  10  or more  before the Diagonal is complete  Upon completion  WTIC may exceed the Cup with Handle target illustrated on the chart  If the Cycles Model  or its interpretation  is correct  we may see the decline completed by the end of December 
 Bloomberg  Benchmark U S  oil prices extended losses below  58 a barrel as the International Energy Agency cut its global demand forecast for the fourth time in five months

 In the short term  supply is still stronger than demand   said Gareth Lewis Davies  a London based analyst at BNP Paribas SA   We are going to see further inventory builds in the first half  hence the realization of further pressure on oil prices  
China stocks reverse course 

The Shanghai Indexpeaked on Tuesday as suggested last week  but closed the week with a small gain  It did so in a 600 point round trip The parabola may be over  but they unwind very quickly  so we may expect to see a complete retracement by the next Cycle low near the end of the year 
 Bloomberg  China s stocks rose  capping a fifth week of gains for the benchmark index  as slowing growth in industrial production boosted speculation the government will take more steps to support the economy

  BKX reversed from the upper trendline of an Orthodox Broadening Top to challenge Intermediate term support at 71 73 This completes both point 5 of the Broadening Top and Intermediate Wave 5 of the rally from June 4  2012  The rally took 30 1 months for all the stock indices  BKX now must decline beneath its mid Cycle support at 64 20 to complete point 6 of the formation 
 Forbes  The ruble is on the skids  It has fallen by more than a third since the summer  largely due to the falling oil price but also in part due to Western sanctions and the general weakness of the Russian economy  The Russian central bank floated the ruble in November and has since allowed it to fall in line with the oil price  though it intervenes now and then to smooth volatility and prevent sharp falls  But it is under pressure to do more to protect the ruble  The falling ruble is causing distress at companies that have debts in foreign currencies  Companies have some  35bn of US dollar denominated debt obligations to meet in December and a further  98bn in 2015  many of them will struggle to do this as dollars become increasingly expensive 
But the most urgent problem is the dollar liquidity crisis at Russia s banks  Shut out of financial markets because of Western sanctions  and with the value of ruble denominated assets falling rapidly  they are struggling to obtain sufficient US dollars to meet foreign denominated debt payments 
 ZeroHedge  Courtesy of the Cronybus sic  last minute passage  government was provided a quid pro quo  1 1 trillion spending allowance with Wall Street s blessing in exchange for assuring banks that taxpayers would be on the hook for yet another bailout  as a result of the swaps push out provision  after incorporating explicit Citigroup language that allows financial institutions to trade certain financial derivatives from subsidiaries that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp explicitly putting taxpayers on the hook for losses caused by these contracts 
 ZeroHedge  Funny what a difference two months make  Back on October 4  we wrote  Here We Go Again  Greece Will Be In Default Within 15 Months  S P Warns  and    nobody cared as the Greek stock market meltup continued  Now  after the biggest three day rout in Greek stock market history  or about 30  lower   and with the overhyped  oversold  oversusbcribed recent Greek 5 Year bond issue available in the open market some 16 points lower  and suddenly everyone cares  Including Goldman Sachs 
Overnight the bank with the  58 trillion in derivative exposure issued a note  From GRecovery to GRelapse  which is quite absent on the usual optimism  cheerfulness and happy ending we have grown to expect from the bank whose former employee is in charge of the European printing press  Here is the punchline   In the event of a severe Greek government clash with international lenders  interruption of liquidity provision to Greek banks by the ECB could potentially even lead to a Cyprus style prolonged  bank holiday   And market fears for potential Euro exit risks could rise at that point  ",2014-12-14,Anthony M.

177025,398541,IBM,As Bad As IBM s Been  Amazon s Been Worse,opinion,"About a year ago our  of  NYSE IBM  and  NASDAQ Amazon com   At the time  IBM had a P E of 10X  AMZN s was 166X   was growing Free Cash Flow  versus flat at AMZN  and seemed wholly more attractively priced than AMZN  As we noted then  we owned IBM and not AMZN  where we think that being a customer is so much better than being an owner 
Fast Forward
A year later  IBM has so far been a disappointment  Its most recent quarterly earnings saw continued weak sales  an abandonment of its long held 2015 forecast of  20 in EPS and a payment of  1 5 billion to a firm kind enough to take its loss making chip manufacturing business off Big Blue s hands  From November 1  2013 through Monday  IBM has returned  7   including dividends   substantially worse than the S P 500 s  13 5  total return over the same period 
It s hard to compare the P E they were trading at last year with current levels because for now  management isn t making a 2015 earnings forecast  However  using consensus estimates of  16 91  IBM is trading at less than last year s 10X multiple that we found attractive  The critics point to the challenge of adapting its business model to cloud based software as a service and away from its licensing model  So far events seems to agree with them  And yet  the company continues to generate  12  14 billion of free cashflow  some of which buys back stock  which helps its per share metrics  We were obviously early with IBM  but are staying the course 
Believe It Or Not
Although it s hard to believe  owning AMZN for the past year would have been worse than the 20  relative underperformance delivered by IBM  AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos and his penchant for putting growth ahead of profits helped drive AMZN s most recent quarterly earnings disappointment and is behind its  20  one year return  33  worse than the S P 500  Bezos has always wanted to deliver profits sometime in the future  It s why Amazon is such an exciting company to watch and why I buy all kinds of obscure items without having to set foot in a brick and mortar store  In the last several weeks  I have bought beach shoes  a replacement license plate light bulb  batteries  leather luggage tags  a belt and several 1lb bags of shelled Brazil nuts  I love AMZN investors for helping keep the company s cost of capital low so that it can offer all these products and millions of others 
Some thought long AMZN short IBM was a great pairs trade  Well  IBM certainly has been a worse investment than the S P 500  but handily better than AMZN  If you re not leveraged  waiting for IBM to beat the benchmark as well isn t that expensive ",2014-10-27,Simon Lack,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/as-bad-as-ibm’s-been,-amazon’s-been-worse-230426",230426

Recap
 Whoa  Looks like Halloween came early this year as Mr  Market started off the spooky month of October with a 238 point trick for the Dow  not treat  I m glad I made Wednesday a conditional call  ES never made more than a token attempt on its pivot Wednesday and the end result was lower in a big way  But big moves make for interesting charts so now we ve got some real meat to chew on  So let s chow down on Thursday   pass the hot sauce  The technicals  The Dow  On Wednesday the Dow basically just fell out of bed and never got up with a 1 4  plunge that closed way below its lower BB   We gave up support at 17K like it wasn t even there  then 16 950  then 16 890 and finally stopping at 16 805 only because the bell rang  That disconfirmed Tuesday s spinning top in a real big way  keeps us off the left side of the descending RTC and leaves all the indicators in confusion  With three down in a row now  there s really nothing bullish about this chart   The VIX  Oddly  while the VIX advanced on Wednesday  it was only up 2 45   not much considering the slaughter on the Street  And while we remain in a rising RTC  we now have something of a lopsided spinning top reversal warning and overbought indicators  Still  we closed above the upper B at 16 63 making this look a lot like the end of July when it took five whole days around that level before the VIX finally gave up  We ve now got 7 out of 8  which I think is a record for the whole time I ve been watching this  some 10 years now  This can t go on forever  Also note that VVIX put in a big gap up evening star doji right to its upper BB and looks ready to move lower   Market index futures  Tonight all three futures are actually higher at 12 25 AM EDT with ES up 0 12   Like everything else  ES took a pounding on Wednesday with a big red candle that traded mostly below its lower BB and remained inside its descending RTC  But it was enough to finally drive RSI oversold  There s actually two pieces of good news right now   first  ES isn t falling in the overnight and second  OBV has turned higher for the first time in a week  It s not the greatest reversal sign  but it s better than nothing   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot plummets from 1968 08 to 1947 17  And even with that giant fall and ES drifting a bit higher in the overnight  we re still below the new pivot  so this indicator remains bearish   Dollar index  On Wednesday the dollar took a breather with a small red harami that was still good for a 0 03  gain  But there s nothing really new here   the unstoppable uptrend just goes on and on   Euro  And the euro just continued its slide down the banister of the lower BB on Wednesday to close at 1 2614  a level not seen in just over two year  It s starting to look like the euro wants to have a go at its multi year support of 1 2279   we re not that far from it now    Transportation  The Trans had an even worse day than the Dow on Wednesday  if that s possible   tanking 2 51  on a giant red marubozu that just blasted through support at 8377  the lower BB at 8333  then more support at 8291 before finally ending at the third level of 8239  That was enough to drive it oversold though  I should think    But this isn t yet a reversal candle so we can t call a bottom here by any means 
The charts are looking pretty grim tonight  But I will point out a few things 

First  the SPX Hi Lo index fell back to 19 on Wednesday  It s only been lower three times in the last six months  and all of those marked significant bottoms 
Second  the NYSE A D line is now quite low  at  1566  It s more likely to go higher than lower from here 
Third  bellwether IBM hit its 200 day MA on Wednesday and is quite oversold  If I was into IBM  I d call this a nice buy point 
Fourth  Dr  Copper is very close to year long support 
Fifth  I think the VIX is ready to move lower  and
Sixth  the futures are actually running higher this evening 

Therefore  I m going to go waaay out on a limb and call Thursday higher  I could be wrong  Lord knows I am often enough   ES Fantasy Trader  Portfolio stats  the account remains  114 250 after eight trades in 2014  starting with  100 000  We are now 6 for 8 total  4 for 4 long  2 for 3 short  and one push  Tonight we stand aside ",2014-10-02,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-higher-227726,227726
177039,398555,IBM,How Bad Was IBM s Print ,opinion,"International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  reported disappointed earnings Monday morning dragging the company s stock price 7  lower  The highlighted quarter in the graph above shows just how bad this earnings report was  Contributing analysts on Estimize were looking for earnings of  4 34 per share  but IBM only managed to earn  3 68  Profits were largely stifled by weakness in the hardware division and a charge to sell off its semiconductor business 
This was IBM s worst report relative to analyst expectations in recent memory and comes alongside a decision to offload the company s chip business to GlobalFoundries  The bad news is that IBM isn t selling its semiconductor manufacturing business for a profit  IBM was losing money on chip production and has agreed to pay GlobalFoundries  1 5 billion to take its toxic wing off its hands 
The bright side is that by dumping its losing business  IBM gives itself flexibility to put capital to work in segments with more potential  IBM will forfeit some of its patents to GlobalFoundries as part of the deal  but will continue to invest in semiconductor research  CEO Virginia Rometty commented that IBM will increasingly focus on businesses with higher expected growth including the cloud  data  analytics  mobile  and security ",2014-10-20,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-bad-was-ibm's-print-229685,229685
177057,398573,IBM,IBM  The Stock That Gets No Respect ,opinion,"International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  must be one of the least liked large cap stocks around  The criticisms are easy and familiar  they haven t grown revenues in years  they are involved in financial engineering to prop up earnings  they are taking on lots of debt to support cashflows  Recently  Barron s Roundtable that Fred Hickey had IBM as a short recommendation 
It s true IBM has been a poor performer against the S P 500 over the past year  However  it has less volatility than the market with a trailing Beta of 0 66 so all other things being equal you would expect it to lag somewhat when prices are rising  And it s true that revenue growth for years has been non existent  hovering frustratingly around the  100BN annual level  However  earnings have grown nicely over the past ten years aided by improving margins and a reduced share count  So although revenues are flat since 2004  over that time EPS has more than tripled from  4 93 to an estimated  17 90 consensus forecast  The sharecount has dropped from 1 7 billion to around 1 billion as they relentlessly return cash to shareholders through buybacks 
As for debt  it s true that it s risen although IBM is hardly a leveraged company  They re expected to finish the year with  48BN of long term obligations less Cash of  17BN for  31 BN of net debt  supporting pre tax operating income of  21BN  This hardly seems like reckless leverage  Meanwhile  they still look to be on track to hit their target of  20 in operating EPS next year  At  194 a share it just doesn t seem ridiculously expensive 
As for innovation  in 2013 IBM inventors received 6 809 patents  the 21st consecutive year of being the most prolific recipient of such awards 
So IBM isn t that exciting on a daily basis  but it does look like a fairly compelling place to invest some of your money if you re not one of those people who requires daily gratification on your stock picks  Fred Hickey s price objective on his short IBM was  150 in the abovementioned article  At the time of his interview it was trading at  182 but has since risen  12  over a third of Hickey s sought after gain  Shorting isn t easy  and don t imagine we re claiming victory because we still own IBM and anything can happen  But there must be better ways to make money than trying to short IBM  They just keep generating cash   18 1 BN in Cash from Operations  less change in Financing receivables  over the past 12 months  or about  18 per share 
For excitement  watch Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  as they continue to break records for the most inefficient converter of revenues into profits  In ten years sales have increased sevenfold while EPS has halved  In their most recent quarter over  19BN in revenues  up 23  year on year  generated a small operating loss  The best investment you can make in Amazon is to sign up for Amazon Prime  Being a customer is far more likely to be satisfying than being an owner ",2014-07-28,Simon Lack,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibm,-the-stock-that-gets-no-respect-220855",220855
177058,398574,IBM,Gloom And Doom Or A Technological Boom  ,opinion,"The Future  Gloomy or Prosperous 
The debate concerning the prosperity of future generations is never ending  especially in the context of investing  In the real world  prosperous periods have often taken an unexpected turn for the worse  For example  heading into 1914  the consensus in Europe was pointing to a bright future  From The Wall Street Journal 

The world swept away had been a rising and increasingly constructive one  where total war was unimaginable   Europe in the summer of 1914 enjoyed a peaceful productivity so dependent on international exchange and cooperation that a belief in the impossibility of general war seemed the most conventional of wisdoms  

War Alters Everything
In the summer of 1914  the peaceful productivity in Europe was threatened after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria set off a chain of events that eventually led to World War I  From History com 

The world s first global conflict  the  Great War  pitted the Central Powers of Germany  Austria Hungary and the Ottoman Empire against the Allied forces of Great Britain  the United States  France  Russia  Italy and Japan  The introduction of modern technology to warfare resulted in unprecedented carnage and destruction  with more than 9 million soldiers killed by the end of the war in November 1918 

Little Basis For Optimism In Early 1980s
Just as negative turns can occur more rapidly than most anticipate  periods of economic weakness and pessimism can be followed by unexpected periods of economic expansion and prosperity  For example  the U S  economy was so unsettled in the late 1970s  the term  misery index  was used regularly during the 1976 presidential campaign  The misery index is the sum of the unemployment rate and inflation rate  After President Nixon s resignation  Gerald Ford took office in September 1974 with a misery index of 17 85   The index peaked at 19 9  a few months later  From The Bancroft Library at the University of California  Berkeley 

In January 1980 the U S  economy entered a recession that  at the time  was the most significant since the Great Depression  One of the causes of the early 1980s recession was the Iranian Revolution of 1979  which sparked a second large round of oil price increases  More important  however  were Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker s efforts to tame inflation through restrictive monetary policy  which had the expected effect of dampening economic growth  The American economy experienced a modest recovery beginning in the summer of 1980 but declined again from July 1981 to November 1982 

Technology Can Drive Unexpected Prosperity
While there are numerous reasons for the economic turnaround that occurred in the early 1980s  advances in technology played a key role  From International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  

On August 12  1981  at a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria ballroom in New York City IBM Lab Director Don Estridge announced the IBM Personal Computer with a price tag of  1 565  Two decades earlier  an IBM computer often cost as much as  9 million and required an air conditioned quarter acre of space and a staff of 60 people to keep it fully loaded with instructions  The new IBM PC could not only process information faster than those earlier machines but it could hook up to the home TV set  play games  process text and harbor more words than a fat cookbook 

2014 2024  Prosperity or Hard Times 
Having worked on Wall Street for over 20 years  I can confidently state that economic and geopolitical gloom and doomers are always easy to find  What they often fail to consider is the possibility of unexpected technological advancements  From The Wall Street Journal 

In the speculation on what the new technologies will look like and do  robots and artificial intelligence remain front and center  at once wished for  who likes making beds   and feared as job killers  We haven t seen a fraction of what is possible in information and communication technology  But the most unexpected advances may come from less glamorous corners  such as material science  One example is graphene  a sheet of very thin carbon whose molecules can be arranged to make it either the strongest or the most flexible material on earth  It conducts electricity and heat better than any material ever discovered  In the future graphene is likely to replace silicon in transistors  solar cells and other applications we cannot yet imagine 

2014  No Shortage Of Geopolitical Concerns
In recent months  investors have been worried about developments in Gaza and Ukraine  On Saturday  August 9  President Obama dampened expectations for a limited and short term U S  role in Iraq  which could add to uncertainty when the financial markets open Monday  From The Guardian 

Barack Obama has committed the US to long term involvement in Iraq  warning that the rapidly evolving crisis in the north would not be solved quickly  US aircraft have targeted armoured vehicles and militant positions in a second day of strikes against Islamic State forces  A mix of US fighters and drones attacked and destroyed armored personnel carriers after Yazidi civilians near Sinjar came under attack from the vehicles  US central command said 

History Tells Us To Remain Open To All Outcomes
How does all this help us from an investment perspective  The point is the future is highly uncertain  Geopolitical events can cascade at unexpected speeds  Technological advancements can be a powerful force for rapid economic advancement  A highly uncertain and almost impossible to predict future calls for a high degree of investment flexibility  If an investor entered the 1980s with a bearish bias  they may have missed one of the greatest bull markets of all time  see chart below   Conversely  many were blindsided by the rapid changes that took place in Europe during World War I 

Were there fundamental problems in 1982  Yes  a brief refresher list is provided below 
Unemployment in the U K  increased by 129 918 to 3 070 621  a post war record number 
Hama massacre took place in Syria 
The DeLorean Motor Company Car Factory in Belfast was put into receivership 
The U S  placed an embargo on Libyan oil imports  alleging Libyan support for terrorist groups 
The Falklands War began  Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands 
The 1982 Lebanon War began 
The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution demanding that Israel withdraw its troops from Lebanon 
The Provisional IRA detonated 2 bombs in central London  killing 8 soldiers and wounding 47 people 
Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini resigned 
Staying In The Present Is The Key

Investment Implications   The Weight Of The Evidence
As outlined in this week s stock market video  the S P 500 held near logical support last week  but the intermediate term investment picture remains cloudy 

While U S  equities rallied strongly Friday based primarily on positive developments in Russia and Iraq  we need to see more than a one day bounce  Therefore  we continue to run a fence sitting strategy with stock exposure  ARCA SPY  being offset with a large cash position and modest exposure to bonds  ARCA TLT   If the S P 500 can  prove it  by closing above 1965 to1970ish  we will be much more willing to take an incremental step back toward growth oriented assets  such as technology stocks  NASDAQ QQQ   From a bearish perspective  if support levels outlined in detail on  are breached on any sustained basis  more than a day   our market model will call for further additions to cash and reductions on the stock  ARCA VTI  side of our portfolios  We will enter the new week with a flexible  unbiased  and open mind  The markets will guide us if we are willing to listen ",2014-08-11,Chris Ciovacco,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gloom-and-doom-or-a-technological-boom-222307,222307
177059,398575,IBM,3 Eclectic Bullish Trade Ideas ,opinion,"As promised  further to my recent post where I indicated that I would write about some bullish ideas  see A tradable bottom    here are three eclectic and out of the box trade ideas for bulls  Each of them embody a different investment theme and each has different risk profiles and time horizons 
Russia as the deep value play
Carla Fried of  highlighted analysis by contrarian manager David Iben on Russia 
In a  Iben drew a comparison between one of the finest contrarian investors of all time  the late John Templeton  dove into a battered Japanese stock market in the 1960s  when stocks were trading at low single digit PE ratios  and the opportunity Iben sees today in Russia   The fact that Russia is a mess is a feature  not a bug for contrarians like Iben  In laying out his case for Russia  Iben invoked one of Templeton s investing commandments   People are always asking me where the outlook is good  but that s the wrong question   The right question is  Where is the outlook the most miserable    Iben clearly makes a case for Russia s misery factor  and seems practically giddy about it   Having lost the Cold War two decades ago  still hated passionately by many  infamous for organized crime and corruption  powerful oligarchs worth billions  and an emerging market  its stock market is now selling at a mere 5 times earnings and 0 6 times book value   
As confirmation of the contrarian value theme  Jim Grant said the following about Russia energy giant Gazprom Oao  OTC OGZPY  back in May when the Russia Ukraine crisis started hitting the headlines  via   
Yeah  So this is   first of all  it s a huge company  Revenues of  150 billion  The market cap is immense  They earn a lot of money even after  as my friend  inaudible  even after stealing they earn a lot of money  They pay a 5 percent dividend  As recently as 2006  the stock changed hands at 10 times the estimated earnings  So now it s at 2 5  And why is that  Well  because people know that there will be even more extreme and costly sanctions imposed on Russia  They know that something terrible is going to happen with the Ukraine election in a couple of weeks  And well it might  There is certitude about outcomes that is notable given that so few people saw the current set of outcomes approaching some months ago  So in addition to the epigram that good things happen to cheap stocks  I will offer this epigram  This too will pass 
He did qualify his report by stating 
 Here s a test of suitability for this investment   said Grant   You can t care about the time  
From a technical viewpoint  the chart below  of the Russia ETF  MarketVectors TR Russia  NYSE RSX   appears to be trying to make a bottom  Even the through the eruption of the latest round of geopolitical tensions  RSX failed to make a lower low  The relative performance chart of RSX to the iShares MSCI All Country World Index Fund  NASDAQ ACWI  in the bottom panel shows that RSX remains in a relative downtrend  though it does seem to be finding relative support   which is positive 

Entry point for the Druckenmiller AMZN IBM pair 
In November  2013   featured an interview with Stan Druckenmiller about technology companies  Druckenmiller proceeded to pan International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  in the worst way possible 
Stan Druckenmiller  who has one of the best track records in the hedge fund industry over the past three decades  said he s betting against the shares of International Business Machines Corp   IBM  because the company s business will be replaced by technology such as cloud computing    It s one of the more higher probability shorts I have seen in years   Druckenmiller  60  said in an interview with Bloomberg TV s Stephanie Ruhle at the Robin Hood Investors Conference in New York today   IBM is old technology being replaced by cloud technology  
By contrast  he praised Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  for its efforts in cloud computing 
Druckenmiller said he is betting on Amazon com Inc   AMZN   and praised CEO Jeff Bezos  Amazon s Web Services division  whose server farms generate the processing power the retailer sells to heavy corporate data users on the cheap   is killing it   he said  IBM should be investing in its business and taking on the  challenge of the Amazons of the world  instead of doing share buybacks  according to Druckenmiller    I think he s a serial monopolist   Druckenmiller said of Amazon s Bezos 
While Druckenmiller did not specifically describe a long AMZN short IBM position as a pair trade  I chose to interpret it that way and the pair chart is shown below  At the time of the article  the pair trade was somewhat extended in favor of AMZN  Since then  the pair has come back down to earth a bit and current levels could serve as a good entry point 

Semiconductors  the momentum play
I have written before that my research has shown that in a bull phase  traders are best served by buying the hot industries and sectors showing the best price momentum  see Momentum   Bull market   Chocolate   Peanut butter   On the weekend  I called for an oversold rally to start  see A tradable bottom    In such an instance  the highest beta momentum group to play appears to be the semiconductor stocks  As the chart below of the relative performance of SOX to SPX shows  the semiconductor stocks have been displaying leadership qualities for all of 2014  The recent retreat  which was due to the minor pullback that we saw in the last couple of weeks  shows the group to have come down to a reasonable long entry point for traders to want to play the momentum game 

Disclaimer  I want to repeat my previous caveat that these are all different kinds of trade ideas encompassing different investment themes  different time horizons and different levels of risk  Not all ideas are suitable for everyone  While I have no positions in any of these trades at the moment  I could initiate a position at any time  Further  I know nothing about your portfolio or your risk tolerance  Do your own due diligence before putting on any of these positions ",2014-08-13,Cam Hui,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-eclectic-bullish-trade-ideas-222468,222468
177060,398576,IBM,Cisco Earnings Report Beats Consensus Estimates,opinion,"Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  has reported its fiscal Q4 2014 earnings after the bell Wednesday  with typically positive results  the tech giant posted earnings per share  EPS  of 50 cents per share  actual  GAAP  on total sales in the quarter of  12 36 billion  This topped the Zacks consensus estimates of 48 cents per share on  12 12 billion in revenues  respectively 
It would seem at first blush that Cisco s foray a few years back diving into cloud based solutions is showing signs of paying off  especially with beating expectations on the revenue side  an earnings beat for Cisco is a no brainer by this point  the company hasn t posted a negative earnings surprise since 2008   Cisco s products  consisting of mostly routers and switchers  where they are still a first tier producer  brought in  9 5 billion in the quarter  while services garnered  2 8 billion 
It will likely take the conference call coming a bit later to really dig into the substance of these numbers  especially regarding guidance for fiscal year 2015  but the year over year growth is likely a good sign that the move toward the  Intercloud  is now bearing some fruit  Gross margins seem to be a bit under pressure  which has been the case with Cisco    as well as plenty other big names in tech trying to make the jump into the high growth end  like International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  for awhile now 
Cisco also bought back 1 5 billion in CSCO shares for the quarter  another thing investors have come to expect  The company s 4  positive earnings surprise is about exactly the average for the past four quarters  as well  What s nice to see for Cisco that s not so typical is the back to back beats on the top line 
Analysts typically have made no adjustments to earnings expectations for Cisco Systems in the quarter  once guidance is established and certain aspects are discussed on the call    among them enterprise IT spending trends  growth in China and Cisco s 9  revenue exposure in Russia    investors will have a better idea how to play the Zacks Rank  3 stock going forward  Year to date  Cisco shares are up 12   but year over year they re down about 4  ",2014-08-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cisco-earnings-report-beats-consensus-estimates-222606,222606

  Updates market action  adds oil 
 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK  July 19  Reuters    Wall Street stocks rose on on
upbeat U S  corporate earnings on Tuesday  and the euro and
European shares gained ahead of an EU summit later this week on
expectations that a solution to Greece s debt problems may be
reached 
 A surprise jump in U S  housing starts in June helped
reduce concern that the U S  economy may be slipping into a
recession 
 Crude oil prices as the optimism on the economy underpinned
the outlook for energy demand  and the weaker dollar also
supported prices  Prices of both Brent crude and U S  oil rose
more than 1 percent 
  So far earnings have been showing us a better picture of
the economy than some macroeconomic issues suggest  which is
encouraging  especially with housing starts surprising to the
upside   said Michelle Gibley  senior market analyst at Schwab
Center for Financial Research in Denver 
 In Europe equities  banking shares bounced back from
two year lows ahead of Thursday s euro zone summit in Brussels 
hoping it will complete a second bailout for Greece in an
attempt to contain the sovereign debt crisis 
 The FTSEurofirst 300  provisionally closed up 0 8
percent at 1 076 59 points 
 Italian and Spanish bonds  which were pummeled by fears
that a possible Greek default could damage the third and fourth
largest economies in the euro zone  firmed slightly after
10 year yields jumped to 6 percent on Monday 
 But even as bank shares rose in Europe  there were concerns
that the gains might not be sustained 
  We re not in a banking crisis  we re in a political
crisis   Robert Quinn  chief European strategist at Standard  
Poor s equity research said  adding he was bearish heading into
Thursday s meeting and saw the potential for further banking
sector losses 
 Gold continued to attract safe haven investment flows 
although it retreated below  1 600 an ounce after touching an
all time high near  1 610  
 The euro  rose as high as  1 42172 on electronic
trading platform EBS before retreating to  1 41722  still up
0 4 percent on the day 
  There is some lightening of short positions ahead of  the
summit  on the risk there could be some sort of agreement
reached   said Omer Esiner  chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington 
  But an agreement on Thursday could include some form of
Greek default  which to me is not necessarily a positive
outcome for the euro  
 The single currency also gained against the yen 
and the Swiss franc   which have been the safe havens
in the foreign exchange market due to anxiety about debt
troubles in Europe and the United States 
 Still  risk aversion among investors remained high also
because of the U S  government s Aug  2 deadline for raising
the debt ceiling  Failure to do so would push the world s
biggest economy into default and endanger its top notch credit
rating 
 The U S  White House and Congress are still at an impasse
over raising the  14 3 trillion statutory debt limit 
 ID nN1E76H1Y0 
 Investors for the most part appear to be assuming that the
U S  debt ceiling will be lifted and a default averted  with
the 10 year Treasury yield hovering near 3 0 percent 
 The stock market  however  found focused on strong
earnings  including results of IBM and Coca Cola  and the data
showing that housing starts in June hit a six month high and
permits for future construction unexpectedly increased

 The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 113 03

 Dow component International Business Machines Corp 
added 4 2 percent to  182 63 after it reported late Monday that
new business at its services division was up more than
expected  raising hopes for the technology sector 
 The S P information technology sector  gained 1 5

177066,398582,IBM,European share bounce led by beaten down banks,news,"  FTSEurofirst 300 ends up 0 8 pct
   Technically backed bounce capped by sovereign concerns
   Banks recoup small change from recent sell off

 By Simon Jessop	
 LONDON  July 19  Reuters    European shares ended higher on
Tuesday after banks bounced from two year lows ahead of a
crucial meeting of political leaders aimed at resolving the
regional debt crisis  	
 Indecision over how to fund a fresh Greek bailout  placate
markets and stop the problem from engulfing Italy and Spain
remains the key headwind for the banking sector  however  in
spite of the technically underpinned retracement 	
 Bucking a three session losing streak that took 5 percent
off the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index   the sector ended
up 1 4 percent  narrowing the year to date loss to 14 2 percent 	
 Supporting the bounce was the sector s 14 day Relative
Strength Index  which ended the previous session at 26 5  with
30 or below considered oversold  	
 Beaten down heavyweight BNP Paribas led the
recovery  helping the sector contribute around a quarter of the
gains for the FTSEurofirst 300   which ended up 0 8
percent at 1 076 88 points 	
 No longer in a banking crisis   we re in a political
crisis   Robert Quinn  chief European strategist at credit
rating agency Standard   Poor s said  adding he was bearish
heading into the meeting and saw the potential for further
sector losses 	
 Quinn said the solution was to bite the bullet and fully
fund Greece  and by precedent Ireland and Portugal  at the
lowest conceivable rates to allow them to achieve a primary
surplus in the quickest time 	
  Private sector involvement  PSI  is clogging up painfully
slow political developments  If we don t drag market attention
away from Italy and Spain then there will be far greater costs
associated  including a most likely global recession and a 20
percent downturn in global equity markets   Quinn said 	
 The recent sector stress test showed European banks had 1
trillion euros   1 42 trillion  in equity capital and so could
absorb the hit from an unfavourable PSI decision   They just
can t cope with the current liquidity crisis   Quinn said 	
 With a meeting of European leaders on Thursday  senior
officials will meet on Wednesday to discuss detailed proposals 
although German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday played down
hopes for a comprehensive solution  	
 A pullback in risk premia on Italian and Spanish government
bonds helped ease some political pressure and buoy domestic
lenders  with UniCredit ending up 4 7 percent 
although yields remain high  	
 Earnings from the Nordic region s biggest bank  Nordea
   also helped sector sentiment  The bank rose 5 7
percent after its in line results nixed recent fears the numbers
would come in light 	
	
 MIXED EARNINGS	
 Earnings elsewhere in the market gave a mixed outlook for
investors keen to see sustained macroeconomic recovery in the
second half  while lack of political agreement in raising the
U S  debt ceiling was also weighing on sentiment 	
 Wildly divergent outlooks pushed Swedish engineer Alfa Laval
 and home appliance maker Electrolux  to the
top of the gainers  and fallers  lists respectively  in heavy
volume 	
 Alfa Laval ended up 6 5 percent in volume around two and a
half times its 30 day daily average after saying it saw demand
remaining strong into the third quarter  	
 Electrolux  meanwhile  slid 15 percent to a two year low in
volume around eight and a half times its 30 day daily average
after warning the second half would be worse than in 2010  hit
by weak demand and higher raw materials costs  	
 The mixed results pattern mirrored earnings in the U S  
where financial heavyweight Goldman Sachs lagged  but IBM
 beat forecasts after the market close on Monday 	
 While the latter s results buoyed tech shares in Europe and
helped keep U S  indices in positive territory by the European
close  uncertainty around the political will to agree a deal to
raise the debt ceiling was still a drag on sentiment 	
 We  need to see some clarity on the EU sovereign and U S 
debt ceiling events to buy into the rally   Atif Latif  director
of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers  said

177084,398600,IBM,INTERVIEW UPDATE 1 India s Infosys eyes buys in Europe  Japan,news,"  Could look at targets with revenue of up to  600 mln CEO
   Looking for buys in healthcare  public services CEO
   To complete business reorganisation in two months COO

  Combines previously separate stories  adds further details 
 By Bharghavi Nagaraju
 BANGALORE  May 1  Reuters    Infosys  India s second biggest
software services exporter  is on the hunt for acquisitions in
Europe and Japan in areas including healthcare and public
services  its chief executive said on Sunday 
 Speaking to Reuters a day after the company announced
changes in its top level management  S  Gopalakrishnan said
Infosys could acquire companies with annual revenues of up to
 600 million 
  Up to  600 million may not pose too much of a risk or
burden on the company  But it s a thumb rule or a guideline
rather than a hard and fast rule   said Gopalakrishnan  who is
set to step down as chief executive in August to become
executive co chairman 
 Infosys was also seeking acquisitions in new areas like
cloud computing  he said  The company had cash and cash
equivalents of  3 8 billion as of the end of March 
  Our philosophy has always been that you plan organic
growth   Gopalakrishnan said 
    But  you keep your eyes and ears open  you have a
dedicated team looking at acquisitions  
  We do not want to set a target for acquisition because we
are not doing acquisition for growth  We are doing acquisitions
for strategic fit and adding capability at this point in time  
he said at the company s sprawling headquarters campus on the
outskirts of Bangalore  India s information technology hub 
 Several Indian technology players including Infosys s larger
rival Tata Consultancy Services and smaller rival Wipro have
been looking for overseas acquisitions to boost growth amid
growing competition from global rivals such as IBM and Accenture
 
 Indian software firms are also looking to reduce a
dependency on their U S  market  which accounts for more than
half of the sector s revenue  and want to expand operations in
European and Asian markets 
  There are multiple strategic requirements for acquisition
so those are the things we are looking at  Typically a smaller
acquisition rather than a large one   said Gopalakrishnan  one
of the seven engineers who founded Infosys in 1981 with  250 
 
 REORGANISATION
 Infosys  which is also listed on Nasdaq  on Saturday
announced top management changes linked to the retirement of its
billionaire chairman and stuck to its practice of giving its
founders a shot at running the firm  
 In a separate interview  CEO designate S D  Shibulal said
Infosys planned to complete an ongoing reorganisation of its
business divisions in about two months 
 Infosys  which counts Goldman Sachs  BT and BP as clients 
is struggling to meet growth expectations and its shares have
fallen over 15 percent so far this year 
 It is dividing its business into five global industry
segments    financial services and insurance  manufacturing 
energy  utilities  communications and services  public service
practices and healthcare  retail and life sciences 
 Infosys will also look to strengthen its geographical focus
by having separate heads for the Americas  Europe and emerging
markets  said Shibulal  who is also one of the founders of
Infosys  and is currently its chief operating officer 
 Wipro earlier this year also reorganised its key outsourcing
business weeks after it decided to replace its joint CEOs with
company veteran T K  Kurien in an effort to boost growth

   Wall Street set for gains	
   Euro  euro zone bond markets firmer    	
   Investors eye euro zone  U S  debt debate	
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON  July 19  Reuters    World stocks clawed back some
recent losses and the euro firmed on Tuesday as investors paused
from their selloff of riskier assets triggered by debt crises in
the euro zone and United States 	
 Wall Street also looked set to open higher 	
 Gold  however  continued to attract safe haven investment
flows  rising for the sixth session in a row to around  1 604 an
ounce  	
 Italian and Spanish bonds  now in the maelstrom as euro zone
debt problems spread  firmed slightly after 10 year yields
vaulted six percent on Monday 	
 Investors were focusing on a euro zone summit to be held on
Thursday  hoping it will complete a second bailout for Greece in
an attempt to stop the sovereign debt crisis from seriously
infecting larger countries  notably Italy and Spain 	
 Stakes are high with the scope for serious market ructions
if Europe s leaders fail to provide a definitive plan 	
  Things are coming to a head  This is a political crisis
just as much as a financial crisis  We need some real
leadership   said Justin Urquhart Stewart  director at Seven
Investment Management 	
 Risk aversion among investors has also been stoked by the
approaching U S  Aug 2 deadline on the federal borrowing limit 
Political leaders in Washington are still at an impasse 
 	
 Investors for the most part appear to be assuming that the
U S  debt ceiling will be lifted and a default averted  with the
10 year Treasury yield camped comfortably below 3 percent 	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up
half a percent and still have gains of around 1 3 percent for
the year despite a plethora of financial  political and natural
crises from Japan to Europe  the United States and North Africa 	
 European shares rose  helped along by technology shares that
got a boost from an upbeat statement from IBM   The
FTSEurofirst 300 gained three quarters of a percent 	
  We can expect a relatively strong  stock  rebound if we get
a political solution to the debt crisis on Thursday  a solution
that would please the market   said Christophe Brule  president
of Entheca Finance   Without an adequate solution  the market
could drop another 10 15 percent  	
 Japan s Nikkei closed down 0 85 percent 	
 
 EURO STEADY	
 The euro rose broadly with investors torn as they balance
the debt concerns on both sides of the Atlantic 	
  Euro dollar is trapped between the euro zone debt crisis on
one side and questions surrounding the U S  debt ceiling on the
other  and the market doesn t want to take on any major
positions   said You Na Park  currency strategist at Commerzbank
in Frankfurt 	
 The euro was at  1 4165  	
 On euro zone bond markets themselves  safe haven German bond
prices fell and Italian and Spanish bonds prices rose slightly 
with some profit taking on the core debt 	
  You can argue that the summit isn t really focusing on the
matter in hand to a degree  There s a risk we could get some
disappointment in terms of help for Spain and Italy if the
crisis gets worse on Thursday   one bond trader said    	
 Spain especially is at very pronounced yield levels 
Systemic risk is definitely the danger into the end of the
week

   Exec says wage hikes will hurt operating margins
   Shares down 4 pct in flat market

  Recasts  adds share price 	
 By Bharghavi Nagaraju	
 BANGALORE  April 27  Reuters    India s Wipro Ltd 
on Wednesday forecast muted growth for its mainstay information
technology services business and said wage hikes would hurt
operating margins this year  sending its shares down four
percent  	
 Wipro  India s No  3 software services exporter  has been
struggling to win large outsourcing contracts amid intense
competition with local and global rivals such as Tata
Consultancy Services  TCS  and IBM  	
 Bangalore based Wipro  which met forecasts with a 14 percent
rise in fourth quarter net profit  said it expected IT services
revenue of  1 39 billion to  1 42 billion in the fiscal first
quarter 	
 The IT revenue forecast reflects a decline of 0 4 percent at
the low end to a rise of 1 6 percent at the top end when
compared to the fiscal fourth quarter that ended March 31 	
  I am disappointed by their guidance  They have forecast
flattish growth in the first quarter compared to expectations of
about 2 5 to 3 percent growth   said Shradha Agrawal  a sector
analyst with Batlivala   Karani Securities in Mumbai 	
  It will make the task of matching the growth rates of
rivals tougher for them  	
  Wipro s IT business  which develops software applications 
integrates IT systems and manages call centres for clients such
as Citi   Cisco and Credit Suisse  
accounts for about three quarters of its revenue 	
 Earlier this month  India s No 1 outsourcing firm TCS beat
net profit estimates but said wage hikes and currency moves
could threaten its full year margins while No  2 Infosys
 forecast lower than expected annual sales growth on
slower client spending  ID nL3E7FF0IU  ID nL3E7FL18Q  	
 Intensifying competition from global rivals IBM and
Accenture has forced Indian technology firms to hike
wages  seen as much as 15 percent higher this year 	
  We have announced wage hikes  effective June 1  2011  which
would have an impact on the operating margins   Chief Financial
Officer Suresh Senapaty said in a statement  No details on the
wage hike were immediately available 	
 TCS has said it planned to raise wages 12 to 14 percent for
India based staff this fiscal year  Infosys has said it would
raise wages by 10 to 12 percent for India based staff 	
 The rupee s rise is another concern for the near  60 billion
outsourcing sector  which exports a large chunk of its services
to the United States but chalks up expenses in rupees 	
 Wipro said its IT revenue forecast was based on an exchange
rate of 44 29 rupees to a dollar  in line with current rates 	
 Mumbai and New York listed Wipro in February
reorganized its key IT outsourcing business in an effort to win
more clients  barely three weeks after it surprised markets by
removing the joint chiefs of the business and naming company
veteran T K  Kurien as the new chief executive 	
 
 IN LINE WITH ESTIMATES	
 Bangalore based Wipro said net profit for the
fiscal fourth quarter rose to 13 75 billion rupees   309
million  under international accounting standards  up from 12 09
billion a year ago 	
 This compares with a Reuters poll forecast of 13 79 billion
rupees for Mumbai and New York listed Wipro   which
counts Citigroup   Cisco and Credit Suisse
 among its clients 	
 The firm said revenue rose 18 percent to 83 02 billion
rupees  compared with a forecast of 82 54 billion rupees 	
 Wipro said it added 68 clients in the quarter   its
strongest pace of addition in at least three years   while
adding 2 894 employees  Operating margins in its IT services
business were at 22 1 percent in the quarter 	
 Wipro shares fell 4 percent in opening trade on Wednesday  
in a Mumbai market that was trading slightly higher 	
 The stock  which the market values at about  26 billion  	
have fallen 5 4 percent this year  compared with a 9 percent
fall in the sector index and the wider market s

177115,398631,IBM,Is This What A Credit Bubble Looks Like ,opinion,"There s been some buzz recently about a pick up in business lending  The six largest banks increased business loans at an average annual rate of 8 5  in the first quarter  according to a Wall Street Journal  last week  Other first quarter data  shows commercial and industrial loans jumping 12  from last year  Charles Schwab s chief strategist went so far as to call a chart depicting the Fed s broader lending data    
Unlike some pundits  though  we re not convinced that a surge in business credit is such a good thing  We don t doubt that more lending to small businesses  in particular  might do some good if it doesn t go too far  Lending to large corporations  on the other hand  is a different story  Corporations are already borrowing at a pace that s only before been seen near cyclical peaks 

At over 4  of GDP  you might say that borrowing is too high  not too low  especially as this pace never lasts long  The bigger issue  though  is that companies are choosing not to invest borrowed funds back into their businesses  You may have seen recent posts by  or   breaking down financial statements for IBM  in particular  They showed that IBM s borrowing in recent years was matched almost exactly by stock buybacks  Clearly  this isn t the kind of borrowing that helps the real economy  and IBM s not alone 
We ll take a broader look at the use of borrowed funds with the Fed s  data  which includes a measure of the internal funds generated by all US corporations  We add the internal funds figure  with an adjustment for dividends  to corporate borrowing to estimate the cash that s available for all purposes  capital expenditures  capex  versus acquisitions  dividends  buybacks and other financial strategies  Normally  capex accounts for between 2 3rds and 3 4ths of the total  Here s the latest update 

Needless to say  attitudes about capex aren t quite what they used to be  see  for more discussion   Financial engineering now consumes almost half of available funding  with the implication that companies are piling more debt than ever before on each dollar of productive assets  Although debt to asset ratios for the broad corporate sector aren t yet available for 2013  the  doesn t update fixed asset data until August   we can make a decent estimate using fixed investment data  Here s a 60 year history with our 2013 figure tacked onto the end 
We pegged the debt to asset ratio at 65  in 2013  6  above the housing boom peak of 59  in 2007  That s a big jump in a short period of time  By comparison  the ratio also climbed 6  over the 11 years from 1989 to 2000  and barely rose at all from 2000 to 2007  Glancing at the chart just four years ago without the latest results  you might have guessed that leverage was finally leveling off  Apparently not  Together with weak capex  data describes a leverage earnings debt spiral that looks something like this 

The spiral could continue awhile longer  and probably will  but it s not sustainable  The longer it circles in one direction  the more strongly it circles back in the opposite direction once the inevitable cracks appear in credit markets  In other words  not only does the spiral explain much of what we re seeing in today s financial markets  it also describes part of the process that leads to the next recession 
When will the debt super cycle end 
What s more  the data also begs the question  When does the roller coaster of leverage peaks and troughs fly completely off the tracks  The idea that we may be in the late stages of a debt super cycle isn t welcome in some circles  but the fact is that leverage can t trend upwards forever  Eventually  we ll reach a point where the normal reflation no longer works  We may then begin a secular downtrend  as in the period from the Great Depression to World War 2  or  at a minimum  we ll establish a sideways pattern that fails to make new highs  Either way  the business cycle won t look quite like it did over the last 70 years of rising leverage  nor will it look like the last few decades of increasing financialization 
Back to the question  can companies lever up as much as  say  70  of assets  75   Maybe so  but it says here that the super cycle ends well before debt reaches 100  of assets  It s hard to say exactly where the breaking point is  but we ll continue to share clues as we find them  In the meantime  one clue may be the bursting of the mortgage bubble in 2008  As you look at the last chart below  keep in mind that residential mortgage debt  backed by properties  and corporate debt  backed by productive assets  are fundamentally different  Or  maybe they re not so different  You decide 

Sidenote  Regular readers know that we ve already taken a position on critical thresholds for government debt  See our  and follow up posts  and

177116,398632,IBM,How To Find The Best Style ETFs,opinion,"Finding the best ETFs is an increasingly difficult task in a world with so many to choose from 
You Cannot Trust ETF Labels
There are at least 49 different Large Cap Value ETFs and at least 236 ETFs across all style  Do investors need that many choices  How different can the ETFs be 
Those 49 Large Cap Value ETFs are very different  With anywhere from 19 to 1403 holdings  many of these Large Cap Value ETFs have drastically different portfolios  creating drastically different investment implications 
The same is true for the ETFs in any other style  as each offers a very different mix of good and bad stocks  Some styles have lots of good stocks and offer quality funds  The opposite is true for some styles  while others lie in between these extremes with a fair mix of good and bad stocks  For example  the Large Cap Value style  per my 2Q Style Rankings Report ranks second out of 12 styles when it comes to providing investors with quality ETFs  Large Cap Blend ranks first  Small Cap Value ranks last  Details on the Best   Worst ETFs in each style are  
The bottom line is  ETF labels do not tell you the kind of stocks you are getting in any given ETF 
Paralysis By Analysis
I firmly believe ETFs for a given style should not all be that different  I think the large number of Large Cap Value  or any other  style of ETFs hurts investors more than it helps because too many options can be paralyzing  It is simply not possible for the majority of investors to properly assess the quality of so many ETFs  Analyzing ETFs  done with the proper diligence  is far more difficult than analyzing stocks because it means analyzing all the stocks within each ETF  As stated above  that can be as many as 1403 stocks  and sometimes even more  for one ETF 
Any investor worth his salt recognizes that analyzing the holdings of an ETF is critical to finding the best ETF 
Figure 1  Best Style ETFs

Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings
The Danger Within
Why do investors need to know the holdings of ETFs before they buy  They need to know to be sure they do not buy a fund that might blow up  Buying a fund without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances  As Barron s says  investors should know the Danger Within  No matter how cheap  if it holds bad stocks  the ETF s performance will be bad 
PERFORMANCE OF FUND S HOLDINGS   PERFORMANCE OF FUND
Finding the Style ETFs with the Best Holdings
Figure 1 shows my top rated ETF for each style  Importantly  my ratings on ETFs are based primarily on my stock ratings of their holdings  My firm covers over 3000 stocks and is known for the due diligence we do for each stock we cover  Accordingly  our coverage of ETFs leverages the diligence we do on each stock by rating ETFs based on the aggregated ratings of the stocks each ETF holds 
Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF  SCHD K  is the top rated All Cap Blend ETF and the overall second rated fund of the 236 style ETFs that I cover  Only the Large Cap Value style contains any Attractive  i e  4 star  rated ETFs  while the best every other style can offer is a Neutral or 3 star ETF 
Sometimes  you get what you pay for 
It is troubling to see one of the best style ETFs  First Trust First Trust Capital Strength ETF  FTCS  have just  77 million in assets despite its Attractive or 4 star rating  On the other hand  Dangerous rated PowerShares S P 500 High Dividend Portfolio  SPHD K  has  158 million in assets  SPHD has lower total annual costs than FTCS  0 33  and 0 72  respectively   but low costs cannot drive positive performance  Quality holdings are the ultimate driver of performance 
I cannot help but wonder if investors would leave SPHD if they knew that it has such a poor portfolio of stocks  It is cheaper than FTCS  but  as previously stated  low fees cannot growth wealth  only good stocks can 
Sometimes  you DON T get what you pay for 
The smallest ETF in Figure 1 is State Street SPDR Russell 2000 Low Volatility ETF  SMLV  with just  11 miilion in assets  Sadly  other Small Cap Blend ETFs with more assets and inferior portfolios charge more than SMLV  In other words  Small Cap Blend ETF investors are paying extra fees for no reason 
First Trust Small Cap Core AlphaDEX Fund  FYX  is one of the worst ETFs in the Small Cap Blend style  It gets my Dangerous rating based off the fact that barely 8  of its assets are allocated to Attractive or better rated stocks  while 67  is allocated to Dangerous or worse stocks  FYX also has total annual costs of 0 78   higher than SMLV s 0 28   One would think that FYX would have fewer assets than SMLV  but instead it has over  566 million  Investors are paying extra fees for poor holdings 
The worst ETF in Figure 1 is Vanguard S P Small Cap 600 Growth ETF  VIOG K   which gets a Dangerous  2 star  rating  One would think ETF providers could do better for this style 
I recommend investors only buy ETFs with more than  100 million in assets  You can find more liquid alternatives for the other funds on my  
Covering All The Bases  Including Costs
My ETF rating also takes into account the total annual costs  which represents the all in cost of being in the ETF  This analysis is complex for mutual funds  but straightforward for ETFs  where all costs are factored into the expense ratio  While costs play a smaller role than holdings  my ratings penalize those ETFs with abnormally high costs 
Top Stocks Make Up Top ETFs
International Business Machines  IBM  is one of my favorite stocks held by FTCS and earns my Very Attractive rating  The declining PC market hurt IBM s profits in 2013 as after tax profit  NOPAT  declined by 3   but company s long term track record of profit growth is solid  Over the past decade  International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  has grown NOPAT by 8  compounded annually  Its return on invested capital  ROIC  stands at a top quintile 15   The market is focused on the near term issues  however  as IBM is priced for stagnation  At its current valuation of   195 share  IBM has a price to economic book value ratio of 1 0  which implies that the company will never grow NOPAT from its current level  Given IBM s track record of growth and adaptation  I expect it to easily surpass those low expectations

177117,398633,IBM,Here s What The Buy Side Expects From Hewlett Packard On Thursday,opinion,"Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ  is set to report FQ2 2014 earnings after the market closes on Thursday  May 22nd  Hewlett Packard is a multinational information technology company which has seen its revenue slip on a year over year basis for 8 consecutive quarters over the past 2 years  Rackspace  NYSE RAX   a cloud hosting company  has been struggling lately to compete with larger players in the industry like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services as a price war has been raging  It s rumored that Hewlett Packard or one of its rivals such as IBM  NYSE IBM  might be getting ready to acquire Rackspace  On Thursday Wall Street expects Hewlett Packard s earnings to come in 1c ahead of FQ2 of last year while revenue slips by 1   Here s what investors are expecting from Hewlett Packard on Thursday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Hewlett Packard to report 88c EPS and  27 350B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 25 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 89c EPS and  27 299B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Hewlett Packard to report 1c ahead of Wall Street s EPS consensus while coming up  51 million short on revenue 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Hewlett Packard s EPS and revenue 3 times each  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing similar earnings projections on Hewlett Packard from Wall Street and Estimize 

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 87c to 91c per share and from  26 637B to  28 301B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a narrow range of EPS estimates on Hewlett Packard and a wider range of revenue estimates 
The size of the distribution of EPS estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrower distribution of estimates signals more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings 

Throughout the quarter  the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from 89c to 88c while the Estimize consensus dropped from 90c to 89c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus rose from  26 840B to  27 350B while the Estimize consensus climbed from  26 861B to  27 299B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revisions at the end of the quarter are often a bullish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is TechStockRadar who projects 89c EPS and  27 397B in revenue  TechStockRadar is ranked 13th overall among over 4 450 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years TechStockRadar has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue an impressive 66  and 63  of the time respectively throughout 538 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case TechStockRadar expects Hewlett Packard to report in line with the Estimize community on EPS while coming out ahead on sales 
On Thursday contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting HP to sneak past Wall Street s EPS consensus while reporting slightly lower sales  The Estimize community is also expecting HP to report a 9th consecutive quarter of falling year over year revenue  which has fueled speculation that HP might consider making an acquisition to boost sales

 BANGALORE  April 15  Reuters    Infosys Technologies Ltd
   India s No  2 software services exporter  sparked
worries about the sector s growth after it forecast annual sales
lower than expected on slower client spending  knocking its
shares down nearly 10 percent 	
Kicking off results for India s nearly  60 billion
IT sector on Friday  Infosys estimated tepid revenue growth due
to global economic uncertainty and said margins would decline
for the year ending March 2012  highlighting currency risks for
the export focused sector 	
  Based on what Infosys has reported and forecast  people
will taper down their earnings estimates for the top players in
the sector   said Tejas Doshi  vice president of research at
Sushil Finance in Mumbai 	
 Bangalore based Infosys  seen as a benchmark for the Indian
outsourcing sector  has missed analysts  profit estimates for
the third time in four quarters 	
  You are seeing high fluctuations in the client spending due
to global economic uncertainties  Margins will remain under
pressure for the companies   Doshi said 	
 Infosys  larger rival Tata Consultancy Services and
No  3 player Wipro have been battling a strengthening
local currency and pay increases for staff as they fight to
retain talent while competing with rivals such as IBM 
and Accenture    	
 Infosys Chief Operating Officer S D  Shibulal said
the company expected to raise wages 10 to 12 percent in fiscal
year 2012  while likely not being able to raise pricing   We
have assumed for all our guidance purposes flat pricing  
Shibulal said 	
 Infosys  which has 130 820 staff  plans to add 45 000 more
this year 	
 
 In the latest management shakeup in the sector  Infosys said
its human resources chief  T V  Mohandas Pai  had quit  Pai  the
former CFO  was widely seen by analysts as the only non founder
who could become CEO  Pai joined Infosys in 1994 and was a
member of the board since May 2000 	
  We have had transitions in the past   these things are part
and parcel of a growth of a corporate and what is good is that
we have the leadership required to manage these transitions  
Chief Executive S  Gopalakrishnan said  referring to Pai s move 	
 Infosys s chairman is slated to retire in August this year 
prompting media reports he would be replaced by the current
chief executive in a move that would create a vacancy for the
top job 	
 Infosys  board would meet on April 30 to discuss succession
plans 	
 In January  Wipro replaced the chiefs of its key outsourcing
business after struggling to keep up with peers 	
 Indian companies are seeing a shakeup in top management as
some founder led firms seek to resolve succession issues and
others look to revamp strategies amid intense competition from
domestic and overseas rivals 	
 Infosys shares ended 9 6 percent lower on Friday  the
biggest daily fall since May 19  2009  and rival Wipro dropped
as much as 5 percent  The sector index fell 6 3 percent
in a broader market down 1 5 percent 	
 More than 10 million shares were provisionally traded on the
National Stock Exchange  more than 10 times its 90 day daily
average volume 	
 
 ECONOMIC WORRY WEIGHS	
  The biggest concern for Infosys  prospect this year is the
slow recovery of the U S  and European economy   said Eric Lin 
manager of the India fund at Prudential Plc s fund unit in
Taipei 	
 Infosys expects revenue for the fiscal year 2012 to rise
between 18 percent and 20 percent to  7 1 billion and to  7 3
billion versus analysts  consensus forecast of  7 3 billion 	
  There is pressure on margins  That is a combination of both
cost pressures and the rupee  Even the outlook is below market
expectation   said Nitin Jain  Singapore principal investment
manager at Kotak Mahindra s fund management unit 	
  The revenue guidance is broadly in line with expectation 
but where we see some disappointment is lower earnings guidance
which means there will be margin pressures   Jain said 	
 Infosys projected profit per American shares for this fiscal
year to rise between 8 percent and 10 percent to  2 83 to  2 88
compared to consensus of  3 10 	
  We don t think the result will hurt Infosys  leading
position in the industry  The company has a cash cow business 
and its long term competitive edge remains   said Prudential s
Lin 	
 Infosys  founded in 1981 by seven engineers with  250
borrowed from their spouses  reported a net profit of 18 2
billion rupees   408 5 million  versus 16 billion rupees a year
ago 	
 Revenue rose 22 percent to 72 5 billion rupees as the firm
added 34 new clients in the fiscal fourth quarter to take the
tally to 620   	
 This compares with a Reuters poll forecast for net profit of
18 8 billion rupees and revenue of 74 6 billion rupees for
Infosys   whose clients include Goldman Sachs   BT
Group and BP  	
 The company s operating expenses rose to 9 1 billion rupees
in January March from 7 4 billion rupees a year ago  It added
3 041 staff  its slowest pace in three quarters       	
 Infosys  which boasts higher profit margins versus local and
global peers  said its margins could decline nearly 3 percent
this fiscal year  mainly due to volatility in local currency 	
 Infosys had operating margin of 30 2 percent versus 28 1
percent for Tata Consultancy and 11 9 percent for Accenture  as
per the latest data from Thomson Reuters StarMine 	
 Indian software companies hedge some of their currency
exposures  but a chunk of their costs are in rupees and
appreciation of the local currency tends to squeeze margins 	
   Currency volatility continues to be a challenge   Chief
Financial Officer V  Balakrishnan told reporters in Bangalore 	
   1   44 5 rupees

177132,398648,IBM,Buy This  Corny  ETF Now,opinion,"As I recently discussed  banks  mutual funds  hedge funds and other institutional funds have been rotating out of the NASDAQ and into the S P 500 and Dow Jones in recent weeks 
Although this has been leading to moderately bullish price action in select blue chip stocks such as International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   more explosive  high momentum moves have been coming from various commodity based ETFs  which have a low correlation to the direction of the overall stock market  
Today  I share with you the technical setup of one of the best looking ETF trade setups out there right now 
Corn Is Popping 
Designed to follow the price of continuous corn futures contracts  the Corn ETF  CORN LSE  broke out from a short term consolidation on heavy volume yesterday  March 31   after a three week consolidation 
Note the drop off in volume during the base of consolidation  which was bullish 

The  undercut  of the 20 day exponential moving average that occurred on the morning of March 31 was followed by a breakout above the high of the recent range  from shakeout to breakout in a few hours  
Confirming the massive intraday reversal and breakout was a huge volume spike  nearly 400  it average daily volume  
Whenever volume suddenly surges so massively as a stock ETF breaks out above a tight range  it is the undeniable footprint of institutional buying activity  which acts as a gas pedal to propel the stock ETF higher in the near to intermediate term 
Corn Confirmation On Weekly
Since a key part of our technical analysis is always looking for confirmation on multiple time frames  let s zoom out to look at the longer term weekly chart of CORN 

On the weekly chart above  notice the tight price action near resistance of the 40 week moving average  similar to 200 day moving average  over the preceding four weeks 
When the price of CORN broke out yesterday  it pushed above the highs of that 4 week range  It s also quite bullish that yesterday s volume alone nearly equaled turnover the entire previous week 
With such strong volume confirming a clean weekly breakout and trend reversal  bullish momentum is likely to carry  CORN substantially higher over the next several weeks

177146,398662,IBM,Adam Low  Supply And Demand Key To Base Metals Success,opinion,"Adam Low of Raymond James believes that the outlook is excellent for zinc  good for copper and neutral for iron ore  In this interview with The Gold Report  he argues that it comes down to supply and demand  Copper supply may soon lag demand  and zinc demand  which is increasing steadily  will soon face a 10  decline in supply  Low suggests eight miners that should benefit from providing the metals the global economy will need to support future growth 
The Gold Report  Your 2014 prognosis for industrial metals is largely positive  correct 
Adam Low  Yes  although our view is not universal  We are most positive on copper and zinc  somewhat less enthusiastic about nickel  We re fairly neutral on iron ore  although we do expect a bit of softening in iron ore prices 
TGR  Why do you like zinc 
AL  We are starting to see fundamental changes occurring in the market  This is a supply story  Zinc has been an unloved metal for decades  As a result  there has been very little investment  which means that six major mines in operation for decades have or will soon end production 
The first two  in Canada  closed in 2013  The next major shut down  scheduled for mid 2015  is MMG Inc  s  1208 HK  Century mine in Australia  the world s second largest zinc mine 
TGR  How much global supply will be lost as a result 
AL  About 10  
TGR  So prices will rise 
AL  Yes  Visible inventories on the London Metals Exchange  as well as on the Shanghai Futures Exchange  are down about 30  over the last year  And zinc demand is increasing steadily  There are some suggestions that we have a small zinc deficit already 
TGR  What are the supply and demand fundamentals in copper 
AL  I d characterize the copper market as being infected with  short termism   Mine supply grew quite spectacularly in 2013  between 6  and 7   How sustainable is that growth  In a couple of years  we could easily have the same problem we had a decade ago  when mine supply lagged behind demand 
TGR  Why would this happen 
AL  One third of global copper supply comes from Chile  This country is increasingly constrained by power and water supplies  labor rates are rising as well  Chile s state owned copper enterprise  the Corporaci n Nacional del Cobre de Chile  CODELCO   produces about one tenth of global copper  and it requires something on the order of  20 27 billion   20 27B  in reinvestment over the next five or six years in order to maintain both current production and grow its production base  That will be quite difficult 
TGR  Why are you less enthusiastic about nickel 
AL  In the long term  we remain skeptical about that market  Indonesia  one of the world s largest nickel miners  has implemented a ban on exports of raw ore  which curtailed a major source of global supply  Nevertheless  nickel has abundant visible inventories  It also has growing supply from long beleaguered laterite projects now finally coming to fruition  Ambatovy  Koniambo and On a Puma 
TGR  Why are iron ore prices softening 
AL  We expect supply growth from mines to outweigh demand growth  particularly as major mines start up in Australia and Brazil  At current prices  the industry is making phenomenal margins  more than 100   At lower prices  companies at the high end of the cost curve will struggle  but the others should continue to do very well 
TGR  To what extent are higher base metal prices dependent on positive global economic news 
AL  Growth is a key factor  The U S  economy appears to have improved  although I m a little bit skeptical about just how robust or sustainable this growth is  especially now that the Federal Reserve has decided to reduce its bond buying 
TGR  How do you view the short term economic prospects of China and Europe 
AL  In Europe  the latest purchasing manufacturers  index is at its best since 2011  We are beginning to see some resurgence from some of the weakest economies  such as Greece  And Germany still looks good  Even so  I don t think we can count on Europe being the key driver for world economic growth quite yet 
TGR  And China 
AL  China is still growing and from a larger base  So while its relative growth may be less impressive than it was  its absolute growth is still quite extraordinary  Any industrialized Western nation would be incredibly envious of  only  6 7  GDP growth per year 
TGR  There is a growing concern that the equities markets are overheated  particularly with the Fed tapering quantitative easing  If there is a significant correction  will base metals equities follow suit  or could we see instead a flight to safety in metals 
AL  If there is a significant correction  we could see base metals equities follow suit  even though they didn t enjoy the upside the rest of the market did  In the longer term  the widening gap between the growing demand and the dwindling supply of many base metals should spark a resurgence of investor interest in this sector 
TGR  Will base metals equities continue to lag prices in 2014 
AL  This trend should begin to correct  Base metals prices have been quite steady over the last year despite headlines that have generated fear and volatility  This steady price environment should provide investors with greater comfort about metals prices  which should  in turn  lead to greater confidence in investing in the equities 
TGR  What are Raymond James  top base metals picks for 2014 
AL  In copper  our preferred stocks are Capstone Mining Corp   CS TSX   First Quantum Minerals Ltd   FM TSX  FQM LSE   Nevsun Resources Ltd   NSU TSX  NSU NYSE MKT  and Rio Alto Mining Ltd   RIO TSX V  RIO BVL  
In zinc  Trevali Mining Corp   TV TSX  TREVF OTCQX  TV BVL   Nevsun and Lundin Mining Corp   LUN TSX  
In iron ore  Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corporation  LIF UN TSX  and Alderon Iron Ore Corp   ADV TSX  AXX NYSE MKT  
TGR  First Quantum has announced production estimates for its Cobre Panama copper project significantly higher than those of previous owner Inmet Mining Corp   IMN TSX   Will this allay fears over its cost 
AL  The new Cobre Panama capital expenditure  capex  is  6 4B  only about 4  higher than Inmet s former guidance  It has projected a design rate of 70 million tons  70 Mt  year ore being processed versus Inmet s 55 Mt year  It is also projecting a higher throughput rate  So the capex is slightly higher  but the cash flows to be generated from the mine have been increased significantly 
Given the size of this project and the inflationary nature of this industry  the market has taken the view that Cobre Panama is actually very well managed 
TGR  When will Cobre Panama begin production 
AL  My colleague Alex Terentiew covers First Quantum  and he s forecasting 2017 2018 
TGR  To what extent is the company s future leveraged to Cobre Panama 
AL  First Quantum is now a fairly well diversified company  It has done numerous acquisitions recently  and it has a base of operations that includes Australia  Africa  Europe and South America  Cobre Panama is certainly its largest growth project but not its only growth project  it has many other mines generating cash flow 
TGR  What distinguishes Cobre Panama from Barrick Gold Corp  s  ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  Pascua Lama white elephant 
AL  First Quantum has a phenomenal record of executing major projects  including those that other companies have stumbled on  For instance  the Ravensthorpe nickel mine in Australia  which BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK   the world s largest mining company  struggled with for many years  First Quantum bought it and got it operating at the rates it promised 
Unlike Barrick  First Quantum does much of its engineering and construction in house  It uses teams it has used multiple times for projects around the world  It takes lessons from previous successes and replicates them elsewhere  It leverages a vast amount of experience and thus contains its costs 
TGR  What s your rating for First Quantum 
AL  We have an Outperform rating and a  25 target price 
TGR  Nevsun has transitioned its Bisha mine in Eritrea from gold to copper  Has that been successful 
AL  Very much so  Bisha is a polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit that had a gold oxide rich cap  Nevsun was fortunate to produce that gold when prices were at their peak  It had a very successful commissioning period with the new copper plant in late 2013  with production coming in near the high end of its guidance and exceeding our estimates  It has already declared commercial production of copper 
TGR  And Nevsun pays a dividend of  0 07 share 
AL  Actually  it s  0 07 twice annually  so you re actually getting  0 14 year 
TGR  Why do you say that Nevsun trades at a significant discount 
AL  It trades at a significant discount relative to its peer group  Its valuation is cheaper based on key valuation metrics  price cash flow  price net asset value  NAV   enterprise value earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization or price earnings 
TGR  What explains this discount 
AL  Two key factors  First  country risk  Bisha is located in Eritrea  which suffers from a perception problem  I ve been to Eritrea twice  and I ve been impressed  both with Nevsun s operation and its level of cooperation with the government  a 40  partner in Bisha 
Second  a mergers and acquisitions  M A  overhang  This is probably a larger factor right now than geopolitical risk  Nevsun has about  300 million   300M  in cash  no debt and it s a one asset company  This makes it a likely M A suitor  and the company has been vocal about its intentions  M A always involve risk  and we often see an acquirer s share price trade down on an announcement  so investors are taking a cautious approach 
TGR  How does Nevsun overcome these obstacles 
AL  On Eritrea  we believe that the impressive cash flow accruing to the company over the next couple of years will force the market to re evaluate its risk assessment 
With regard to M A  Nevsun has been very prudent  It refrained from acquisitions when valuations were much higher than now  It doesn t want to grow for growth s sake  Its key criterion in evaluating potential acquisitions is return on investment  So a smart buy now could actually improve its valuation  as it would no longer be an all eggs in one basket company in a country that people don t understand  If we look at recent examples  some base metals companies have had their share prices perform quite well after acquisitions  most notably Capstone and Lundin 
TGR  What s your rating for Nevsun 
AL  We have an Outperform rating and a  5 50 target price 
TGR  Rio Alto s La Arena mine in Peru is now a gold producer  When will it begin to mine copper  and what effect will that have on its future 
AL  Rio Alto has a relatively large copper gold porphyry deposit at La Arena  Currently  it is a fairly significant gold producer  about 200 000 ounces per year  It has a gold oxide processing plant on site  That said  the future of La Arena really is more in copper  The transition will likely happen in 2016 or 2017  But if it were to find additional gold within its concessions  we could see the life of the gold mine extended 
We have a favorable view of La Arena s copper project  We expect it to have a very low capital intensity   11 000 14 000 per ton annual copper equivalent  about half the industry average  It can benefit from existing power and transportation infrastructure  As well  it can use the existing open pit oxide deposit for the tailings during the startup of the copper  At current gold prices  it should be possible to fund the copper expansion using cash flow from the existing gold mine 
TGR  Will Rio Alto be aggressive in beginning new projects in Peru 
AL  La Arena is in a very prospective region of Peru  It is surrounded by many major gold mines  and its concession is relatively underexplored  Rio Alto most likely will look for potential gold oxide satellite deposits that could provide supplemental feed to its existing plant 
Longer term  future acquisitions wouldn t surprise me  given its cash flow  But Rio Alto could be a potential acquisition target itself  given that we view it as an undervalued company with a good organic growth project 
TGR  What s your rating for Rio Alto 
AL  Companies that transition to base metals from precious metals typically encounter trading volatility because these different sectors have different investor groups  However  companies with good projects should weather this volatility well  Nevsun managed a very similar transition quite well  We have an Outperform rating and a  3 50 target price 
TGR  Not long ago  Peru was seen as a country not friendly to mining  Has that changed 
AL  It s hard to classify Peru as being friendly or unfriendly  Projects should be assessed on a case by case basis  Some areas have been opposed to mining  and we have seen violent protests  However  several mining companies have succeeded in Peru  despite its pitfalls of left wing political parties and social community activism 
Rio Alto has flourished with a concentrated  hands on  local approach  using a predominantly Peruvian management team  Even some members of its non Peruvian management team have moved to the country 
TGR  Trevali is also in Peru  where its Santander zinc lead silver mine is about to begin commercial production 
AL  Trevali is the only pure play producer listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and one of a few in the world  By pure play  I mean it will be generating the majority of its revenue from zinc  This is an enviable position  Because of the coming zinc scarcity I mentioned above  investors will be funneled into zinc equities to gain leverage to the zinc market  I ve followed Trevali for about four years  and it is in a stronger position now than I ve ever seen it  The Santander commissioning process has gone well  and its balance sheet is robust 
TGR  How do you rate its non Peru operations 
AL  Trevali has quite a bit of organic growth potential through its other operations  particularly the Halfmile and Stratmat brownfield sites in New Brunswick  which it intends to restart in the next year or so  The bulk of our NAV for Trevali comes from New Brunswick  That s where we re going to see a lot of the value in this story start to accrue 
TGR  What s your rating for Trevali 
AL  We have an Outperform rating and a  1 40 target price 
TGR  Capstone announced that it had met its overall 2013 copper production targets from its Pinto Valley  Cozamin and Minto mines in Arizona  Mexico and Yukon  Even so  shares fell 14  in January  Why 
AL  First  Capstone has been one of the best performing stocks in the sector  so it faced some profit taking  Second  there has been some waning of momentum  Yes  it came in very close to its 2013 production guidance  but its 2014 production guidance was weaker  particularly for Minto  than we expected  Third  some lackluster economic data from China has caused a selloff in many base metals equities in the early part of this year 
TGR  What s your rating for Capstone 
AL  We have a Strong Buy rating and a  4 25 target price 
TGR  What s your outlook for Lundin 
AL  Lundin has a solid management team and a very steady portfolio of mining assets  It also has pretty good cash flow growth coming in soon from its stake in the Tenke Fungurume copper cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  as well as from the startup of its Eagle copper nickel mine in Michigan  recently acquired from Rio Tinto Plc  RIO NYSE  RIO ASX  RIO LSE  RTPPF OTCPK  
Like Nevsun and Trevali  Lundin should benefit from the coming zinc scarcity  It could leverage this by increasing production at its Neves Corvo zinc copper mine in Portugal 
TGR  What s your rating for Lundin 
AL  We recently upgraded it from Market Perform to Outperform  Our target price is  6 25 
TGR  The various iron ore projects in the Labrador Trough have been bedeviled by transportation costs  How serious is this problem 
AL  I think it s been overemphasized  There are already two existing railways in the region that supply existing ports  and both have upside capacity potential  Unfortunately  these railways are controlled by two companies that restrict access  The Cartier Railway is controlled by ArcelorMittal S A   MT NYSE   and because it doesn t cross any provincial boundaries  ArcelorMittal is under no obligation to provide third party access 
The other route  Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway  is owned by the privately held Iron Ore Company of Canada  IOC   Canada s largest producer of iron ore pellets  That railway does cross provincial boundaries and is bound thereby to provide third party access  But that access doesn t come cheap  The challenge is to build a new railway to break the monopoly  Access to existing infrastructure is the reason why our preferred iron ore companies are Alderon and Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corporation 
TGR  What do you like about Alderon 
AL  Alderon has a very good project  Kami  which  as noted  is close to an existing rail line  It has a top notch management team poached from IOC and strong backing from China s largest steel company  Hebei Iron   Steel Co  Ltd   000709 CH   We think 2014 is going to be a monumental year for Alderon  as it will complete many milestones  receiving key permits  bringing on additional offtake and or joint venture partners and securing financing for mine construction 
TGR  What s your rating for Alderon 
AL  We have an Outperform rating and a target price of  2 60 
TGR  Why do you like Labrador Iron Ore Royalty 
AL  It owns 15 1  of IOC and gets a 7  revenue royalty on IOC s production  So here you have a company that owns a stake in a mine that not only operates throughout the commodity cycle IOC has been operating its current mine for five decades but it also owns its own transportation infrastructure 
We see this company as one of the safer ways to play iron ore  and it s also a dividend growth story due to an expansion that is underway at IOC  Its royalty payments should increase because IOC s capital expenditures will decline  as that expansion is nearly completed 
TGR  What s your rating for Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corp  
AL  We have an Outperform rating and a  37 25 target price 
TGR  Any other iron ore companies 
AL  Champion Iron Mines Limited  CHM TSX  is still at the discovery stage  It has very large tonnage specular hematite and magnetite deposits at its Consolidated Fire Lake North project  which is close to the Cartier Railway  The grade for these deposits is close to 30  iron  which is on par with most of the Labrador Trough  but the larger grain size of the mineralization should make beneficiation easier  Champion s challenge is that its transition to production is hampered by a lack of interest from the capital markets in Canadian iron ore projects and ready access to infrastructure 
Mamba Minerals Ltd   MAB ASX  of Australia intends to buy Champion  Mamba s chairman  Michael O Keeffe  sold Riversdale Mining and its Mozambique coking coal project to Rio Tinto for  4B in 2011  Mamba will bring credibility and know how to Champion in its transition from developer to producer 
TGR  What s your rating for Champion 
AL  We have a Market Perform rating and a target price of  0 45 
TGR  What are the characteristics common to your top picks in base metals

177166,398682,IBM,ANALYSIS Indian outsourcers shy of blockbuster MA,news,"  Dealmaking could help Indian firms take on bigger rivals
   IBM  Dell  Cognizant expand offerings through
acquisitions
   Indian firms set for nuts and bolts buys outside U S 
   Companies shy of big deals  lack of risk taking appetite
   Infosys  TCS shares double in  09 on growth view
 By Sumeet Chatterjee   Anshuman Daga
 BANGALORE SINGAPORE  Oct 19  Reuters    In an industry
where size matters  India s showpiece software services firms
need to be bold and acquire firms or risk playing second fiddle
as bigger IT players emerge as one stop shops for
cost conscious clients 
 Oracle and Dell have snapped up targets to grow beyond
their core areas  while Xerox is buying Affiliated Computer
Services for  5 5 billion to jump into the outsourcing sector 
 By acquiring players with a wide client base  India s top
three IT firms    Tata Consultancy Services  Infosys
Technologies and Wipro    can leapfrog in size and clout 
helping them win multi million dollar deals 
 So far  India s near  60 billion IT sector has shied from
blockbuster deals and instead focused on acquiring smaller IT
divisions to tap opportunities in areas such as utilities and
healthcare 
  For good measure these companies have been conserving
their resources and as competitive pressure grows now is the
time to fill up some of their skill gaps through acquisitions  
said Ved Prakash Chaturvedi  managing director at Tata Asset
Management 
 India s top three IT firms each has a market value of
between  18 billion  27 billion and boasts a global footprint 
 These exporters individually employ about 100 000 staff 
mostly in low cost India centers with manicured lawns  pizza
and Subway outlets  auditoriums  fitness centres and golf carts
to move around the sprawling campuses 
 IBM  Accenture and Hewlett Packard have also expanded their
India based workforce  enabling them to move more of their
overseas work to these lower cost centres 
 IBM stole a march in 2004 when it swooped on Daksh  an
early local backoffice outsourcer  for  170 million  and now
employs over 70 000 staff in India  Accenture has over 40 000 
 India s two decade old IT sector already faces cut rate
competition from the bigger players and is struggling to retain
experienced staff  usually lured away by global rivals 
  What might happen in the long term is customers might work
with large all services under one roof kind of vendors  which
Indian vendors do not offer   said Gartner India s principal
research analyst Diptarup Chakraborti 
 Global clients are increasingly keen to partner vendors
offering an array of IT services    from managing complex
computer networks and call centres to software coding 
 Infosys and Tata Consultancy shares have doubled in 2009 
versus a 45 percent rise in IBM and 19 percent in Accenture 
Infosys trades at 20 times forward earnings versus 14 for IBM 
 Firms such as Citibank  General Electric  BT  Ferrari and
British Airways count on Indian firms to help keep their
operations ticking 
 This month  Infosys  improved outlook failed to cheer
markets  suggesting a recovery will take time 
 RADAR ON SMALL BUYS
 For now  Indian IT firms are content with smaller buys 
  Looking for strategic buys that allows them to play on the
grand global stage  that s really the next step that these
Indian companies are in the process of taking   said Mark Mayo 
partner and president at advisory and research firm TPI 
 Analysts see them as potential acquirers in Europe as local
firms look to expand sales in markets other than the United
States to cut their big exposure to the world s largest
economy 
 However  they are unlikely to be keen to swoop on large
European IT players such as Capgemeni and Atos Origin due to
the potential risks arising from adding large headcount to
their existing base of low cost staff 
 Instead  they may be keen to buy Indian backoffice
operations of banks such as BofA Merrill Lynch and American
Express  Firms that specialise in consulting or offer services
to healthcare and energy firms are also targets 
 Cognizant Technology last week bought the Indian backoffice
unit of UBS for about  75 million 
 Infosys  which walked away from a bidding war with a
smaller local rival to acquire British IT firm Axon last year 
has built up a cash pile of  2 8 billion and is now looking for
buys to establish its presence in new markets and add new
service lines 
 HCL Technologies paid about 440 million pounds   720
million  for Axon  marking the biggest overseas acquisition by
an Indian IT firm 
 Infosys CEO Kris Gopalakrishnan said   Our focus on
acquisitions is very different and that s a reason why we are
looking at an acquisition typically 10 percent of our revenue
   that s about  400 million  
 Cultural and integration risks associated with large M A
are also a barrier and Indian firms are unlikely to shed their
cautious approach 
  They do not want to acquire a big ticket player and maybe
they feel the integration issues will be too tough a challenge
to manage in the short to medium term   Gartner s Chakraborti

177168,398684,IBM,What The Buy Side Expects From EMC,opinion,"EMC Corp   EMC  is set to report FQ4 2013 earnings before the market opens on Wednesday  January 29th  EMC is an American multinational corporation that specializes in cloud computing  virtualization  IT services  data storage  analytics  and information security  Last quarter EMC fell behind others in the industry and missed analyst expectations by a wide margin 
This quarter the expectations are sky high  largely thanks to the growth in cloud computing and EMC s partial ownership of VMware and GoPivotal  In December cloud competitor Oracle  ORCL  posted much stronger than expected numbers and IBM  IBM  has recently committed  1 2 billion toward bolstering its own cloud computing capacities  Cloud computing is an industry that both analysts and corporations are expecting continued growth in over the next decade  here s how the buy side expects EMC to report Wednesday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 
 
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for EMC to report 59c EPS and  6 626B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 11 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 59c EPS and  6 630B revenue  Despite a bad miss last quarter  this quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting EMC to report inline with Wall Street expectations on profit and beat by a small margin on revenue 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a very small differential between the 2 groups  forecasts 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69 5  more accurate than Wall Street  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus  
The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 57c to 60c EPS and  6 480B to  6 708B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a smaller distribution of estimates compared to previous quarters 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A smaller distribution of estimates signaling more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings 
The Wall Street and Estimize EPS forecasts have both remained in a tight range all quarter and have fallen from 60c to 59c  Revenue forecasts between the two groups have converged throughout the quarter with the Wall Street consensus dropping from  6 661B to  6 626B while the Estimize com expectation has increased from  6 610B to  6 630B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and at the end of the quarter both groups are showing very similar earnings expectations for EMC 
The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is Zabajaba who projects 59c EPS and  6 480B in revenue  In the Winter 2014 season  Zabajaba is yet to make an estimate but is ranked 146th overall among over 3 600 contributing analysts  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case the analyst with the highest rated estimate is predicting that EMC will report inline with profit expectations but come up way short on revenue

177169,398685,IBM,Cyber Security Stocks With Potential ,opinion,"When it comes to the burgeoning Internet of Things  IoT    whereby companies are equipping everyday objects with internet connectivity   security is an afterthought 
Or as Trend Micro s  TMICY  Christopher Budd says   Lurking behind some of the most exciting products being showcased this year are serious privacy and security concerns  
That s downright frightening news for consumers  I mean  China could already be assembling a cyber weapon of mass destruction to exploit these vulnerabilities 
Yet  at the same time  it s unbelievably positive news for investors 
Here s why 
Another Avenue for Attack
Almost every expert agrees that cyber threats aren t going away anytime soon 
What s more  a brand new frontier of devices is opening up for cyber criminals to target 
Literally billions upon billions of new devices are about to come online   with the ability to send and receive data  no less  And some teenager in Hungary will be able to turn these devices against us  forcing them to bombard the internet with insane amounts of data traffic   grinding vital global websites to a halt 
Or worse  Our sworn enemies could literally kill us by hacking into our medical implants 
Don t believe me  Then you obviously didn t see the 60 Minutes piece with former vice president  Dick Cheney  where he revealed that his doctor insisted on disabling the wireless functionality of his heart implant  He feared that terrorists might hack it in an assassination attempt 
And you must have definitely missed my article last week  when I revealed how an unsuspecting refrigerator was commandeered to participate in a 750 000 message  
Obviously  we can t stand around defenseless  Our daily lives  our economic security   even our national security   are on the line 
So the investment implication for us is obvious 
Go  long  leading cyber security companies  Because demand for their services can only go one way from here   up 
In fact  the uptick is already underway 
Cyber security firms are reporting double digit quarterly sales growth   almost without exception 
But here s the  64 000 question  What cyber security stocks hold the most upside potential 
As promised last week  I m going to answer that question for you today  I m a man of my word  after all 
Let s Make a Deal
Understandably  we ve witnessed a spate of mergers and acquisitions in the cyber security space  as big players like Cisco  CSCO  jockey for position 
In the last year alone  the number of cyber security deals in the United States doubled  according to Dealogic 
So if we want to maximize our profit potential  we d be wise to identify not only a leading cyber security firm  but also one that s a prime takeover target  That means focusing on small cap players  After all  they re the most affordable in dollar terms 
With that in mind  the recent deal between FireEye  Inc   FEYE  and privately held Mandiant proves most instructive 
On January 2  FireEye paid  1 05 billion in a cash and stock deal for Mandiant  which works out to roughly 10 times revenue 
Rest assured  the valuation isn t an outlier  Not when we consider that Cisco paid 12 times revenue for Sourcefire back in July 2013 
If we apply the same multiple for the Mandiant purchase to the remaining independent cyber security firms  an obvious investment choice emerges for us  The KEYW Holding Corporation  KEYW  
 
It s important to note that the company boasts similarly impressive growth rates as its peers  So the fact that it s trading at a discount to the industry on a price to sales basis isn t based on inferior fundamentals 
Could the upside potential really be that significant  though  Yes  indeed  And don t just take my word for it 
Wall Street Analyst Goes Rogue
On the heels of FireEye s deal for Mandiant  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst  Tobey Sommer  wrote in a note to investors that KEYW would be worth over  80 per share in a buyout 
At the time  shares were only trading hands for about  15  So his estimate implies an upside of more than 400   too 
Never in my career have I witnessed such a bold call from a mainstream Wall Street analyst  It s not in their nature  They re herd animals 
Accordingly  I admire Sommer s willingness to break rank  And  of course  I wholeheartedly agree with his analysis 
Bottom line  With cyber attacks on the rise  don t be foolish and leave your portfolio vulnerable  too  Load up on shares of KEYW before one of the titans of the industry   like Cisco Systems Inc   CSCO   IBM  IBM   Juniper  JNPR   Symantec  SYMC   or EMC  EMC    goes on a buying spree and beats you to it 
Full disclosure  We originally recommended KEYW to WSD Insider subscribers when it was trading for  11 26 per share  And now they re sitting on an unrealized gain of 48   and counting  ",2014-01-30,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cyber-security-stocks-with-potential-200700,200700
177170,398686,IBM,Weekend Links  Heading For A Strong Year End Market Rally ,opinion,"With the SP 500 down 3  in January  14  and as January is thought of as the January Barometer  and a good leading indicator for full year equity returns  we are trying to balance the mental gymnastics of knowing the stock market was overbought and needing a correction  versus the thought that January s negative 3  return might actually mean something  The SP 500 JUST exited a 13 year bear market in May  2013 by trading over the old March  2000 and October  2007 highs of 1 550 and 1 577  According to the charts  the new bull market has just gotten started 
One pundit described the 3 choices this way  January s thrashing for the SP 500 as a suggestion that the SP 500 is entering a long term bear market  versus a period of flat to negative 10  returns  versus another strong year 
I don t know of too many widely followed market bears that think we are headed for a repeat of 2008 today or even a 20  bear market  but those who are negative seem to think a 10  to 15  pullback cures all the bullish sentiment from the stock market and will instill a significant amount of appropriate fear to allow for the next decent advance 
My own opinion is that the  2 year President Cycle  as proferred by Jeff Kleintop and Josh Brown inLinkfest is the right analog to this market  which means we get a flat to  10  through the first 6   9 months of 2014  and then a strong year end rally 
Some think a re test of the SP 500 s 50 day moving average at 1 812 41 as of Friday 1 31 14 s close is the key to the next market move  The thought is that if the SP 500 is rejected at the 50 day m a and starts to fade on volume  it is highly likely we take out the Dec  13 lows on the SP 500 and we are headed for a deeper correction in the SP 500  which could mean 1 700 on the SP 500 or lower  We need a better flush in the main stock market indices 
Josh Brown on some using the as analog for the 2014 market  Have to believe that 2014 SP 500 crash like 1929  is a huge stretch  Josh does a good job of debunking the analogy 
 is Ryan Detrick on the 2 Year Presidential Cycle analog  When you have three market heavyweights and superb pundits like Jeff Kleintop  strategist at LPL   Josh Brown  portfolio manager  analyst and market commentator and Ryan Detrick  technician  all who come at the market with somewhat different disciplines  agreeing that the 2 year Presidential Cycle pattern has some weight  you can see why I am starting to talk to clients about it 
Ryan Detrick flagged  buying climax cluster last May  13  too and it led to some market congestion  The attached tweet from Ryan is from Friday Feb 1   14  and it is December  13 and January  14 data  Tells me we are likely working lower over the near term 
This guy  UKarlewitz  has some good stuff on Twitter  Good  on SP 500 testing 1 770 3 times this week 
Good chart from  361Capital on the retail space  XRT is the chart shown   Largest 3 components of XRT by market cap weight are Amazon  AMZN  at 10  of XRT  Wal Mart  WMT  at 9  and Home Depot  HD  at 8    9   Two of the three   Amazon and Wal Mart   had a tough Friday  Jan 31  14 with earnings  AMZN  or the preannouncement  WMT   I think you have to use pullbacks in sectors like retail and Consumer Discretionary to buy quality names  WMT is first  despite US comp issues  next we d buy AMZN down near  325  is where we would add that name  Whole Foods  WFM  we like and they report in next two weeks   361Capital s summary comes out Monday night s   it is one of the best research pieces all week  Long all stocks mentioned  XRT trading just below its 200 day moving average currently   Long all except XRT  
The Treasury and bond markets had a good January  14  The TLT was up 6   the IEF up 3   the AGG was 1 5   The Muni Bond Agg  MUB  was up 2 5  and the HYG and JNK  both high yield corporate ETF s rose 0 40  and 0 57  respectively  Some think when corporate credit spreads get whacked  widen   the equity market correction will be in its last throes  We sold one of our muni ETF s this week  MEN  and will likely trim further some interest rate risk this week or next  Our Treasury short   TBF   hurt us in January  down 6  
Our balanced accounts did very well in 2013  as our Treasury short  TBF  added a lot of value  and we traded in and out of high yield and the ETF s  I told clients  in a tough market like the credit and bond markets will be in the next few years  you have to trade  and not buy and hold  The plethora of ETF s introduced over the last 13 years has allowed a typically long only advisor like me to become much more hedge fund like in volatile markets  It is much easier to hedge risk with inverse ETf s and protect limit client s downside risk  We haven t bought on yet to the Direxion and the 2 x    3 x  leveraged ETF s but the unlevered inverse ETF s do work nicely for valuation sensitive protection 
According to the SPDR ETF s  every sector was negative in January  14  except healthcare   0 94   and UTE s   2 98   for the month 
The Russell 2000 fell 2 77  in January  14  versus the SP 500 s  3 52   Hard to believe with the outperformance of the RUT  over last 5 years     that the small cap run is over  Continued small cap outperformance relative to the large caps tells me that the bull market isn t getting long in the tooth  as the 1998 drop did  The RUT peaked in early 1998  and its drop preceded the LongTerm Capital Crisis  RUT s only began to outperform again in 2003  The RUT is struggling to regain its 50 day moving average on the daily chart

177172,398688,IBM,Analysts Expect Rackspace To Come Up Short,opinion,"Rackspace Hosting Inc   RAX  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings after the market closes on Monday  February 10th  Rackspace is an American IT hosting company which provides hybrid cloud solutions to clients which allow workloads to be run on public cloud  private cloud  dedicated servers  or a combination of platforms  Analysts across the board are expecting a significant increase in the demand for cloud services  Many large tech companies such as IBM  IBM  who recently committed over  1billion are making significant investments to the cloud space  While the cloud space may be an area of  growth in the near future for Rackspace  investors are not expecting this quarter s report to be so hot 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors  
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for RAX to report 14c EPS and  404 86M revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 13c EPS and  402 51M revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting RAX to miss the Wall Street consensus on both profit and revenue by a small margin 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69 5  more accurate than Wall Street  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing an average differential compared to previous quarters 
The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 12c to 14c EPS and  392 86M to  405 86M in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a smaller distribution of estimates compared to other quarters 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrower distribution of estimates signaling more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings 
Throughout the quarter the EPS estimate from Wall Street decreased from 16c to 14c while the Estimize consensus remained flat at 13c  Over the same time period Wall Street raised its revenue expectation from  401 63M to  404 86M while the Estimize forecast dropped from  404 64M to  402 51M  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and Wall Street and Estimize have flipped positions in forecasting RAX s revenue 
The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is jshoe who projects 12c EPS and  405 86M in revenue  In the Winter 2014 season jshoe rated as the 30th best analyst and is ranked 52nd overall among over 3 800 contributing analysts  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case jshoe is expecting Rackspace Hosting beat the Street on revenue but jshoe also agrees with the Estimize community that RAX will be short on profit 
While RAX may be well positioned to capitalize on the expected expansion into cloud services  analysts are not expecting such a great quarter this time around  Contributing analaysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting Rackspace Hosting to miss the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue

177173,398689,IBM,Callidus Software  In The Danger Zone  ,opinion,"Check out this week s Danger Zone Interview with Chuck Jaffe of Money Life and MarketWatch com 
Cloud software provider Callidus  CALD    11 share  is in the Danger Zone this week  We ve recently highlighted two other Software as a Service  SaaS  companies in Netsuite  N  and Salesforce com  CRM   and CALD is a classic story of a bad company riding the coattail of the popularity of cloud computing and Saas companies  SaaS stocks surged in 2013  and CALD followed the trend  gaining 166  over the past year 
Compared to its competitors  CALD has less scale  inferior profitability metrics  and fishy accounting to boot  The  stock s valuation is so high that our DCF model can hardly make sense of it  The stock seems to be trading largely on the hopes of an acquisition 
Poor Profitability
CALD has never earned a profit  nor has it ever even come close  2008 was its best year  when it earned over  100 million in revenue and had profit  NOPAT  margins of  11   In terms of return on invested capital  ROIC   CALD s best year was 2011  when it was  25   In its most profitable year of operation  CALD lost 25 cents for every dollar invested 
CALD looks bad on a cash flow basis as well  The company has had negative free cash flow in five out of the past six years  and it has burned through roughly  75 million in the past two years  CALD has reported positive cash flows in 2013  but that s due to the  17 5 million in deferred revenue at year end  a fourfold increase from the year before 
CALD started 2013 with  67 million in adjusted total debt  It managed to reduce that debt by  31 million in 2013 by issuing another 4 million shares  further diluting its stock  The fact that CALD had to resort to issuing further shares to pay back its debt should concern investors  The positive cash flow from deferred revenues is only a short term patch on what appears to be a very leaky business 
Fishy Accounting
CALD employs multiple accounting tricks to give the illusion of profitability 
Like many unprofitable companies  CALD likes to highlight its  non GAAP  results  which exclude items like stock based compensation  restructuring expense  and other non cash or non recurring expenses  While I am in support of using non GAAP measures to analyze profitability  our NOPAT metric makes several adjustments to GAAP net income  investors should be very wary of non GAAP measures provided by companies  Typically  when companies make up their own profit metrics  they tend to find ways to boost profitability 
CALD uses two main techniques to boost its  non GAAP  earnings  The first  stock based compensation  is a widespread practice  especially in the tech industry  While GAAP rules changed to require companies to include stock based compensation expense in 2005  many companies like CALD continue to exclude stock based compensation in non GAAP results  Excluding stock based compensation expense allowed CALD to boost non GAAP income by  13 7 million  14  of revenue  in 2012 and  10 4 million  9  of revenue  in 2013  All these outstanding employee stock options constitute a  25 million  6  of market cap  liability for CALD 
The other  more unusual technique CALD employs involves restructuring expense  CALD has incurred restructuring expenses in each of the past seven years with an average expense of  1 6 million a year  According to its filings  CALD has been undergoing restructuring for more than half of its life as a publicly traded company  This typically  unusual  charge for CALD has become usual  Perhaps  they like classifying expenses as  restructuring  because they exclude those costs from their  non GAAP  income metric 
The surge in CALD s stock price last year came in part from its return to  non GAAP  profitability in 2013  CALD reported a  non GAAP  profit of  1 8 million  most of which is made up of the  1 7 million in restructuring expenses that the  non GAAP  metric excludes  CALD might classify these expenses as  non recurring   but their history suggests otherwise 
Competitive Position
While we ve compared CALD s profitability to CRM and N  it actually has set itself up to avoid direct competition with those firms as much as possible  Its Learning  Hiring  Marketing  and Selling clouds aim to fill in the gaps between the enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management solutions marketed by larger companies 
Unfortunately for CALD  it s not the only company filing those gaps  Numerous small companies compete with CALD as does Oracle  ORCL   In fact  ORCL is making a big push into the cloud software space and it seems to view CALD as a less formidable adversary than CRM or N 
Obviously  ORCL has a massive scale advantage over CALD  ORCL spent almost  5 billion on research and development in 2013 while CALD spent just  17 million  Of course ORCL is not spending its entire R D budget on cloud products  but there s no question it can outspend CALD by a huge amount 
We re seeing a growing level of commoditization in the software industry  and CALD looks like a prime candidate to fall victim to this trend  As more firms try to occupy its niche  CALD will struggle to differentiate its product  and it should have real trouble competing with a firm like ORCL on price 
Valuation in the Clouds
CALD pulled back over 20  at the end of last week due to lower guidance  but it remains significantly overvalued  If we assume CALD can achieve profitability next year and reach 20  pre tax margins by 2019  same level as IBM   it would still have to grow revenue by 8  compounded annually for 25 years to justify its valuation of   11 50 share 
Both the margin assumptions and the revenue growth horizon seem overly optimistic to me  CALD faces too much competition going forward to assume 20  margins  while 25 years is too long of a growth appreciation period for a company in a rapidly changing industry like cloud software 
Figure 1 shows how CALD s stock price and profitability have reached an unprecedented level of divergence recently 

Figure 1  Stock Price vs Economic Book Value  Zero Growth Value 


Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings

Despite the 20  drop  CALD is still near its all time high  while economic book value is near its all time low  There has never been a worse time to buy 
Insider Selling Signals a Top
The recent decline is not just a blip for CALD  it s the start of a long term downtrend  A look at the insider trading activity for CALD bears out this thesis  Over the past six months  insiders have sold over 200 thousand shares  about 12  of their holdings  Such a large amount of selling does not signal strong confidence in the company s future 
Shorting a high momentum stock is always a dangerous proposition  but the recent reversal of momentum makes CALD an appealing short candidate  Any further slowdown in revenue growth or profitability  or success from competitors like ORCL  could send the stock tanking 
The only possibility for price appreciation at this point seems to be an acquisition  Rumors have been spreading that CALD could be an acquisition target  but no offers have been made as of yet  I don t see any company wanting to give CALD much of a premium to its current valuation  but acquisitions are not always rational  so I can t rule out the possibility  Still  the downside risk in this stock is much greater than the slim chance of a lucrative buyout 
CALD is a great example of the sector trap  When a high growth industry  like cloud computing  catches the market s eye  the flood of investors sends all stocks higher  even those like CALD that can t justify their valuations  Look for an even bigger drop in the future as the market value adjusts back to the reality of CALD s fundamentals

After piercing the lower trendline of its Orthodox Broadening Top  Megaphone formation  at 1748 00 SPX continued its reversal above the Wedge trendline  This completes phase 7 of that pattern  The Phase 8 may be a potential crash  since this is a major reversal pattern  The Bearish Wedge implies a probable reversal to its origin  A new record high will not negate the effects of a Bearish Wedge  It only postpones it  Bearish technicians are now bullish

The Euro may have a head fake 



The Euro closed above weekly Short term and Intermediate termsupport  This may not be indicative of a new bull run in the Euro  The inability to make anew high indicated this may be a bearish head fake 
    The euro zone economy grew slightly faster than expected in the last three months of 2013  an official report showed on Friday  bringing welcome news for the global economy amid signs of slowing in the United States and China 
Although growth in the 18 nation currency union is still weak  at a 1 1 percent annualized rate  it was the euro zone s third straight quarter in positive territory  indicating that the bloc is well beyond the year and a half recession that ended in mid 2013 
The broader 28 member European Union also grew  though weakly  for the third consecutive quarter  The Union  with a market of 500 million consumers and an economy worth about 11 7 trillion euros  or  16 trillion  is one of the pillars of the global economy  and the extended weakness there has been a major source of concern for officials in the United States 
The Yen challenging Intermediate term resistance 



The Yen slipped beneath weekly Intermediate term resistance at 97 97  but closed above it on  Friday  Further decline is anticipated by the Cycles Model  The next break of the Head   Shoulders neckline may bring the Yen beneath its 2008 lows 
    Japan s Topix index fell  erasing its weekly advance and capping a sixth week of declines  as the yen reversed losses and consumer lenders tumbled 
All but one of the 33 Topix  TPX  industry groups retreated  Toyota Motor Corp   the world s biggest carmaker  decreased 1 3 percent after rising as much as 1 1 percent  Aiful Corp  plunged 10 percent  pacing declines among consumer lenders  after saying it would not provide a full year forecast as the outlook is  uncertain   Kirin Holdings Co   Japan s biggest beverage maker  tumbled 9 2 percent to lead declines on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average after its net income forecast missed estimates 
U S  Dollar fell beneath its Triangle trendline again 



The dollar declined back through its Triangle trendline at 80 40 again  The next level to watch is the December low at 79 50 A reversal above that level reinstates the bullish view on the Dollar The Cycles Model suggests that it has about a week to confirm the decline or reverse higher 
    The dollar declined to its weakest level in almost two months after factory production in the U S  unexpectedly declined in January by the most since May 2009  adding to evidence severe winter weather weighed on the economy 
 With this week s U S  data generally subdued and euro zone data modestly firm in tone  the greenback is ending the week on a defensive note   Nick Bennenbroek  the head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Securities LLC in New York  wrote in a client note   We expect the U S  dollar s softer bias could continue into next week  
Treasuries bounce off the Broadening Wedge 



Treasuries bounced off its Broadening Wedge trendline and weekly Intermediate term support at 130 93  It is probable that declining overheadresistance may be tested again this coming week  Unfortunately  the Cycles Model suggests a renewed decline into the end of February or early March 
  Treasuries rose for the first time in three days as U S  retail sales unexpectedly fell in January by the most since June 2012 and initial claims for jobless benefits rose more than forecast last week 
U S  government securities extended gains as the Treasury sold  16 billion of 30 year bonds at a yield of 3 690 percent  the lowest since August  Current 30 year yields dropped from almost the highest this month  Ten year note yields after inflation  called real yields  were at almost a three week high  The drop in retail sales amid inclement weather came as the Federal Reserve plans to keep reducing bond purchases 
Gold rockets to Long term resistance 



Gold rose over 4  to challenge its Long Term resistance at 1313 36 and closed above it Unfortunately  the rally may be over  or nearly so  after making a 54 5  retracement of the prior decline The Cycles Model calls for a month long decline that may break through the Lip of a Cup with Handle formation  The potential consequences appear to be severe  See the article below to gauge the sentiment of the analysts 
   Gold prices are poised to extend their 2014 rebound and reach  1 400 an ounce  the highest since September  according to technical analysis from Citi Futures and RBC Wealth Management 
Prices yesterday settled above the 100 day moving average for a second straight day for the first time since October  The metal has also closed above its 50 day measure in every session since Jan  23  The pattern signals prices will rally 8 5 percent by the end of March  Chicago based Sterling Smith of Citi Futures said 
Crude falls short of a 50  retracement 



Crude peaked on Wednesday  an important pivot day  and eased down into the close  It had only managed to complete a 47  retracement of its decline from 112 24  There is a Head   Shoulders formation at the base of this rally  which  if pierced  may lead to a much deeper decline 
    Oil prices slipped closer to  100 a barrel Friday as fresh U S  economic data and higher than expected crude supplies pointed to weaker demand 
By early afternoon in Europe  benchmark U S  crude for March delivery was down 16 cents to  100 19 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange  On Thursday  the Nymex contract eased 2 cents to close at  100 35

By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69 5  more accurate than Wall Street  but increased accuracy is just icing on the cake  The real value of the Estimize data set comes from the fact that it better represents the market s expectations  In this case IBM beat the market s expectation for profit but missed by a wide margin on revenue 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 
After the market closed IBM beat Wall Street and Estimize on profit by announcing  6 13 EPS while Wall Street was expecting  6 01 and Estimize com forecast  6 03  IBM missed both revenue forecasts by a wide margin by reporting  27 699B revenue while the Street predicted  28 281B and the consensus from Estimize was  28 257B 
IBM is known for moving at its own pace and marching to the beat of its own drum  At the end of the quarter IBM announced its intention to sell off its low end server business and invest  1 2billion in 15 data centers across the globe to buff up its cloud computing capacities  In addition to the data centers investment IBM is also committing to opening up its Jeopardy champion super computer Watson to collaborate with private developers  New applications that take advantage of Watson s superior artificial intelligence and computing power could become a big source of profit in 2014 

While revenue this quarter was a big disappointment  year over year profit was actually up and IBM has repositioned itself for the near future  Super star investor Warren Buffett also seems to think that IBM is making the right moves  While the Oracle of Omaha generally avoids tech stocks  his firm  Berkshire Hathaway  has accumulated a 5 5  stake in the company  In November 2011 Buffett said   I don t know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM

Bank Of Japan Did Not Hint At Any Additional Easing
Japanese shares have ended the day slightly higher after the Bank of Japan did not hint at any additional easing  Japanese policy makers have pointed to accelerating inflation highlighting the progress made in its bid to stamp out 15 years of falling prices  Significantly  the dollar remains bullish trading at a 2 month high  This is owing to the fact that most economists expect the U S  Federal Reserve to further trim its bond buying next week 
Gold remains firmly under the spotlight after analysts at Morgan Stanley lowered bullion forecasts once again  The 2014 target has been cut 12 percent to  1 160 an ounce whilst forecasts for 2015 have been reduced 13 percent to  1 138  Analysts have cited gains in equity markets   thus reducing the need for haven assets   and increased regulation as main factors contributing to gold s weakness  The commodity fell 28 percent in 2013 signalling the end of a 12 year bull run as Federal Reserve policy makers decided to cut monthly bond purchases  the biggest fall since 1981

The major news in UK markets this morning was unemployment data being announced at 7 1   0 2  better than forecast and closing in on the forward guidance target of 7   leading investors to speculate that a hike in interest rates may be approaching  The decline in unemployment by 167 000 is the largest decline since 1997 and at 7 1  unemployment is at its lowest level since 2009  After opening up for the day  UK markets reacted negatively to the figure with speculators driving the market into decline for the day  Expect further volatility for the rest of the week as investors look to position themselves and adapt to the better than expected numbers

177194,398710,IBM,T2108  Finally Overbought ,opinion,"T2108 Status  71 0 VIX Status  12 8General  Short term  Trading Call  Short  bearish bias  Active T2108 periods  Day  138 over 20   Day  1 over 70   overbought 
Commentary T2108 avoided overbought status for 52 straight trading days until peeking over the requisite 70  threshold today 

The higher lows makes it look like T2108 has been pressured upward for many months


I thought hitting this point would bring resolution to an important juncture  but the tease just barely continues  The S P 500 barely advanced on the day and remains stuck right near the top of the  bear bull  zone that I defined earlier 

S P 500 continues to crawl along


The S P 500  SPY  enters this overbought period after printing a very high performance for the 70  underperiod  I would like to think this means performance from the overbought period has been  pulled forward   especially with earnings season in full throttle now  Instead  I think the better perspective recognizes that once if the S P 500 follows through in this overbought period  the index could take off for another legendary extended overbought rally  For now  I am maintaining the bearish bias UNTIL the follow through occurs  After that  I will follow the standard overbought strategy  bullish first  bearish with a return to the 70  underperiod and or bearish on appropriate technicals before overbought day  20 
I end with two earnings related chart reviews 
First up  Netflix  NFLX   The stock traded up an incredible 18  or 60 points in after hours after the company reported earnings  This puts the stock at a fresh all time high  While Carl Icahn will likely use this fresh gift to once again sell shares into the increased liquidity generated by post earnings reactions  I do NOT think it is as clear a shorting opportunity as the last post earnings response  Last time  NFLX soared almost 12  above its upper Bollinger Band  BB   That move is about as over extended as they come  This time  NFLX will be trading just above the upper BB  Do not be surprised to see additional momentum before the stock pulls back for a rest  With Icahn overhang out of the way  it is very possible upward momentum will continue 
I last charted NFLX two weeks ago when it broke below its 50DMA  The stock barely followed through on the selling  three times in the last five trading days  buyers rushed in and picked NFLX off the bottom  I guess I should have taken those moves as a bullish pre earnings sign  I will now be alert for applying this template in other pre earnings scenarios featuring a stock that should be selling off 

A pre earnings setup


Lastly  International Business Machines  IBM   IBM is turning into a good trading stock  Two months ago I wrote  Simple Reasons to Like IBM Despite the Headwinds  and have written   I had a modicum of success buying dips but over extended myself buying a call spread ahead of earnings  That over confidence has cost me a worthless position but a valuable  re lesson  There was no real dip to buy here  In fact  IBM had just failed at the 200DMA for the second time this month  triggering what should have been a bright red technical flag to short the stock  The post earnings trading reaction is indicative of a stock that still has dip buyers  The stock over extended a bit below the lower BB and bounced right into natural resistance support at the 50DMA  It is all about the follow through from here  I will not go long again until a strong close above the 50DMA  Otherwise  the recent W bottom is likely to get retested relatively quickly 

IBM fails the test

177205,398721,IBM,FOREX Yen extends broad slide  pound bounces,news,"  Yen falls to 3 week lows as long positions trimmed
   Pound yen at 3 week highs  Aussie yen at 1 year peak
   Aussie strong at 14 month highs on rate hike fever
   Euro hits fresh 14 mth high  kiwi touches new 15 mth high
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO  Oct 16  Reuters    The yen stayed under broad
pressure on Friday as investors cut some of their long
positions  while sterling approached its highest level
in three weeks following upbeat central bank comments 
 The yen struggled as short covering in the pound spilled
over to other cross yen pairs  easing to as far as 90 99 per
dollar from 90 60 late on Thursday in New York where it lost over
1 percent 
 The euro and high yielding currencies such as the Australian
and the New Zealand dollars hit new highs for the year against
the dollar after positive U S  data and encouraging corporate
earnings prompted investors to further build long positions 
dealers said 
 The Aussie was also underpinned by an Australian newspaper
report that central bank Governor Glenn Stevens agreed the
Australian economy s strength could drive the Aussie to  1 10 
  An increasingly positive mood on the global economy has been
supporting higher yielding currencies  While the yen is not one
of these currencies  it had been firming  and now we are seeing
some correction   said Ayako Sera  market strategist at Sumitomo
Trust   Banking 
 Traders said the yen s decline was triggered by the rebound
in the pound after Bank of England policymaker Paul Fisher said
he felt more confident the bank s quantitative easing programme
was working well  see  
 Gains in the pound against the yen lifted other yen crosses
and hedge funds continued buying them in early Asian trade 
boosting the Aussie and the kiwi further to one year highs
against the Japanese currency  dealers said 
  The yen does look a bit glum now  especially on the
crosses   Jonathan Cavenagh  currency strategist at Westpac 
  Offshore investments by Japanese investors are set to pick
up  now that the fiscal half year end is over and I suspect
that after some good earnings numbers from the U S   investors
would want to put some money in the U S  
 The euro rose as high as 136 03 yen  its highest since
August  before it trimmed gains to 135 49 yen  up 0 1 percent on
the day 
 Against the dollar  the euro rose as far as  1 4968 on
trading platform EBS  its highest since August last year 
  The Aussie broke past major resistance to trade at one year
highs of 84 20 yen 
 Sterling hit fresh three week highs of 148 74 yen in Asian
trade  after having jumped nearly 5 yen in
the previous session 
 Investors were also growing more confident about a recovery
in the U S   keeping the yen on the defensive against the U S 
dollar 
 The U S  third quarter earnings season has got off to a
strong start  with Intel  JPMorgan Chase 
Google Inc and IBM profits beating estimates 
 Investors were also heartened by signs of stabilisation in
the U S  labour market  The number of workers filing new claims
for jobless insurance unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest
since January 
 The better outlook is starting to feed into a view that
U S  rates could probably rise faster than those in Japan 
 On Thursday  former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker 
now an economic adviser to President Barack Obama  said it was
important to tighten monetary policy proactively  even if
unemployment was high  
 The dollar has fallen about 7 percent against a basket of
major currencies so far in 2009  on expectations that
U S  interest rates will remain low and on talk that it is
becoming the preferred funding currency  replacing the yen  for
leveraged carry trades 
 Top White House adviser Lawrence Summers said on Thursday
that the Obama administration believed a strong dollar was in
the best interest of the United States  
 Meanwhile  the Australian dollar traded at fresh
14 month highs at  0 9271  buoyed also by mounting speculation of
steep interest rate increases by the Reserve Bank of Australia
before the year end 
 The bank s governor said on Thursday holding rates at very
low levels was no longer needed and he would not be timid in
raising rates  He also signalled he was keeping a closer eye on
prices 
The New Zealand dollar also jumped to  0 7496  its highest in
15 months

177225,398741,IBM,2014  Leverage The Power Of Now In Investing,opinion,"Staying In The Now Is Key To Investing Eckhart Tolle s New York Times Best Seller  has sold over 2 million copies worldwide and has been translated into over 30 languages  From an investing perspective  we found the first half of the book to be worth the price of admission  you can draw your own conclusions about the second half of the text  The basic premise of the book is captured in the excerpt below     Nothing has happened in the past  it happened in the Now  Nothing will ever happen in the future  it will happen in the Now      The Twin Thieves  Regret and Fear Our entire investing lives have taken place in the Now  We have never executed a buy order in the past  nor have we ever executed one in the future  However  we have all wasted a considerable amount of mental energy regretting past investment missteps or worrying about what will happen next in the markets  Below are a few examples of self talk we can all relate to concerning investment decisions made in the past     The S P 500 just gained 100 points how could I have missed a move that big      I am an honest  hard working  and competent person  why do I continue to perform so poorly in the financial markets      I should have invested years ago  why did I wait      I have missed all the upside      Now  I will never be able to retire     The twin energy sapping brother to regret is fear about making investment mistakes in the future  Below are examples of self talk related to fear of future losses     It is too late  I can t invest now the market will peak soon      Stocks can t keep going up with the Fed cutting back on QE      The economy is getting weaker and stocks will drop      Profit margins will narrow  which will hurt stocks      A bear market will start the day after I get in      The economy is about to slip into a recession     Past Missteps Are Yesterday s News Anyone who has invested for any length of time has made mistakes  regardless of their lot in life  The financial markets are a competitive and often cruel place  which means there is no shame in having missteps on your investing resume  Mistakes can be labeled as valuable experience if we are willing to review them in the context of  how can I get better   However  dwelling on the past in a negative manner will do nothing but reduce your odds of getting back on track     Sometimes letting things go is an act of far greater power than defending or hanging on      Eckhart Tolle   No One Can Predict The Future   So Stop Wasting Time And Energy On It Having worked on Wall Street for 20 years  I can confidently state that no one can consistently predict the future actions of investors and consumers  Since economic and market outcomes are based on the future actions of millions of consumers and investors around the globe  logic tells us no one can consistently predict where the economy and markets are headed  Before some of you get all bent out of shape  the topic of probabilistic forecasting market profiles will be addressed later in this article  meaning there are logical ways to prepare for the future  As noted in   if the best football handicappers don t perform much better than a coin flipper when trying to predict what will happen when 22 players compete for just 60 minutes  how can we expect someone to accurately forecast the actions of millions of consumers and investors 12 months in advance    How Can The Now Help Us With Investing  Would you rather invest based on a forecast with 50 50  odds or would you prefer to invest your hard earned money based on information known with almost 100  certainty  The future is very uncertain  but we can understand the current profile of the financial markets and economy with nearly 100  certainty  Rather than worrying about what may or may not happen next  investors should focus on the Now   If we allocate our investment accounts based on today s known information and then adjust as the inputs change  our odds of success will improve significantly     If you take emotion   would be  could be  should be   out of it  and look at what is  and quantify it  I think you have a big advantage over most human beings     John Henry of John W  Henry   Company  Inc     Is Fear Of A 2014 Recession Holding You Back  Concerns about future economic weakness are on the fear inducing and performance robbing list for investors  Since recessions are declared after they have been in place for some time and the track record of forecasting them is unimpressive to a  not useful  point  it is logical to think in term of probabilities  One of the  was does economic data support an imminent recession  If the answer is no  then worrying about it is not productive from an investment perspective  As covered in detail on   the bond market  based on information in the Now  is not pointing to a recession  If you prefer stats over charts  the following excerpt from  fits the bill    This week the Philly Fed just released its State Leading Index for November which showed that 49 out of the 50 states are expected to see their coincident indexes grow over the next six months  With 98  of states expected to show growth over the next six months  the risk of a coming recession remains remote  Just look at the sea of green on the Philly Fed s State Leading Index map below  where only Alaska is expected to show contracting economic activity over the next six months  Of note  back in December of 2007 when the U S  economy first slipped into a recession only 32 states were expected to show economic growth in the first half of 2008  as more than one third of the country was already in a recession  Clearly the present backdrop is bullish and does not offer any impending doom to the current economic expansion    More Hard 2014 Evidence To Combat Economic Fear Economic data  such as GDP and employment  are examples of observable evidence that can be obtained in the Now  Thursday brought some additional news that aligns with the  risk on  look of the charts noted earlier this week  From     The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week fell and planned layoffs hit a 13 1 2 year low in December  adding to a range of data that have suggested the economy is gaining steam   The labor market seems to have picked up some steam towards the end of the year   said Guy Berger  an economist at RBS in Stamford  Connecticut  Separately  consulting firm Challenger  Gray   Christmas said planned layoffs at U S  firms plunged by 32 percent in December to the lowest level since June 2000    Decisions Made Today Can Eliminate Regret Tomorrow We cannot go back in time  nor can we change the decisions we made in the past  Therefore  if things have not gone well for you recently  you have to shift your focus to  what can I do right now to avoid feeling this way in the future   A good first step is to focus more of your brain power on the Now  and less on regret and fear  A logical next step is to determine how you plan to focus on the present    Was The Economy The Same In 2007 and 2009  One method to stay in the investing Now involves monitoring and adjusting  Do you believe there were discernible differences between the market s technical profile when stocks peaked in October 2007 and when they bottomed in March 2009  Do you believe the known economic data was discernibly different before and after the financial crisis  October 2007 vs  March 2009   If the answers are yes  then it is logical to assume there were discernible incremental changes in the hard evidence between October 2007 and March 2009  Our allocates between growth oriented investments  such as stocks  and defensive assets  such as bonds  based on the Now  current market profile   The model makes incremental adjustments as needed based on observable changes in the profile of the economy and financial markets  No forecasting is needed  The two video segments below provide examples of the concepts 
Navigating 
Monitor   Adjust  
Investing In The Now   How Do I Make It Happen  A structured system or model is one excellent way to stay in the Now  You should build a model or find a model that passes the  that makes sense to me  test  Any model should be thoroughly backtested  Strict rules are also necessary since a model is useless if you do not follow it 100  of the time  no exceptions   The beauty of the financial markets is there are countless ways to skin the risk management cat  The articles below cover the concepts of paying attention and adjusting as the evidence changes 
IF  THEN
The Market What You Think
The concept of paying attention is based on probabilistic outcomes  or if you prefer probabilistic forecasting  The difference is we base our allocations on known information  markets and hard data  rather than where we believe the data or markets will be in the future  When the  knowns  change  we adjust our allocations as needed  1982  Would You Have Predicted An 18 Year Rise In Stocks  Human bias about the markets is a form of forecasting  If your self talk is something along these lines   Stocks cannot go up given all the problems in the world today   then ask yourself how many people felt the same way in 1982  The events below took place in 1982  or in the first year of an 18 year bull market in stocks

177227,398743,IBM,The Week Ahead  Can Earnings Growth Propel Stocks Higher ,opinion,"If you could know one thing about stocks in the coming year  it would be what to expect from corporate earnings  The Q4 2013 reports will provide a preview  with attention starting this week 
Has the improvement in economic strength translated into higher corporate profits 
Last Week Recap 
Last week I suggested that with the return of the A Teams from vacation  we would learn more about how the market would react to news  Would  good news  finally be treated as good  With Fed policy better defined  there was no longer a reason to translate each event into a possible motivation for a change from the Fed    This proved to be a major news theme during the week  although the old  Fed habit  dies hard  In general  positive economic news led to a positive reaction  The Friday jobs report was treated as negative for stocks  Dow futures were up 70 or so before the report  and positive for bonds  For the moment  this seems to be the new market mind set 
This Week s Theme
The focus on earnings is a clear choice for this week s theme  and it will probably persist for another week or two  There is plenty of disagreement about the role of earnings in the 2013 market rally  Can earnings improve enough to power stocks higher in 2014    There have been two schools of thought 
Corporate profit estimates are too high   based upon peak profit margins  optimistic forecasts  and low interest rates  As these underlying factors revert to the mean  actual earnings will decline 
Various factors sustain current profit margins  including foreign sales and low labor costs  Margins will decline gradually  accompanied by an increase in economic activity and revenues  This means that gross profits and overall earnings may not suffer 
I have my own guess  while I will offer in the conclusion  First  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the background  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasions something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially    no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good  
Most of the important recent news was good 
Democrats willing to compromise on emergency unemployment benefits  As usual  the most market friendly result recognizes the current economic weakness  but moves toward an end to extraordinary policy     
Stanley Fischer was officially nominated to be Fed Vice Chair  He has  and is expected to help in unwinding QE  improving understanding of foreign markets  and increasing credibility  Most see it as   New Chair  the appointment   Reader quiz  Can you imagine even a committed Fed basher not liking this appointment  suggesting that Fischer is actually too good  and would represent competition for Yellen  Answer in the conclusion  
Initial jobless claims moved lower to 330K  beating expectations  Job losses are only half of the story  since we also need job creation  but initial claims are a weekly market focus   of adding value  adjusting the claims for the changing size of the labor force  The result is a chart that you will not see anywhere else  Could there now be a trough in the claims improvement 

Congress compromises on budget extension  This will avoid an imminent shutdown debate  While there is still plenty of partisan controversy  the room for compromise has clearly improved     
Major improvement in trade data implies much stronger Q4 GDP       sees a more mixed picture 
ADP private jobs growth was strong  Many evaluate this report as a prediction of the  official  BLS announcement  This is a mistake  It is a different and independent method and a helpful yardstick for evaluating employment changes  While the market emphasizes the monthly government report  most investors should be more interested in actual economic progress   whatever the measure  I explained in more detail

The Bad
Some of the bad news was really  really bad 
Record cold weather could mean as much as a  on the economy  Some of this might represent delayed expenditures  but some is lost forever   trips  shopping  and restaurant meals that will not happen 
ISM services disappointed on the headline number  The internals were also weak  See  for full analysis and charts 
The employment report  showing a net growth in payrolls of only 74K and yet another decline in the labor force participation rate  Nearly everyone realizes that the decline in the popular headline  the unemployment rate  is misleading  There were many good reviews  as well as some bad ones   I ll cite several of the best 
Do not be deceived by the lower unemployment rate     
The weak report will not alter Fed plans  according to economists in a  
Weather creates even more noise in a data series that is already noisy     
Don t blame the weather for the decline in labor force participation  If there had been no decline in the labor force over the last year  unemployment would be at 7 9      
And best of all  don t take it too seriously  The BLS tries each month to count all of the jobs in a 150 million person workforce  The market incorrectly places substantial weight on modest changes projected by this method  It is much better to look at longer trends   See the  from Barry Ritholtz

The Ugly
Income inequality  Even the dollar stores are getting too expensive for many  So says Family Dollar Stores Inc   FDO  CEO Howard Levine  See the full story  

For the last several quarters  we ve discussed the economic challenges our customers are facing  Over the last two years  I think we ve seen a growing bifurcation in households  Higher income households who have benefited from market gains  better employment opportunities  or improvements in the housing markets have become more comfortable and confident in their financial situation  But our core lower income customers have faced high unemployment levels  higher payroll taxes  and more recently reductions in government assistance programs

177228,398744,IBM,Stocks For 2014  Growth And Income For Total Return  Part 3,opinion,"Introduction
When investing in common stocks  there is no one strategy that fits all investors   Some investors are focused on investing for income  some for capital appreciation and others for various combinations of both   Additionally  there is the issue of risk tolerance   Some investors are willing and capable of assuming greater risk if they believe it will lead to greater returns  while others are more risk adverse   These are just but a few of the many variations that apply to the individual investor s own unique goals and characteristics 
Therefore  I have initiated this series of articles with the hopes of providing fairly valued stock research candidates that potentially offer something for everyone   In  I introduced the series and provided a few examples of each specific equity class that I would cover in the series   In  I covered high growth stocks  which I consider the most aggressive  but perhaps potentially the most profitable equity class   In this part 3  I offer a review of what appear to be fairly valued growth and income stocks  Consequently  this category contains selections that may be appropriate for investors in the accumulation phase of building their retirement portfolios 
Similar to high growth stocks  but ideally in a more conservative fashion  the primary focus of my growth and income selections is total return   Therefore  I offer this group of research candidates to those investors desirous of building and accumulating long term wealth  through investing in high quality blue chip dividend paying stocks for the purpose of generating an above average rate of total return through the combination of capital appreciation  dividend income  and in many cases a growing dividend income stream 
Therefore  each candidate that will be found in this article will pay a dividend   However  the current yields available may not meet the needs or objectives of those retired investors currently seeking income   On the other hand  this article will be reviewing candidates that I believe provide the opportunity for generating double digit future long term total returns   Moreover  many of these selections are poised with the potential to deliver long term total returns that are the equivalent  or close to it  of many of the high growth candidates covered in part 2 
Total Return  The Capital Appreciation Component   The Income Component
Very simply stated  for common stocks the total return is comprised of the two primary components of return  the capital appreciation  growth  component and the income  dividends  component   When investing in pure growth stocks  stocks that pay no dividends   total return is comprised only of capital appreciation   However  with dividend paying stocks the investor still receives the capital appreciation component but also receives additional return from the income component   These two returns together make up the total return received on a dividend paying growth stock 
Although this is a very straightforward calculation  it is not void of controversy or debate   There are those that would argue that dividend income does not provide additional return  For example  these individuals argue that since the company s stock price is reduced on the ex dividend date by the precise amount of the dividend  the dividend itself provides no additional return   Although this is technically correct  I would argue that it s much ado about nothing   I am not alone on this position   In his excellent and newly released book titled Top 40 Dividend Growth Stocks For 2014  author David Van Knapp has this to say on the subject   First  on pages 23 and 24  David explains the ex dividend date as follows 
 Ex dividend date   Without dividend date   The first day that a newly purchased share of stock comes without the right to receive the next dividend  If you purchase a stock on or after the ex dividend date  you will not receive the next dividend  In order to be entitled to the next dividend  you must buy prior to the ex dividend date 
From the seller s point of view  the ex dividend date is the first day on which you can sell the shares and nevertheless be entitled to receive the next dividend  The ex dividend date precedes the payment date by a few days or weeks 
Before the market opens on the ex dividend date  stock exchanges usually adjust the previous day s closing price downward by the amount of the dividend  This price adjustment reflects the fact that the cash to pay the next dividend will not be retained by the company  as it is earmarked to pay the dividend  For most stocks  that adjustment in price soon gets lost in the noise of the next day s trading  
Then  later on pages 57 and 58  Dave goes on to further explain why he does not consider this temporary dividend reduction a big issue 
 10  Stock prices drop by the amount of the dividend
This is not really a disadvantage either  although some people view it as one 
Stock exchanges follow a long standing practice  When a company declares a dividend  it sets the record date  Under exchange rules  the ex dividend date is thereby established a few days prior to the record date  That ex date becomes the first day on which new buyers of the stock will not receive the upcoming dividend 
Before the opening of trading on the ex dividend date  the exchange reduces the quoted price of the stock by the exact amount of the declared dividend 
The idea is that this money will not be received by new buyers  so they should pay that much less for the stock 
Because of this price adjustment  shareholders who owned the stock before the ex dividend date  and who hold on straight through  see the price of their stock momentarily lowered by the amount of the dividend  In practice  as soon as trading opens on the ex dividend date  market participants establish the actual price of the stock  The exchange s price adjustment is usually hard to detect after an hour or two of trading  There certainly is no long term impairment to the price of the stock  
Moreover  I wrote extensively on the subject in a previous article    However  since this article is focused on total return I thought it would be useful to elaborate on how total return is comprised  calculated and produced   Since a picture is worth 1000 words  I will utilize the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool to illustrate how total return on a common stock is accomplished   I will use a few quintessential examples of companies that are included on my list of fairly valued growth and income candidates that will be produced later in the article 
Stanley Black   Decker Inc   SWK 
Stanley Black   Decker  Inc  provides power and hand tools  mechanical access solutions  and electronic security and monitoring systems and products and services for various industrial applications 
The following 15 calendar year graph on Stanley Black   Decker plots its monthly closing stock price  the black line  and earnings  the orange line   Notice how the stock price tracks and closely correlates to earnings  Additionally  notice what happens when the price line disconnects from earnings and moves either above the orange line or below it  Inevitably  it moves back into alignment  This relationship of price to earnings is what establishes the capital appreciation component of total return 
In sophisticated terms  this represents how the market sets the company s stock price by capitalizing earnings  By capitalizing earnings  I am referring to how the market applies a P E ratio to the company s earnings per share which in turn creates the stock price quote  When the market applies this capitalization of earnings rationally  long term capital appreciation is both functionally related to and in close approximation to the company s earnings per share growth rate  Therefore  when fair valuation is in alignment  the capital appreciation component and the company s earnings growth rate will be equal or very similar 

Importantly  this capitalization of earnings is similarly applied based on a company s earnings growth rate regardless of whether it pays a dividend or not  Note  the above graphic does not include dividends   However  because of the minute to minute fluctuations in stock price  the earnings growth rate and the capital appreciation component will be in close approximation to each other  In other words  in the long run earnings determine market price  We can clearly see this relationship when reviewing the performance results associated with the above 15 calendar year earnings and price only graph on Stanley Black   Decker that follows 

On this next graph  I add the dividend component in order to vividly illustrate the second component of total return   dividends   F A S T  Graphs  expresses dividends in two important ways   First of all  they are expressed by the pink line on the graph   This expression shows the portion of earnings prior to being paid out as dividends  which simultaneously provide two important perspectives 
The first perspective that the viewer receives when dividends are shown in this manner  the pink line  is how consistently dividends have grown  and a visualization of the growth rate   The second perspective is the instantaneous graphical expression of the company s payout ratio   The portion of earnings  the green shaded area  below the pink line  graphically reveal the company s payout ratio   Therefore  without looking at the payout ratio column on the performance report  the viewer can instantaneously see that this company is paying approximately one third of their total earnings out as dividends 
The second expression of dividends on the graph is the light blue shaded area above the orange earnings justified valuation line   When expressed this way  the viewer receives a clear perspective of how dividends represent a return in addition to the capital appreciation component   The black price line tracks earnings creating capital appreciation as previously discussed  and the dividend income is vividly revealed as the additional and second component of total return 
Here  one note of clarification is in order   If the dividend was only expressed by the light blue shaded area  the viewer might get the illusion that the dividend on Stanley Black   Decker went lower during the Great Recession   This is only an illusion because when the dividends are expressed this way  they track the earnings line   Stanley Black   Decker s earnings did fall during calendar years 2008 and 2009  however  the company s dividend increased each of those years as seen by reviewing the pink line and the dividend column under the graph 

This point is further validated by reviewing the performance table associated with the earnings and price correlated graph   The annualized rate of return without dividends is as previously reported 7 3    However  add in the dividend income that shareholders received over this timeframe and we see that the annualized total return increases to 8 8    Therefore  a quick review of the complete performance report clearly illustrates the two separate components of total return growth and income 

The validity of dividend income as a total return component is more greatly reinforced when performance is calculated with dividends reinvested   The following performance calculation with dividends reinvested illustrates that Stanley Black   Decker s total return exceeds double digits at 10 2  per annum   Consequently  an earnings growth rate of 8  per annum expands to a double digit return when dividends are reinvested and included in the calculation 

Silgan Holdings Inc    SLGN 
With my second example Silgan Holdings Inc  I show a company with a lower dividend yield but a higher earnings growth rate than we saw with Stanley Black   Decker   Once again  my first graph shows earnings and stock price only  with dividends excluded    The earnings and price relationship and correlation holds true   As we saw in the first example  stock price tracks earnings  and when it occasionally deviates away from the orange earnings justified valuation line  it soon moves back into alignment   As we saw with our first example  earnings drive stock price over the long run 

However  when dividends are added on to the graph  the pink line and the light blue shaded area  the relevant contribution of dividends to total return is once again revealed   Yet again  we see clear evidence of the principle that capital appreciation and dividend income are the two components of total return   Therefore  the principle remains intact  however  there are two important differences with this example 
The first difference is the rate of earnings growth is much faster at almost 14  per annum   The second difference is that the dividend yield is approximately half of what we saw in our first example   The importance of these differences will become clear when we review the performance report without dividends included 

When dividends are added to the equation  we get the visual perspective of the two components of total return capital appreciation   dividend income 

The capital appreciation component of Silgan Holdings is highly correlated to the company s faster rate of earnings growth   On the other hand  even though the dividend yield is lower than we saw with our first example  the growth rate of this company s dividends is much higher as a result of the faster earnings growth rate   Consequently  total dividends paid are lower  yet growing faster  but the total return is much higher  again as a result of faster earnings growth   Nevertheless  the contribution from dividend income is still clearly evident 

Moreover  for those investors attempting to build future wealth as quickly as possible  but perhaps with less risk than is found in a pure growth stock  the benefit of investing in a moderately low yielding dividend growth stock cannot be denied   This is especially compelling when dividends are reinvested as seen in the following 11 calendar year performance report for Silgan Holdings  

33 Fairly Valued Dividend Growth Stocks by Sector
Over the course of conducting my research looking for fairly valued dividend growth stocks with an objective of total return  I uncovered 33 potential candidates   Since diversification within a common stock portfolio is of such great importance  I organized the candidates by sector   Consequently  the 33 candidates I felt comfortable offering as research candidates are spread out over 8 different sectors   Therefore  I believe that an investor seeking an above average total return would be offered an adequate number of possibilities from which to construct a diversified portfolio of dividend growth stocks 
Moreover  since my objective was for total return  I have highlighted the five year estimated annual total return column on each sector grouping for perspective   Therefore  assuming that the consensus analyst estimates are within reasonable parameters of accuracy  each of these candidates would have the potential of generating double digit long term rates of return   I will include one historical earnings and price correlated graphical example for each sector  My purpose in doing so is to illustrate that each of these candidates represent reasonably valued dividend growth stocks in spite of the market s strong run up over the past several years

Sector 45   Information Technology   5

International Business Machines Corp  IBM 
International Business Machines Corporation  an information technology company  provides various services  software  and integrated solutions   I am going to add additional information on this example because I believe it represents a classic case of price bias   Notice that I have circled the recent price performance of IBM on the Earnings and Price Correlated Graph below   It has been my observation that when the price of a stock drops it stimulates a lot of negative sentiment about the company   However  as we can see from reviewing IBM s earnings  the orange line on the graph below  that only stock price has fallen even though earnings continue to advance 

I have read numerous articles over the past year focusing on IBM s negative cash flow growth   However  I believe that many investors are overstating the negativity regarding IBM s cash flows   The following FUN Graph  Fundamental Underlying Numbers  plots IBM s cash flow per share  cflps   free cash flow per share  fcflps   and operating cash flow per share  ocflps   
The only negative regarding IBM s cash flows that I can see relate to free cash flow per share   However  free cash flow per share as calculated by FUN Graphs is after dividends have been paid   Therefore  although free cash flow has been flat over that last three years  the graph illustrates that IBM has ample free cash flow left over even after dividends 

When reviewing IBM s gross profit margin  gpm  and net profit margin  npm  we discover that both have been increasing albeit only moderately   Consequently  there is little evidence that IBM s business is deteriorating based on margins 

A final factor supporting future earnings growth is IBM s rather substantial share buy backs over the past 9 years   What s most important about this share buy back initiative by IBM is that the company s stock price has generally been fairly valued or undervalued over this timeframe   In other words  I am suggesting that IBM s purchasing of those shares since 2006 has been an effective use of capital because their shares were attractively priced  see the Earnings and Price Correlated Graph above        

Summary and Conclusions
The primary focus of this article was to identify dividend paying stocks forecast to grow at above average long term rates in order to achieve an above average long term total return   Although each of these candidates pay a dividend and several have long streaks of increasing their dividend  each was selected primarily based on their forecast earnings growth rates   Simply stated  it is my contention based on years  of experience that above average earnings growth represents the primary source of above average long term total return

177229,398745,IBM,FOREX Dollar back on defensive  Aussie hits 14 mth high,news,"  NZD lifted by better than expected retail sales
   Investors continue shift to high yielders  commodities
   Focus on 3rd quarter U S  earnings
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO  Oct 13  Reuters    The dollar drifted against a basket
of currencies on Tuesday but stayed soft against the Australian
dollar  which earlier hit a 14 month high boosted by optimism
that robust U S  corporate earnings would sustain investors  risk
appetite 
 The New Zealand dollar also shone  hovering not far from a
14 month high  after retail sales figures for August beat
expectations and fuelled talk the central bank might soon drop
its explicit easing bias 
 Although overall activity was subdued in Asia  growth linked
and higher yielding currencies such as the Aussie and the kiwi
were supported ahead of more U S  earnings this week 
  It seems the dollar is getting some respite from its fall
against the yen but higher yielding currencies remain strong and
the general tone of the market still points towards dollar
weakness   said Kazuyuki Kato  treasury department manager at
Mizuho Trust   Banking 
  Investors are still shifting funds into higher yielding
currencies and commodities   he said 
 The dollar edged up 0 1 percent to 89 90 yen from late U S 
trading on Monday  when the U S  currency rose as high as 90 47
yen with stops being triggered around 90 30 yen and sellers
lining up around 90 50 
 The dollar index was steady at 76 170  not far from a
14 month low of 75 767 struck last week 
 The greenback received a brief reprieve late last week and
early on Monday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said
late on Thursday the U S  central bank stood ready to tighten
monetary policy once economic recovery took hold  prompting
speculators to cover dollar shorts 
 But investors are now focused again on U S  corporate
earnings  which if they beat expectations could boost the
appetite for high yielding currencies  analysts say 
 Some investors sell the U S  dollar when economic optimism
grows  buying assets such as stocks and commodities instead 
 The Australian dollar was steady at  0 9077 after rising as
high as  0 9096  its highest since August 2008 
 The New Zealand dollar edged down to  0 7372 after rising
near a 14 month peak of  0 7457 struck last week 
  Contrary to its promise to keep the cash rate at its current
level until late 2010  we suspect the  New Zealand  central bank
will  albeit reluctantly  begin a tightening cycle by the second
quarter of next year   said Su lin Ong  a senior economist at RBC
Capital 
 The euro was little changed at  1 4780 with resistance seen
around  1 4815  Traders awaited Germany s ZEW economic sentiment

 LONDON  Oct 13  Reuters    The dollar fell against a basket
of currencies to within sight of recent lows on Tuesday as gold
hit a new high and commodity prices strengthened  lifting the
euro above  1 48 
 The euro had given back gains earlier in the session
following a surprise fall in German investor morale but the dip
provided a good buying opportunity for a market that remains
broadly bearish on the dollar 
 Gold rose above  1 065 an ounce and oil rose one percent
above  74 a barrel  The dollar and commodities are often
inversely correlated  with gold and oil priced in dollars and
seen as an alternative currency and hard asset themselves 
 The euro rose to within sight of last month s one year high
of  1 4842  as options dealers tested reported large barriers
and expiries at  1 4850 
  The euro took a tumble on the back of a much weaker than
expected German ZEW survey  though buyers quickly emerged
lifting the euro back  above  the  1 4800 level   said Jane
Foley  research director at Forex com in London 
  Gold is essentially the antithesis of the dollar   said
Neil Mellor  strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London 
 At 1030 GMT the euro was up 0 4 percent on the day at
 1 4830  with one Asian central bank in particular said to be a
notable buyer on the break above  1 48 
 The dollar index  a measure of the greenback s value against
six currencies  was down a quarter of a percent on the day at
75 95  within sight of its 14 month low of 75 767 struck last
week 
 The dollar was down a third of a percent against the yen at
89 60 yen  having earlier traded above 90 yuen 
 
 FED TALK JUST TALK 
 The euro had earlier hit a six and a half month high against
sterling of 94 10 pence after the release of unexpectedly soft
UK inflation data  before easing back on the fall in Germany s
ZEW index 
 But the ZEW inspired euro weakness was brief  and the euro
was last trading at 93 95 pence  up 0 5 percent on the day 
 The U S  dollar hit 14 month lows against the Canadian and
Australian dollars  with both these so called commodity
currencies supported by gold and oil 
 Ahead of U S  corporate earnings figures and speeches from
Federal Reserve officials later in the day  currency investors
continued to weigh up the expected timing  pace and extent of
when the U S  central bank will tighten policy 
 Expectations of continued earnings improvements were seen
keeping investor focus on so called riskier assets to the
detriment of the yen and a more pronounced dollar recovery 
  Risk perception remains an important topic in the absence
of a cyclical trend out of the United States  But I wouldn t
expect any serious impact on the risk perception picture when
liquidity remains very ample  so in this environment commodity
currencies should continue to outperform   said Michael
Klawitter  currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt  
 Although U S  central bank officials continue to warn of
eventual policy tightening  this was only to put a lid on
inflation expectations  
  They have to express a certain degree of hawkishness  But
between that and actual action  there is a fairly large gap 
Consequently  the dollar isn t getting any real meaningful
support   Klawitter said

 NEW YORK  Oct 13  Reuters    The U S  dollar hit a 14 month
low on Tuesday as investors refocused on the outlook for U S 
interest rates and whether the U S  government really wants a
strong currency 
 Higher rates make U S  assets more attractive and bolster
demand for the dollars to buy them 
 Expectations of a strengthening global recovery outside the
U S  added to rising demand for growth  and commodity linked
currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars at the
expense of demand for the greenback 
  The dollar is under pressure because interest rates here
are the lowest in the western world and will remain low for the
foreseeable future   said John McCarthy  director of foreign
exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York 
   The U S  Federal Reserve will release minutes of their
September policy meeting on Wednesday and investors will
closely scrutinize the text for any clues as to when the
central bank will tighten the benchmark interest rate and
reduce stimulus 
 But for now  with rates close to zero  investors are
focused on the fact that while the U S  government pays lip
service to a strong dollar policy  there is little action
beyond words 
  The  U S   administration is quiet and says nothing about
it  so people feel they don t desire to make any type of
external stand on the dollar   McCarthy said 
 The dollar index  a measure of the greenback s value
against six currencies  was down 0 3 percent at 75 907 after
hitting 75 738  its lowest since early August last year 
 The euro rose to its highest against the dollar since late
August  2008 as dollar selling gained momentum  helping push it
past option expiries at  1 4850  It last traded at  1 4836 
 While the dollar gained  particularly against the yen 
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said last Thursday
the U S  central bank stood ready to tighten monetary policy
once economic recovery took hold  investors now consider that
the time frame for action may be open ended 
 The U S  currency was last down 0 2 percent at 89 69 yen 
having earlier traded above 90 yen 
 Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn and New York Fed president
William Dudley are set to speak later in the day but investors
are not betting there will be any new statement on the economy
or interest rates 
 NO SAFE HAVEN
 Expectations for economic growth elsewhere in the world
have also reduced demand for the dollar as a safe haven
currency with record gold and higher oil prices one indication
of higher risk tolerance 
 The dollar and commodities are often inversely correlated 
with gold and oil priced in dollars and seen as an alternative
currency and hard asset themselves 
 The euro rose to a six and a half month high against
sterling after the release of unexpectedly soft UK inflation
data  even as sterling managed a 0 2 percent rise against the
dollar to  1 5833 
 Expectations of continued earnings improvements were seen
keeping investor focus on so called riskier assets to the
detriment of the yen and the dollar 
  Risk perception remains an important topic in the absence

 NEW YORK  Oct 13  Reuters    The dollar fell to a 14 month
low on Tuesday  with investors betting the United States is
likely to bring up the rear in a global economic recovery led
by Asia and commodity producing countries 
 The euro rose to near  1 49  its highest level since August
2008  before the demise of Lehman Brothers pushed the world
economy to the edge of collapse and sparked a frenzy of dollar
buying by investors eager to dump riskier currencies 
 Hopes for a stronger recovery outside the United States
lifted oil to a seven week high  and pushed gold to a
fresh record peak  while demand for commodity linked currencies
such as the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real remained high 
 Investors fear a weak U S  labor market and a protracted
recovery will keep interest rates near zero well into 2010 
 That makes holding low yield dollars unattractive  and any
appeal the greenback has would be dulled further if other major
central banks start lifting interest rates as growth picks up 
 Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn bolstered that
view on Tuesday  saying a tepid U S  recovery meant rising
inflation is not an imminent threat   ID nWEQ001466 
  People are optimistic about global growth in the fourth
quarter and beyond  so money is coming out of the U S  and the
dollar has gone south against most majors  especially commodity
currencies   said Hidetoshi Yanagihara  senior currency trader
at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York   That should continue for
awhile  especially if the Fed keeps rates where they are  
 The euro was last up 0 3 percent to  1 4815  after
earlier hitting  1 4876  its highest since late August  2008 
Sterling rose 0 6 percent to  1 5885  while the dollar
edged up 0 1 percent to 89 90 yen  
 The dollar hit a 14 month low against its Canadian
counterpart at C 1 0268  before recovering to C 1 0355 
steady with Monday s closing level 
 An index that measures the dollar against a basket of six
major currencies earlier touched its lowest level in 14 months
and was last down 0 2 percent at 75 980  
 Big corporate names due to post earnings this week include
JP Morgan Chase   Co  on Wednesday  and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc  and International Business Machines Corp
 on Thursday   SP500 WK   RESF US  
 Strong results could further whet investors  risk appetite 
adding to dollar weakness 
 The Fed will release minutes from its September policy
meeting on Wednesday  and investors will scrutinize the text
for clues on when the central bank will tighten the benchmark
interest rate or start winding down a stimulus program that s
pumped trillions into the economy 
 Many investors  though  expect the U S  government to do
little to support the dollar other than issue from time to time
its oft repeated  strong dollar  mantra  as a softer currency
should aid the weak economy and boost export revenues 
  The  U S   administration is quiet and says nothing about
it  so people feel they don t desire to make any type of
external stand on the dollar   said John McCarthy  director of
foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York

177241,398757,IBM,Hewlett Packard Beats On Q4 Earnings,opinion,"Shares of Hewlett Packard Company  HPQ  or H P went up 5 4  in after hours trading post better than expected fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 results 
H P s fourth quarter non GAAP earnings of  1 01 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Although the company s earnings improved 17 4  on a sequential basis  they were down 12 9  on a year over year basis 
Revenues
H P s revenues of  29 1 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  28 1 billion despite 2 8  decline from the year ago quarter  On a sequential basis  revenues improved 7  
Segmental Revenues
Personal Systems revenues declined 1 7  year over year to  8 58 billion  primarily due to 10  revenue decline in the consumer segment which more than offset the 4  increase in revenues from the commercial segment 
The growth in the commercial revenues was driven by robust performance of its Ultrabook HP EliteBook Folio  Total units sold were up 2 0  compared to the year ago quarter  While Desktop units declined 5 0   Notebook units were up 3 0  
Printing revenues were down marginally  down 0 6   year over year to  6 04 billion  Despite the revenue declines  total hardware units increased 6 0  year over year due to increase in laser volume and SMB home business 
The segment s commercial hardware revenues grew 3 0  from the year ago quarter buoyed by its transactional laser  management services and graphics business  Consumer hardware revenues increased 7  during the period due to traction in its Officejet Pro X  However  these increases were more than offset by a 4  decline in Supplies revenues 
Revenues from the Enterprise Group were up 1 8  from the year ago quarter to  7 59 billion as H P s Industry Standard Servers  networking and storage performed better 
Apart from this  revenues from the Industry Standard Servers increased 10 0   while Business Critical Systems revenues slumped 17 0  from the year ago quarter due to declines in the UNIX market 
Moreover  Storage revenues increased 1 0  from the year ago quarter due to robust growth in converged storage space  Technology Services revenues were down 6  on a year over year basis 
Although Enterprise Services revenues were down 9 4  year over year to  5 76 billion  bookings during the quarter increased 30  from the year ago quarter  primarily driven by growth in renewals 
Revenues were impacted by a 10 0  decline in Application and Business Services revenues and 9  decline in IT Outsourcing revenues 
Software revenues also declined 9 1  year over year to  1 06 million primarily due to tough year over year comparisons due to the General Motors  GM  contract signed in the year ago quarter 
Support revenues were up 4 0   while license revenues were down 24   Professional services revenues were down 13  year over year but SaaS revenues were up 15 0   SaaS revenues increased higher bookings from its business units  mainly in Autonomy  IT Management and Fortify on Demand 
HP Financial Services revenues declined 5 6  year over year to  912 0 million primarily due to volume declines  Financing volume declined 3  year over year and had net portfolio assets of  12 2 billion 
Operating Results
H P s gross margins were down 121 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 23 0  primarily due to lower revenue base  Moreover  unfavorable product mix and pricing pressures impacted margins 
Although H P s operating expenses were down 1 4  from the year ago quarter to  4 1 billion  as a percentage of revenues  expenses were up 20 bps  This impacted operating margins  which contracted 142 bps to 9  on a year over year basis  H P s non GAAP net margins were also down 89 bps on a year over year basis 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow 
The company ended the quarter with  12 2 billion in cash and cash equivalents versus  13 3 billion in the previous quarter  The company had a long term debt balance of  16 6 billion  down from  17 1 billion in the previous quarter 
H P generated  2 82 billion in cash from operations versus  2 67 billion in the previous quarter  During the quarter  H P repurchased stocks worth  479 million and paid dividends of  284 million 
Guidance
H P expects its non GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2014 to range between 82 cents and 86 cents per share and that for fiscal 2014 to be within  3 55 to  3 75 
H P expects revenues from Personal Systems to decline further due to higher commodity costs  The company also forecasts revenues from Enterprise Group to decline sequentially but expects to gain traction in converged storage and networking and converged infrastructure 
Moreover  revenue run off from fiscal 2013 is expected to impact Enterprise Services segment revenues  The company s shift toward the SaaS is expected to continue in this quarter as well 
Summary
Although H P reported better than expected top and bottom line results  the year over year comparisons were dismal  Pricing pressures also impacted margins  Moreover  the company did not provide an encouraging guidance 
Nonetheless  the company s tractions in the cloud  security and big data segments are the positives  going forward  Restructuring initiatives and management changes are also expected to keep the company in the growth path  The company s shift to core software business will also help it to achieve long term profitability 
However  continuing macroeconomic challenges  tepid IT spending and competition from International Business Machines  IBM  and Oracle  ORCL  are the headwinds  going forward

177245,398761,IBM,Academics Rule The World,opinion,With the Federal Reserve prominently in the news again this week  having finally begun to reduce the amount of monthly stimulus  a few thoughts continue to nag at me  I offer the following for your consideration Having lectured over the decades at several nationally reputed colleges and universities  I have a very special place in my heart for men and women who dedicate themselves to educating subsequent generations  Most are very intelligent and extremely well informed in the areas of their specialty  A great many for profit and not for profit organizations call upon such academicians for counsel as consultants and  in some instances  as board members  Imagine  however  a good sized corporation having a board of directors composed almost entirely of academics with virtually no direct business experience  That doesn t happen  Imagine further that it were a giant corporation like GE  Microsoft  Wal Mart or IBM  Inconceivable  How about an entity many times bigger than any of those that has a direct effect on virtually the entire world economy  That entity is the Federal Reserve While I have spent no time studying the curricula vitae of the Fed s current board of governors  I have heard references to business experience only about Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher  who had prior hedge fund involvement  Several members have served in regulatory roles  but that s far removed from hands on business experience  How could we have arrived at the point at which we allow academicians  regardless of how intelligent  to function as world financial central planners  World business leaders have been remarkably silent about the need to interpose some practical business experience I can only presume that such silence stems from not having their ox gored in recent years  For the past decade and a half or more  the Fed has done little but let the good times roll  And what corporate CEO doesn t like free flowing money  In the past five years in which the Fed has created more than 3 trillion new dollars and has usurped far more power than was ever expressly granted to it  corporate leaders have had no cause but to celebrate We can only hope that common sense will soon prevail and that a huge public outcry will arise against a small cadre of academics holding the reins of the world economy  The rationale for such an outcry becomes all the more obvious when we consider Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren s recent description of current Fed policy as  experimental    trial and error   and  learn by doing   And he s a supporter  This condition would be comical in the extreme if it were not so horrifically scary ,2013-12-22,Thomas J.

177247,398763,IBM,UPDATE 1 EU opens in depth probe into Oracle  Sun deal,news,"  EU Commission cites concerns over database market
  Deadline of Jan  19  2010 for Commission decision
  Lawyer  too early to say whether probe is bad news for deal
 
  Adds lawyer comments  background 
 By Foo Yun Chee
 BRUSSELS  Sept 3  Reuters    European Union antitrust
regulators launched an in depth probe on Thursday into Oracle s
 7 billion takeover of Sun Microsystems on concerns the deal
could dent competition in the database market 
  The  European  Commission has an obligation to ensure that
customers would not face reduced choice or higher prices as a
result of this takeover   Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes
said in a statement 
 The Commission  competition watchdog of the 27 country
European Union  set a Jan  19  2010 deadline for its decision 
putting the world s No  3 software maker  Oracle  months behind
its original plan for closing the deal 
 The regulatory delay could allow rivals    including
Hewlett Packard Co and International Business Machines Corp   
more time to poach hardware customers from Sun  the No  4 maker
of computer servers 
 HP and IBM have been offering discounts and other incentives
to woo Sun customers since Oracle agreed to buy Sun in April 
playing up concerns that Oracle might have trouble running a
hardware maker 
 Oracle had on Aug  20 received the green light from the U S 
Department of Justice for its takeover of Sun  developer of Java
software  among the world s most widely used computer languages 
 Christopher Thomas  a Brussels based antitrust lawyer at law
firm Lovells  said the Commission s in depth probe showed it was
more cautious than its U S  counterparts but did not necessarily
mean the deal would be derailed 
  I would not read too much into the investigation  The
Commission has different sets of documents than the U S 
authorities  I would imagine the issues are broadly the same  
he said  
  At this stage  it is too early to say if this is
particularly bad news for the transaction itself though it will
affect the timing of the transaction   added Thomas  who is
advising companies on the deal 
 The Commission said it was concerned that the open source
nature of Sun s MySQL database might not eliminate fully the
potential for anti competitive effects 
 With Oracle s databases and MySQL competing directly in many
sectors of the database market  MySQL is widely expected to
represent a greater competitive constraint as it becomes
increasingly functional  the EU executive said 
 Oracle  IBM and Microsoft are the main players in the
proprietary database market 
 Analysts have expressed doubts on whether Oracle s
acquisition of MySQL would stifle competition in the  19 billion
a year database market  Sun generates about  300 million in
revenue from MySQL 
 Oracle brought in about  9 2 billion in database sales last
year  according to market researcher Gartner

 NEW YORK  Sept 23  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Wednesday
as the Federal Reserve said economic activity has picked up
following a severe downturn  an assessment that suggested the
outlook for corporate profits was brightening 
 As expected  the Fed s policy setters kept interest rates
unchanged and said they will stay very low for an extended
period  For details  see  ID nN23390829 
  Their statement was a little more upbeat than the last
statement   said Hugh Johnson  chief investment officer of
Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany  New York 
  They have signaled that they are going to slow the pace of
purchases of mortgage backed securities and housing agency
bonds  That may be construed as the first subtle  and small
move toward removing a significant level of stimulus in the
system  
 The gains took the Dow Jones industrial average  to
the verge of 10 000 as investors snapped up shares in some of
the sectors that have helped underpin the market s long runup
from the 12 year lows of early March

 NEW YORK  Sept 30  Reuters    U S  stocks slipped on
Wednesday on news of a surprising contraction in an index of
Midwest business activity  but losses were limited by a bounce
in technology bellwethers like Cisco Systems Inc  at
the end of a strong quarter 
 The top drags in Wednesday s session were some of the
quarter s best performers  including industrials and banks 
 The Institute for Supply Management Chicago s business
barometer unexpectedly fell to 46 1 in September  a level that
indicates contraction in the regional economy  For details  see
 ID nN3095624 
 Typical of quarter end action  trading was choppy and
volume light 
 Indexes initially fell as much as 1 percent but then
briefly turned positive by mid afternoon  thanks to gains in
the shares of such tech bellwethers as Cisco Systems Inc
 and International Business Machines Corp  
  The Chicago PMI kind of scared people  given how much
below expectations it was and that turned the market south  
said Owen Fitzpatrick  head of U S  Equity Group at Deutsche
Bank Private Wealth Management in New York 
  In general  even though economic numbers in the last two
or three weeks have been mixed just like today  I think we re
still headed toward an economic recovery  
 The Dow Jones industrial average  fell 58 94 points 
or 0 60 percent  to 9 683 26  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
 lost 6 79 points  or 0 64 percent  to 1 053 82  The
Nasdaq Composite Index  shed 6 56 points  or 0 31
percent  to 2 117 48 
 The Chicago PMI report added to the recent string of some
surprisingly weak economic indicators  including Tuesday s
disappointing report on September consumer confidence 
 It also eclipsed a Commerce Department report that showed
the economy  measured by GDP  contracted more slowly than
initially thought in the second quarter 
 Even so  the benchmark S P 500 stayed on course to end the
quarter and September  a traditionally sour month for stocks 
on a higher note 
 The S P 500 is up 14 6 percent for the third quarter  which
ends Wednesday  For 2009  the S P is up 16 7 percent and from a
12 year closing low in early March  it s up about 55 8
percent

177266,398782,IBM,Accenture  Continuing To Deliver A Growth Story ,opinion,Accenture  ACN  is a global   technology services and outsourcing company with approximately 275 000 people serving clients in more than 120 countries  As of the end of fiscal year 2013  the company had revenues just shy of  29 billion and a market capitalization that was roughly double that amount  Additionally  Accenture provides services to a wide spectrum of industries ranging from Automotive and Aerospace to Energy and Travel  Effectively  Accenture wants to deliver a high performance solution to whatever problem you have on hand  Of course  that is not to say that the company is without risks  Like all equity issues  there is always a reason that potential investors have the opportunity to be compensated well beyond  safe  rates of return  For instance  some might point to the consulting and outsourcing segments as demonstrating worse than anticipated sales trends  Or foreign exchange headwinds could prove more complicated than originally anticipated  Demand patterns could require consistent changes to the company s strategy  The business could even be a victim of a slowing or evolving global economy  There s always a reason that a particular company might face challenges  in fact  within Accenture s most  management lays out a total of 30 potential threats and risk factors  However  with the above being stated  there does appear to be a variety of growth catalysts for the company  For example  Accenture works with 91 of the Fortune Global 100 and more than three quarters of the Fortune Global 500  Perhaps more impressively  of Accenture s top 100 clients based on revenue  99 of them have been with the company for at least 5 years  Accenture has worked with 91 of those clients for at least 10 years  In other words  it appears that the Accenture business model is quite sticky  It s one thing to find and obtain clients  it s another thing entirely to maintain  strengthen and extend those relationships  It follows that such a large company with a persistent business model might be hard to replicate  And this type of moat is precisely what we observe   Andrew Lange does a solid job of describing Accenture s advantages   We believe Accenture has a wide economic moat based upon customer switching costs and intangible assets  Deep and broad industry expertise  a global delivery network  and satisfied customer references have provided the company with a successful foundation in the highly competitive and fragmented IT services industry  Accenture s global nature sets the company apart from smaller rivals  and allows it to draw from a vast pool of specialist personnel and technology tools  We think such resources make Accenture an attractive partner for large enterprise clients  Notably  Accenture finished fiscal 2013 with roughly 130 diamond accounts  accounts over  100 million in annual revenue   which is an industry leading figure and only replicable by the likes of IBM    Clearly the company has a fundamental advantage over any would be start up competitors  In addition to this theoretical benefit  Accenture has also demonstrated that it can use this scale to deliver results  For instance  in the most recent  Accenture indicated that they had new bookings of  33 3 billion  which was an all time high amount and near the top of their previously guided range  With a profitable business  shareholder returns usually follow  Accenture CEO Pierre Nanterme described such a scenario in the latest earnings call   We generated free cash flow of  2 9 billion  slightly above our guided range  and we continue to have a very strong balance sheet  ending the year with a cash balance of  5 6 billion  We continue to return cash to shareholders with  3 7 billion in share repurchases and dividend payments during the year  And we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of  0 93 per share  which is a 15  increase over our prior dividend   Surely investors are excited about this  much in the way that they would be excited about future increases  Accenture has been able to increase its dividend for 9 consecutive years at an annualized pace of over 20  a year  In viewing the current payout ratio below 40  with a reasonable 2 5  yield  future growth in line with earnings or slightly better appears reasonable  Finally  those still doubting the potential growth story of Accenture will have to go through the likes of David Rowland  Accenture s CFO  As he described in the latest   Let me start by saying that we are a growth oriented company  And everything you heard today clearly illustrates that point  I can assure you that our management team focuses 24 7 on what we need to do to drive profitable growth  It s in our DNA and it s embedded in our culture   With that  let s turn to the past operating history and possible future endeavors for an Accenture investor  11 Years of Growth  Accenture has grown earnings  orange line  at a compound rate of 17 3  since 2003  resulting in a nearly 48 billion dollar market cap  In addition  Accenture s earnings have risen from  1 06 per share in 2003  to today s forecasted earnings per share of approximately  4 29 for 2013  Further  Accenture initiated a dividend  pink line  in 2005 and has been able to increase this payout at a robust pace  Note that Accenture did not cut its dividend in 2010  but rather switched to a semi annual payout  For a look at how the market has historically valued Accenture  see the relationship between the price  black line  and earnings of the company as seen on the  below Here we see that Accenture s market price previously began to deviate from its justified earnings growth  starting to become undervalued during the most recent recession and coming back to fair value as of late  Today  Accenture appears to be fairly valued in relation to both its historical earnings and relative valuation In tandem with the strong earnings growth  Accenture shareholders have enjoyed a compound annual return of 15  which correlates somewhat closely with the 17 3  growth rate in earnings per share  A hypothetical  10 000 investment in Accenture on 12 31 2002 would have grown to a total value of  45 611 11  without reinvesting dividends  Said differently  Accenture shareholders have enjoyed total returns that were roughly 2 times the value that would have been achieved by investing in the S P 500 over the same time period  It s also interesting to note that an investor would have received approximately 1 2 times the amount of dividend income as the index as well  But of course   as the saying goes   past performance does not guarantee future results  Thus  while a strong operating history provides a fundamental platform for evaluating a company  it does not by itself indicate a buy or sell decision  Instead  an investor must have an understanding of the past while simultaneously thinking the investment through to its logical  if not understated  conclusion In the opening paragraphs a variety of potential catalysts  opportunities and risks were described  It follows that the probabilities of these outcomes should be the guide for one s investment focus  Yet it is still useful to determine whether or not your predictions seem reasonable  Twenty three leading analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ come to a consensus 5 year annual estimated return growth rate for Accenture of 12   In addition  Accenture is currently trading at a P E of 17 4  which is inside the  value corridor   defined by the orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Accenture s valuation would be  107 17 at the end of 2018  which would be a 9 8  annualized rate of return including dividends  A graphical representation of this calculation can be seen in the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator below  Now  it s paramount to remember that this is simply a calculator  Specifically  the estimated total return is a default based on the consensus of the analysts following the stock  The consensus includes the long term growth rate along with specific earnings estimates for next two upcoming years  Further  the dividend payout ratio is presumed to stay the same and grow with earnings  Taken collectively  this graph provides a very strong baseline for how analysts are presently viewing this company  However  a F A S T  Graphs  subscriber is also able to change these estimates to fit their own thesis or scenario analysis Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Accenture to an equal investment in a 10 year treasury bond  illustrates that Accenture s expected earnings would be 3 9 times that of the 10 year T Bond Interest  This comparison can be seen in the 10 year Earnings Yield Estimate table below  Finally  it s important to underscore the idea that all companies derive their underlying value from the cash flows  earnings  that they are capable of generating for their owners  Therefore  it should be the expectation of a prudent investor that   in the long run   the likely future earnings of a company justify the price you pay  Fundamentally  this means appropriately addressing these two questions   in what should I invest   and  at what time   In viewing the past history and future prospects of Accenture we have learned that it appears to be a strong company with solid upcoming opportunities  However  as always  we recommend that the reader conduct his or her own thorough due diligence Disclosure  Long ACN  IBM at the time of writing

177270,398786,IBM,ANALYSIS EU affirms tough antitrust stand with Microsoft case,news,"  EU Commission seen tougher on antitrust than U S 
   Firms under probe may be tempted to settle like Microsoft
   Commission s broad mandate unique among regulators
 
 By Foo Yun Chee
 BRUSSELS  Aug 3  Reuters    Microsoft s offer to settle a
decade long battle with EU antitrust regulators cements the
European Commission s reputation as one of the world s toughest
watchdogs and could force other firms to follow its example 
 The U S  software giant last month yielded to the
Commission s demand to let users choose their own browser and to
provide more information that would let third parties design
programmes compatible with its products 
 Analysts said that the case underlined the difference in
approach of regulators in Europe and the United States 
  In the last 10 years compared with the United States 
Europe has been effectively prosecuting antitrust cases  The
U S  has been taking a cautious approach   said competition
expert Robert Stillman at consultancy CRA International 
  The Microsoft interoperability case is an example where the
Commission got it right  In the United States  there is no
interest in that case   he said 
 The EU executive has slapped fines totalling 1 68 billion
euros   2 37 billion  on Microsoft over the years for infringing
EU antitrust rules  may levy another hefty penalty if it were to
rule against the company in the current case 
 U S  regulators have generally taken a slightly softer line
than their European counterparts 
 The newly appointed head of the U S  Justice Department s
antitrust department  Christine Varney  said in May the unit had
 not been as active as it could have been  under former
President George W  Bush and vowed tougher enforcement 
 Part of the European Commission s firm stance has to do with
its sweeping mandate  said antitrust lawyer Jonas Koponen at law
firm Linklaters 
  The Commission is tough in different fields  in state aid 
cartels  antitrust  Not many regulators have that broad a
regulation portfolio   he said 
 
 CLEAR SIGNAL
 With the Commission having shown its willingness to dig in
for a long battle  companies on the regulator s radar screen
should take heed of Microsoft s decision to settle  said
antitrust lawyer Stephen Kinsella at Sidley Austin 
  If it is possible to resolve a case with both parties
agreeing     and then give some forward looking commitments
designed to resolve problems for the future as well  that has to
be the way to try to deal with issues in this area   he said 
  If Microsoft can settle with the Commission  presumably
others can   Kinsella said 
 U S  wireless chip and technology company Qualcomm  under
scrutiny in Brussels for anti competitive behaviour  is a case
in point 
  If people look at the willingness of the Commission to
close cases through commitments  that certainly remains am
option for Qualcomm if it feels it is likely to end up with a
decision against it   Adam Collinson at law firm Eversheds said 
  Certainly in terms of the time and cost of pursuing these
investigations  if there isn t a huge commercial impact to
offering these commitments  then that may be a very sensible
thing to do   he said 
 Companies with interoperability issues and facing regulatory
scrutiny would likely look at Microsoft s concessions to get an
idea of the Commission s concerns  said Linklaters  Koponen 
  There are issues in there that could be relevant for other
cases  for example Oracle and Sun Microsystems  IBM could be an
issue   he said 
 World No  3 software maker Oracle sought Brussels  approval
on Monday on its plan to buy computer maker Sun  the world s
fourth largest maker of server computers and also the developer
of Java and Solaris software 
 U S  computer firm T3 Technologies filed a complaint with
the Commission in January  accusing IBM of abusing its power in
the mainframe computer industry 
 The benefits to companies looking to settle are significant 
Not only do they escape fines from the Commission but the
possibility of court actions by competitors 
 But companies could face an uphill battle if the Commission
wants to set a precedent in complex and groundbreaking cases 
  Sometimes  they really want a decision  even a judgement 
because they want to establish a principle without a doubt  
said Kinsella 
 
 TAKING ON BANKS  GOVERNMENTS  CARTELS
 Since her appointment in 2004  Neelie Kroes  Europe s
competition czar  has taken on political leaders looking to prop
up their countries  ailing car industries and banks as well as
conglomerates seeking to block rivals or run cartels 
 Far from weakening regulatory oversight as some expected 
the credit crisis and economic downturn have boosted antitrust
authorities  resolve to uphold the rules 
  Competition authorities both in Europe and the United
Kingdom have maintained a pretty hard face even in the difficult
economic and financial climate   said Eversheds  Collinson 
  They do not want companies to be able to use the economic
and financial crisis as an excuse to engage in anti competitive
practices which in the long term will be damaging to the economy
and to consumers

   Eyes A share listing when rules permit
   Sees profitability in mature markets by March 2010
   Not optimistic on Windows 7 to boost PC sales
   Stock up 50 pct this year  beating main board
 By Kelvin Soh and Doug Young
 TAIPEI BEIJING  Sept 1  Reuters    Lenovo  0992 HK   the
world s No  4 PC brand  says it plans to list on the Shanghai
stock exchange when rules permit  opening an opportunity for the
firm in one of the world s best performing stock markets 
 The move would make sense for Hong Kong listed Lenovo  since
it developed in China and is one of the country s best known
brands  with about a third of the market 
  I obviously would wish to list  in China  today   Wong Wai
Ming  Lenovo s chief financial officer  said at the Reuters China
Investment Summit 
  Knowing Lenovo s market share in China  it makes a lot of
sense and we would follow that issue very closely  We need to
look at what the rules are  and what are the possible impacts on
our operations  
 Lenovo cannot list in China in its current form as Beijing
forbids overseas headquartered companies from listing on the
Shanghai  or Shenzhen  stock exchanges 
 The PC maker s headquarters is in North Carolina in the
United States  having moved there in 2006 after completing its
purchase of IBM s  laptop PC arm 
 But Beijing is in the process of changing the rules to allow
foreign headquartered companies to list in China  prompting a
flood of overseas headquartered companies that do major business
in the market to say they would seek such a listing 
 Separately  Wong said he expects Lenovo s operations in
mature markets such as Western Europe and the United States to
return to profitability by March 2010  as tech demand there picks
up with the easing of the global downturn 
  There is no reason for me to believe that we cannot return
to a profit in mature markets by the end of the financial year  
Wong said  in a reference to Lenovo s financial year that runs
through March 31   We re working towards that  and are keeping in
mind our other group objectives as well  
 Much of Lenovo s losses in the past three reporting quarters
have been due to its weakness in mature markets  and a recovery
there would help the company return to profitability 
 Many analysts and PC makers have been hopeful that
Microsoft s  launch of its next generation Windows 7
operating system will also help push up overall PC sales  but
Wong was less optimistic about its prospects 
  Many CFOs are especially sensitive to cost right now  and
will not increase capital spending just because the economy seems
to be doing better now   he said 
 Wong s comments came as many of Lenovo s global peers such as
Dell  have said they are betting on a strong replacement
cycle from 2010 as companies replace PCs that are still running
on older versions of Windows 
 In early August  Lenovo reported its third straight quarterly
loss  but cut losses and exceeded market expectations  thanks to
China s massive stimulus package  stabilising consumer demand and
a slew of cost cutting measures   ID nTP97926 
 Investors have been optimistic on its turnaround story  with
its shares up about 50 percent so far this year  compared with a
roughly 35 percent advance on the benchmark Hang Seng index

  Updates to midday  changes byline 
 By Ryan Vlastelica
 NEW YORK  Sept 2  Reuters    U S  stocks edged higher on
Wednesday following three straight days of declines after more
labor market data suggested that the economy s recovery
remains a slow one 
 The ADP survey of private sector jobs showed employers cut
298 000 jobs in August  That number was better than July s
figure  but worse than expected  suggesting struggles in the
labor market before Friday s highly anticipated monthly jobs
data from the U S  Labor Department 
 Improvement in the job market has been slow  and consumer
confidence has stumbled of late  worrying those hoping for an
upturn in consumer demand to fuel economic growth  The current
mean estimate of economists polled by Reuters is for a loss of
225 000 jobs in Friday s non farm payrolls report 
  We re still digesting some of yesterday s losses and the
data   said Paul Nolte  director of investments at Hinsdale
Associates in Hinsdale  Illinois  who said the rally was
built  in part  on anticipation of a recovery 
 Financial shares once again led decliners and kept the
major indexes  gains extremely modest  The KBW Bank Index
lost 1 3 percent  with regional banks  such as SunTrust Banks
down 7 percent at  20 21 
 Moving up were shares of gold producers as the price of
 gold rallied to  975 60 an ounce  Shares of Gold Fields Ltd 
  gained 9 6 percent to  13 00 and the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs
Index  rose 7 4 percent to 376 78 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13 07 points  or
0 14 percent  to 9 334 47  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
inched up 0 65 of a point  or 0 07 percent  to 998 69  The
Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 3 80 points  or 0 19 percent 
to 1 972 68 
 The S P 500 has climbed about 50 percent from a 12 year
closing low in early March  prompting some investors to
speculate that a correction may be on the way 
 On the plus side  shares of International Business
Machines Corp helped support the blue chip Dow average  A
senior IBM executive in China told Reuters that IBM is
targeting China s retail  auto and insurance sectors as
emerging industries that are growing faster than the country s
overall economy 
 IBM s stock was up 0 03 percent  or 3 cents  at  116 72 
  There s so much built into the market  I think it s going
to go sideways for a while   Nolte said 
  I don t see much upside or downside potential  
 A bright spot in Wednesday s market was the health
insurance group  with the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor
index advancing 4 1 percent to 1 212 33  WellCare Health
gained 2 4 percent to  23 74 while Aetna Inc climbed 4 1
percent to  29 01  Insurance stocks have been under pressure

of computer servers 
 HP and IBM have been offering discounts and other incentives
to woo Sun customers since Oracle agreed to buy Sun in April 
playing up concerns that Oracle might have trouble running a
hardware maker 
 Oracle had on Aug  20 received the green light from the U S 
Department of Justice for its takeover of Sun  developer of Java
software  among the world s most widely used computer languages 
 The Commission said it was concerned that the open source
nature of Sun s MySQL database might not eliminate fully the
potential for anti competitive effects 
 With both Oracle s databases and MySQL competing directly in
many sectors of the database market  MySQL is widely expected to
represent a greater competitive constraint as it becomes
increasingly functional  the EU executive said

177298,398814,IBM,STTG Market Recap  October 29  2013,opinion,"Tick tock  Another day the market is open and goes up  Essentially the same story as the entire month of October  there have only been 2 down days since this rally began in the S P 500  The S P 500 gained 0 56  and the NASDAQ 0 31   Nothing really new to add to the overall market analysis here  we are in a major uptrend of parabolic nature  and you are seeing rotation under the surface as different groups take turns being leaders each day  No one is worried much about tomorrow s Federal Reserve decision as there is zero expectation of anyhing but full steam ahead from the Fed  IBM was a highlight today as the massive DJIA component announced a huge  15B addition to its buyback program  The only major economic report on the day were monthly retail sales   they were above expectations but mostly due to iPhone sales The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales excluding automobiles  gasoline and building materials  increased 0 5 percent last month after a 0 2 percent gain in August  The so called core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product  Core sales last month were boosted by a 0 7 percent advance in receipts at electronics and appliance stores  Economists polled by Reuters had expected core retail sales to increase 0 4 percent in September  The increase last month probably reflected sales of Apple s new iPhone  Those sales likely boosted receipts at non store retailers  mostly Internet sites  which increased 0 4 percent in September No changes to the indexes 

The NYSE McClellan Oscillator has worked off some of its very overbought condition with a read back below 40 

One area that has been hot hot hot are the consumer staples  Usually they rally when people are worried about the economy but with the Fed on the sideline from any reduction in quantitative easing for seemingly at least 6 more months  the yield on government debt is falling so people want alternatives and these type of stodgy stocks usually have good dividends 

Two well known internet names reported after the bell   LinkedIn  LNKD  and Chinese  Google   Baidu com  BIDU    the initial reaction was quite different with the former down about 4  and the latter up 5   LinkedIn is trading back under  240  while Baidu is up near  170 in the after hours LinkedIn Corp  posted a loss for the third quarter  but the results were stronger than Wall Street expected as the professional networking service boosted its user base and increased revenue  Its outlook for the current quarter  however  was below estimates and its stock fell in extended trading after the results were released  LinkedIn lost  3 4 million  or 3 cents per share  in the July September period compared with earnings of  2 3 million  or 2 cents per share  in the same period a year ago  Adjusted earnings were  46 8 million  or 39 cents per share  in the latest quarter  which beat analysts  expectations by 7 cents  Revenue rose 56 percent  to  393 million from  252 million  Analysts predicted  384 8 million  according to FactSet  For the current quarter  LinkedIn forecast a revenue range of  415 million to  420 million  which is below Wall Street s expectations of  438 9 million 

Chinese Internet company Baidu Inc said it experienced strong growth in mobile search revenue during the third quarter and forecast better than expected revenue for the final three months of the year  Baidu  the largest Internet search engine in China  projected that revenue in the fourth quarter will range between 9 220 billion yuan and 9 480 billion yuan  Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I B E S were looking for Q4 revenue of 8 904 yuan  Baidu s net income saw a slight bump in the third quarter  rising 1 3 percent to 3 048 billion yuan 

Apple reported yesterday after the close and today had a day similar to Netflix last week   a bearish outside reversal day where the stock first went higher than the previous day s range and then closed below it  So as with Netflix some caution is now necessary as this is usually a bearish short term signal

177300,398816,IBM,Why Washington Is Cutting Safety Nets ,opinion,So how to explain this paradox  As of November 1 more than 47 million Americans have lost some or all of their food stamp benefits  House Republicans are pushing for further cuts  If the sequester isn t stopped everything else poor and working class Americans depend on will be further squeezed  We re not talking about a small sliver of America here  Half of all children get food stamps at some point during their childhood  Half of all adults get them sometime between ages 18 and 65  Many employers   including the nation s largest  Walmart   now pay so little that food stamps are necessary in order to keep food on the family table  and other forms of assistance are required to keep a roof overhead  The larger reality is that most Americans are still living in the Great Recession  Median household income continues to drop  In last week s  75 percent rated the state of the economy as  negative  or  poor   So why is Washington whacking safety nets and services that a large portion of Americans need  when we still very much need them  It s easy to blame Republicans and the rightwing billionaires that bankroll them  and their unceasing demonization of  big government  as well as deficits  But Democrats in Washington bear some of the responsibility  In last year s fiscal cliff debate neither party pushed to extend the payroll tax holiday or find other ways to help the working middle class and poor  Here s a clue  A new  of families in the top 10 percent of net worth  done by the American Affluence Research Center  shows they re feeling better than they ve felt since 2007  before the Great Recession  It s not just that the top 10 percent have jobs and their wages are rising  The top 10 percent also owns of the stock market  And the stock market is up a whopping 24 percent this year  The stock market is up even though most Americans are down for two big reasons  First  businesses are busily handing their cash back to their shareholders   buying back their stock and thereby boosting share prices   rather than using the cash to expand and hire  It makes no sense to expand and hire when most Americans don t have the money to buy  The S P 500  Buyback Index   which measures the 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratios  has surged  this year  compared with a 24  rally for the S P 500  IBM has just approved another   for share buybacks on top of about  5 6 billion it set aside previously  thereby boosting its share prices even though business is sluggish  In April  Apple announced a  50 billion increase in buybacks plus a 15  rise in dividends  but even this wasn t enough for multi billionaire Carl Icahn  who s now demanding that Apple use more of its  170 billion cash stash to buy back its stock and make Ichan even richer  Big corporations can also borrow at rock bottom rates these days in order to buy back even more of their stock   courtesy of the Fed s  85 billion a month bond buying program   Ichan also wants Apple to borrow  150 billion at 3 percent interest  in order to buy back more stock and further enrich himself   The second big reason why shares are up while most Americans are down is corporations continue to find new ways to boost profits and share prices by cutting their labor costs   substituting software for people  cutting wages and benefits  and  on each of the employees that remain  Neither of these two strategies   buying back stock and paring payrolls   can be sustained over the long run  so you have every right to worry about another Wall Street bubble   They don t improve a company s products or customer service  But in an era of sluggish sales   when the vast American middle class lacks the purchasing power to keep the economy going   these two strategies at least keep shareholders happy  And that means they keep the top 10 percent happy  Congress  meanwhile  doesn t know much about the bottom 90 percent  The top 10 percent provide almost all campaign contributions and funding of  independent  ads  Moreover  just about all members of Congress are drawn from the same top 10 percent   as are almost all their friends and associates  and even the media who report on them  Get it  The bottom 90 percent of Americans   most of whom are still suffering from the Great Recession  most of whom have been on a downward escalator for decades   have disappeared from official Washington ,2013-11-03,Robert B.

177301,398817,IBM,How To Find The Best Sector ETFs,opinion,"Finding the best ETFs is an increasingly difficult task in a world with so many to choose from   You Cannot Trust ETF Labels There are at least 44 different Financials ETFs and at least 174 ETFs across all sectors  Do investors need that many choices  How different can the ETFs be   Those 44 Financials ETFs are very different  With anywhere from 22 to 536 holdings  many of these Financials ETFs have drastically different portfolios  creating drastically different investment implications   The same is true for the ETFs in any other sector  as each offers a very different mix of good and bad stocks  Some sectors have lots of good stocks and offer quality funds  The opposite is true for some sectors  while others lie in between these extremes with a fair mix of good and bad stocks  For example  the Health Care sector  per my 4Q Sector Rankings Report  ranks sixth out of 10 sectors when it comes to providing investors with quality ETFs  Consumer Staples ranks first  Utilities ranks last 
The bottom line is  ETF labels do not tell you the kind of stocks you are getting in any given ETF   Paralysis By Analysis I firmly believe ETFs for a given sector should not all be that different  I think the large number of Financials  or any other  sector of ETFs hurts investors more than it helps because too many options can be paralyzing  It is simply not possible for the majority of investors to properly assess the quality of so many ETFs  Analyzing ETFs  done with the proper diligence  is far more difficult than analyzing stocks because it means analyzing all the stocks within each ETF  As stated above  that can be as many as 536 stocks  and sometimes even more  for one ETF   Any investor worth his salt recognizes that analyzing the holdings of an ETF is critical to finding the best ETF Figure 1  Best Sector ETFs Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings   The Danger Within Why do investors need to know the holdings of ETFs before they buy  They need to know to be sure they do not buy a fund that might blow up  Buying a fund without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances  As Barron s says  investors should know the Danger Within  No matter how cheap  if it holds bad stocks  the ETF s performance will be bad   PERFORMANCE OF FUND S HOLDINGS   PERFORMANCE OF FUND  Finding the Sector ETFs with the Best Holdings Figure 1 shows my top rated ETF for each sector  Importantly  my ratings on ETFs are based primarily on my stock ratings of their holdings  My firm covers over 3000 stocks and is known for the due diligence we do for each stock we cover  Accordingly  our coverage of ETFs leverages the diligence we do on each stock by rating ETFs based on the aggregated ratings of the stocks each ETF holds   Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF  VDC  is the top rated Consumer Staples ETF and the overall top rated fund of the 174 sector ETFs I cover  Only the Consumer Staples sector contains any Attractive  i e  4 star  rated ETFs  while the best every other sector can offer is a Neutral or 3 star ETF   Sometimes  you get what you pay for  It is troubling to see one of the best sector ETFs  First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund  TDIV  have just  227 million in assets despite its 3 star rating  On the other hand  Dangerous rated iShares North American Tech Software ETF  IGV  has over  900 million in assets  IGV has lower total annual costs than TDIV  0 53  and 0 55  respectively   but low costs cannot drive positive performance  Quality holdings are the ultimate driver of performance   I cannot help but wonder if investors would leave IGV if they knew that it has such a poor portfolio of stocks  It is cheaper than TDIV  but as previously stated  low fees cannot growth wealth  only good stocks can   Sometimes  you DON T get what you pay for  The smallest ETF in Figure 1 is PowerShares KBW Property   Casualty Insurance Portfolio  KDWP  with just  21 million in assets  Sadly  other Financials ETFs with more assets and inferior portfolios charge more than KDWP  In other words  Financials ETF investors are paying extra fees for no reason   iShares U S  Regional Banks ETF  IAT  is one of the worst ETFs in the Financials sector  It gets my Dangerous rating based off the fact that barely 3  of its assets are allocated to Attractive or better rated stocks  while 77  is allocated to Dangerous or worse stocks  IAT also has total annual costs of 0 53   higher than KDWP s 0 39   One would think that IAT would have fewer assets than LOGSX  but instead it has over  499 million  Investors are paying extra fees for poor holdings   The worst ETF in Figure 1 is State Street SPDR Utilities Select Sector SPDR  XLU   which gets a Dangerous  2 Star  rating  One would think ETF providers could do better for this sector   I recommend investors only buy ETFs with more than  100 million in assets   Covering All The Bases  Including Costs My ETF rating also takes into account the total annual costs  which represents the all in cost of being in the ETF  This analysis is complex for ETFs  as one has to consider not only expense ratios  but also front end load and transaction fees  A high front end load not only costs investors at the beginning  it also reduces the growth investors can experience later on  While costs play a smaller role than holdings  my ratings penalize those funds with abnormally high costs   Top Stocks Make Up Top ETFs International Business Machines Corp  IBM  is one of my favorite stocks held by First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund  TDIV  and earns my Very Attractive rating  IBM has grown after tax profits  NOPAT  by 11  compounded annually over the last 8 years and has achieved positive and rising economic earnings every year over the same timeframe  The company generates a return on invested capital  ROIC  of 20   which puts it in the top quintile of companies that I cover  Despite this strong track record of profit growth  IBM is cheaply priced  At its current price of   177 share  IBM has a price to economic book value ratio of 0 9  This valuation implies that the market expects IBM s NOPAT to decline permanently by 10   Since IBM has grown NOPAT by 11  compounded annually over the last 8 years  these expectations seem low  A strong growth track record and a cheap valuation earn IBM my Very Attractive rating   Jared Melnyk contributed to this post  Disclosure  David Trainer and Jared Melnyk receive no compensation to write about any specific stock  sector  or theme ",2013-11-03,David

 By Harpreet Bhal
 LONDON  July 17  Reuters    British shares rose early on
Friday  on track for a fifth straight day of gains  as upbeat
U S  corporate earnings supported optimism about the pace of
global recovery  lifting oil majors  miners and banks 
 By 0821 the FTSE 100 was up 0 7 percent or 30 86 points at
4 392 70  and set for its biggest weekly rise since January
after hitting a four week high in the previous session 
 Strong earnings from U S  firms IBM  Intel  Goldman Sachs
and JPMorgan Chase have lifted global markets  with investors
eyeing results from Citigroup and General Electric later in the
session 
  If corporate earnings continue to exceed analysts
expectations there is the argument that the equity market is
undervalued and could squeeze considerably higher   said Manoj
Ladwa  senior trader at ETX Capital  
 Despite the positive sentiment  geopolitical worries could
return to the surface after bomb blasts ripped through two
hotels in Jakarta s business district  killing nine and injuring
42 
 Oil and gas firms added most points to the index  as oil
prices stayed above  61 a barrel  
 BG Group  BP  Cairn Energy and Royal Dutch Shell added
between 0 5 and 2 percent 
 Royal Dutch Shell s subsidiary Shell Oil Co said it was
considering staff cuts to its refineries and chemical plants on
the U S  Gulf Coast to reduce costs
  Banks were also in positive territory  benefiting from
strong earnings from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs earlier in the
week 
 Barclays  HSBC  Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of
Scotland rose between 0 2 1 1 percent  But market participants
were cautious on the outlook for the sector 
  The thing  with the banks  is that there is also the
corporate and mortgage and loan defaults which seem to be
increasing and traders and economists will be keeping a very
close eye on those numbers   Ladwa at ETX Capital said 
 Miners were in demand with Anglo American  BHP Billiton 
Eurasian  Kazakhmys  Rio Tinto and Xstrata up 0 9 3 2 percent 
 Vedanta rose 2 percent after the India focused group said it
planned to expand to steel manufacturing with a partner 
 British Airways was the top riser  up 4 2 percent after
announcing plans to raise about 600 million pounds through
bondholder debt and bank credit  reassuring investors about its
funding position 
 The airline also reported an operating loss of 100 million
pounds for the three months ending June 30  but analysts said
this was better than feared 
 On the downside  engineering firm Invensys fell 1 8 percent 
as it said reduced volumes in its short cycle products would
impact first half performance 
 Defensive tobacco firms were lower  with British American
Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco both falling around 0 5 percent

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON  July 17  Reuters    The dollar and yen were firmer
against other major currencies on Friday as caution set in
before more key U S  corporate earnings later in the day 
 U S  stocks rallied for a fourth day on Thursday  U S 
stocks futures indexes were a little lower in mid morning London
trade 
  Currency markets are taking their lead from equities  with
the dollar and yen generally firmer   said Adam Cole  global
head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets 
 Second quarter earnings results from Citigroup   Bank
of America  and General Electric  are all due out
later in the day  and the market is seen closely following stock
market reaction to those results 
 Stellar earnings results from Goldman Sachs  and
JPMorgan Chase  earlier this week  as well as big
corporates such as Intel   IBM  and Google
 exceeding forecasts have buoyed risk taking sentiment 
 Markets shrugged off euro zone trade data for May  which
posted a surplus of 1 9 billion euros  slightly lower than
forecasts for 2 7 billion euros   ID nBRQ007443 
 By 0903 GMT  the euro was down 0 3 percent at  1 4101 
and down 0 3 percent at 132 20 yen   
 Brighter sentiment had almost caused currency pairs to break
out of consolidation patterns  but not quite  Euro dollar was
holding its symmetrical triangle dating back to the start of
June 
 The euro is also on track for its best weekly performance
against the dollar in two months  or up 0 9 percent on the week 
 The dollar index was up 0 3 percent at 79 451  after
falling to a six week low at 79 131 the previous day 
 Sterling was down 0 7 percent at  1 6317  and down 0 8
percent at 152 94 yen  
 The U S  currency eased 0 1 percent to 93 70 yen  
 The dollar dipped to a five month low of 91 73 yen in July
and its rise stalled at 94 46 yen this week    right around a
38 2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the dollar s fall from its
high in June of 98 90 yen down to the five month trough 
 Risk sentiment was dampened after bomb blasts at hotels in
Jakarta  although most analysts did not expect any lasting
effect on markets 
  The blasts have added to this direction in terms of risk
trades coming off   said Mitul Kotecha  head of FX strategy at
Calyon in Hong Kong  but added it wasn t a big move 
 Reaction was muted to comments from Japan s new currency
tsar  Rintaro Tamaki  who said the U S  dollar will remain a
core asset in Japan s  1 trillion of foreign currency reserves 
 Tamaki also said he would not completely rule out currency
intervention  but that foreign exchange rates should be
determined by the market   ID nTKF106478 ",2009-07-17,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/forex-dollar,-yen-firmer;-await-u.s.-bank-earnings-72533",72533

177323,398839,IBM,Why I Remain Pessimistic On This Stock Market,opinion,"The third quarter corporate earning season has begun  And as I have been predicting  earnings growth just isn t there this quarter  If companies in key stock indices are beating their earnings estimates  it s because they are beating already lowered expected earnings  What s the biggest problem with the corporate reports I m seeing  Revenue growth is disappearing What we have seen so far 
International Business Machines Corporation  IBM  reported third quarter corporate earnings per share were up 11  from the same period a year ago  but revenues fell four percent from the third quarter of 2012   Source  International Business Machines Corporation  October 16  2013  
The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc   GS  reported corporate earnings of  2 88 per share for the third quarter of 2013  In the same period of 2012  corporate earnings were  2 85 per share  And revenues plunged 22  from the second quarter   Source  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc   October 17  2013  
What we have seen so far in respect to the earnings of big public companies isn t anything impressive  In fact  it s just more evidence pointing to key stock indices running on nothing but propped up earnings due to stock buyback programs made largely possible by easy monetary policy Going forward  I just expect to hear about more companies struggling with revenue growth  thus  you can understand my skepticism on rising key stock indices  Every  party  comes to an end  and the gains we now see on the key stock indices could disappear very quickly  I believe caution and capital preservation are the best investment strategies right now as key stock indices run ahead of themselves The fundamentals  real rising corporate earnings and real rising corporate revenue because of real economic growth in the equation that is missing from the rise in stock prices  On an individual basis  real personal income has been declining since 2009 and jobs created since the Great Recession have been in the low paying retail and service sectors This is the weakest economic recovery on record  Our economy isn t growing  All we have is the government increasing its debt and the Fed printing new paper money to give to the banks and the government  Take out the rise in the stock prices of big bank stocks since 2009  who have been supported by the Fed  from key stock indices  and the stock market looks a lot different Economists like me who hold contrarian views on key stock indices are ridiculed these days  I don t mind   I was also ridiculed in 2005 when I said the U S  housing market was overpriced and that it would collapse  My belief is that we are at the end of the bear market rally in stocks that started in 2009  The bear is doing a masterful job at convincing investors the stock market is a safe place again just what the bear wants before it takes stock prices down again Michael s Personal Notes Keeping up with the subject of irrationality  it s not just key stock indices working in reverse to the fundamentals  I believe gold bullion prices are facing the same issue  They are moving in the wrong direction in spite of fundamentals suggesting otherwise India  the biggest gold bullion consuming country  is experiencing robust gold demand in spite of the government and central bank working together to curb it  According to traders in India  gold bullion premiums have reached a record high of  100 00 an ounce about eight percent above London prices  Why  There s a shortage in the supply of gold bullion to meet the demand in India   Source  Reuters  October 15  2013   As per the World Gold Council s estimates  the demand for gold bullion in India will be about 1 000 tonnes for the year Consumer demand for gold bullion elsewhere is significantly higher as well  And one of the gold bullion buyers I follow closely  central banks  are active  too According to the International Monetary Fund  in August  Russia  Turkey  and six other central banks across the global economy increased their gold bullion reserves  The Russian central bank purchased the greatest amount since December of 2012  bringing its gold bullion reserves to 1 015 52 tonnes  Turkey s central bank bought 23 34 tonnes of the precious metal  and its total gold bullion holdings stood at 487 35 tonnes in August   Source  Reuters  September 25  2013  Looking at all this  I am more bullish than ever on gold bullion  because I m focused on the long term prospects of the precious metal In spite of the weakness in gold bullion prices we witnessed in early summer this year  the long term trend in gold bullion prices is still intact  You can see it for yourself in the chart below I believe opportunities in the form of depressed prices for well managed senior and junior mining companies are knocking on the doors of investors  No one likes them right now because they have shed a significant amount of value  There s blood on the streets for gold  it seems  and that s why the contrarian investor in me likes gold related investments so much What He Said  What group of stocks are next to fall in light of the softening U S  housing market  The stocks of companies that sell retail products to the American consumer  I believe  are next on the hit list  Many retail stocks are already reporting soft sales  In my opinion  they haven t seen anything yet in respect to weaker sales

177325,398841,IBM,Tangoe  In The Danger Zone,opinion,Check out this week s Danger Zone interview with Chuck Jaffe of Money Life and MarketWatch com   Tangoe Inc  TNGO  is in the Danger Zone this week  TNGO operates in a very specialized sector of the software as a service  SaaS  field  It provides  communications lifecycle management   or software that maximizes the efficiency and minimizes the costs of a company s communications assets  The software as a service industry has been very popular with investors  and TNGO is no exception  Every analyst that covers the stock currently has a  buy  or  strong buy  rating on TNGO  Year to date the stock is up 112    TNGO checks all the marks of a Wall Street rollup scheme  Beating earnings estimates by a penny for share every quarter  Check  Constant acquisitions to keep the top line growing  Check  Shady management rewarding itself with massive stock options  Check   Red Flags From Our Model TNGO has successfully made their top and bottom line results appear positive  The company grew total revenue by 53  in 2011 and 47  in 2012  Earnings per share increased by 150  last year and are expected to grow by a further 25  next year   TNGO has managed this impressive growth by going on an acquisition spree  In 2011 and 2012  the company acquired four smaller competitors for a combined cost of  79 million  or 26 times its reported net income from last year  The company funded these acquisitions through its initial and secondary public offerings that allowed it to report positive cash flow for the past two years   The reported growth from these acquisitions obscures the fact that the business is already in decline  The company s after tax operating profit  NOPAT  declined by 14  as its margins shrunk from 5  to 3  in the last fiscal year  TNGO s return on invested capital  ROIC  declined from 7  to 4  at the same time   Beyond these profitability issues  the company has hidden liabilities that even further decrease the value of the stock  The company has  22 million of reported debt  but it also has a further  19 million in off balance sheet debt  These liabilities wipe out the  42 million in cash that the company has left over from its public offerings   The other hidden liability is outstanding employee stock options  TNGO had 6 9 million ESO s outstanding at the end of 2012  At that time  they were worth only  40 million  but the massive growth in the stock price has brought the value of these liabilities up to over  100 million or over 10  of the stock s market value   Questionable Accounting Benefits Executives Tangoe s management manipulates the accounting metrics that help determine their compensation  The company s cash flow measurement excludes capital expenditure  including money paid for acquisitions  Over the past two years  management has been able to exclude acquisitions and turn   13 million and   24 million of cash flows into   9 million and   15 million   The other major metric that drives executive compensation  EBITDA  conveniently excludes stock based compensation  Since stock based compensation makes up 77  of executive pay  the management of TNGO basically is allowed to exclude their own payment from expenses in order to award themselves even larger bonuses   Don t think that executive compensation is a minor issue for TNGO either  In 2012  TNGO executives earned  6 9 million  You might recognize that as being more than double the reported income from the entire company last year  When the CEO is making more money than the rest of the company combined  something has gone significantly wrong   Unfortunately  TNGO s executives have a history of this sort of behavior  The CEO and CFO s last company  Information Management Associates  filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2000 after the SEC expressed concern over its accounting and NASDAQ halted the trading of its stock   Insiders and Institutions Selling Insiders and Wall St  have propped up this stock for a while  but it looks like they re getting ready to pull the plug  Institutional investors have sold around 8 million shares  roughly 22  of all outstanding shares  in the last six months   Insiders in the company have sold 1 4 million shares  about 20  of their holdings  in the last six months  Clearly  these investors are looking to reduce their exposure to this stock   Competitive Disadvantage A closer look at TNGO s operations and the state of its industry reveals why insiders are so ready to cash out on the stock  Quite simply  the company is falling behind in a competitive industry and it doesn t have the resources to keep growing revenues and EPS through acquisitions  Figure 1 analyzes TNGO against several companies in its peer group along several different profitability metrics  including ROIC  gross margins  return on equity  and NOPAT margin  TNGO falls at or below the median on all 11 metrics   Figure 1  Lagging Behind Peers Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  Another headwind for the company is the possibility of larger companies entering the field  For instance  IBM  IBM  recently acquired a direct competitor of TNGO s and has begun actively competing in the field  Even worse  IBM accounted for over 10  of TNGO s revenues as recently as 2010   TNGO s declining margins and slowing revenue growth projections support the thesis that its competitive position is eroding  The company s options at this point are to accept lower profits or raise money through another round of debt or equity financing in order to fund new acquisitions  Neither option should be enticing for current shareholders   Valuation The end result of this run up in the stock price is that TNGO is seriously overvalued  Its current valuation of   25 share implies that the company will grow NOPAT by 32  compounded annually for 15 years  The market appears to be extrapolating a couple years of acquisition fueled growth out for the next decade and a half   TNGO operates in a fragmented and competitive market place  Unless it somehow gains a dominant market share  which Figure 1 suggests is highly unlikely   I don t see a way it can live up to those growth expectations  A complete implosion like the executive s past company seems like a more likely scenario   Avoid These Funds Investors should avoid these ten mutual funds due to their 2  percent allocation to TNGO and Dangerous or Worse ratings   Sam McBride contributed to this article  Disclosure  David Trainer and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock

 By David Brett 
 LONDON  July 16  Reuters    Upbeat results from JP Morgan
boosted banks  lifting Britain s top share index into positive
territory for a fourth session in mid session trade on Thursday 
 The index was trading in slightly negative territory in
early trade but the JP Morgan results lifted the FTSE 100 index
0 2 percent  or 8 53 points  to 4 354 99 by 1110 GMT  
 The index closed at a four week high on Wednesday  and is
set for its best weekly performance in two months 
   JP Morgan results  have given a shot in the arm to the
markets   said Richard Hunter  head of equities at Hargreaves
Lansdown  
  It s too early to call the earnings season a success  but
the early signs are positive as evidenced by a shift to risk
taking on both sides of the pond  
 Banks were the biggest driver of gains  continuing the bull
run from the last couple of sessions following the results from
JP Morgan  
 HSBC  Barclays and Standard Chartered added between 0 6 and
1 7 percent  
 Among other financials  Schroders climbed 2 7 percent  after
Citigroup raised the fund firm to  buy  from  sell   
 The U S  will continue to be the main focus on Thursday as
second quarter earnings season continues with Google and IBM
both due to report later in the session 
 
 DEMAND SOGGY
 However  the overall outlook for the global economy was
still looking difficult with a soggy demand outlook dragging
metals and crude prices lower  putting pressure on miners and
energy stocks 
 Mining firms took the most points off the index  Anglo
American  BHP Billiton  Kazakhmys and Rio Tinto lost between 0 3
and 2 3 percent  
 Oil stocks retreated following Wednesday s rally as crude
again softened back below the  61 a barrel a mark 
 Energy firms Tullow Oil  Cairn Energy  Royal Dutch Shell  BP
 and BG Group fell between 0 3 and 2 3 percent 
 However  Petrofac moved 4 7 percent higher to lead the FTSE
risers  after the company said its Petrofac Emirates unit  in
partnership with GS E C  was awarded a  2 1 billion Abu Dhabi
integrated gas development contract 
 UK software firm Autonomy was the biggest faller on the
index  down 8 6 percent  as analysts said although the firm
reported second quarter revenue which was in line with
expectations  it missed a number of top end estimates  and the
market expected more from its outlook 
 Risk appetite  while slightly improved  was still fragile
leading investors to move into defensive pharmaceutical and
tobacco stocks 
 AstraZeneca and Shire added 1 1 and 1 percent  respectively 
while British American Tobacco gained 1 percent and Imperial
Tobacco was up 1 2 percent  
 On the economic front  China s growth rate shot up in the
second quarter on the back of a surge in state spending and bank
lending  boosting hopes the biggest emerging economy will lead
the way out of the worst global downturn since the 1930s   
 As well as the corporate newsflow  further U S  economic
data is expected later

 NEW YORK  July 16  Reuters    U S  stocks rallied for a
fourth day on Thursday after JPMorgan s robust results added
to growing optimism about the quarterly earnings season and
technology shares rose in anticipation of more good news 
 Gains in International Business Machines Corp helped the
market shake off its earlier malaise  The broad S P 500
extended the week s gains to tally its best four days since
March as stocks recovered from 12 year lows 
 IBM rose 3 2 percent to  110 64 and provided the Dow s
biggest boost during the regular session  The stock climbed
2 9 percent in extended trade after it released its quarterly
results 
  As the market rallies  implicit in that is the
expectation that we ll continue to see a recovery in corporate
profits   said Dean Curnutt  president of Macro Risk Advisors
in New York 
 JPMorgan Chase   Co continued the week s streak of
positive results  posting a strong quarterly profit  but
warning of deteriorating consumer credit  The bank s stock was
kept under water for most of the day  edging down 0 4 percent
to  36 13 on the New York Stock Exchange 
 Much better than expected results from Goldman Sachs and
Intel set the tone early in the week amid expectations of a
lousy second quarter marked by falling revenues and cost
cuts 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 95 61 points  or
1 11 percent  to 8 711 82  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
gained 8 06 points  or 0 86 percent  to 940 74  The Nasdaq
Composite Index  advanced 22 13 points  or 1 19 percent  to
1 885 03 
 Comments from leading economist Nouriel Roubini further
boosted sentiment after he said the worst is past in terms of
economic and financial conditions 
 Shares of Qualcomm Inc lifted the Nasdaq after RBC Capital
Markets started coverage of the cellphone chip supplier with
an  outperform  rating  Qualcomm gained 1 4 percent to
 46 72 
 Google recovered from earlier losses to gain 1 percent to
 442 60 on Nasdaq  but the stock fell 2 4 percent in extended
trade shortly after its quarterly results came out 
 On the economic front  government data showed the number
of U S  workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell
last week to their lowest level since January  but the
seasonally adjusted data was amplified by earlier auto
industry plant shutdowns 
 A separate report showed showed factory activity in the
U S  Mid Atlantic region shrank for the 10th consecutive month
in July  a worse than expected decline that raised questions
about the speed of the economic recovery

The Markets Stocks surged higher on Wednesday as news emerged that Senate leaders reached a deal to end the government shutdown and raise the debt limit  avoiding a default at least until the next debt ceiling deadline on February 7th  The NASDAQ Composite and the Russell 2000 pushed to new multi year highs on the news while the S P 500 inched closer to resistance presented at the all time high of 1729  the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains the odd man out  remaining well off of the previous high as the benchmark attempts to regain lost ground  Struggles for the Dow may continue into Thursday s session following earnings from the second largest constituent of the benchmark  IBM  which reported results after the closing bell that failed to impress investors  The company reported earnings of  3 99 per share  above the  3 96 per share estimate  However  a top line miss sent shares lower in the after hours as the company reported revenues of  23 7B  off of the  24 74B expectation  The stock traded lower by over 6  after the release  pulling down the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF  DIA  by almost a third of a percent  Shares of IBM enter a period of seasonal strength at the end of October  trading higher through to the end of the period of seasonal strength for Technology in January  The stock has been trending lower since peaking in March of this year and the implied open at  175  based on after hours trading  would break significant support around  182  The 200 day moving average of this stock looks poised to turn lower for the first time since emerging from the 2008 2009 recession  suggesting ongoing pressures for the stock may continue over the long term  
With Wednesday s gain  the S P 500 is pushing closer to resistance presented by the all time high at 1729  Short term momentum indicators are overbought following the substantial surge higher in anticipation of a debt deal in the US  Trendline resistance for many benchmarks is directly overhead  Rising wedge patterns are still in play as long as these levels of resistance hold  which implies that a bearish scenario is not off of the table just yet

177359,398875,IBM,GLOBAL MARKETS Rally stalls as caution builds ahead of results,news,"By Sujata Rao
 LONDON  July 16  Reuters    World stocks hovered around flat
on Thursday despite strong Chinese growth data that provided
reassurance on the global economy for investors bracing for the
spate of U S  and European corporate results due this week 
 As the mood turned cautious  the yen and the dollar rose and
U S  Treasuries ticked higher  while oil prices were steady
around  61 a barrel following a 3 percent rise in the previous
session 
 Three days of strong risk appetite this week have pushed up
global equities 5 5 percent and fuelled gains in oil 
commodities and emerging markets while the VIX volatility index
    Wall Street s fear gauge    dropped to levels last seen in
September 2008 
 Better than expected results from companies like Goldman
Sachs and Intel added to investors  optimism over the global
economic recovery this week but with a spate of earnings still
to come    including banking giants JP Morgan and Citigroup and
tech firms IBM and Google    nervousness is building 
 By 0850 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was flat  its performance mirrored by London s FTSE100 
Germany s DAX and France s CAC 40 
  The market needs to see that recovery is there and that
earnings have bottomed   said Bernard McAlinden  investment
strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin  
  So far we are getting indications of a better than expected
second quarter earnings season  although it s very early  
 The mood has faltered slightly after a jump in Asian shares 
Tokyo markets hit a one week high before paring gains while
other Asian shares powered to a month high with a rise of over 1
percent before coming off 
 Markets were buoyed early in the session by China s second
quarter gross domestic product which rose 7 9 percent against
the previous year  beating forecasts for a 7 5 percent rise  
 The world s third largest economy also grew 7 1 percent in
the first half versus a year earlier 
 Coming on top of better than expected U S  data and
corporate results  the news suggested to investors that the
recession is abating  But trepidation about the upcoming results
kept a lid on market gains 
  We re seeing a bit of profit taking in risk assets after a
few days of gains on stock markets   said Elisabeth Andreew 
currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen  
  There is a concern that a lot of the positive news may
already be priced in and also nervousness ahead of some big U S 
companies reporting earnings   she said  adding that currency
markets were taking their cue from equities 
 By 0758 GMT the dollar had fallen 0 5 percent against the
yen to 93 73 yen while the euro was down 0 6 percent to 132 19

 The day s loser was the New Zealand dollar 
 Fitch sent a sobering message to global markets  cutting the
outlook on New Zealand s  AA plus  rating to negative  citing
the country s high debt levels and pushing the NZ dollar down
1 2 percent to  0 6413 
  This was a bit of a surprise  It may refocus attention on
concerns about sovereign risk that had been receding for a
while   said Masafumi Yamamoto  head of FX strategy Japan at
Royal Bank of Scotland  referring to sovereign ratings in
general 
 Markets are also keeping a wary eye on the fate of CIT Group
Inc  a U S  lender to thousands of small and mid sized
businesses  after bailout talks with the government ended  a
move that could drive it to bankruptcy 
 U S  Treasuries benefitted from the renewed demand for less
risky assets  with 10 year yields at 3 5747 percent  down nearly
four basis points from U S  trade but up from a two month low of
3 26 percent hit on Monday 
 Corporate results apart  markets are also waiting for weekly
U S  jobless claims to see how the employment picture is shaping
up in the world s biggest economy

177363,398879,IBM,Can The Stock Market Maintain Its High ,opinion,Remember the famous words of Mark Twain   Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority  it s time to pause and reflect   As readers of Profit Confidential know  it was this kind of mentality that lead me to  1  turn bullish on gold in 2001  2  turn negative on housing in 2006  3  turn bearish on stocks in late 2007  and 4  turn bullish on small cap stocks in 2009  when the talking heads on the TV were saying  we are heading lower sell  sell  and sell    Fast forwarding to today  when I look at the key stock indices  I see something similar happening  but the chants I hear now are  buy  buy  and buy even more   It seems the majority consensus is bullish  They believe the key stock indices will continue to march higher  Even the worst case scenarios look overly optimistic  Outright euphoria  Maybe not  but we are getting there From January to August of this year  the key stock indices have significantly increased in value  The S P 500 has increased a little more than 14  in the first eight months of this year  and the performances of other key stock indices have been in a similar range  But historically  since 1970  the S P 500 has risen only about 8 2  per year on average   Source   Past Data   StockCharts com  last accessed September 10  2013   Some argue that the rise we have seen in key stock indices so far this year  we have seen in the past  However  those times were truly different  For example  in 1997  the S P 500 increased 31 6  because our economy was booming that year  U S  gross domestic product  GDP  increased almost 4 5  in 1997   Source  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis web site  last accessed September 10  2013   Today  we have no real economic growth  According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis  BEA   U S  GDP is growing at an annual rate of 2 5  this year  I ve heard some say that the key stock indices are forward looking and investors are pricing in next year s economic growth  Saying the very least  since the end of the financial crisis  we have seen our central bank be very accommodative  Now  the Fed is talking about ending those policies  And interest rates are aggressively rising  The yield on the 10 year U S  Treasury is up 71  from a year ago  The interest rate on the popular 30 year fixed mortgage is approaching five percent  And when looking at corporate earnings of companies in the key stock indices  the most important reason for stock prices to rise or fall   they give me another reason to be skeptical To offset declining earnings  companies are resorting to buying back their stock to boost per share earnings  It s outright  financial engineering  to increase corporate earnings The share buybacks are massive  We are not talking millions  but multi billion dollar share buybacks at a time  Take Halliburton Company  HAL   for example  on July 25 of this year  it said it would buy  3 3 billion worth of its own shares at a price between  42 50 and  48 50   Source  Halliburton Company  July 25  2013   I equate that to 12 6  of its outstanding shares which translates to about the same increase in its per share earnings   Source  Yahoo  Finance  last accessed September 10  2013  Aside from reducing the number of shares they have outstanding  companies in the key stock indices are resorting to cost cutting to show better corporate earnings There s a new trend emerging among public companies  To reduce the healthcare costs of retirees  companies in key stock indices are moving them to  health insurance exchanges   where they have to create their own plans  This way  companies save on administrative costs  Famous names in the key stock indices that are taking this step include Time Warner Inc   TWX   International Business Machines Corporation  IBM   Sears Holdings Corporation  SHLD   and Darden Restaurants  Inc   DRI    Source  Wall Street Journal  September 8  2013  For the key stock indices to go higher  companies need to be increasing revenues and earnings the old fashioned way not by financially engineering the growth   Tricks  to boost earnings can only go on for so long A stock market rally is justified when you hear that companies in the key stock indices are experiencing rising sales and earnings  when they are spending the cash they are hoarding to invest in their business expansion  None of that is happening right now With the back drop of the Fed s pulling back on paper money printing  interest rates rising  economic growth weakening  and global demand softening  the risks in the stock market are high  Investors should be cautious What He Said  Over built  over speculated  over financed and over done  This is the Florida real estate market right now  For those looking to buy for personal use or investment  hold off  The best deals are yet to come  I continue with my prediction that the hard landing in the U S  housing market  which is now affecting lenders  will have significant negative effects on the U S  economy   Michael Lombardi in Profit Confidential  April 3  2007  Michael started talking about and predicting the financial catastrophe we started

177364,398880,IBM,Converting Reported Assets Into Invested Capital ,opinion,This report is one of a series on the adjustments we make to convert GAAP data to economic earnings  This report focuses on an adjustment we make to convert the reported balance sheet assets into invested capital  Reported assets don t tell the whole story of the capital invested in a business   provide numerous loopholes that companies can exploit to hide balance sheet issues and obscure the true amount of capital invested in a business  Converting GAAP data into economic earnings should be part of every investor s diligence process  Performing detailed analysis of footnotes and the MD A is part of fulfilling fiduciary responsibilities  We ve performed unrivalled due diligence on 5 500 10 Ks every year for the past decade  Unconsolidated subsidiaries are companies in which the parent company has significant control  usually owning between 20  50  of the business  Unconsolidated subsidiaries are accounted for using the   Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries represent an investment of resources from the parent company  and investors therefore have the right to demand a return on that capital  However  there are situations where poor disclosure forces us to treat unconsolidated subsidiary assets as non operating and remove them from invested capital  Sometimes  companies bundle their unconsolidated subsidiary income into a non operating line item  In those cases  we are forced to treat unconsolidated subsidiaries as non operating to ensure consistent treatment of the asset and the income  If we did not make this adjustment  we would be holding companies accountable for unconsolidated subsidiary assets without measuring the income from those assets in our calculation of ROIC  For instance  IBM  IBM  had  120 million in assets accounted for under the equity method  IBM bundles the income from these unconsolidated subsidiaries into  other income   so we have no way of knowing the amount of money IBM made from their equity method investments  Since all  other income  is treated as non operating  we must treat the unconsolidated assets as non operating so that the asset and income are treated the same  Without this adjustment  return on invested capital  I  is distorted by accounting for assets but not income  Figure 1 shows the five companies with the largest unconsolidated subsidiary adjustments to invested capital in 2012 and the five companies with the largest unconsolidated subsidiary adjustments as a percent of total assets Figure 1  Companies With the Largest Unconsolidated Subsidiary Adjustment in 2012 Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings The companies in Figure 1 are far from the only companies affected by non operating unconsolidated subsidiaries  We found 40 companies with  2 6 billion in adjustments for 2012 and 726 companies with  77 8 billion in adjustments over the history of our coverage  As Figure 1 shows  unconsolidated subsidiary assets do not have as big an impact on invested capital as some of our other adjustments  However  adjusting for unconsolidated subsidiaries is still an important step in calculating a company s true ROIC  For example  CSX Corporation  CSX  has over  511 million worth of investments in various subsidiaries but no disclosure of the income earned from these subsidiaries  Therefore  we must treat the subsidiary assets as non operating so that the asset and the income from that asset have the same treatment  The resulting adjustment only impacts ROIC by four tenths of a percentage point  Still  the important points is that we make this adjustment and all others to ensure we deliver the best ROIC in the industry  There are many instances where the impact of this adjustment is much larger  and there is always the potential of the impact being large for any given company in the future  Better to be diligent and cover this analytical base than to pretend or hope it is not material  Investors who ignore the impact of unconsolidated subsidiaries on invested capital are holding companies accountable for earning returns on assets to which they don t have earnings information on  By adjusting invested capital for unconsolidated subsidiaries  one can get a better picture of the value that management is creating for shareholders  Diligence pays  Sam McBride contributed to this report  Disclosure  David Trainer and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock  sector  or theme ,2013-09-20,David Trainer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/converting-reported-assets-into-invested-capital-184546,184546
177365,398881,IBM,Dividend Contenders With Over 20  Return on Equity ,opinion,A solid investment also delivers solid returns over the time  Dividend growth is not the only criteria for a good investment  There are also many dividend growth stocks with low or negative returns on investments and on equity ratios   I screened the Dividend Contenders Database by stocks with high return ratios  I fixed the 20 percent level in order to get the best results   Only 15 companies fulfilled both  a return on equity as well as a return on investment over 20 percent  The difference between those two ratios is that the return on investment does not include the leverage effect  A corporate with high debts will automatically generate high returns on equity  The second ratio is a performance measure that looks only at the investment by dividing the investment return by the costs of the investment   One High Yield is below the results and 10 stocks got a buy or better rating by brokerage firms

177366,398882,IBM,IBM  Road Map To Reasonable Valuation ,opinion,"International Business Machines Corporation  IBM  likely isn t flying under anyone s radar  From its humble beginnings as the Computing Tabulating Recording Company in the early 20th century  this Armonk  New York based mega technology corporation has grown to a  in the world  But even without that tidbit of information  you ve surely heard about the company  Perhaps two of the most well respected value investors   Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch   have commented specifically on this company  Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  shares or about 5 5  of the company in 2011 stating the following   I was late to the IBM party  I have been reading the company s annual report for more than 50 years  but it wasn t until a Saturday in March last year that my thinking crystallized   In an interview  he went on to describe that in his early entrepreneurial days he competed against IBM products only to be told that  nobody ever got fired for going with IBM   In Peter Lynch s book  One Up On Wall Street  he describes the a similar ideology on the ownership side   There s an unwritten rule on Wall Street   You ll never lose your job losing your client s money in IBM   So if   according to Buffett s and Lynch s experiences   you can t really go wrong with either being a customer or an owner of IBM  then it seems like a company in which one might find interest  Granted these two sentiments were separated by two decades  but each seems to be as relatively true today as it was at the time they made their remarks  IBM operates in 5 business segments  but really it comes down to three basic components  Hardware  Services and Software  In 2000 these parts made up roughly 35   38  and 27  of profits respectively   Note  Financing has been a small part of the overall business but is included with Hardware  As of the  these numbers have moved to 14   41  and 45  respectively  In other words  there has been a migration out of Hardware and into Services and Software  Notably  the company indicated that roughly half of its profits are expected to come from Software by 2015  In addition  IBM has consistently reiterated its Road Map objective of  20 in operating earnings per share by 2015  which appears quite achievable given its revenue growth and prolific  which has decreased outstanding shares by roughly 40  over the last 15 years  Morningstar s Grady Burkett sums IBM up nicely indicating 

While each of  IBM s  businesses is an industry leader in its own right  the combination of these products and services provides the firm with an unrivaled solution  creation and delivery ability that is the key to its wide economic moat 

Specifically  he goes on to indicate that while mainframes still remain as an advantage for IBM  the company has shown its ability to innovate and diversify towards more profitable business technologies  Risks include a move away from hardware  varied cloud computing substitutes and potentially cheaper alternatives from rivals like Oracle  ORCL   Especially telling of IBM s entrenched technology and ability to continuously innovate is their enormous amount of patents  In 2012 alone the company  and kept its two decade streak of most patents by any company in the world  In turn  shareholders have been continually rewarded via share buybacks and increased payouts  15 Years of Growth  International Business Machines Corp has grown earnings  orange line  at a compound rate of 11 3  since 1999  resulting in a  209  billion dollar market cap  In addition  IBM earnings have risen from  3 84 per share in 1999  to today s forecasted earnings per share of approximately  16 90 for 2013  Further  IBM has been particularly consistent by not only paying but also increasing its dividend  pink line  for the last 18 years  Especially noteworthy is the 16  average annual growth rate of this payout for the last decade and a half  For a look at how the market has historically valued IBM  see the relationship between the price  black line  and earnings of the company as seen on the  below Here we see that IBM s market price previously began to deviate from its justified earnings growth  starting to become overvalued in 1999 and coming back to fair value around 2002  Today  IBM appears undervalued in relation to both its historical earnings and relative valuation In tandem with the strong earnings growth  IBM shareholders have enjoyed a compound annual return of 5 9   note that this does not correlate closely with the 11 3  growth rate in earnings per share due to overvaluation at the beginning of the period  Still  a hypothetical  10 000 investment in IBM on 12 31 1998 would have grown to a total value of  23 138 82  without reinvesting dividends  Said differently  IBM shareholders have enjoyed total returns that were roughly 1 4 times the value that would have been achieved by investing in the S P 500 over the same time period But of course   as the saying goes   past performance does not guarantee future results  Thus while a strong operating history provides a fundamental platform for evaluating a company  it does not by itself indicate a buy or sell decision  Instead an investor must have an understanding of the past while simultaneously thinking the investment through to its logical  if not understated  conclusion In the opening paragraphs we alluded to a variety of potential opportunities for growth  It follows that the probabilities of these outcomes should be the guide for one s investment focus  Yet it is still useful to determine whether or not your predictions seem reasonable  27 leading analysts reporting to S P Capital IQ come to a consensus 5 year annual estimated return grow rate for IBM of 10 1   In addition  IBM is currently trading at a P E of 11 8  which is at the low end of the  value corridor   defined by the orange lines   If the earnings materialize as forecast  IBM s valuation would be  404 90 at the end of 2018  which would be a 16 9  annualized rate of return including dividends  A graphical representation of this calculation can be seen in the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator seen below  Now it s paramount to remember that this is simply a calculator  Specifically  the estimated total return is a default based on the consensus of the analysts following the stock  The consensus includes the long term growth rate along with specific earnings estimates for the next two upcoming years  Further  the dividend payout ratio is presumed to stay the same and grow with earnings  Taken collectively  this graph provides a very strong baseline for how analysts are presently viewing this company  However  a F A S T  Graphs  subscriber is also able to change these estimates to fit their own thesis or scenario analysis Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in IBM to an equal investment in a 10 year treasury bond  illustrates that IBM s expected earnings would be 4 8 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest  This comparison can be seen in the 10 year Earnings Yield Estimate table below  Finally  it s important to underscore the idea that all companies derive their underlying value from the cash flows  earnings  that they are capable of generating for their owners  Therefore  it should be the expectation of a prudent investor that   in the long run   the likely future earnings of a company justify the price you pay  Fundamentally  this means appropriately addressing these two questions   in what should I invest   and  at what time   In viewing the past history and future prospects of IBM we have learned that it appears to be a strong company with solid upcoming opportunities  However  as always  we

177367,398883,IBM,Obamacare   An Unintended Consequence    ,opinion,Obamacare officially kicks off in nine days  What the heck is going to happen  I don t believe that anyone really knows I m concerned that there will be many  unintended  consequences  Information has being coming out in recent days about how much Obamacare is going to cost individuals  As near as I can determine  the cost of Obamacare is going to be substantially lower than what it was thought to be  The liberal press has been having a field day over these cost estimates  Yesterday Obama and Clinton were on TV touting how cheap the new insurance will be  Obama made the point that the cost of health insurance for younger people will be less than a cell phone bill The Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  released its Obamacare cost estimates this week   If these numbers are what we end up getting across the country  then there is proof that the cost of health care insurance is going down  The HHS report has numbers for different ages and family size  and by city and state  The following are the state by state averages Okay  this all sounds good  but what about the unintended consequences   Consider  from the CBO that estimated the consequences of Obamacare  Look at the line  Employer  and note that the CBO has forecast zero change in 2014 for the number of individuals who now have private insurance who will be forced onto the exchanges That line decreases by 2m in 2015  The working assumption is that Obamacare will have a negligible consequence on those individuals who now have private insurance  But we know for a fact that the CBO estimates are dead wrong  Obamacare has not even started  and these four companies have announced that they will be forcing some of their workers to get Obamacare I think the number of workers that will be forced into Obamacare is going to soar over the next few years  The economics will force this to happen  Look again at the pricing structure from HHS  Then check to see how much you are paying for health insurance  and how much your employer is kicking in  If the total of the contributions  self and employer  is greater than the Obamacare cost  then you are in trouble  Many employers are going to follow the lead set by IBM  Walgreen  UPS and Home Depot  They will compensate employees for the cost of Obamacare  and pocket the difference  An additional incentive is that for employers  large and small   it reduces eliminates the overhead and problems of company sponsored insurance plans  What if Obamacare results in substantial forced  outsourcing  of health insurance  The CBO estimates are way off the mark  but by how much  What happens if the forced migration over the first few years of Obamacare is 20 million  versus the forecast of only 2m  If this is to be the result  then some will call it a great success  This outcome would move the country much closer to the  single payer  system that many liberals believe should happen  But what about those who are forced into Obamacare  What about the promise by Obama that in his  plan  anyone who now has private insurance  could keep it  I do not have answers to how this will play out  I m comfortable saying  1  the migration from private insurance to Obamacare is going to be much larger than has been estimated  and  2  large groups of folks will get burnt in the process  A question for readers  Are there any muni workers reading  A cop fireman  town clerk or teacher  Can you share some of the info on what you and your employer s monthly Ins  cost is  Compare that cost to the estimates for Obamacare in your area   Would your muni save money if it moved you to an exchange  If the answer is  yes  then muni workers are going to be in for a rude awakening  There is not a muni in the country that is not desperate to cut the health care costs it provides for its workers  Anyone who now has private insurance that is forced onto the insurance exchanges is going to be unhappy  Based on what has happened so far  it appears that the negative consequences of the forced migration is being felt largely by the Democratic base  This unintended consequence of Obamacare may prove to be the  wild card  that swings the Bi and Presidential elections  It s possible that the liberal s ultimate objective of achieving a single payer system  might well prove to be their undoing  That would be a very interesting unintended consequence ,2013-09-26,Bruce Krasting,https://www.investing.com/analysis/obamacare-–-an-unintended-consequence-185331,185331
177369,398885,IBM,Wave Of The Future Investment From The Ground Up,opinion,An increasingly high tech world is on the horizon  but technological revolution can t take place without the right materials  especially graphite and platinum group metals  This is where mining  one of the oldest industries in human history  comes in  In this interview with The Metals Report  Byron King  editor of the Energy   Scarcity Investor and Outstanding Investments newsletters  profiles companies poised to deliver graphite and platinum group metals to tech companies working to change the way we communicate  travel and harness energy   The Metals Report  Byron  you recently visited Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California  What did you see there that could affect our lives in the next decade   Byron King  The focus of my visit was a massive physics experimental project known as the National Ignition Facility  or NIF  It uses laser beams to simulate the effects of almost incomprehensibly powerful phenomena like the inside of a star or the inside of a nuclear explosion   NIF is a gigantic facility almost as big as an aircraft carrier  It s a huge building filled with laser beam systems that focus intense energy on tiny spots inside a 30 foot diameter target chamber  Essentially  the NIF lasers create hydrogen fusion  a sort of tiny hydrogen bomb  Scientists can use it to simulate fundamental physics issues down to the star like levels of pressure and temperature on protons  neutrons and electrons in the nucleus of an atom  One of the key government purposes  if you will  is to calibrate instrumentation that tests nuclear weapons without actually setting them off  Projects at NIF push the envelope of our understanding of atomic physics  This has the potential to change our lives in ways that we can t even begin to understand  It s wide open   Sitting here talking with you during the current government shutdown  it s easy to criticize government for being too big  too expensive  etc  But this kind of big science like we see at NIF can only be done through a dedicated  long term  national government effort  In terms of pushing the fundamentals frontiers of human knowledge  I think it s worth the money we put into it   TMR  It sounds like NIF could impact technology and energy in many ways  You call graphite the next industrial revolution  Why graphite  and why now   BK  For most of human history  people have only used a very few materials  cellulose in the form of wood  cotton or other fibers  and metals like bronze  copper  lead and steel  Aluminum only came into widespread use in the early 20th century   Since the end of World War II and the space race of the 1960s  we are using a larger variety of materials in our daily lives  Today  cell phones  TVs  even light bulbs are filled with all sorts of exotic materials   I think the next big leap for fundamental material science will be in the field of carbon  This takes us immediately to graphite and what are called allotropes of carbon  such as graphite nanotubes and graphene   One of the primary carbon raw materials will be a naturally occurring form called graphite  Humankind already uses lots of graphite  Consider what s called amorphous carbon  which you ll find in all manner of things brake pads and pencils  for example  Flake graphite is a higher end form of carbon  it comes in different grades  Small flake graphite is only somewhat better than the amorphous stuff  with many of the same applications like brake pads and such  Large flake graphite is critical to many modern applications  Examples include advanced storage batteries and the heat conducting foil that dissipates the heat from your smartphone so you can hold it in your hand without getting burned   We re barely into the early innings of the materials revolution using advanced forms of graphite   TMR  Different types of graphite come with their own challenges  What are some of the differences among crystalline  amorphous  lump and vein graphite when it comes to mining it and processing it   BK  People have been mining and using graphite for centuries  The root of the name is the Greek word graphein  which means to write  Someone in the ancient past figured out how to use this interesting mineral to make marks on a parchment   But let s dwell on today  and not ancient Greece  People mine graphite all over the place these days  with China being a key world supplier  Gee  where have we heard that before  eh   Unlike with  say  rare earths  mining and processing graphite isn t super technically advanced  With graphite mining  as with everything  you have what you have and not what you might wish you had  If you have really high quality  large flake graphite  it makes it easier to mine but you have to be careful at the mouth of the mine not to crush the material too hard  If you handle it the wrong way  you ll destroy the very properties that you re seeking  you ll destroy the crystalline aspects that might make it most useful   Natural graphite deposits differ from one locale to another  Mineralogical research seems to be showing that the deeper and the hotter the burial and the temperature at which the graphite forms  the better the crystallinity  and the more suitable it is for high value end products   Another angle is that the users the firms that make batteries  electrical components or electrodes all have their own secret chemistry for putting the graphite and other additives together into a component  It s very important for a mining player to work with the downstream users early on  That s what will make a project succeed  It s forming partnerships up front  with the downstream users   TMR  You mentioned the importance of flake size  How much of a price difference can a company demand for large flake graphite   BK  Graphite has experienced big price swings in the last five years  A  500 600 ton price for lower quality material is just about the cost of production  Higher quality material ranges from  1 500 2 000 ton  There has been very exotic  one off  super high quality material that sold for 10 times that  although not just any company can build a mining model using a  20 000 ton price  which is exceptional   TMR  What do you use as a standard price   BK  To be very conservative  I look at numbers in the  1 250 1 500 ton range for really good  high quality material at the 99 9  level   I see rapid demand growth for material at that level  for use in batteries and foils and innovative uses in fire insulation and heat resistance   Graftech International Holdings Inc   GTI  is an intriguing story  It makes carbon electrodes for steel mills  graphite foils for companies that make things like the iPad  GrafTech uses engineered graphite for fire proofing in a way that when fire gets to the graphite coating  the graphite will expand and form a char which insulates the substrate  That keeps the substrate from burning or if it s a metal  it keeps it from melting  If you can crack the building codes of the world and get a material like that approved as a fire insulator  you would have a multibillion dollar market for graphite right there  It s a midstream or downstream user  a technology application  It buys its material from mines and material brokers who deal with miners   TMR  As demand and use for things like insulation develops  when do you expect the graphite price to rise   BK  Graphite prices  as well as many other metals  have had a tough 18 24 months  but I think we ve found a bottom  I expect graphite prices to hold their own  if not increase in a gentle way  There is a market for good quality material   In the graphite world  it s interesting to note that we haven t seen a new mine open up outside of China in the last 25 years  There are precious few mine building graphite plays out there  Many of the working mines are getting long in the tooth  It s time for mid  and downstream users to take a hard look at the life of those mines  how much reserve is left and where things can go from here   TMR  What companies could fill the demand for graphite  and what type of graphite does each project have   BK  Focus Graphite Inc   FMS  has a very high grade deposit in Lac Knife  Qu bec  on the border with Labrador  near Fermont  This graphite play was discovered several decades ago by miners looking for iron or gold  Focus has done a lot of drilling and defining the graphite ore body   Focus is still developing its mine and processing capabilities  but management has built the company into more of a technology play on graphite  The company invested heavily in developing applications for graphite that involve other forms of carbon  such as graphene and nanotubes  Focus wants to create a branded  high spec  high tech product it can sell to downstream users looking for the high end stuff   If you want a down to earth company so to speak that s more of a traditional graphite miner  take a look at Energizer Resources Inc   ENZR   Its deposit is on the island of Madagascar  The deposit is so extensive that you can see it from space on satellite photographs  It originated deep underground and was heated to high temperatures 400 million  400M  years ago  Now it s all large flake graphite and I mean beautiful mineralogy  exposed at the surface   When I visited  we drove for miles across the scrub of southern Madagascar  The tires kicked up graphite dust  You could do geologic mapping by looking at the termite mounds  The gray mounds were graphite  the brown ones weren t  It s very mineable  In terms of strip ratio  there s virtually no waste   Energizer has put together plans for a mining and processing facility  logistics  transport and shipping  The company recently hired two well known mine builders  The company has had successful bench scale testing and is building a pilot plant to demonstrate the processing capabilities of the material  The next step is to get together with mid  and downstream users  to understand their needs  Madagascar is far away if you look at the map from North America  but it s also that much closer to major markets in India and East Asia  Plus  Madagascar has a stable government and is relatively mining friendly  Rio Tinto   RIO  and Sherritt International Corp   SHERF  have operations there   TMR  Energizer s new CEO and board are talking to potential offtake partners for its Molo graphite project  Is an offtake deal the next expected catalyst   BK  The next announcement will probably be about the pilot project  probably around the end of November  A deal with offtake users is the next logical step in the company s development   Considering the size of the deposit  the quality of the material  the lead time involved in making the arrangements and commitments on something this big  there isn t a lot of time for any grass to grow beneath anybody s feet   Focus and Energizer are two of the most advanced  most attractive graphite mining plays in terms of their ability to deliver product to an end user that can then add more value to it   TMR  Some people are saying that synthetic graphene might be more practical than graphene made from graphite  How much demand could be created and how quickly by some of these innovative  but still not very commercial  products being discussed   BK  Graphene and nanotubes are already finding their way into very high end  high spec  high tech applications  At the NIF  for example  the little targets that they shoot the laser beam at are made of diamond  The laser scientists are thinking about replacing the diamond with nanotubes  That s a truly exotic application  but it tells you that these materials are finding their ways into the most interesting places   There are many very aggressive R D projects out there for the use of graphene in things like touch screens on personal digital devices  One of the largest patent holders on graphene applications is IBM Corp  The fact that IBM holds a very large patent portfolio on graphene ought to make you feel warmer and fuzzier about this whole arena   I think we will see nanotube  graphene and other carbon allotropes coming from both ends  It s like you re building a brick wall held together by mortar  The brick would be the nanotubes or the graphene that comes from the natural graphite  The bonding or  healing  process would be with a process called chemical vapor deposition  CVD   which is like the mortar that holds bricks together   Right now  graphene and nanotubes can be manufactured using CVD  This is a well known technique used in the computer chip fabrication industry  One example is CVD Equipment Corp   CVV  of Long Island  New York  which makes very high end fabrication equipment for CVD applications  The CVD customer list is a who s who of scientific research organizations  I mean research universities  national laboratories like Oak Ridge and Livermore  big industrial corporations like IBM  Pratt   Whitney  Advanced Micro Devices  AMD  and KLA Tencor Corporation  KLAC    CVD makes equipment that deposits graphene and nanotubes on a substrate  This gets us closer to mass production of a very complex  nano scale product with unbelievably high tolerances  Mass production drives down the unit cost  which means you can start to put this nanotube or graphene material into more applications  It s important to devise a way to produce larger amounts of high quality material at a predictable cost  so designers can create items that use these materials   TMR  What other companies could supply some of this graphite   BK  In terms of minerals in the ground  we have to mention Zenyatta Ventures Ltd   ZEN   which has had a remarkable share price run in the last year or so  The company drilled up a couple of geophysical anomalies and found a remarkable graphite based material that appears to be quite a scientific curiosity  While the stock has had a great price run  this remains a very early stage idea with a lot of development work left to do   Mason Graphite Inc   LLG  has the Lac Gu ret deposit in Qu bec  a discovery of fairly recent vintage  It was discovered as a graphite deposit  unrelated to any gold or iron exploration  The grade of the ore appears to be even better then Focus  project  Where Mason can go with this is wide open  but the company definitely has the right materials to start with  It s possible that the high grade could lead to much higher purities and higher prices  That would benefit the bottom line  because it would allow the company to sell high end product out of the mill  and capture premium pricing sooner in the value chain   TMR  Let s shift over to platinum and palladium  Is the ongoing strike at Anglo American   AAL  in South Africa making projects outside of Africa more viable   BK  Anything that diminishes the South African supply of platinum and palladium is generally good for pricing around the world  although it does make supply more problematic   September and October tends to be a season for strikes in South Africa  Last year  strikes got very violent and people died  That was very bad for South Africa s political risk profile  This year we ve seen strikes  but the overall climate hasn t been as violent  Anything that affects the labor climate and the output from any of the major South African platinum mines will affect world supply   One key point to keep in mind is that we re still dealing with the effects of the unending recession  We ve got the China slowdown  the Japan doldrums  the Eurozone issues  the slowdown in other developing nations like Brazil and of course the issues in the U S   On the positive side  at least in a global sense  the automobile industry is doing very well  North American auto sales are up to nearly the pre crash levels of five years ago  People are buying big cars  SUVs and pickup trucks are rolling off the lines as fast as the makers can build them  Every one of those vehicles has a catalytic converter installed on its engine exhaust system  The rebound in auto sales has to feed back to the demand for platinum and palladium for those catalytic converters  If the European automobile market ever starts to recover  it could be another real kicker for platinum and palladium prices   TMR  Are there any projects outside of Africa that could fill that demand   BK  There are only a couple of small players outside of Africa   I like the management and early stage work being done by Prophecy Platinum Corp   NKL V   It has an intriguing project up in the Yukon north of Skagway  Alaska  which would be the company s shipping port   We won t see a mine there for several years  Meanwhile  management is doing good work revitalizing an old platinum play that operated in the 1970s and  80s  It closed for several reasons  but lack of ore was not one of them   Yukon is a mining friendly jurisdiction  and because the Prophecy mining claims are in the rain and snow shadow of the Chugach mountain range of Alaska  it gets relatively little snowfall  It could operate year round  You move the product across the border to the U S  and export out of Alaska  The company has good geology and good management  It s all very doable   TMR  That s one to watch  Any others   BK  Platinum Group Metals Ltd    PTM   a South African play  has made great progress  The deposit is in a sweet spot of the old Bushveld complex  where the company has discovered entire new zones to the degree that the geology books on the Bushveld almost need to be rewritten  The company is finishing up a brand new mine  scheduled to start producing ore in 2014  Platinum Group Metals will deliver ore with excellent grades from a brand new mine with all modern safety equipment and production technology   TMR  Should all of that help with the labor issues   BK  I think the company has its labor issues under control  It doesn t have any legacy issues of mine pit alumni or government meddling  It s new   TMR  Last time you talked about recycling  Does that remain a viable option for meeting demand   BK  Oh  yes  Recycling  in particular recycling catalytic converters  is an important option  I ve mentioned Pro Or Inc   POI  before  Its pilot plant has been up and running in Quebec for eight or nine months with excellent output  It seems to have a very workable chemical process  with astonishing yields and a cost curve to make grizzly old miners weep  Pro Or is now raising funds to build more  similar reactors to improve the technology and the process   In the U S  and Canada  12M or more catalytic converters are scrapped every year  Right now almost all of them are exported to Japan or South Africa  and we buy them back at full price on the showroom floor  Pro Or offers a technological option that allows that recycling value chain to occur here in North America  The materials would stay in the North American market and we could keep that added value inside the U S  and Canadian economies   TMR  When could that new plant be operational   BK  Depending on the fundraising  it could be operational in 2014  The people who run Pro Or could crank these reactors out pretty fast if the tech took hold   TMR  What will the world look like twenty  thirty years from now  What commodities will be critical  And what can we invest in that will make the world a better place for the long term   BK  We re going to see absolute transformations in energy use and energy efficiency  No  we ll never defeat the laws of thermodynamics  but it will take less and less energy to do many of the things that we already take for granted today  Energy conversion levels will be much higher  Prices will fall for the technology  and it ll become more and more available to a mass market   Materials will change  including the strength of materials  We will still use cars  but they will be stronger and more lightweight  Actually  in the future  I think the cars will be driving us  Also  the devices we carry around in our hands will get even smaller  Some communications technology might get small enough to be implanted in your skin  People will become walking specimens of technologically enhanced humanity a more pleasant form of the Borg  of Star Trek fame  you might say   Along the way  we have to convince our children and teenagers to study math  science and foreign languages  People who don t understand these subjects will be on the outside of the economy looking in  That is  if you can only do certain basic things  you are destined to be replaced by a robot  If you can work with other people and enhance the technology that s already there  then there s a place for you   That s my happy version of the future  There s plenty of room for apocalyptic thinking as well  Just as technology allows more people to do good things with greater efficiency  it also allows bad people to do more bad things with greater efficiency   TMR  Let s hope that your happy version is the one that plays out  Byron  thanks for your time and insights   Byron King writes for Agora Financial s Daily

177377,398893,IBM,US STOCKS Bleak payrolls report mauls Wall St  volume thin,news,"  June payrolls data fuels worry about recovery
   Broad sell off sinks market  energy  tech  banks wilt
   Dow off 2 6 pct  S P off 2 9 pct  Nasdaq off 2 7 pct
  Adds volume 
 By Ellis Mnyandu
 NEW YORK  July 2  Reuters    U S stocks tumbled on
Thursday  driving the S P 500 down to its third straight
weekly loss  as a steeper than expected slide in June non farm
payrolls revived caution about economic recovery prospects 
 News that U S  employers shed nearly half a million jobs
last month and the unemployment rate jumped to 9 5 percent 
the highest in nearly 26 years  dampened recent hopes that the
recession might be abating 
 Investors pummeled stocks across the board  but energy 
industrials  financials  technology and consumer oriented
shares were among the hardest hit sectors 
 These sectors were at the forefront of the broader
market s recent recovery from the 12 year closing lows of
early March as investors bet that the worst of the economic
slump was over 
 All told  the jobs data served as a reality check and
signaled that any recovery will not be smooth sailing 
analysts said 
  Quite frankly  rising unemployment is bad for the entire
economy   said Sasha Kostadinov  portfolio manager at Shaker
Investments in Cleveland  Ohio   It s not positive for
discretionary stocks  It s not positive for financials   
because there s a direct correlation between the high
unemployment rate and charge offs and delinquent payments  
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 223 32 points  or
2 63 percent  to 8 280 74  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
slid 26 91 points  or 2 91 percent  to 896 42  The Nasdaq
Composite Index sank 49 20 points  or 2 67 percent  to
1 796 52 
 The S P 500 fell for a third straight week  But it s still
up 32 5 percent from the 12 year closing low of March 9 
 For the week  the blue chip Dow average slipped 1 9
percent  while the S P 500 dropped 2 5 percent and the Nasdaq
lost 2 3 percent 
 Light volume due to Wall Street s thinly staffed trading
desks accentuated Thursday s sell off 
 Additionally  the New York Stock Exchange was hit by
connectivity glitches that affected orders originating from
the trading floor  The NYSE extended its regular close from
2000 GMT to 2015 GMT to execute customer orders affected by
system irregularities 
 U S  financial markets will be closed on Friday for the
U S  Independence Day holiday  with July 4th falling on
Saturday this year 
 IBM AND EXXON SLIDE
 On the technology front  shares of International Business
Machines Corp  a technology services giant  tumbled 3 percent
to  101 73  making the stock the Dow s top decliner 
 Apple Inc  another tech bellwether and the maker of the
iPhone  slid 2 percent to  140 02  It was the Nasdaq s worst
drag 
 In the energy sector  Exxon Mobil Corp shed nearly 3
percent to  68 49  while the S P energy index dropped 3 6
percent  U S  front month crude declined  2 58  or 3 7
percent  to settle at  66 73 a barrel 
 NRG Energy Inc shares slumped 4 8 percent to  24 80 after
Exelon Corp raised its hostile takeover bid for the
independent power producer by more than 12 percent to  7 45
billion  ahead of NRG s annual meeting 
 Among consumer oriented stocks  department store operator
Macy s Inc lost 6 3 percent to  11  while the S P retail index
fell 4 percent 
 Housing stocks were not spared  with the Dow Jones U S 
home construction index down 3 percent  The S P 500 s consumer
discretionary sector dropped 3 7 percent 
 In deal news  healthcare giant Johnson   Johnson said it
agreed to pay  1 billion for an 18 4 percent stake in Elan
Corp plc and will buy most rights to the Irish company s
portfolio of experimental drugs to treat Alzheimer s disease 
 Elan s U S  traded shares jumped 8 6 percent to close at
 7 60 on the New York Stock Exchange  while J J s stock  a Dow
component  fell 1 9 percent to  55 98 
 Data showing U S  factory orders were better than expected
in May was overshadowed by the bleak news on the labor
market 
 On the New York Stock Exchange  only about 733 6 million
shares changed hands  way below last year s estimated daily
average of 1 49 billion  while on the Nasdaq  about 1 96
billion shares traded  also below last year s daily average of
2 28 billion 
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by
a ratio of 4 to 1  while on the Nasdaq  about five stocks fell
for every one that rose

177378,398894,IBM,UPDATE 2 Infosys beats Q1 fcast but says environment tough,news,"  Raises lower end of full year forecast in dollar terms
   Sees global environment challenging
   Expects tech spending to recover in mid 2010
   Shares rise 3 0 pct in flat broader market
   Adds stock reaction  CEO  CFO comments 
 By Sumeet Chatterjee
 BANGALORE  July 10  Reuters    Infosys Technologies Ltd
beat forecasts with a 17 percent rise in quarterly profit and
marginally raised its full year estimates  helped by currency
gains but warned of a challenging global environment 
 India s second biggest software services exporter  which
kicks off the sector s results  expects contract prices to drop
further due to pressure from battered clients 
Infosys  rivals Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro also
face competition from big players  IBM  Accenture and
Hewlett Packard who have raided their home turf and are winning
contracts 
  The broad numbers are better than estimates   said Apurva
Shah  head of research at broking firm Prabhudas Lilladher in
Mumbai   The guidance is more a signalling tool indicating the
degree of pessimism or gloom has come down  But it is not yet
back to normal to lift the overall forecast  
 The business environment was turbulent and punctuated by
long decision making cycles and a recovery in technology
spending was likely only by mid 2010  Infosys  Chief Operating
Officer S D  Shibulal said  He expects prices to fall by 5
percent in the year ending March 2010 
 Infosys forecast consolidated revenue to fall 3 1 4 6
percent to  4 45  4 52 billion in the year to March 2010  It
expects earnings to decline 11 1 12 4 percent in dollar terms 
 That compares with its April forecast of earnings to fall
11 1 15 1 percent on a revenue fall of 3 1 6 7 percent 
 Many clients of India s outsourcing sector  which had so
far chalked up impressive rates of growth  are struggling to
stay afloat  have gone bankrupt  or are tackling severe cost
cuts  leaving them little room to boost technology spending

 BANGALORE  July 10  Reuters    Infosys Technologies Ltd
marginally raised its full year forecasts after beating
estimates with a 17 percent rise in quarterly profit  helped by
currency gains but warned of a challenging global environment 
 India s second biggest software services exporter  said
staff strength fell in the last quarter for the first time and
it expects contract prices to drop further due to pressure from
battered clients 
 Its rivals Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro also face
competition from big players such as IBM  Accenture and
Hewlett Packard who have raided their home turf and are winning
contracts 
  The broad numbers are better than estimates   said Apurva
Shah  head of research at broking firm Prabhudas Lilladher in
Mumbai   The guidance is more a signalling tool indicating the
degree of pessimism or gloom has come down  But it is not yet
back to normal to lift the overall forecast  
 The business environment was turbulent and punctuated by
long decision making cycles and a recovery in technology
spending was likely only by mid 2010  Infosys  Chief Operating
Officer S D  Shibulal said  He expects prices to fall by 5
percent in the year ending March 2010 
 Kicking off the sector s results  Infosys forecast
consolidated revenue to fall 3 1 4 6 percent to  4 45  4 52
billion in the full year 
 The company  which counts Goldman Sachs  Philips
Electronics  BT Group Plc among its clients  expects earnings
per share to decline 11 1 12 4 percent in dollar terms  That
compares with its April forecast of earnings to fall 11 1 15 1
percent and revenue to decline 3 1 6 7 percent 
 Nasdaq listed Infosys  which started in 1981 with  250
borrowed from spouses of its seven founders  said its staff
strength fell by 945 in the last quarter to 103 905 
 It was the first drop for the company that had been hiring
employees by the thousands each quarter to keep pace with
rising contracts from clients keen to cut costs 
  I think it is a blip   said Ashok Reddy  managing director
of staffing firm TeamLease   There has been employee
rationalisation to combat the slowdown in the IT sector  But in
the last month and a half recruitment demand has revived  
 Many clients of India s outsourcing sector  which had so
far chalked up impressive rates of growth  are struggling to
stay afloat  have gone bankrupt  or are tackling severe cost
cuts  leaving them little room to boost technology spending 
 Infosys added 27 clients in April June  lower than 37 in
January March and from 49 a year ago  The total tally of
clients fell to 569 from 579 in Jan March 
  We believe that it is too early to say the  global 
economy is better  There are conflicting signals   CEO Kris

177385,398901,IBM,Ben Graham Did Not Give Up On Value Investing  In Theory,opinion,Love the blog  I am an MBA student and obsessed with the value investing philosophy  There are two points that could use clarification  There are so many value investors today  does that mitigate potential rewards  Does value investor competition create less value Towards the end of Grahams career he said   I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques of security analysis in order to find superior value opportunities  This was disheartening to read  but I saw that Jason Zweig commented that Graham was only referring to passive investors Graham seems to imply otherwise  Any thoughts I would really appreciate a response  All the best So wrote one of my readers  I ll try to answer both of the questions The answer to the first question is relatively simple  Any strategy can be overused relative to the degree of mispricing in the market  There can be too many value players  There can be too many momentum players  There can be too many investors aiming for dividends  low volatility  high quality  etc  If you are the only one with a strategy  you can make a ton off of it  Think of Ben Graham back in the 30s  40s   50s  there were few people kicking the tires on seemingly troubled companies that had a lot of unused assets  It was easy to make a lot of money in that era  for the few that were doing it  Phil Fisher was a growth investor with a singular insight   look for sustainable competitive advantage  or in the modern parlance  a moat  He racked up quite a track record in the process  Or think of Sam Eisenstadt who developed the core of Value Line  building on the ideas of Arnold Bernhard  He was way ahead of GARP investing by incorporating price momentum  earnings momentum  earnings surprise and valuation into one neat method  It took a long time before those anomalies were exhausted  It worked for 50 years or so  Or think of Buffett  who synthesized many strands of value investing together with an insurance holding company  levering up value investing with an aim of rapid compounding of profits  Any valid strategy with few users will reap relatively high rewards  When lots of people pursue it  relative rewards fall  Value investing has two things going for it that tends to reduce the tendency for the rewards to be played out  It takes effort  and it s not sexy  Value investing can be taken to as deep of a level as one wants  Sometimes I read the analyses of other value investors  and I say to myself   This is either masterful  or he had a lot of time on his hands   I tend to be more simplistic  realizing that the first 20  of the analysis releases 80  of the value  I am also a better portfolio manager than I am an analyst  though I ve had people say to me that my intuition is sharper than many   I don t know   The  not sexy  aspect of value investing partly stems from a desire to invest in things that are growing rapidly  because there have been notable growth companies that have made their investors a lot of money  Why else do you see articles  This stock is the next Microsoft  Apple  Google  etc   Creating the next Chevron  IBM  or Berkshire Hathaway would take a lot of time  relatively  Every now and then  value investing gets crowded  but the advantage never fully goes away for a long time  Besides  market events like 1973 4  1979 82  1987  1998  2002 3  and 2008 9 shake up things so that there are a crop of new opportunities  As I said to my boss in 2007 when he was giving me a bad review   When I came here in 2003  it was as if the applecart had been knocked over  and easy values were easily picked up  like apples  Today  there are no easy pickings   Okay on to question 2  Part of the problem here is the famous part of what Graham had to say is well known but the whole article is not well known    And here is the famous quote  again  In selecting the common stock portfolio  do you advise careful study of and selectivity among different issues  In general  no  I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques of security analysis in order to find superior value opportunities  This was a rewarding activity  say  40 years ago  when our textbook  Graham and Dodd  was first published  but the situation has changed a great deal since then  In the old days any well trained security analyst could do a good professional job of selecting undervalued issues through detailed studies  but in the light of the enormous amount of research now being carried on  I doubt whether in most cases such extensive efforts will generate sufficiently superior selections to justify their cost  To that very limited extent I m on the side of the  efficient market  school of thought now generally accepted by the professors  On the face of it  to a value investor  this is rather disheartening  Who wants to see the founder abandon the heritage  But I mostly agree with Jason Zweig  because this has to be taken in context with the other things he said in the FAJ article  Let me explain  First  since Ben Graham  we have discovered a wide number of anomalies in investing  earnings quality  momentum  distress  asset shrinkage  share shrinkage  neglect  etc  We haven t been impoverished because we no longer have net nets  cheap companies with unused assets  to invest in  We ve sharpened the discipline beyond what Ben Graham could have imagined  Second  if you read the full article  Ben Graham still defends value investing  Turning now to individual investors  do you think that they are at a disadvantage compared with the institutions  because of the latter s huge resources  superior facilities for obtaining information  etc   On the contrary  the typical investor has a great advantage over the large institutions   Why  Chiefly because these institutions have a relatively small field of common stocks to choose from say 300 to 400 huge corporations   and they are constrained more or less to concentrate their research and decisions on this much over analyzed group  By contrast  most individuals can choose at any time among some 3000 issues listed in the Standard   Poor s Monthly Stock Guide  Following a wide variety of approaches and preferences  the individual investor should at all times be able to locate at least one per cent of the total list say  30 issues or more that offer attractive buying opportunities  What general rules would you offer the individual investor for his investment policy over the years  Let me suggest three such rules   1  The individual investor should act consistently as an investor and not as a speculator  This means  in sum  that he should be able to justify every purchase he makes and each price he pays by impersonal  objective reasoning that satisfies him that he is getting more than his money s worth for his purchase in other words  that he has a margin of safety  in value terms  to protect his commitment   2  The investor should have a definite selling policy for all his common stock commitments  corresponding to his buying techniques  Typically  he should set a reasonable profit objective on each purchase say 50 to 100 per cent and a maximum holding period for this objective to be realized say  two to three years  Purchases not realizing the gain objective at the end of the holding period should be sold out at the market   3  Finally  the investor should always have a minimum percentage of his total portfolio in common stocks and a minimum percentage in bond equivalents  I recommend at least 25 per cent of the total at all times in each category  A good case can be made for a consistent 50 50 division here  with adjustments for changes in the market level  This means the investor would switch some of his stocks into bonds on significant rises of the market level  and vice versa when the market declines  I would suggest  in general  an average seven  or eight year maturity for his bond holdings  This is value investing  What Graham is suggesting won t work is that big investors who have a lot of money to put to work will be forced into big names that are over analyzed  He is not saying that analysis of less followed names won t work  the small size of the individual investor is an advantage  not a curse  Then Ben Graham says  What general approach to portfolio formation do you advocate  Essentially  a highly simplified one that applies a single criteria or perhaps two criteria to the price to assure that full value is present and that relies for its results on the performance of the portfolio as a whole i e   on the group results rather than on the expectations for individual issues  Can you indicate concretely how an individual investor should create and maintain his common stock portfolio  I can give two examples of my suggested approach to this problem  One appears severely limited in its application  but we found it almost unfailingly dependable and satisfactory in 30 odd years of managing moderate sized investment funds  The second represents a great deal of new thinking and research on our part in recent years  It is much wider in its application than the first one  but it combines the three virtues of sound logic  simplicity of application  and an extraordinarily good performance record  assuming contrary to fact that it had actually been followed as now formulated over the past 50 years from 1925 to 1975  Some details  please  on your two recommended approaches  My first  more limited  technique confines itself to the purchase of common stocks at less than their working capital value  or net current asset value  giving no weight to the plant and other fixed assets  and deducting all liabilities in full from the current assets  We used this approach extensively in managing investment funds  and over a 30 odd year period we must have earned an average of some 20 per cent per year from this source  For a while  however  after the mid 1950 s  this brand of buying opportunity became very scarce because of the pervasive bull market  But it has returned in quantity since the 1973 74 decline  In January 1976 we counted over 300 such issues in the Standard   Poor s Stock Guide about 10 per cent of the total  I consider it a foolproof method of systematic investment once again  not on the basis of individual results but in terms of the expectable group outcome  Finally  what is your other approach  This is similar to the first in its underlying philosophy  It consists of buying groups of stocks at less than their current or intrinsic value as indicated by one or more simple criteria  The criterion I prefer is seven times the reported earnings for the past 12 months  You can use others such as a current dividend return above seven per cent or book value more than 120 percent of price  etc  We are just finishing a performance study of these approaches over the past half century 1925 1975  They consistently show results of 15 per cent or better per annum  or twice the record of the DJIA for this long period  I have every confidence in the threefold merit of this general method based on  a  sound logic   b  simplicity of application  and  c  an excellent supporting record  At bottom it is a technique by which true investors can exploit the recurrent excessive optimism and excessive apprehension of the speculative public  So  no  Ben Graham did not give up on value investing  One could easily say that he was arguing for value indexing  He knew what characteristics of cheapness would lead to superior returns  He also thought there was room for value investing outside of the largest 400 companies available for investment  He did recognize that the easy days were gone  Analyzing liquid assets net of liabilities no longer paid off  But value investing  buying assets with a margin of safety  and buying them cheap to their intrinsic value was not dead  at least for small investors  What Ben Graham would have learned had he lived longer was that value investing would adapt  and find new ways of seeking value  We are you heirs  Ben  and we have built upon your work  As a final note  though Ben Graham sought  the good life  and was often more concerned with the arts than investing  he was the original quantitative investor  He recognized aggregate behavior of stocks relative to valuation criteria  and saw that such value investing still worked  But with individual issues  the  Happy Hunting Ground  of the 30s  40s and 50s no longer existed  aside from  74 76  That s what Ben Graham meant when he no longer believed in individual security selection for value investing  PS   When I initially inclined to write this piece  I did not think I would write this  I thought I would support the mainstream opinion   that Graham gave up on value investing  I can now tell you that that view is wrong  Very wrong  Full disclosure  Long BRK B  CVX,2013-08-14,David

177389,398905,IBM,COLUMN After Sun  expect new Oracle hardware deals  Eric Auchard,news,"   Eric Auchard is a Reuters columnist  The opinions expressed
are his own   
 
 By Eric Auchard
 LONDON  May 11  Reuters    Larry Ellison  Oracle Corp s
chief executive  is famous for making outrageous predictions
about the future of the computer industry and being mocked by
rivals and pundits 
 But don t underestimate the software maker s latest moves
into the hardware business 
 Oracle s surprised many last month that the company would
buy Sun Microsystems for  7 4 billion  Now Ellison has gone one
better  telling Reuters he was  definitely not going to exit 
Sun s various hardware businesses 
   
 The Oracle leader is not saying so directly yet  but the
unmistakable conclusion to draw is that he is ready to embark on
a new wave of mergers to consolidate the business computer
market  once the Sun deal closes 
 Hanging on to Sun s computer  chip and storage businesses
implies Oracle is ready to bulk up via mergers to reinforce
Sun s competitive position and check rival countermoves  Sun
wouldn t be selling itself if its franchise could survive alone 
 Why would Oracle bother to pay  7 4 billion for a company
known largely for its hardware  unless  that is  it has specific
reasons to enter the hardware market  Oracle may be able to
better exploit Sun s Java software franchise  Java is used on
more than 1 billion computers and phones  but Sun received only
 200 million in revenue in 2008 for its 14 year old software 
 Oracle wants to improve the performance of its software by
building it into its own lines of hardware  It dipped its toe
into hardware last year with Exadata  a machine designed to run
the most demanding database tasks  Built on Intel chips in
partnership with Hewlett Packard Co  Oracle s database software
runs far faster than on standard computers 
 The old technical distinctions that once divided software
from hardware  chips or network equipment are blurring  if not
disappearing  The entry of network equipment maker Cisco Systems
 into the market for big business computers earlier this year is
a harbinger of the opportunity that outsiders like Oracle see in
hardware 
  Once we own Sun  we ll be able to plan and synchronize new
features from silicon to software  just like IBM and the other
big system suppliers   Ellison said last week 
 Financial dynamics are at work here  Hardware businesses
operate at far lower margins than software ones  But companies
that control both hardware and software are able to charge a
premium for combined products  Apple  Cisco and IBM are
examples  Roughly 20 percent of computer maker IBM s revenue
comes from hardware  It s not computers themselves  but the
software and services bundled along with them that generate most
of IBM s revenue and profit 
 No company in the technology world has proved a more
relentless consolidator of adjacent businesses than Oracle  Its
track record over the past six years shows it must be taken
seriously when Ellison says he has no intention of shedding
Sun s hardware businesses  Fifty acquisitions priced at nearly
 35 billion later  he s rolled up vast stretches of the once
fragmented software business    PeopleSoft  Siebel and BEA among
them 
 Oracle focuses almost entirely on sales to big companies and
governments  The home for most of its products is big data
centres  Sun is surely a play by Oracle to grab a bigger part of
the data centre market  Dozens of companies  both software and
hardware may be in play once Sun joins Oracle  Names such as EMC
 VMware  Network Appliance  Brocade and Juniper Networks could
be targets  if not of Oracle  then of rivals seeking to fend off
the combined Oracle Sun challenge 
 Oracle will end its 2009 fiscal year in May with around  23
billion in sales  Once the Sun deal closes  Oracle sales could
easily top  30 billion a year 
 It is attacking a market led by IBM and HP  the world s
biggest technology companies  by sales  But Oracle can afford to
be nimble as it generated  8 billion in free cash flow for the
12 months ended in February  Vivek Ranidive  CEO of rival Tibco
Software  complains that Ellison has transformed Oracle into a
kind of private equity firm 
 Sun is a stepping stone to bigger things for Oracle  not an
end in itself  Once the Sun deal closes  there is every sign
that Ellison could do to the market for business computer
hardware what he has done to software

177391,398907,IBM,Looking Ahead  The Q3 Earnings Season,opinion,Looking Ahead to Q3 Earnings Season We are a few weeks away from the start of the 2013 Q3 earnings season  with estimates for the quarter down sharply from where they stood just a few months back  This isn t unusual as we have been seeing this negative revisions pattern play out repeatedly in recent quarters  Estimates for the following quarters  Q4 and beyond  have held up fairly well  likely indicating that analysts expect the earnings picture to improve materially going forward  We didn t see any evidence in the Q2 earnings season that would inspire such confidence in the overall earnings picture  Yes  total earnings reached a new quarterly record in Q2 and other aggregate metrics like growth rates and beat ratios looked respectable as well  But all of that was solely due to one sector only  Finance  Exclude Finance from the aggregate numbers and the picture that emerged was anything but satisfactory  But before we start referring to the 2013 Q2 earnings season in the past tense  let s acknowledge that it hasn t technically ended yet  As of today  we still have Q2 results awaited from a couple of S P 500 members  But total earnings for the 498 S P 500 companies that have reported are up  2 5  from the same period last year  with 62 7  beating earnings expectations with a median surprise of  2 9   Most of that earnings growth has come from top line gains  up  1 9    with margins essentially flat from the same period last year  Revenue surprises have been better relative to the extremely weak levels in Q1  but largely in line with historical levels  Finance is solely responsible for keeping aggregate earnings growth for the S P 500 in the positive column  Excluding Finance  total earnings growth in Q2 was negative  While earnings strength was concentrated in Finance only  the weakness was broad based  From Technology to Basic Materials and Industrials to Retail  all contributed to the weak earnings picture  The Retail sector was expected to do better  but early results from leaders like Macy s  M  and Wal Mart  WMT  had given us a pretty good preview of what transpired  The Retail sector s Q2 earnings and revenue growth numbers were actually decent enough  But surprises were predominantly negative and guidance was very underwhelming  Expectations for Q3 have come down materially as the Q2 reporting season unfolded and companies guided lower  The chart below plots how Q3 consensus earnings growth estimates for the S P 500 have evolved over time  The negative revisions to Q3 estimates have been very pronounced in a few sectors  namely Retail  Basic Materials  Industrials  Consumer Discretionary  and Technology  Current total earnings growth for the Retail sector in Q3 is less than a quarter of what was expected in early May  while Basic Material s expected has dropped to less than a third over the same time period  Unlike the downtrend in Q3 estimates over the recent past  expectations for Q4 and beyond have held up fairly well and still represent a material acceleration in the growth pace  The chart below shows growth expectations for Q3 and Q4 and what was actually achieved in the last few quarters A lot of the Q4 growth is expected to come from sectors outside of Finance  as the chart below of ex Finance growth expectations shows  Even the expected flat finish in Q3 is a material improvement from what we saw in Q2 Most of the recent negative Q3 estimate revisions have been in the sectors outside of Finance  Current ex Finance Q3 growth estimate is less than a third of what was expected a few weeks back  But given what we have seen from these sectors in Q2 thus far  it seems like a tall order for this level of growth ramp up  My sense is that estimates need to come down further  particularly for Q4 The market hasn t cared much in the recent past about negative revisions as aggregate earnings estimates have been coming down for over a year now  But if we are entering a post QE world  as I believe we are  then it will likely be difficult to overlook negative earnings estimate revisions going forward  How the market responds to negative guidance and the resulting negative revisions will tell us a lot about what to expect going forward Key PointsTotal earnings for the 498 S P 500 companies that have reported results are up  2 5   with 62 7  beating earnings expectations  Revenues for these companies are up  1 9   with a revenue  beat ratio  of 50 2  The earnings and revenue growth rates are roughly in line what this same group of companies reported in recent quarters  while the revenue beat ratios have been better relative to Q1 s extremely low rate Finance results have been very strong  with total earnings for the companies that have reported results up an impressive  30   Excluding Finance  total earnings for the remainder of S P 500 companies that have reported would be down  2 9  from the year earlier period Finance reclaims its leadership role in the S P 500  contributing more earnings to the index s total than Technology this year for the first time since the 2008 crisis  The sector is expected to account for 19 7  of total S P 500 earnings in 2013 compared to Technology s 17 9  Technology earnings remain weak  with total earnings for the sector down  10 1  on  0 4  higher revenues  Margins have been under pressure across the board for many industry players like Apple  AAPL   Google  GOOG   IBM  IBM   and others Technology remains a big drag on earnings growth in Q2  Excluding Technology  but including Finance   total Q2 earnings for the S P 500 would be up  5 4  Estimates for 2013 Q3 have started coming down  with current Q3 total earnings growth of  2 3  down from  5 2  in early July  But expectations for the fourth quarter  up  11 7   still represent a material growth ramp up from the first half s level While there is not much growth  the overall level of total earnings is quite high  with total earnings in Q2 on track to surpass Q1 s all time quarterly record  Earnings for the S P 500 companies are expected to total  255 9 billion in Q2  a new quarterly record ,2013-09-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-ahead:-the-q3-earnings-season-183531,183531

  Updates to early afternoon  changes byline 
 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK  June 24  Reuters    U S  stocks gained on
Wednesday after software maker Oracle s results beat
expectations and durable goods orders jumped unexpectedly 
giving more hope that the economy is rebounding 
 Investors awaited a statement from the Federal Reserve 
due at around 1815 GMT  for clues on how the U S  central bank
assesses the economy 
 Technology shares rose after better than expected
quarterly profit and sales from Oracle Corp  The software
maker s stock was among the Nasdaq s top advancers  up 7 9
percent at  21 43  Shares of IBM rose 0 7 percent to  105 17
on the New York Stock Exchange and helped left the Dow
industrials 
 The Fed is widely expected to leave the benchmark fed
funds rate at almost zero  but investors will hone in on its
statement for clues on the central bank s economic outlook 
  The policy statement is likely to say the economy is
still mired in slow growth and inflation is not a problem  
said Bruce Bittles  chief investment strategist at Robert W 
Baird   Co in Nashville  Tennessee 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 55 40 points  or
0 67 percent  at 8 378 31  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index was
up 12 69 points  or 1 42 percent  at 907 79  The Nasdaq
Composite Index was up 38 48 points  or 2 18 percent  at
1 803 40 
 New orders for durable goods  which are long lasting U S 
manufactured products such as refrigerators and washing
machines  increased by a much stronger than expected 1 8
percent in May  and the median price of new homes hit its
highest level since December  even though sales slipped 
economic data showed 
      There was a lot of concern about the economy and all
of a sudden the economy shows some signs of life  and so does
the market   Bittles said 
  Although stocks rose sharply from early March through
May  gains have stalled recently as investors sought signs the
economy is recovering enough to justify the market s rally 
 The broad S P 500 index is up 34 percent from a
12 1 2 year closing low on March 9  it had soared as much as
40 percent during the spring rally

   Confirms 2009 outlook  2011 sales targets
   Sees acquisitions opportunities
   Shares gain 9 2 percent
  Adds CEO comments  analyst comment  share price 
 By Nicola Leske and Peggy Kropmanns
 FRANKFURT  Jan 27  Reuters    Germany s Software AG
confirmed its 2009 outlook on Tuesday after strong
fourth quarter results and said it was well positioned to make
acquisitions  sending its shares more than 10 percent higher 
  We have hardly felt an impact from the financial crisis  
Chief Executive Karl Heinz Streibich said 
 He said there was a demand for Software AG s products that
help businesses become more efficient 
 Software AG said for its fourth quarter it posted a 14
percent rise in group revenue to 212 4 million euros and an
operating profit of 54 9 million euros  up 28 3 percent   
thanks mainly to the integration of webMethods 
 Analysts polled by Reuters on average had expected
fourth quarter sales to increase by 7 percent to 200 million
euros and operating profit to grow 14 percent to 49 million
euros 
 Software AG s shares were up 9 2 percent at 43 00 euros at
0827 GMT after rising more than 10 percent in early trade as
analysts cheered key figures that beat expectations and the
company confirmed its outlook 
 Software AG  a distant second to SAP among German software
makers and the fourth largest maker in Europe  has two main
revenue streams    one from helping companies to modernise and
manage applications for large mainframe computers  and the other
from helping to design and deploy Web services and get the most
out of older IT investments 
 Streibich told Reuters in an interview that while he could
not comment on the first quarter of 2009 he was sticking with
the company s 2009 targets of 4 percent to 8 percent revenue
growth and an operating margin of 24 5 percent to 25 5 percent 
  That we are confirming our targets should tell you
something about the first quarter   the CEO said 
 Streibich also confirmed that Software AG remained committed
to reaching its 1 billion euro   1 31 billion  revenue goal by
2011 through both organic growth and acquisitions 
  Acquisitions should be somewhat easier than organic growth
because acquisitions are cheap right now   Streibich said 
  We have a high cash flow and are very creditworthy   he
said  adding that the company had its sights set on some
potential targets but declined to elaborate 
 He said that Software AG could manage another purchase the
size of webMethods should an opportunity arise 
 In 2007  Software AG bought U S  based software company
webMethods for  546 million  the biggest acquisition in the
company s history  
 However  Streibich said acquisitions of that magnitude were
not the norm and currently none were planned 
 Streibich said he expected webMethods to remain one of
Software AG s main growth drivers  aiming at 4 percent to 10
percent sales growth for the unit 
 For its ETS mainframe unit  which helps companies maintain
and update large mainframe computers  Software aims to achieve 4
percent to 6 percent revenue growth  Streibich said 
 DZ Bank analyst Oliver Finger said in a note that the
numbers were  surprisingly good   given the current market
environment 
  We are in particular positively surprised by the
performance of the Webmethods division  which clearly
outperformed the expectations   he said 
 Software AG trades at 9 35 times estimated 2009 earnings
compared with a sector average of 11 according to Reuters
estimates  U S  rivals Tibco and IBM are valued at 11 times and
9 times  respectively 
 SAP  which issued a profit warning in October  is due to
report fourth quarter and full year earnings on Wednesday

behind Obama s bid for the presidency  would step down in early
April 
 Symantec spokesman Cris Paden declined to confirm or deny
that Thompson is Obama s top pick for the post 
  I don t have any information   he said in an email 
 A company official earlier had said the executive visited
Washington in the last several weeks and noted Thompson s work
on Obama s behalf 
 Obama had nominated New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson to
fill the commerce post  but Richardson withdrew on Jan  4 in
the face of a legal inquiry 
 Richardson  a former Democratic presidential candidate and
one of the country s most prominent Hispanic politicians 
denied any wrongdoing in connection with the probe of a
California financial company that had done business with New
Mexico s state government 
 But Richardson said an investigation lasting possibly weeks
or even months  would have forced an untenable delay in the
confirmation process  
 Richard Parsons  the incoming chairman of Citigroup  had
been rumored to be a potential Commerce pick after Richardson
withdrew but the executive has said that was not interested 
 Thompson s biography on Symantec s website says he built
the company  from a small consumer software publisher to a
global leader in providing security  storage and systems
management solutions  
 Thompson was a senior executive with IBM Corp before
joining Symantec and has a master s degree in management
science from MIT s Sloan School of Management 
 Former President George W  Bush appointed Thompson to the
National Infrastructure Advisory Committee in September 2002 to
make recommendations on the security of the critical
infrastructure of the United States 
 Thompson also has served as the chair of the Silicon Valley
Blue Ribbon Task Force on Aviation Security and Technology to
identify and evaluate technology driven solutions to improve
the security and efficiency of national and local aviation ",2009-01-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/update-2-thompson-top-choice-for-us-commerce-sec'y--sources-24099,24099

177421,398937,IBM,COLUMN Computer industry hopes lie in the clouds  Eric Auchard,news,"   Eric Auchard is a Reuters columnist  The opinions expressed
are his own   
 
 By Eric Auchard
 LONDON  March 26  Reuters    No one can easily define it 
 But the next phase of the computer revolution is busy being
born out of the ashes of the current economic crisis  The new
approach delivers computing power as a service over the Web 
like an electric utility  instead of making customers buy
computers they manage themselves 
 It goes by the hazy term of  cloud computing  
 Forget your tidy distinctions between hardware and software 
networking and storage  the Web and the desktop  Most disappear
as they merge into the cloud 
 Clouds are located in centralised data centres that can
house thousands of pizza sized boxes  networked computers that
can each process millions of transactions  They take advantage
of the latest software that go by buzzwords like Web 2 0 
virtualization and open source 
 Always in search of the next big idea  the technology
industry has latched onto the cloud as its big new organising
principle  once more normal corporate spending patterns return 
  Compelling economics will ultimately force you to move to
clouds   Erich Clementi  IBM s general manager of cloud
computing  told a Dublin conference last week  IBM is setting up
centralised cloud computing centres across the globe 
 Six months into a financial crisis that has stifled most
corporate initiative  two of the world s largest technology
companies are taking the offensive 
 Network gear leader Cisco has jumped into the market for big
business computers called servers  while computer maker IBM is
in talks to buy Sun Microsystems  another server maker  in its
biggest merger deal ever  sources say  The value of the deal
could run up to  8 billion 
 Both Cisco and IBM aim to capitalize on the emerging shift
to cloud computing  in particular by grabbing bigger slices of
the data centre supply market  They are looking to turn vast
farms of server hardware and software into utility services that
customers can rent 
 The promise of the cloud is to do away with the need of
organisations and individuals to maintain their own computer
hardware  software  storage and network gear  The cloud metaphor
is used to disguise the complexity of bringing all these pieces
together  It s the difference between owning and repairing a car
yourself or leasing one with a mechanic to keep it running 
 These actions  as they play out in coming years  have
hundreds of companies large and small reassessing their
strategies ahead of what Wall Street analysts are predicting
will be a wave of mergers in the tech world  This consolidation
could sweep up not only hardware makers  but software 
networking  data storage and semiconductor suppliers as well as
Web services 
 
 CUMULO NEBULOUS
 There is no agreement on how to define the cloud  There are
complicated academic definitions and others full of self serving
marketing spin  Computer maker Dell  created an industry uproar
by trying to trademark  cloud computing  last year  but has
retreated after widespread criticism they were claiming
ownership for a generically accepted phrase 
 The notion of centralized utility scale computing dates is
decades old  dating back to the 1960s when corporations rented
time slots on mainframes  Web hosting services proliferated
during the 1990s  The term  cloud  to describe the inner
workings of the Internet at large date back to the 1970s 
 This is all part of a long shift from hardware based
computing to software and now Web based computing  Clouds allow
unused computing resources to be shared  or  virtualized   and
reused by other customers  improving efficiency  To further cut
costs  most rely on inexpensive open source software 
 But unlike these earlier forms of managing dedicated
machines on behalf of individual clients  cloud computing takes
advantage of virtualization technology to reuse the same
computing capacity again and again  Online retailer Amazon com
has dubbed this approach as  elastic  computing capacity and is
making inroads with the idea 
 The dominant players include not just hardware makers like
Cisco and IBM and computer rival Hewlett Packard  There are big
name Internet services or software providers such as Amazon 
Google and Microsoft  which deliver a range of pre packaged
software services to both start ups and established businesses 
Hot Web companies like Facebook use cloud computing to deliver
thousands of different services to tens of millions of users
everyday 
 Earlier this month  the Financial Times quoted Microsoft
research head Rick Rashid as estimating that 20 percent of all
the computer servers in the world are now sold each year to a
small number of Internet companies    Microsoft  Google  Yahoo
and Amazon were ones he named  Computer industry margins  long
in decline  stand to benefit as cloud services are sold as
packages rather as boxes  Selling the same capacity repeatedly
has benefits 
 
 ELASTIC CAPACITY
 Growth in computer servers used to run business operations
has flattened out from their spending heyday in the 1990s 
Computing is undergoing a transformation as entrenched ways of
selling hardware and software as separate products are under
attack  Customers are fed up running complicated systems without
clear payback  especially as they look to slash costs in the
downturn 
 The industry is now ploughing most of their new investments
into cloud services rather than separate computer products 
Start up promoter and conference organiser Dealmaker Media says
the cloud is one of the categories still getting funding by
Silicon Valley venture capitalists  It charts  150 million
invested in 25 firms in 2008 and so far in 2009 
 Some clouds will be hosted by established systems
integrators  Internet or telecom service operators ranging from
EDS  now a unit of HP  to Amazon to BT or AT T  Other clouds
will be built to sit in house by big companies to maintain
complete control of how they work  Hybrids are emerging that mix
private data centres with public cloud services to provide spare
computing capacity only when needed 
 Market research firm Gartner Inc estimates that cloud
services revenue should top  56 billion this year  growing 21
percent from 2008  despite the credit crunch  It forecasts the
market to reach  150 billion in 2013 
 Wall Street is eagerly handicapping the takeout potential of
dozens of downstream technology companies that will need to seek
allies in the land of giants 
 Possible targets range from equipment makers Network
Appliance  Brocade or Juniper to storage virtualisation company
EMC VMware to consulting services such as Accenture or
CapGemini  Holdouts are likely to be forced to make partnerships
with Cisco  IBM or HP  to survive 
 The cloud concept has emerged as the best hope for a
maturing computer industry  The hope is this will create
conditions for a yet to be fully imagined wave of new
businesses  run from the clouds

TOKYO  April 7  Reuters    The yen and the dollar climbed on
Tuesday  benefiting from defensive position taking as a flush of
optimism which powered a recent rally in stocks and higher risk
currencies gave way to caution about banks 
 The yen had slid to its lowest in nearly six months against
the dollar and euro on Monday but later revived as U S  and
European shares fell on renewed worries about the health of banks
and the collapse of IBM s takeover bid for Sun Microsystems 
 The Australian and New Zealand dollars  which have both
ridden higher on improving risk appetite  also retreated from
recent multi month highs  with the market keen to see whether
Australia s central bank cuts rates 
 Analysts said there was both profit taking after recent sharp
gains and a renewal of risk averse positions  with the dollar and
the yen benefiting on safety bids when investor confidence wanes 
  It s a tendency since the financial crisis for investors to
be risk averse  and they don t hold positions for a long time  As
a result the theme in the market changes every week   said Toru

 The euro fell 0 4 percent on the day to  1 3358 and 0 6
percent to 134 65 yen  after touching 137 42 yen on Monday  its
highest since late October 
 The dollar also slipped against the yen  falling 0 2 percent
to 100 79 yen after climbing to 101 45 yen on Monday  Against a

 The Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  meets to decide whether
to cut interest rates by 25 to 50 basis points or keep them
steady at a record low of 3 25 percent  with the decision due at

 The decision is seen as a very close call  The Australian
dollar slid 0 5 percent to  0 7080 and 0 7 percent to 71 43 yen 
after leaping to a six month high of 72 87 yen on Monday 
according to Reuters data 
 The Bank of Japan ends a two day meeting on Tuesday and is
expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 0 1 percent

 By Charlotte Cooper
TOKYO  April 7  Reuters    The yen and the dollar climbed on
Tuesday  benefiting from defensive position taking as a flush of
optimism that powered a recent rally in stocks and higher risk
currencies gave way to caution about banks 
 Traders said the decline in the euro and higher yielding
currencies was also driven by profit taking after the single
European currency and the dollar rose to their highest in nearly
six months on the yen on Monday 
 The Australian and New Zealand dollars  which have both
ridden higher on improving risk appetite  also retreated from
recent multi month highs  with the market keen to see whether
Australia s central bank cuts rates on Tuesday 
 The Bank of Japan  BOJ  kept its rates steady at 0 1 percent
as expected  leaving the market free to focus on the Reserve Bank
of Australia  where a decision was due at 0430 GMT 
 The market is keen to see if the RBA trims interest rates by
25 to 50 basis points or keeps them steady at a record low of
3 25 percent 
  The market is completely divided on this one   said Sue
Trinh  senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in
Sydney 
  The bottom line is that there will be a huge amount of
volatility on the Aussie dollar on the announcement  with the
market pricing in a little over 25 basis points worth of cuts  
 The Aussie slid 0 3 percent to  0 7100 and 0 8 percent to
71 38 yen  after leaping to a six month high of 72 87 yen on
Monday  according to Reuters data 
 The BOJ unveiled further steps to ease credit strains  as the
the world s No 2 economy wallows in its worst postwar recession
amid a global credit crisis 
 It expanded the range of collateral eligible for market
operations to include loans on deeds to the government  loans
with government guarantees and loans on deeds to municipal
governments 
 SHORT TERMISM
 The euro fell 0 4 percent on the day to  1 3358 and 0 8
percent to 134 38 yen  after touching 137 42 yen on Monday  its
highest since late October 
 The dollar also slipped against the yen  falling 0 4 percent
to 100 53 yen ahead of the BOJ decision and staying there
afterwards  It had climbed to 101 45 yen on Monday 
 Trinh said the dollar needed to remain above 99 70 yen  which
was the breakout point for its latest leg higher  if it were to
stave off a deeper correction 
 But against a basket of major currencies it was up 0 2
percent and clawing back ground against sterling 
 A fall in European and U S  shares on Monday on renewed
worries about the health of banks and the collapse of IBM s
takeover bid for Sun Microsystems fuelled profit taking on the

 UK daily the Times said on its website that new IMF forecasts
were set to suggest toxic debts racked up by banks and insurers
could spiral to  4 trillion  although it gave no sources for the
report 
 Analysts and traders said the report fed into the revival in
concerns about the banking sector  although there was also plenty
of reason to take profits on the recent rally ahead of the U S

177441,398957,IBM,Detroit And The Discipline Of Municipal Bonds,opinion,Long awaited and now finally arrived  Detroit s bankruptcy was expected and priced into markets  Some Detroit debt had been trading down to 30 cents on a dollar prior to the announcement   Let s dig into this news  Detroit will now be a poster child  It will reveal the tragic decline in the economics of many cities and other jurisdictions that did not correctly manage their fiscal affairs   The news is filled with photographs of empty buildings and reports of population declines  The statistics show the remaining residents  income deterioration  The high taxation rates implemented to correct imbalances completely destroyed the fiscal viability of the city   In the days of the Wild West we had ghost towns when the ore ran out  In the modern world we have large unfunded liabilities  a population drain  Detroit lost two thirds of its peak 2 million  and then a financial wreck   We will have a bankruptcy fight to watch  Conflicting interests will battle over payments  Friday afternoon  a judge ordered a reversal of the bankruptcy action  So the courts are now in a fight with the State s Governor as legal combat attempts to preserve pension benefits which are unfunded and not economically viable   Who will get paid  who will lose money  and how much  The battle will rage  Labor contracts will be rewritten  and pension benefits will be reexamined  Unsecured creditors  derivative counterparties  and vendors will compete for a limited pot of money  Secured creditors may take haircuts  This fight will be over many innings and will not be quickly resolved   While we watch this denouement unfold in Detroit  much as we have watched it unfold in other cities  Cumberland takes a more disciplined approach with municipal bonds  Stay away when credit is questionable  Do not get sucked into a higher yield on a weaker credit  It is all about credit   At Cumberland  we look at everything the rating agencies do and say  We also analyze and score credit internally  We combine research to synthesize a judgment about whether to buy  sell  or hold a specific bond   Remember all municipal bonds are idiosyncratic securities  they are not all exactly alike  Their structures  priorities of payments  intricacies of clauses in bond indentures  and pricing of various options within the bond indenture all reflect the individual characteristics of each bond  Homogeneity does not exist in the specifics of municipal bonds   In the old days bond buyers used to say   Well it s insured and rated AAA   that s all I need to know  Just give me the coupon  call date  and maturity date   Those days are gone and will not be back for a long time   There are over 90 000 municipal entities in the US  There are approximately 40 000 separate bond issues that trade in sufficient depth for information to be tracked in databases  Bond investors need to understand that this specific type of municipal bond credit research and resulting assessments are more important than ever   We would like to suggest a metaphor  There are approximately 6 000 stocks trading in the U S  They are widely followed by advisory companies and are collectively assembled in over 1 000 ETFs  exchange traded funds   They get a lot of attention   There are almost seven times as many separately trading bond issues as there are stocks  These are collectively assembled in a few mutual funds and a few ETFs and are mostly held in passive structures or by passive investors  Think about it  seven times as many instruments  perhaps  get one seventh of the scrutiny of stocks in terms of detail  Many analysts estimate the earnings for IBM  Few analysts dissect the trust accounting of a major city   Detailed research and data tracking are critical in this  3 7 trillion asset class of municipal bonds  When it comes to the data  governmental units are usually more transparent than corporations are  Public bodies and reporting systems make relevant information available  although the structure of the information portrayal is complex  Despite its complexity  municipal bond data is available  all you have to do is examine it  In 99  of the cases  it is forthright and can be relied upon   Any bondholder that holds Detroit debt today asked to be put at risk for this event  Detroit s financial disaster was visible and predictable  If the bondholder suffers a loss  so be it  At Cumberland  we hold only one small Detroit piece and it is insured by Berkshire and is rated AA   Credit is the key component in Muni

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Oct 9  Reuters    Investors  willingness to take
risk rose on Thursday but stocks pared gains a day after
coordinated global interest rate cuts gave some calm to jittery
markets worldwide and curbed the appeal of safe haven assets 
 Demand for government bonds  gold and low yielding
currencies    all recent beneficiaries of investors who have
scrambled for relative safety    fell 
 Oil traded little changed around  89 a barrel after a steep
slide this week in response to expectations that demand will
fall sharply if the global economy slides into recession 
 The yen fell broadly and higher yielding currencies bounced
as extreme risk aversion receded after key central banks around
the world cut rates on Wednesday in a coordinated response to
halt the worst global financial crisis in almost 80 years 
 U S  stocks initially rose as investors snapped up
beaten down shares after a six day slide on Wall Street pushed
the Dow down about 34 percent from a record peak a year ago on
Oct  9  2007  By mid morning in New York  however  the bounce
on profit taking fizzled and stocks were little changed 
 Shares of International Business Machines Corp  rose
2 percent after it posted solid profit  making it a top boost
to the Dow  Apple Inc   another tech bellwether  led
the Nasdaq with a 4 percent gain 
  What we re seeing is just a bear market rally   said Dave
Rovelli  managing director of U S  equity trading at Canaccord
Adams in New York   You could see a significant rally over the
next couple of days  The market is so oversold  
 Mid morning in New York  the Dow Jones industrial average
 was down 6 37 points  or 0 07 percent  at 9 251 73  The
Standard   Poor s 500 Index  was down 2 01 points  or
0 20 percent  at 982 93  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was
up 12 60 points  or 0 72 percent  at 1 752 93 
 The cost of interbank borrowing overnight cash fell in
response to the coordinated effort by financial authorities to
restore calm to jittery markets  The cost of dollar  euro and
sterling funds for the overnight rate all fell substantially 
although by less than one half percentage point 
 The rate cuts were aimed in large part at unclogging the
commercial paper market and keeping businesses humming 
 Meanwhile  the cost of borrowing dollars for any period
beyond the overnight rate rocketed  Three month dollar Libor
hit its highest this year as banks scrambled for greenbacks to
cover U S  currency positions and to fund dollar assets 
  We re not seeing any relief in term Libor fixings which
tells us that the rate cut has exclusively impacted on the
overnight market but it hasn t touched the Libor market at
all   said BNP Paribas rate strategist Alessandro Tentori 
  And that s not a very good sign   Tentori said 
 U S  Treasuries fell for a third straight day as debt
supply issues weighed on investor sentiment  while rising stock
prices on Wall Street sapped any safety bid for bonds 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  fell
30 32 in price to yield 3 77 percent  and the 2 year U S 
Treasury note  fell 7 32 in price to yield 1 67
percent  Bond prices and yields move inversely to each other 
 European stocks were higher  breaking a three session
losing streak  after fresh government and central bank action
to combat the financial crisis 
 The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
was little changed after rising around 1 5 percent 
 The low yielding yen fell from a three year high against
the euro and a six month peak versus the dollar that it hit the
previous day  although it later pared some losses 
  The stocks overnight had a bit of a rally     and that s
given the dollar yen a little of a boost   said Steven Butler 
director of FX trading at Scotia capital in Toronto 
 Against the yen  the dollar  was up 1 86 percent at
101 10  The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies 
with the U S  Dollar Index  up 0 32 percent at 81 174 
 The euro  rose 0 22 percent at  1 3659 
 Gold slipped as investors cashed in gains that took the
precious metal to a nine day high in the previous session 
 Spot gold prices  fell  24 95 to  881 55 an ounce 
  There are still a lot of speculative positions in the
market and some banks are taking profit to make up losses on
other markets   Commerzbank senior trader Michael Kempinski
said 
 Oil was lower  U S  light sweet crude oil  fell 40
cents to  88 55 a barrel 
 Stocks clung to small gains overnight in Asia  MSCI s index
of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan  rose 2 05
percent after a 9 percent tumble on Wednesday  its biggest
single day fall in at least two decades

177445,398961,IBM,GLOBAL MARKETS Equities rise  helped by earnings  credit,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  Oct 17  Reuters     Equities rose across the world
on Friday after encouraging earnings signals from technology
firms such as IBM and a slowly improving tone in beleaguered
short term money markets helped ease recession fears 
 European shares were up more than 3 percent following gains
in Asia  Overnight  Wall Street ended a volatile Thursday with
gains of more than 4 percent 
 The dollar was flat to weaker against major currencies and
euro zone government bonds sold off mildly  Oil prices rose
nearly  2 a barrel to near  72  helped by the equity gains and
growing expectations for an OPEC production cut 
 Investors have been shifting their attention over the past
week from the still volatile financial crisis to the prospect of
a global recession 
  There s still nervousness in the market about the real
economy  but in terms of valuations the price is good right
now   said Nagayuki Yamagishi  a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities in Japan 
  The economic problems are the main theme of the market
right now and everybody knows this  so rises will be limited  
 Among the factors helping investors look past the immediate
problems were some better than expected corporate news 
 International Business Machines Corp  IBM N  said on
Thursday it expects to meet long term profit forecasts  partly
due to continued growth in emerging markets 
 Meanwhile  U S  firms such as internet search leader Google
Inc and chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc posted  results
after U S  market hours that beat expectations 
 On the credit front  recent unprecedented measures by
central banks to inject liquidity into the financial system
appeared to be bearing some fruit 
 Three month dollar lending rates  were around 4 5
percent compared with more than 6 percent at the beginning of
the week 
 Until bank to bank lending    frozen for much of the last
year by uncertainty over which faced financial disaster    is
flowing freely again  corporate activity and consumer spending
cannot hope to recover from the crisis 
 
 RECOVERY 
 MSCI s main world stock index   which has
lost more than 40 percent of its value this year  was up 1 5
percent on the day 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300  gained 3 6
percent and Japan s benchmark Nikkei  closed up 2 8
percent after losing more than 11 percent on Thursday 
 On currency markets  the yen gained  The dollar was down a
quarter of a percent at 101 30 yen  and the euro fell the
same to 136 57 yen 
 Dollar euro was flat at  1 3474

4 084 percent  up 2 basis points and two year debt

177455,398971,IBM,Best   Worst ETFs   Mutual Funds  Information Technology Sector,opinion,The Information Technology sector ranks second out of the ten sectors as detailed in my Sector Rankings for ETFs and Mutual Funds report  It gets my Neutral rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of 27 ETFs and 155 mutual funds in the Information Technology sector as of July 8  2013  Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the sector  Not all Information Technology sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 25 to 418   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst ETFs and mutual funds  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks  To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Information Technology sector  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings  My fund rating methodology is detailed   Investors seeking exposure to the Information Technology sector should buy one of the Attractive or better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2  Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5  Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNAs less than  100 million for inadequate liquidity  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsFigure 2  Mutual Funds with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5  Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNAs less than  100 million for inadequate liquidity  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Eight mutual funds are excluded from Figure 2 because their total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards Technology Select Sector SPDR  XLK  is my top rated Information Technology ETF and Fidelity Select Portfolios  Computers Portfolio  FDCPX  is my top rated Information Technology mutual fund  XLK earns my Attractive rating and FDCPX earns my Neutral rating PowerShares Lux Nanotech Portfolio  PXN  is my worst rated Information Technology ETF and Rydex Series Funds  Electronics Fund  RYELX  is my worst rated Information Technology mutual fund  PXN earns my Dangerous rating and RYELX earns my Very Dangerous rating Figure 3 shows that 118 out of the 605 stocks  over 39  of the market value  in Information Technology ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  However  only 2 out of 27 ETFs  52  of total net assets  and no mutual funds in the sector get an Attractive or better rating The takeaways are  mutual fund managers allocate too much capital to low quality stocks and Information Technology ETFs hold poor quality stocks Figure 3  Information Technology Sector Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds   StocksSources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management  Investors need to tread carefully when considering Information Technology ETFs and mutual funds  as 33  of ETFs and 47  of mutual funds in the sector earn a Dangerous or worse rating  Investors should focus on the two ETFs that earn an Attractive or better rating  Only these two ETFs have low fees and allocate significant value to high quality stocks International Business Machines  IBM  is one of my favorite stocks held by Information Technology ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Attractive rating  IBM has maintained a return on invested capital  ROIC  above 10  every year since 2006  Since 2002  it has averaged 12  compounded annual growth in after tax profits  NOPAT   Despite these impressive fundamentals  the market is surprisingly cautious about IBM  At its current valuation of   194 93 share  IBM has a price to economic book value ratio of just under 1  implying a slight but permanent decline in NOPAT  Given its impressive track record of growth  IBM looks like a good bet to exceed the market s low expectations  Broadcom Corporation  BRCM  is one of my least favorite stocks held by Information Technology ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Dangerous rating  Other than a brief spike in 2010 and 2011  BRCM has not earned positive economic earnings in any year going back to at least 1998  BRCM s NOPAT declined by 5  in 2011 and 14  in 2012  One would expect BRCM to be fairly cheap  but this is not the case  To justify its valuation of   33 77 share  BRCM would need to grow NOPAT by 8  compounded annually for 12 years  For a company with no track record of sustained growth  such a high long term growth expectation makes BRCM a risky bet  296 stocks of the 3000  I cover are classified as Information Technology stocks  but due to style drift  Information Technology ETFs and mutual funds hold 605 stocks  Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all Information Technology ETFs and mutual funds  Figure 4  Separating the Best ETFs From the Worst ETFsSources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsFigure 5

177513,399029,IBM,Rockwell Trading CEO Heitkoetter  A Simple  Timeless Trading Strategy ,opinion,On Wednesday  May 1st I had the opportunity to interview Markus Heitkoetter  CEO of Rockwell Trading  Markus and I have a similar background as we both came out of the Technology Industry and decided to devote ourselves to trading  Markus worked for IBM  out of Germany and I served with SAP in the United States  Ironically he worked for an American based company in Europe and I worked with a German based firm in the United States  We both recall when SAP launched mysap com in the late 1990 s  Markus  story is unique in that he wasn t born in the US but is living proof that anyone with the drive  desire and perseverance can succeed in the trading world  Markus decided in the early 2000 s that he was going to change his career and get involved with online trading  He has since started Rockwell Trading based out of Texas and has devoted the last dozen years to helping and mentoring new and novice traders to the world of online trading  We spoke about this at length during our discussion as I asked him about the importance of coaching  He mentioned that in Europe and other parts of the world any profession has an apprenticeship program that can last for years  I seem to recall that when I worked with Canadians they had mentioned the same thing  He mentioned that he liked to play golf but didn t really get proficient at it until he hired a coach  In his words  when you watch TV and see a professional do it  it looks so easy and you think you can do it yourself  but the whole purpose of using a coach is that they can point what you re doing wrong  so you can correct it   This gives testimony to fact that most traders don t succeed  They read a book  watch a video and think  wow  I can do that   But they don t pay attention to the details of trading  Conversely Europeans take a more systematic approach in that they trade with a plan  Markus does not use  exotic  indicators in his approach  Rather he uses indicators that are readily available or should be available with any charting package chosen  One of the things I ve noticed over the years is his strategies and techniques are simple yet for lack of a better word  timeless   They are universal and readily understandable by anyone  On a personal note  one of my techniques is to use renko bars in tandem with trading  Why  Because renko bars liken to range bars use a preset number of ticks  4  5  etc   for each bar such that you will know what the next bar will open up at  This is very different from using a minute chart as with a minute chart the range can differ dramatically  They can go up  down  sideways and flat or choppy  This makes trading very erratic as you re wondering  where do I get in  at what price should I go long or short   Markus has developed a strategy called the Ping Pong that helps to alleviate that problem  In it he uses range bars as a way and means of determining where someone should enter the market and where they could potentially exit  This is only one of many strategies developed  I use a similar technique except I use renko bars  A simple  yet timeless technique  We spoke at length concerning Rockwell Trading and what they do  Markus offers a 296 page eBook called  The Complete Guide to Day Trading  and it discusses every aspect of trading that every trader should know  I recall earlier versions of this book and it made me aware of what I needed to think about and consider  I would strongly recommend this eBook to any new or novice trader as the people at Rockwell are very forthright and will tell you exactly what it takes to be a successful trader  Even an experienced trader can benefit from the eBook as it can make them aware of mistakes made  methods to improve  etc  Any aspiring entrepreneur can benefit from listening to this interview as it details one person s journey to the freedom of trading  My interview with Markus can be viewed at   We all have different reasons for trading but one universal truth that is common amongst all traders is the freedom we enjoy  Freedom from economic servitude  freedom to choose  If Markus and his team at Rockwell Trading represent anything  it is that and if that s the case Rockwell will be around for a long time  Nick Mastrandrea is the author of Market Tea Leaves  Market Tea Leaves is a free  daily newsletter that discuses and teaches market correlation  Market Tea Leaves is published daily  pre market in the United States and can be viewed at  Feel free to visit and subscribe ,2013-05-08,Nick Mastrandrea,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/rockwell-trading-ceo-heitkoetter:-a-simple,-timeless-trading-strategy-166093",166093
177546,399062,IBM,Can Apple Save Technology ETFs ,opinion,After the market closes on Tuesday  April 23  the world will turn its attention to the previously untarnished Apple  APPL   Its epic downward spiral from  700 per share to a sub  400 price is largely responsible for the relative under performance of Technology ETFs  Below  the Vanguard Information Technology  VGT  S P 500 price ratio demonstrates the trend Over the last week  however  a different tech bellwether deserves the lion s share of the blame  IBM s  IBM  share price eroded 11  due in large part to a high profile  miss  on revenue and earnings  Unfortunately for exchange traded enthusiasts  the company has an over sized weighting in a number of Technology ETFs as well as the Dow What is particularly troubling about the IBM weighting is the history of the corporation s share price with the broader market  According to Bespoke Investment Group  IBM earnings reports tell investors where the market is heading over the next 5 weeks with a 75  success rate  Over the last 5 quarters  the success rate is actually 100   On the three occasions that IBM s stock price rose after reporting  the S P 500 gained ground  on the two occasions that IBM s stock price fell after reporting  the S P 500 lost value over the following 5 week period In other words  the broader market may already be set up for failure in the last week of April and the month of May  It follows that Technology ETFs with heavy IBM exposure may be particularly vulnerable There is a wild card  however  What if Apple  APPL  defies critics as well as months of extraordinary selling pressure  What if iPhone  iPad as well as Mac desktops and laptops blow past sales expectations  What if revenue based margins at the heart of profitability improved dramatically from Q1 to Q2 If it happens  Apple might be able to reclaim some of its former glory  Moreover  with Apple s prominent weighting in Tech ETFs  one may see the sector demonstrate resilience in spite of IBM s recent woes Of course  for the market to respond favorably to upcoming earnings  a large number of  what ifs  need to occur  Do I believe that Apple will impress  No  I do not  Nevertheless  it s vital to recognize that the perception of Apple s numbers will likely set the tone for Tech ETFs in the months ahead  As it stands  SPDR Select Technology  XLK  is already flirting with a long term downtrend  the current price for XLK is struggling to stay above a 200 day moving average  If the i Everything maker fails its upcoming exam  Technology ETF aficionados would likely need to utilize their exit strategy Disclosure  Gary Gordon  MS  CFP is the president of Pacific Park Financial  Inc   a Registered Investment Adviser with the SEC  Gary Gordon  Pacific Park Financial  Inc  and or its clients may hold positions in the ETFs  mutual funds  and or any investment asset mentioned above  The commentary does not constitute individualized investment advice  The opinions offered herein are not personalized recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities  At times  issuers of exchange traded products compensate Pacific Park Financial  Inc  or its subsidiaries for advertising at the ETF Expert web site  ETF Expert content is created independently of any advertising relationships ,2013-04-23,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-apple-save-technology-etfs-164079,164079

177603,399119,IBM,You Don t Have To Own The Index  Sector Allocation,opinion,Pundits are once again commenting on the difference in performance between the Canadian and American markets  and no wonder  Since the market bottom four years ago  the S P 500 has gained 136   while the TSX has risen 70   only about half as much  Why the big difference  and what  if anything  should we do about it In order to make a decision  it is first necessary to understand how stock indices are put together  Each of the S P 500 and the TSX Index are called  market cap weighted  indexes  Here is how the S P works  Each of the 500 largest public companies in the United States is included in the index  Each company is given a  weight  or proportion in the index reflecting its market value compared to that of the entire index  At the moment  the most valuable company in the United States is Exxon Mobil  Its market capitalization is about  406 billion  The market value of all 500 companies put together is about  14 trillion  meaning that Exxon Mobil represents about 3  of the value of the whole market  The twenty most valuable companies in the U S  together make up about 30  of the whole index If the shares of Exxon Mobil went up 1  one day  the effect on the S P 500 would be to move the index up by only 3  of 1   or 0 03    or  45 points on the S P  If all the 20 biggest stocks went up by 1   they would move the index by 20  or 1  or  2   equal to 3 15 points The TSX works the same way  but with two very important differences  The first difference is that the top twenty Canadian companies make up 42  of the index  This is much more concentrated than the S P 500 at 30   The second big difference is the industry concentration By far the biggest sector in the TSX is the financial industry  making up over 18  of the top twenty  This compares to less than 6  in the S P 500  making the big banks and insurers three times as important in Canada  The second biggest sector in Canada  not surprisingly  is energy  making up almost 10  of our top twenty  compared to just over 4  in the U S  Finally  the materials sector is very important in Canada  making up 5  of our biggest stocks  compared to a zero weighting in the S P As crucial as what is big in Canada is what is absent altogether  The biggest sector in the S P top twenty stocks is technology  Composed of names like Apple  IBM and Google  these stocks comprise about 8  in the U S   while only 1  here  Healthcare makes up 4  of the big S P stocks  compared to zero weight in Canada Given these changes in the composition of the two indices  it is not hard to understand why they can move very differently  Technology and healthcare have been two very hot sectors since the market crash  and account for a large part of the move in the S P 500  Four years ago Apple was at  82 compared to  436 now  Google was at  289 compared to  814 today  and IBM has moved from  83 to  214  At the same time Canadian commodity heavyweights have done very little for investors  with giant oil company Suncor moving from  23 to  31  fertilizer maker Potash going from  28 to  40  and Canada s largest gold company Barrick actually declining from  33 to  31 The difference in sector weightings and the varying fortunes of  for example  energy vs  technology or gold vs  healthcare  explain why some times the TSX beats the S P 500  and other times trails  However  from a portfolio management standpoint  it is crucial to understand that investing in Canada does not mean that a portfolio must mirror the makeup of the TSX index  just as a U S  portfolio need not look like the S P 500 At present  our clients have no precious metal stocks  although they make up a big part of the TSX  About 9  of our equity holdings are in the Canadian banks and insurers  although they make up over 20  of the market  and our energy exposure is a meager 3  compared to over 30  for the entire Toronto market  Building a portfolio that looks very different from the TSX index has given our clients results that do not reflect that index In our view a manager adds value by sector allocation as much as by picking stocks within each sector  It is not helpful  for example  to have the best gold stock if the entire sector is plummeting  For this reason we pay no attention to the market weight of each sector within the TSX index  as we have no desire to mirror its performance  Our investment process starts by picking sectors we believe will do well  avoiding ones we think will do poorly  and follows by finding the best companies to buy within the sectors we like  In 2012 each of our equity holding asset allocation strategies had a return which exceeded its benchmark  and the same has been true for the first quarter of 2013

177635,399151,IBM,Why HFTs Are Not A Problem ,opinion,Many people are concerned about the fact that some people can trade more frequently than they can due to having a large infrastructure of high speed computers and connections to various exchanges  It all seems like regular people can get ripped off  and so some kind of governance is needed via transaction taxes  or some limits on the trade frequency This is all unnecessary  If you are concerned about being gamed by high frequency traders  aka HFT   there s a pretty simple way to avoid this  Simply trade using Volume Weighted Average Price  VWAP  orders  Say you decide on Sunday  after doing all sorts of research over the weekend  that you want to buy IBM  If you are buying less than 1  of ADV  your effect on the price is positive to be sure  but spread out over the day  not quick enough or with a high enough certainty that one would want to front run you  ie  it s not sufficiently greater than the spread to be worth buying in the morning and selling at close   Further  any information that might give a HFT a millisecond advantage within they day will be randomly because you can t predict the sign of such innovations hours in advance  so HFT shenanigans are irrelevant to you  they aren t biased in any direction Widows and orphans can execute VWAP orders now  and then benefit from any benefits in a perceived case where trading is simply done at a central auction once a day  Yet with this solution no one is constrained  no one has to monitor or regulate anyone  The solution exists currently and is available to everyone who want to avoid HFT  Real investors shouldn t be day trading  but making longer term decisions based on a longer term analysis of the trends  and in that case they can trade as if HFT didn t exist without any new rules ,2013-02-14,Eric Falkenstein,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-hfts-are-not-a-problem-155288,155288

177705,399221,IBM,Signs That A Correction May Be Near In The SPX  RUT And DJIA,opinion,The great market prognosticators have by now came out with their 2013 predictions about financial markets  It seems to me to be a fool s game to try to predict what financial markets are going to do in the future I want to be clear in stating that I do not know what is going to happen in the future  I do not know where the S P 500 Index is going to trade tomorrow let alone 6 months from now  Most market pundits simply will not admit to this fact These same market pundits seemingly are unable to be honest about their own fallibility  In their own mind they believe it undermines their credibility or will hurt their forward sales for some book or strategy they are going to unveil  I for one do not prescribe to that notion  I believe in telling the truth The truth is that these so called market experts do not know anymore than you or I about price action in the distant future  However  what I do know is that forward price action remains a mystery until its unveiled in the present Instead of wasting time discussing potential price action in the future  why not focus on a few pieces of information that have occurred that are known facts right now  I think the chart below points out that in the intermediate time frame  equity indexes are reaching extreme overbought conditions As can be seen above  the number of stocks trading above their 50 period moving averages is reaching close to the highest levels in the past 5 years  Many times when these price levels have been reached we witness a correction at the very least and any short term gains are usually given back in short order  This is not to say that prices are going to sell off tomorrow or in the next few weeks  however it is a warning that a correction is likely lurking in the not so distant future To help confirm this notion  a quick look at the Volatility Index  VIX  demonstrates just how much complacency there is in the short term spot VIX price which is currently trading below 5 year lows  For novice readers when the VIX moves lower the outcome is typically bullish for the S P 500 Index and when the VIX moves higher the reaction is typically bearish in terms of the S P 500 Index As can be seen above  the VIX is trading near the bottom of its recent range  This helps confirm the strength we have seen the past few weeks  however a reversal seems likely in the near future  Should the VIX pick up considerably it would have a negative impact on the S P 500 Index  Furthermore  if we go out several months in time the Volatility Index Term Structure steepens wildly What this means is that traders and money managers have bid up forward VIX contracts in an attempt to hedge against a variety of perceived risk  I would also point out that at the moment February monthly options contracts are cheap relative to their historical volatility levels  However  the VIX could rally violently higher should the appropriate chain of events take place in the months ahead There are several catalysts in the short term which will have a major impact on price action for the broader indexes  This coming week we will have earnings from major companies such as IBM  AAPL  and GOOG which all have the potential to move the tape significantly in either direction The other more obvious short term inflection point is the dreaded U S  debt ceiling debacle which is likely to begin permeating the financial media as the deadline for action draws near  In recent history both houses of Congress and the Executive Branch have struggled to achieve compromise until the 11th hour  The fiscal cliff was one issue  but the debt ceiling issue has the potential to have a major impact on financial markets Just to put into context what happened back in 2011 when Congress could not reach a compromise regarding a debt ceiling increase  the S P 500 Index had the following reaction as shown below Obviously there are significant unknowns regarding how the debt ceiling process will unfold in 2013  However  what is known is that should the politicians wait until the 11th hour equity indexes could force their hands yet again Additionally the threat of credit rating agencies downgrading U S  government debt is a major concern  The outcome of this decision alone has the potential to devastate investment portfolios should the government have a partial shutdown as a result of a failure to reach an agreement regarding the debt ceiling What is important to understand is that the longer term price action in the future is impossible to know at this point  We have major earnings reports which are about to be released over the next few weeks which presents significant risks to the broader indexes in both directions  Furthermore we have a major macro event that is facing us and will have to be addressed in the next 5   8 weeks The outcome of these events as this point is entirely unknown  I would also point out that in 2011 prior to the debt ceiling debacle we saw equity prices rally higher in late June of 2011 while the VIX traded down near recent lows at that time  After a period of consolidation equity indexes remained patient and gave the politicians time Eventually the price action in risk assets forced both political parties and the President to come together  As shown in the chart above  the S P 500 lost nearly 19  in less than 4 weeks of trading sessions  Even the most skeptical politician was forced into submission by Wall Street and the financial media Will history rhyme with the recent past  Will we see a compromise in advance of the dreaded shutdown date  Will the debt ceiling outcome create a major paradigm shift in U S  financial markets and U S  politics Unfortunately  there is no one that can tell us with any certainty what is about to happen in the next 5   8 weeks  let alone later this year  After all of the forthcoming analysis and discussion in the weeks ahead  price action will continue to remain a mystery until the debt ceiling situation is behind us  Until then  caution is warranted in both price directions  Trade safe ,2013-01-23,Chris

177779,399295,IBM,Tuesday Uncertain  Bias Higher ,opinion,The Hoot  Actionable ideas for the busy trader delivered daily right up front Tuesday uncertain  bias higherES pivot 1426 00  Holding above is bullish Rest of week bias higher technically Monthly outlook  bias lower ES Fantasy Trader standing aside Recap  Wow  it sure looked like my call for a higher close was going to look pretty foolish today with the Dow sinking ever lower all morning and through lunch time   until a late day rally appeared to save the day  OK  so the close was only 2 points higher but that sure beats 100  points lower  Whatever the cause  I ll take it  Now let s move on to Tuesday as we beat the charts into submission until they tell us what we want to hear   The technicals  daily   The Dow  I m not quite sure what that late day rally was on about   I was out running errands at the time  But it was enough to create a deep doji star  almost a dragonfly doji  Either way  it s a pretty good bullish reversal indicator  We did poke through the lower BB intraday but recovered  However  the indicators are still only halfway from overbought to oversold and we re now sitting right on the edge of a long running rising RTC all the way back to June 4th  Technically we closed outside it yesterday for a bearish setup and today s trade was entirely outside for a bearish trigger  However  given that it s a weekly RTC  I m willing to give it a pass for a day or two to see if the Dow can manage to bounce back  We ll want to see a close above 13 380 on Tuesday to cancel this bearish signal   The VIX  Of all the charts tonight  the VIX has the clearest picture  a 2 58  drop on a classic dark cloud cover that just touched the 200 day MA before backing off  It s also our second day on the upper BB and the VIX rarely spends more than that before declining  I d have to say the VIX is moving lower on Tuesday   Market index futures  Tonight all three futures are down at 1 09 AM EDT with ES lower by 0 12   After yesterday s big dump  ES today gave us a small DCB style green hammer  pretty much what I was expecting  However  the stochastic still hasn t moved into position for a bullish crossover and the overnight action isn t showing much enthusiasm at this point  possibly on fallout from the last  thank God  presidential debate   ES daily pivot  Tonight the pivot rises from 13433 67 to 1426 00 even  And even though ES is currently down a bit  this means that we re now above the new pivot  a positive sign   Dollar index  Today the dollar gave us a rare  almost textbook perfect three candle pattern known as side by side white lines  This is a high reliability bullish continuation pattern and is confirmed by rising indicators and a lack of any near term resistance for the    I d have to say this chart looks set to move higher again   Euro  The euro stopped its two day slide today with an unusual gain on a day that the dollar also moved up  The new candle forming in the overnight is a red gap up spinning top indicating a possibility that the euro may move lower on Tuesday  However  this candle is now outside the descending RTC for a bullish setup and the stochastic seems to be narrowing to set up a bullish crossover from a high level  That all makes this chart too hard to call   Transportation  Unlike the Dow  the trans continued lower today  but like the Dow they gave us a reversal candle in the form of a decent hammer  But also like the Dow  the indicators are still descending from overbought so we ll want some confirmation of this hammer before calling the trans higher   Sentiment  Once again it s time for the latest weekly TickerSense Blogger Sentiment Poll  We continue to track the poll to see how well it performs  Here s the updated cumulative list for this year  Again  the SPX number is the closing price of the S P on the Friday before each new poll comes out  The  NightOwl  column is how I voted  Since the poll is for 30 days out  after the first four weeks we re able to see how well we did  This week we see that my bullish call on 9 24 was wrong again  the S P now being lower than then  I m using the column  Accuracy  to track my calls  So now with 9 weeks to go in 2012  I m 23 for 39 or 59    For the record  I voted bearish again on this weeks poll  I note that the weekly SPX chart exited its rising RTC going back to June for a bearish setup last week  So far this week we re still outside  Unless the SPX can trade above 1460 by Friday that will be a bearish trigger  And moving out to the SPX monthly  so far the current candle has also dropped out of its rising RTC for a bearish setup there  I just can t be bullish in the face of that kind of statistics   Hmmm   the market seems to be trying to set up a rally but is being a bit uncoordinated about it  On the plus side  the VIX  the trans  and the ES pivot are looking positive  Also bellwether IBM seems to be bottoming here  On the other hand  the dollar  and copper are looking negative  Meanwhile  the Dow and the trans are looking like possible reversal candidates that require confirmation   On the other hand  Rob Hanna  who I respect greatly  put up some convincing numbers of a coming rally  On the other other hand  J Trader is part short  part cash  All of which just leaves me scratching my head tonight like the  before  picture in a Head   Shoulders ad  I d like to call it long but I think it s a bit premature  On still yet another hand  I can t see going short at these levels either so I ll just have to settle for calling Tuesday uncertain but I ll throw in a bias higher  I think we ll have more clarity for Wednesday   ES Fantasy Trader  Portfolio stats  with no trade last night the account remains at  193 875 after 68 trades  53 wins  15 losses  starting from  100 000 on 1 1 12  Tonight we stand aside amid so much uncertainty   no edge here  nothing to see  move along    CUA  Commonly Used Acronyms   BB   Bollinger Bands DCB   Dead

177891,399407,IBM,Forget Libor gate  Oil Market Manipulation Is Far Worse ,opinion,Since the Global Community all the sudden seems to be preoccupied with Market manipulation even though the authorities knew it was a problem for over 5 years with   It is high time authorities look at the Crude Oil market which has been  for the last decade and all the sophisticated participants know it is rigged or artificially higher than the fundamentals of the economy dictate  Consumers are paying an easy  35 dollars per barrel over what they would otherwise doll out for a barrel of oil  if fund managers didn t use the benchmark futures contracts as their own personal ATMs   Just a month ago Crude Oil WTI was  78 a barrel and today it is  93  Do you think the fundamentals changed one bit to merit this price swing  Nope  Supply levels are all at record highs around the world  Is it Iran  Please   It is all about the money flows  nobody takes delivery anymore  Assets have become one big correlated risk trade  Risk On  Risk Off  If the Dow is up a hundred  you can bet crude is up at least a dollar  It has nothing to do with fundamentals  inventory levels  supply disruptions  etc  It is all about fund flows  So how this affects the average Joe is that if Wall Street is having a good day  i e   fund flows are going in  then Average Joe is having a bad day and paying more for Gas  Yes  it is that simple  A good day for Wall Street is a bad day for consumers at the pump these days as Capital flows into one big Asset Trade  Risk On  It should be separate in that equities respond to stock valuations  and energy responds to the market conditions of supply and demand  But that isn t the case in the investing world today  it is all about Capital Flows in and out of Assets  The economy could be doing really poorly  Oil inventories can be extremely high  the economic data very bleak but Oil will go up and consumers will pay more at the pump just because some Fund Manager pours capital into a futures contract  The Fund Managers goals are in direct opposition to the consumers who actually uses the product  Funds flows and not supply and demand ultimately carry the day in the energy markets  and that needs to change  The key is equities  crude oil  both Brent and WTI  are essentially equities for Fund Managers to trade in and out of and they make a fortune in these instruments  When I refer to Fund Managers this includes Hedge Funds  Oil Majors  Pension Funds  Investment Banks etc  This is part of the reason that the price of oil can be so varied in value within a 3 month span  WTI can literally be  110 one month and  80 the next because of pure funds going in or coming out of the futures contracts  The volatility really is where they make their money  they have deep pockets and they make a fortune moving crude oil around like a puppet on a string  If you think in terms of each dollar price move in the commodity being equal to  1 000 and the size that these players employ on a monthly and quarterly basis you start to see the value of buying thousands and thousands of futures contracts and capitalizing on these huge moves in the commodity  Start out a quarter at  80 a barrel   buy a bunch of futures contracts and put them in the portfolio along with your other holdings like Apple  IBM  and Johnson and Johnson and run them up just like any other asset class in the first quarter to hit your numbers  Use the media to  or any other potential supply disruption scenario and Voila you end the quarter at  110 and you have made far more gains in your Crude Oil asset class than lowly Apple by comparison  It s the biggest game on Wall Street  Notice how European equities are at 11 week highs and look at the Spike in the Brent contract  Fund managers pump money into these asset classes and once earnings are over  they will pull their money out so they are not left holding the bag when the damage to the economy ensues as consumers and the economy slows due to the burden of artificially high Oil prices on discretionary income  The economic downturn has a lot of negative effects  and consumers should be benefitting from lower fuel costs as a result of slower economic conditions  However  Fund Managers will not let the Fundamental Oil Price take hold in the market place  their gain is consumer s loss  Right now Oil prices should be at least  75 a barrel based on current supply levels  and the facts regarding near recessionary levels of unemployment  weak manufacturing  and constrained housing production taking place in the economic landscape  Gas prices are not matching the GDP numbers or the capacity utilization rate of business activity in the economy  But Fund managers are laughing all the way to their Hamptons and Connecticut mansions while average  Joe Blow Consumer  has to pawn household items or charge up their credit cards to fill up their gas tanks each week  This Oil manipulation is really putting a crimp on consumers and makes it extremely difficult to get this recovery off the ground because just as the economy starts recovering fund managers slap it back down with their run up of oil prices  This leads to growth being constrained and even sputtering  consumers start reeling  and the entire supply chain is negatively affected because of these artificially high energy prices  The fund managers then dump their holdings and short the market  and the entire cycle starts over every three to six months or so  The volatility is great for them  but really hurts economic stability  Also  this is one major reason why a  because it just adds fuel to this process  And any benefits to the economy are quickly offset by even more inflated energy prices  The Fed giveth on one hand  and the Economy suffers on the other hand  A no win situation which Ben Bernanke is well aware of from the last failed attempt in QE2 which just plays right in line with the ideal Fund Manager strategy of manipulating price by creating artificial demand through paper trading of markets  The last thing they need is more paper to artificially accumulate positions and distort market prices to an even greater extent  Hopefully  Ben Bernanke and crew have learned their lesson is this regard  which it is hard to target a QE Program without artificially inflating all assets  even those that are essential to everyday living  and end up hurting the very people that you are trying to help  In this case  Fed Policy would be a contributing factor towards the same Market Price Distortion of Fund Managers that ultimately needs to be fixed   So what is the solution to all this madness  Everybody in the market knows the culprits  so why doesn t this practice ever get addressed  The same reason Libor manipulation went on for so long  all the watchdogs are completely incompetent or lobbied to death on these financial matters  Obama tried to squash the fund managers with the SPR release  but even then word got out long before the actual lever was pulled  and it took 2 months to coordinate  Can you say too little too late  Consumers were already paying  4 gas for months before any action was carried out  Day Trading isn t even the problem here it is the buy and holders who accumulate large positions for swing trading that ultimately do the real damage and price distortion in the Oil Markets  Legitimate regulation on Fund Managers who accumulate and hold these large positions in the form of enforcing delivery obligations would clear up this malfeasance real fast  I guarantee you if it was a requirement for any Fund Participant to take delivery of any Futures contract held more than 3 days that there would be a significant re pricing in the Oil market  as well as adding price stability as true market conditions would dictate price  And based upon actual inventory levels over the last 5 years  this suggests price should have been very stable as inventories have not fluctuated much during this era  Even with all the turbulence here and there  actual supply has never been an issue with inventory levels all near the highs of the 5 year range for this period  Day Traders can continue to practice their craft in the Oil markets because it can be argued that they don t move price significantly  and actually create better pricing by adding liquidity to the market for participants if they actually did need to hedge production or set up physical delivery of the commodity  An example would be an Airline getting a fair price when they enter the market to hedge price due to an active Day Trading market  So the next time you fill up your gas tank  just realize that this price is an artificially high fixed  manipulated price due to the Position Trading of the Fund Managers  Libor Gate pales in comparison to the actual pass through effects of price manipulation in the Oil Markets  If you think Consumers are being screwed by artificially fixed Libor Rates  and Politicians have finally stepped forward after years of abuse and neglect  then you should really be outraged by the Oil Price Manipulation  Consumers have been paying on average for the last five years by conservative estimates a good 35  over fair market prices for Oil related products due to this Manipulation on behalf of Position Traders  Again  I label the group with the catch all term  Fund Managers  defined earlier in this piece  but I am not referring to just the standard definition of Fund Manger  Any Market participant who accumulates a large position and holds over time which results in the distortion of market mechanism price discovery due to not actually taking physical delivery of the commodity is inclusive of this label  Fund Manager  and part of the problem that needs to be addressed  So how long will it take politicians and the CFTC to address this manipulative practice that is a decade in the making in the Oil Markets   My guess is it will just continue as usual because regulators and politicians are either corrupt or incompetent to address the issue and consumers are too busy working their ass off to even have the time or energy to revolt against this practice  There isn t a  Gotcha  moment like Libor Gate  rather just a slow steady business practice that drains consumers of their resources like just another societal Tax on their consumption  A repugnant tax I am calling attention to  the  Gotcha Bells  should start resonating in policy holders  ears  and they should finally start addressing this seedy Oil Market and its blatant Market

177893,399409,IBM,Economic Fundamentals Mirror America s Frail Recovery,opinion,Up until early Q3  the slowdown in the US economy evidently persisted as factory activity in the nation contracted in July for a third straight month along with new claims for jobless aid  revealing a surge from last week s performance  Meanwhile  other reports showed home re sales slumped to their lowest level in eight months in June and a gauge of future economic activity slipped last month  As a result  the data confirms that the economy has cooled off pretty considerably late in Q2 and early in Q3 from the pace economists saw earlier in the year The US has been hit by fears of deep government spending cuts and higher taxes next year  as well as troubles from the debt crisis in Europe  which culminates in slower job growth  weak consumer spending and soft manufacturing output  The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index for the mid Atlantic region came in at a reading of  12 9 points in July compared with  16 6 points last month  which still reflects the frail health of manufacturing as a reading below zero indicates contraction in output in factories in eastern Pennsylvania  southern New Jersey and Delaware New orders also noted a drop for a third consecutive month  and a gauge of employment declined sharply to a near three year low  Growth in US factory output slowed to a 1 4 percent annual rate in Q2 after a brisk 9 8 percent pace in the first three months of the year  which led the Philadelphia Fed s regional factory index to suggest a continued loss of momentum It is perceived that the biggest factor weighing on the recovery of the US is the fear that politicians in Washington would be unable to avoid the so called fiscal cliff at the turn of the year  While there are real issues out there  such as Europe  what seems to be the overarching factor driving business decisions is the fear of a fiscal fiasco Gridlock is believed to be no longer just a political game  It is having real economic effects  Until business leaders can plan with more certainty  there is little chance the economy can accelerate to a solid pace Recently  US stocks shrugged off the four economic data and rose for a third straight day  with the Standard   Poor s index touching a 2 1 2 year high as IBM gave an upbeat outlook and eBay posted stronger than expected earnings  Prices for US government bonds fell and the US dollar dropped to a six week low against the Japanese yen as worries about the eurozone debt crisis weighed  With the economy showing little vigor  economists say the chances of the Fed launching a third round of bond purchases were on the rise  After believing that economic conditions have not deteriorated sufficiently to push the Federal Reserve over the edge  the odds of further policy action being taken in the near term have clearly risen  reflecting the tepid growth of the US economy ,2012-07-21,Aviv N.

177894,399410,IBM,4 Steps To Identify Institutional Gaps ,opinion,Many traders look at the morning gaps and wonder how they can play the move  Often novice traders and investors will simply buy every gap higher that they see  They will most often believe that the gap higher is a breakout and the stock will continue to rally  Here are a few simple rules that can help to identify the difference between a strong gap  institutional sponsorship  and weak gap  institutional fake out  when examining the charts  It is important to remember that the institution money moves stocks  as traders we simply want to be on the right side of that move 1  Strong gaps higher  institutional sponsorship  will usually occur from basing patterns and over sold conditions  Look at the example of IBM  NYSE IBM  below  this stock formed a nice two week consolidation pattern before gapping higher after earnings  These gap patterns should not be sold short  instead they can most often be bought 2  Often the institutional traders gap a stock up from an extended and overbought chart position  This move by the institutions is a way to get the novice or amateur trader to buy stock from them at highs  institutional fake out   Look at the example of WHR  NYSE WHR  below  The institutions sold right to retail investor at the high  This is why it is important to not chase stocks  This gap can be sold short by traders who identify the pattern 3  The same rules are reversed when looking at stocks that are gapped lower  When a stock declines from a strong technical chart position it is a sign that the institutions are unloading their holdings  These stocks will not recover quickly and will often decline further in the coming days  Look at the example of Riverbed Tech  NASDAQ RVBD  below  the institutions sold every up tick in the stock  These stocks should not be bought until they give an indication that the institutions are accumulating 4 The institutional traders will often gap a stock lower from an already oversold chart condition only to buy the stock cheaper from the weak handed retail trader  Look at the chart of Goldman Sachs below  you can clearly see how the stock was washed out in the near term  Traders can usually buy this stock with a small stop loss below the gap low It is not always easy to identify institutional gap sponsorship or institutional gap fake outs  Traders that are interested in trading the morning gaps should test these patterns and methods over the next few months  These methods when accompanied with good money management will usually provide a good risk reward trade  Please remember  all patterns can and will fail from time to time  As traders all we can do is try to put the odds in our favor and use stops on all positions  Once we have the odds in our favor  trading becomes much easier  and the profits will follow ,2012-07-25,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-steps-to-identify-institutional-gaps-130737,130737
177895,399411,IBM,Using Volatility To Trade IBM Using Options,opinion,One of the hallmarks of an option based trading approach is the ability to accommodate various market conditions by varying the specific construction of your option trade in order to maximize the probability of success In order to form a logical basis for trade selection  it is best to think in terms of each of the three primary forces impacting option pricing  price of the underlying  time to expiration  and implied volatility For option traders  one of the fundamental characteristics of the current market is the extremely low implied volatility  The new trader could reasonably pose the question  How would I know that   There are several answers to that question First  the most widely followed indicator of implied volatility is the Volatility Index  VIX   This somewhat arcane calculation reflects the implied volatility of the S P 500 index options and as such is a useful barometer of the overall market volatility  Its current daily chart is included here for reference  Suffice it to say that it is currently at very low levels Less generally known is that there exist volatility indexes for several of the less broadly followed indices such as the Russell 2000 Index  RUT  whose volatility symbol is RVX  The Powershares QQQ ETF also has its very own volatility index in symbol QQV  These less broadly based calculations are particularly useful when the implied volatility of a specific index is not congruent with the general measures of volatility Yet another layer of granularity in volatility calculations exist in a few underlying assets for which the CBOE calculates a volatility level  these include   AAPL  symbol VXAPL  AMZN  symbol VXAZN  GS  symbol VXGS  and GOOG  symbol VXGOG Another stock for which this index is calculated is IBM  symbol VXIBM  Its current chart is presented below Not only is the IBM implied volatility currently at very low levels  it is substantially less than the actual historic volatility  labeled SV in chart below  and in fact it demonstrates the largest downward divergence from historic volatility we have seen this year For the option trader  the take home message from this assessment of the current state of implied volatility is that negative vega trades  trades that are inversely impacted by increases or decreases in implied volatility  face a stiff headwind here Probabilities strongly favor both a convergence of historic and implied volatilities and return of the current low values of volatility to its historic mean for IBM Most option traders usually prefer to enter negative vega trades because this type of trade construction usually benefits from the inevitable and unavoidable passage of time Examples of such trades would be naked short puts  butterflies  and iron condors  While such trades are not absolutely contraindicated in the current environment  they are not trade structures we would choose as a first choice Let us consider for discussion one of the positive vega trades available in order to increase the probability for a successful outcome  The trade I would like to demonstrate is known as a horizontal spread  a time spread  or most commonly a calendar spread The fundamental logic of this spread is to sell a rapidly decaying shorter dated option and buy a longer dated  more slowly decaying option at the same strike price  The specific strikes for the trade are selected so that the short option is out of the money in order to avoid the potential complication of early assignment An example of such a trade using the August and September monthly options at the 205 strike is presented below and reflects a mildly bullish price hypothesis for IBM Several points of general applicability for calendar spreads deserve emphasis  Our IBM example has 10 days of total duration and for this example we will be looking at a 10 lot trade costing  1 490 Most importantly the IBM Calendar Spread reaches maximum profitability at expiration when the underlying is at the strike price  This characteristic is clearly seen in the broken lines on the P L graph which gradually rise to meet the solid expiration P L line  I would also point out that the IBM trade has a positive vega of 166 meaning that for every 1 point increase in volatility  the trade profits  166 The last point of emphasis and what is not immediately apparent from this graph is the potential for additional profit  As expiration of the August 205 call we are short approaches  there exists the ability to sell additional premium in the weekly calls which would then be available As with all option trades  it is important to understand crisply the risk of the trade since we can only arrange probabilities in our favor  there are no guarantees of profit This trade has a defined maximum risk of the cost incurred to enter the trade  This is the level of absolute maximum risk that has a low probability of occurring since we have the ability to sell additional premium to reduce this outcome or to simply close the trade should market conditions change This IBM Calendar Spread is just one example of using the current market conditions to put the wind at your back as an option trader  I invite you to visit our website and try our service to see these ideas in action ,2012-08-09,J.W.

177921,399437,IBM,Q A With Jim Rogers And Greyson Colvin,opinion,Journal of Indexes caught up with some of the best known names in commodities to discuss investor concerns around the space  Jim Rogers  Commodities Investor  JOI  Given that leading commodities indexes like the S P GSCI and DJ UBS are so different  does beta really exist in the commodities market  If so  what is it    Rogers  The major commodity indexes change dramatically every year  which is a reason that you cannot capture any beta  instead  you capture somebody s construction of an index  I don t know if you re aware of it  but the S P GSCI changes every year  Over three or four years  it changes very dramatically  That s true of all those indexes  In that sense  there is no beta  You re capturing performance more than anything else  If something goes up a lot  then the S P increases its weighting in the index  I don t even know what that captures  as a matter of fact  If there s any way to capture beta  you need a stable  consistent  transparent index that doesn t change a lot    JOI  Are index based investments  and investing overall  affecting commodity prices    Rogers  Essentially  in my index or any index  you would buy the future this month  and you sell it again next month  Or you sell it when it matures  So that may have some slight temporary effect on the actual cost  but it doesn t have much long term effect    You can see that  for instance  with stock indexes and this is a very important differentiation  The stock index or stock funds take delivery  If the SPY buys one million shares of IBM  they take them off the market  and they re not available  That obviously affects the price of IBM  But if the S P GSCI buys oil  they don t take it off the market  They buy the future  and then they turn around and sell the future a month later  The oil is never taken off the market  in other words  They don t really have too much of an effect on the actual price of the underlying commodity  other than perhaps a temporary effect in the marketplace when they re buying or selling the futures  While the prices of futures and commodity prices themselves usually move in the same direction  there can be differences    JOI  What is the near  and longer term outlook for commodities    Rogers  Commodities are essentially a bull market because of supply problems  and that bull market has a few more years to go  in my view  Previous bull markets in commodities have lasted 18 20 years or so  but we still have several years to go  because you don t have new supply coming in  Eventually  all bull markets in the past have ended because supply has come into line and outstripped consumption  Then the price goes down until supply and demand fall out of balance again  So far  you don t see much new supply of any commodities coming on stream  In fact  the supply situation for some commodities is extremely serious  For instance  in agriculture  the average age of farmers in America is 58  In Japan it s 66  And farmers around the world are dying out  We have serious  serious supply problems facing us in agriculture    In other commodities  the same problems exist  With oil  unless something happens pretty quickly  the supply problems are going to get much worse  Eventually  all other bull markets have ended  but I don t see this one ending yet    JOI  Should individual investors be able to purchase commodities futures exposure without a gating mechanism  Do we need stricter position limits    Rogers  I don t think individual investors need some kind of a gatekeeper  It s much more likely that you re going to find fraud in the securities business than in the cotton market or the wheat market or oil market  I think the world is full of all kinds of problems with manipulation in stocks  like with Enron  There s very little of that ever in the history of the commodities markets    JOI  Should investors invest strategically in different commodities markets  or take a whole asset class approach to commodities    Rogers  Index investing has been proven repeatedly to be best for most investors because investing outperforms the averages year after year  You should buy the S P 500 rather than try to pick stocks  unless you re awfully good at picking stocks    Now  within the S P 500  if you really know about three or four industries  yes  you could probably focus and buy an index just for those sectors of the economy  and likewise with commodities    If you really know a lot about agriculture  why not concentrate on agriculture  If you know a lot about metals or energy  why not buy the metals index  or the energy index  instead of the overall index  But most people don t know enough to make those kinds of distinctions and should just invest in the overall index  Greyson Colvin  Managing Partner  Colvin   Co   JOI  Given that leading commodities indexes like the S P GSCI and DJ UBS are so different  does beta really exist in the commodities market  If so  what is it   Colvin  From an academic standpoint  I can t really give you a definitive yes or no to that question  But from personal observations and experience  I would say that the beta today is the equity market  Correlations between asset classes seem to have risen substantially over the last decade  It really takes specific news or data in a commodity to break correlations  Today s markets seem to be so macro driven that positive news about reductions in corn supplies can be more than offset by bearish news on the European sovereign debt crisis  or a trading mistake at J P  Morgan    Historical data shows the lack of correlation between commodities and other asset classes  but I don t think this data hold quite as true in today s marketplace    JOI  Are index based investments  and investing overall  affecting commodity prices    Colvin  I would say so  With the lack of attractive investments available today  commodities are really one of the only bright spots  But with the stock market essentially flat over the last decade  and 10 year Treasuries below 2 percent  investors are certainly looking for alternatives  A decade ago  I knew very few individuals or institutions with exposures to commodities  Today the question is  How much  And which commodity    With the inception of ETFs and indices  access to commodities has become very easy for investors  Flows to commodities have surged in recent years  which has been one of the drivers behind the rising commodity prices  And the fund flows have really increased daily volatility as well  A good example  I remember 10 15 years ago  when a 3 cent move in corn prices per day was a big deal  Now that happens every minute  Fund flows through the ETFs and indices and managed accounts are just adding capital to the sector  But I see that as positive    JOI  What is the near  and longer term outlook for commodities    Colvin  We re very bullish on commodities for the long term  especially the grain complex  Emerging market growth and the development of middle classes in countries such as China and India are creating demand for Western goods and diets    There will certainly be volatility in the near and long term with commodities  But the long term demand story becomes more compelling every day    JOI  Should individual investors be able to purchase commodities futures exposure without a gating mechanism  Do we need stricter position limits    Colvin  I think individual investor participation should be encouraged and that more participants will provide liquidity and increase competition  For most investors I speak with  their hurdle to establishing a futures account isn t their lack of knowledge  but rather the difficulty of opening and executing a futures account  The futures markets and their level of execution are well behind the equities market  as far as platform and accessibility for individuals  As far as position limits  I think that stricter position limits will only limit liquidity to the commodities markets and make it harder and costlier to hedge    JOI  Should investors invest strategically in different commodities markets  or take a whole asset class approach to commodities    Colvin  The answer is really driven by how much time and interest investors have to research commodities  For the investor looking for generic commodity exposure and diversification  I think a diversified index would best achieve those goals  For investors who are willing to take a more strategic approach and more time  they will certainly be able to outperform the index by identifying commodities that have better supply and demand stories over the next decade    JOI  From an investment perspective  are first generation commodities indexes good investments    Colvin  Overall  I think first generation commodity indexes are good investments  but there are more efficient structures for long term buy and hold investors  Indexes taking positions across the curve minimize the effects of contango and will limit trading costs    In some cases  the best opportunity is the front month contract  There is a lot of criticism of first generation commodity indexes  but the real issue here is educating investors about the different ways to gain commodity exposure that will allow them to choose the model that best fits their goals and needs  I m a big believer of choice  but I also believe that investors need to be educated about the differences between first generation  second generation and third generation indexes and be allowed to make the decision that fits their best investment goals and criteria    The problem today is that the amount of people that understand the difference between the indexes is small  I fear that a lot of people are going into these first generation indexes not really knowing the risks and costs of the investments ,2012-07-16,T.

177970,399486,IBM,Dell Vs  HP  Which Stock Should You Own ,opinion,I got a chance to catch up with old colleagues at a tech investment conference this past week  And one topic dominated our hour long discussion  Now that Dell  Nasdaq  DELL  and Hewlett Packard  NYSE  HPQ  are trading far from their all time highs  is either one a bargain  More specifically  how do these two stocks stack up against each other  We couldn t come to an agreement  but now that I ve had a chance to compare these two stocks  I think a clear winner has emerged    To value these stocks  I used eight distinct factors and assigned each factor a relative weighting on a 100 point total scale  Here s the result      Factor  1  profit margins  Weighting 15 points   Dell s operating margins have fluctuated between 4  and 8  in the past six years  while HP s margins have hovered between 7  and 9   thanks to a greater emphasis on software and services     Result    Dell  6 5 points HP  8 5 points   Factor  2  sales consistency  Weighting 12 points   In a worst case scenario  which we saw in 2009   Dell s sales fell 13   while HP s fell only 3   Moreover  Dell was only able to boost sales by 1  in fiscal  January  2011 to about  61 5 billion  even after incorporating a series of acquisitions  HP s recent sales growth hasn t been especially impressive either  but the company at least has a higher degree of recurring revenue from long term service contracts     Result    Dell  5 points HP  7 points    Factor   3  free cash flow  Weighting  15 points   This is distinct from factor  1 because it better incorporates capital intensity  The company that can derive more profits with less capital spending can more quickly strengthen its financial position  Dell has a generated an average of  3 5 billion in free cash flow in the past four years  equating to a free cash flow yield of more than 25   which is truly stunning  HP has generated an average of  8 5 billion in free cash flow in each of the past four years  equating to a still impressive 15  free cash flow yield     Result    Dell  8 5 points HP  6 5 points   Factor  4  Management track record and corporate governance Weighting 10 points   HP gets an incomplete upgrade because it is under relatively new management  Dell  on the other hand  deserves a failing grade     Michael Dell has made a series of bold moves  yet none have been able to move the needle  Even lumbering Microsoft  Nasdaq  MSFT  now appears to be making a series of winning moves  proving that you can t blame the tough external environment for Dell s underwhelming results  And the fact that Michael Dell runs the company with a seemingly free hand tells you that the company s board provides few checks and balances     HP s management    and board    are fairly new  so an incomplete grade is justified  Still  the decision to shed thousands of employees and re invest the savings into niches with higher growth opportunities is bold enough to merit attention  Compared to Dell s weak management and governance  HP s fresh slate of officers and directors get the nod     Result    Dell  4 points HP  6 points   Factor  5  Industry positioning  Weighting 15 points   HP is the world s largest seller of PCs and laptops  which is nothing to brag about in a world increasingly dominated by tablet computers and smartphones  Nevertheless  this segment accounts for a smaller percentage of sales than it does for Dell  HP has lost its edge in the IT services market as companies like IBM  NYSE  IBM  take market share  Still  outsourced IT management is a trend that continues to grow  and HP remains a viable candidate when major contracts come up for bidding    Dell has been pursuing a greater emphasis on enterprise hardware  especially with a string of data storage acquisitions  Yet even as Dell pursues best of breed niche vendors in this segment  and pays top dollar for them   the company is still seen as something of an also ran when compared to storage focused vendors such as EMC  NYSE  EMC   Frankly  neither of these companies have much to show for internal R D efforts and have ended up overpaying for other companies  Improved R D execution is essential for future relevance for these firms     HP s service focus gives the company a slight edge     Result    Dell  7 points HP  8 points   Factor  6  International exposure  Weighting 13 points   With Europe in trouble and China slowing down  the United States is suddenly looking like the place to be  Companies with a higher percentage of sales in the United States now look better equipped to meet forward earnings estimates  HP derives 45  of sales in the U S   and 36  in Europe  Africa and the Middle East  EMEA    In contrast  Dell derives 49  of sales in the U S   while the EMEA region accounts for roughly 30      Result    Dell  7 points HP  6 points   Factor  7  EPS trends   Weighting 12 points   Earnings forecasts continue to trend in the same direction  so the recent downward revisions to Dell s EPS  earnings per share  forecasts are likely to continue  Stock prices often track earnings revisions and it s hard for a stock to rally while forecasts are still coming down  HP s earnings forecasts have remained largely unchanged and may even rise a bit  thanks to the recently announced huge layoffs that will take effect in the quarters ahead     Result    Dell  5 points HP  7 points   Factor  8  Analyst opinion  Weighting 8 points   As analysts reiterate bullish or bearish opinions on a stock  they can have an impact on the stock price  HP s average analyst rating is 2 6  with 1 0 being a strong  Buy    while Dell s is 2 3   Result    Dell  4 5 points HP  3 5 points     This is arguably generous as Dell has seen a few downgrades since Yahoo last updated analyst ratings scores   By a decent margin  HP looks like the better stock to own  The fact that HP trades for about five times projected 2013 profits while Dell trades for around six times tells you that both of these stocks are extremely inexpensive  Dell s solid balance sheet should provide support to shares at current levels  but HP looks better positioned to make the bold moves that can restore the company back into relevance    and deliver profits to shareholders  BY David

177972,399488,IBM,Sell In May Would Have Been A Good Idea,opinion, Sell in May and go away    Boy  would that have been a good idea  In May  markets were down over 6  in the United States  European markets were a sea of red  and the rest of the world followed suit  We did not expect this to be the case  In April  we suggested that  during this election year and with the economic data stream then apparent   1  the very low worldwide interest rates and the  2  appealing valuations of the stock market would combine in a strategic sense  Hence  we concluded that this was not the year to sell in May  We were wrong  It would have been better to sell in May  raise cash  sit the month out It is now June  Will  June  be  bustin  out all over  as they sang in Carousel  or will there be a June swoon  a continuation of the May malaise  The market focus continues to be on Europe  France will have parliamentary elections on the 10th and 17th of June  Greece will have crucial elections on the 17th of June  The European Central Bank  ECB  seems to be on hold until the political situation is more stable  Clearly  there is a demand for more liquidity in Europe  and the ECB holds the keys  We expect an ECB action at any time In the US  the Federal Reserve seems to be in permanent neutral  In fact  the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve is gradually shrinking  because the Fed is permitting some runoff of its holdings  Operation Twist ends in June  QE3 is going nowhere  The rhetoric of the Fed  the message from the Fed  the discussions originating out of the members of the FOMC  coalesce to suggest that the Fed will do nothing  That is our outlook  unless there is a massive shock of some type or the economy goes into recession  Neither shock nor recession is likely  Thus  we expect  no changes at the Fed until after the end of this year  In Japan  political change is underway and the composition of the Japanese Central Bank may change  How those politics play out remains to be seen  The Japanese Central Bank s balance sheet seems to be headed in an expansive direction  And  of course  there are the ongoing discussions in the UK and the Bank of England about its monetary policy making  Where the UK goes also remains to be seen As we survey the world  we find a continuing expectation of extremely low short term interest rates  Credit spreads  interest rates  and central bank balance sheets are all updated on Cumberland s website    When you look at those charts  the striking impression is that the distribution of rates is truly remarkable  There is an extension of those very low interest rates out into the intermediate section and long section of the yield curves  where the high grade sovereign debt is priced  There is a widening of credit spreads in many sectors  from junk bonds in the US to junk sovereign debt in Europe  The high grade interest rates are bordering on the bizarre in terms of pricing What do we mean by bizarre   When the two year German government bond trades at a negative yield  that is bizarre pricing  When the ten year US Treasury trades at 1    that is bizarre pricing  When the thirty year US Treasury bond trades under 3   while a very high grade  AAA  tax free municipal bond trades close to 4   that is bizarre pricing  The investing professional and the serious individual are each bewildered by the circumstances that confront them every single day  In the financial markets  the market clearing   pricing mechanism seem to be broken  Very few of my colleagues would spend their own money buying a ten year US Treasury note in return for a 1   interest rate  They  I  wouldn t do it for their  my  personal account  In our firm  that means we will not buy it for clients That bewilderment doubles when you compare the ten year riskless yield with the US stock market  There you can purchase the benchmark S P 500 Index and get close to a 2   yield from dividends  Compare the two choices if you are a longer term  strategically thinking investor  Would you take the riskless ten year note and receive 1    or would you take the composition of the 500 large companies in the S P 500 Index and say   I ll get 2   in yield today  and sometime in the next ten years I expect the price of that index to be higher than 1300  and I will have a capital gain  Also in the next ten years  I expect the collective dividends on these 500 companies to rise  Thus   my ongoing yield will probably escalate   That is the choice facing investors  To us  that choice is clear  We would rather bet strategic investment money on Johnson   Johnson  Exxon  IBM  and the others who compose the S P 500 Index  derive a higher yield while we do it  and have an expectation of higher stock prices sometime in the next decade  That looks like a better choice to us than the ten year US Treasury note  The policy at Cumberland is to make the strategic choice  and that favors being invested in the stock market  What about the bond market   We will not buy the ten year Treasury note  It does not make sense to us  The only reason we would want to own the ten year Treasury note at a 1   yield is if we thought there would be a protracted deflationary recession in the United States and that it would go on for a number of years  We think the evidence for a deepening recession is not there  The data sets we examine  the economics that we apply  suggest to us that the US economy is headed for a protracted period of slow but steady recovery  Furthermore  it looks to us like that recovery will begin to accelerate over time  The acceleration will come from three sectors  The first is a housing sector that stabilizes and then begins to return to normalcy over the next few years  The second is the manufacturing sector in the United States that is also gradually and continuously recovering  The third is the US energy sector  particularly with the evolution of natural gas in its new form  shale  throughout the country  Put those three sectors together  and you can add a point or more to the annual GDP growth rate as it unfolds during the next decade  To us  this looks like an opportunistic place to be  Are we worried about Greece   Are we concerned about the euro zone   Are we worried about the growth rate in China   Of course  we are   There a million things to worry about  You can focus on them by looking at Tehran  Damascus or Cairo  You can peer into Beijing  Tokyo or Seoul  You can fret about Rome  Athens  or Madrid However  do you make your investment decisions only based on the deteriorating  negative strategic view    If yes  sit in cash  It earns zero yield  And it has zero volatility and zero growth At Cumberland Advisors  we are taking the other side of this trade  We have been though over a decade of malaise and weak performance  We have witnessed the brutal adjustment of real estate prices throughout the world  That is not over yet but much of it is already behind us  We have endured financial crisis  banking crisis  investment banking crisis  and central banking policy changes of monumental proportion  That is all old news Over the next decade  the question is  what is the new news   In our view  it is more likely to be positive than negative  The fact that markets are not pricing in the positive outcomes makes them even more attractive June is here  May is over  We shall see whether June busts out or if May s negative momentum continues through the summer We are fully invested in the US stock market ETF accounts  We favor the sectors that would participate in a growth setting  We are greatly underweighted in Europe in the international ETF accounts  Our exposure to Europe is limited to Germany in the euro zone  We own some UK  Sweden  and Poland  Note that those three are not in the euro zone  but they are in Europe  It s June  June  June  says the song  The melody is appealing ,2012-06-03,Cumberland

177974,399490,IBM,German Sovereign CDS Widening Is A Troubling Sign ,opinion,The focus recently has all been on the eurozone periphery  but signs of strained financial conditions are now showing up in German sovereign CDS  The spread has been steadily rising  as discussed here  This CDS widening has been taking place at the time when German bond yields have been falling This divergence  bond CDS basis  indicates that bond prices are driven by demand for  safe  paper in the euro area while German sovereign risks  visible in the CDS markets  are perceived to be increasing  Somewhat of a contradiction  But these have become common in the stressed environment we are in  One could presumably lock in this difference by shorting the 5 year government bond  by borrowing it in the repo market  and by selling the 5 year CDS against it  Assuming this position is held for 5 years  the trade will work  However until then the spread could widen even further if for example the 5 year yield goes to zero and or the CDS widens  The mark to market volatility of this position could be substantial and the return on capital wouldn t be great because of the margin required  initial and variation  for shorting the CDS  That s why market participants are not all jumping into this  arbitrage  situation  also if the German CDS were about to trigger  there may not be a DC  ISDA committee  around to trigger it   but that s a topic for another discussion  To an economist this raises all sorts of questions such as what is the  risk free rate  for the euro  And how can German paper be viewed as risk free when German sovereign CDS is wider than Verizon  IBM  Pfizer  Microsoft  etc  CDS  What this tells us is that investors are becoming concerned about Germany s growing liabilities associated with the eurozone  And this concern stems from the fact that the costs to Germany of a potential breakup of the EMU would dwarf the costs of German reunification  which took the country a generation to absorb ,2012-06-12,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/german-sovereign-cds-widening-is-a-troubling-sign-126196,126196

177976,399492,IBM,The US Economy Sitting On The Threshold Of A New Golden Age  Part Two ,opinion,In part one of this multipart series on the US economy I offered the following basic opinion  The majority of the positive aspects underpinning the US economy are being mostly ignored by mainstream media in favor of the smaller  but more titillating  negative aspects  Consequently  I believe that many Americans  and since this is an investing blog  many investors  are holding a much more negative view of the strength of the American economy than is warranted  I offer massive outflows from equity funds into Treasury bonds as evidence supporting my thesis However  the more important message I am attempting to convey with this series of articles is that America has entered the beginning of what will become a New Golden Age of economic growth and prosperity  So as to be perfectly clear  with this second message I am taking the role of the reporter  Although my opinion is certainly intertwined and aligned  I am not the source of the message  Instead  I m simply reporting information from other  I believe  credible sources that are clearly being mostly excluded and neglected by mainstream media  Important information for every investor in America to know goes almost unreported  I will cite the sources as I report their messages My Opinions FirstThis section will express my personal views on economics and freedom  For clarification and color  I will write a paragraph articulating my personal views and follow it with a supporting quote or quotes from my favorite economist of all time  Nobel prize winning economist Milton Friedman I believe that the foundation supporting the thesis for a New Golden Age is the nature of our society coupled with our economic system  Both of these factors create an opportunity for progress and growth that is unequaled in the history of mankind  In my opinion  nothing unleashes the enormous potential of people more than a free market economy operating in a free society  Mankind s DNA is hardwired to feather its own nest  With the freedom to do so  we willingly work long hours  and will make enormous sacrifices for our families and our own futures  But more importantly  freedom and the profit motive inspire us to better our world as we better ourselves  The world runs on individuals pursuing their self interests  The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus  Einstein didn t construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat  Henry Ford didn t revolutionize the automobile industry that way    Milton Friedman    Because we live in a largely free society  we tend to forget how limited is the span of time and the part of the globe for which there has ever been anything like political freedom  the typical state of mankind is tyranny  servitude  and misery  The nineteenth century and early twentieth century in the Western world stand out as striking exceptions to the general trend of historical development  Political freedom in this instance clearly came along with the free market and the development of capitalist institutions  So also did political freedom in the golden age of Greece and in the early days of the Roman era     Milton Friedman   To be clear  I am a fiscal conservative that believes in the benefit and benevolence of free markets  However  I would be considered a liberal regarding my deep desire to see the plight of the common man and the downtrodden vastly improved  I want food  shelter  quality healthcare  education and a high standard of living for every human being on the planet  Frankly  I also believe that so called conservatives and liberals alike all want the same benefits for humanity  Our differences are not with want we want for mankind  but rather with how we might best achieve our equally shared goals     The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not care what color people are  it does not care what their religion is  it only cares whether they can produce something you want to buy  It is the most effective system we have discovered to enable people who hate one another to deal with one another and help one another     Milton Friedman   Therefore  the reason I embrace fiscally conservative values and free markets is because I strongly believe  and recognize  that they are the only means that are capable of providing humanity what it needs  My reasoning is based on what I believe are the undeniable facts that the only economic laws that work  or could possibly be expected to work  are ones based on the immutable laws of nature  Supply and demand is not a law invented by man  it is a law based on and functioning on the natural needs  desires and psychological behaviors of mankind  Natural economic laws work  because at their root  they function as people function     A major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that it     gives people what they want instead of what a particular group thinks they ought to want  Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself    Milton Friedman Additionally  I believe that free markets are the most benevolent economic force possible  Not because free markets have a conscience  but rather because they don t  The market s DNA is designed to encounter and  as efficiently as possible  rebalance and fix any imbalances that manifest  When left alone to its own magnificently capable devices  it accomplishes this while naturally causing the least amount of pain and suffering possible  When interfered with  the problems either grow bigger  are prolonged  or most often both  History is replete with evidence that supports my argument     So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear  That there is no alternative way  so far discovered  of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system     Milton Friedman    A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither  A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of both     Milton Friedman    This leads me to express my opinion on the role of Government regarding economic policy and stimulus  I emphatically believe that the Government needs to stay out of interfering with the natural forces of free markets to the maximum extent possible  Now let me be clear  I do not necessarily feel that Government has bad intentions or that all politicians are evil tyrants  For the most part  they are likely caring people with good intentions and a strong desire to be helpful  My problem is that I believe they do not realize the damage their actions really do  They see a problem and immediately offer to fix it  and their constituents demand that they act  and that they act now     The existence of a free market does not of course eliminate the need for government  On the contrary  government is essential both as a forum for determining the  rule of the game  and as an umpire to interpret and enforce the rules decided on     Milton Friedman    Our minds tell us  and history confirms  that the great threat to freedom is the concentration of power  Government is necessary to preserve our freedom  it is an instrument through which we can exercise our freedom  yet by concentrating power in political hands  it is also a threat to freedom  Even though the men who wield this power initially be of good will and even though they be not corrupted by the power they exercise  the power will both attract and form men of a different stamp     Milton Friedman   Consequently  promises that can t be kept are made to a voting populous that finds catharsis in seeing policies enacted  This is in spite of the fact that they don t and can t work  and cause unnecessary and prolonged damage to our economic health and well being  All of this simply because Government  and its constituency  refuses to trust the best and most benevolent economic system that has ever existed on earth  The one and only system that has raised the standard of living on the planet to its highest level in history  while every social experiment that attempts to control economic activity has failed miserably     One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results     Milton Friedman    There is still a tendency to regard any existing government intervention as desirable  to attribute all evils to the market  and to evaluate new proposals for government control in their ideal form  as they might work if run by able  disinterested men free from the pressure of special interest groups       Milton Friedman    To conclude this section of my personal views I offer that our free market economic system operating in a still mostly free society  has produced an incubator of great  and even unbelievable ideas  that will allow us to eventually solve our greatest problems and lead us into a future golden age of prosperity and growth  This fertile environment has spawned technological advances that are growing exponentially  But most importantly  investments already made in the installation and transition phase     positions our economy for rapid and profitable future growth    The Fifth Techno Economic Revolution   Future economic growth and prosperity has always been  and will always be directly proportionate to the growth and capacity of our economy  True progress and prosperity comes from  speaking metaphorically  an economy that continues to bake more pies  I believe that one of the great mistakes made by those who are forecasting our country s economic demise is their belief that we only have one pie that must be shared  Consequently  they tend to think about how we can slice that single pie instead of recognizing the incredible capacity our economy has to bake more pies    Technology is our baker  and technology is advancing exponentially  Unfortunately  most people see technology advancing linearly  To put this into perspective  I offer the following quote from page 34 of the book Abundance  The Future is Better Than You Think by Peter H  Diamandis and Stephen Kotler illustrating the difference between linear and exponential growth     if I takes 30 linear steps  calling one step a meter  from the front door of my Santa Monica home  I end up 30 meters away  However  if I take 30 exponential steps  one  two  four  eight  sixteen  thirty two  and so on  I end up a billion meters away  or  effectively lapping the globe 26 times     This exponential growth of technology is creating real world  and in real time  solutions to our planet s biggest and most compelling problems  The areas I am focusing on are not science fiction fantasies of what it might be like far into our future  Instead  I am focusing on advancements that are already developed or very near completion  that already are or soon will be  capable of solving our planet s greatest challenges  Moreover  in addition to solving many of the world s greatest problems  these technological innovations are poised to ensure and accelerate our future economic growth and prosperity    With the remainder of this article I will simply highlight what I believe are some of the more intriguing and promising advancements  From an investor s standpoint there are both old line established corporations as well as startups and private companies that are currently engaged in bringing these advancements to the world    Prospective investors are offered the choice of conservatively investing in established profitable companies where these advancements will help these companies maintain or accelerate their future growth  Or  the more courageous amongst you might want to take a shot at aggressively investing in some of the startups  But be advised that the companies covered below are not recommendations  Instead  they are offered as a representative list of companies already participating in tomorrow s future    Furthermore  I want to be clear that I do not offer this as a comprehensive list  Instead  I will tell you that I am merely scratching the surface regarding all the exciting opportunities that I believe the world will enjoy over the coming years and decades  And  not just in America  but all over the developed and developing world as well    Importantly  as I stated in the beginning of this article  I am only reporting on the technological opportunities that follow  The primary source of the information I am sharing comes from the current issues of Trends Magazine  and secondarily from current best selling books like Abundance  or The Rational Optimist  Each of these sources in turn provides additional sources providing greater detail on these opportunities that they are merely summarizing    Special Purpose Service Robots   According to Trends Magazine  one of the most logical applications for special purpose service robots is the personal assistant companion  These robots can be of great assistance to our aging population  Prototypes are being developed that can clean the house  shop for groceries  monitor the human inhabitants  activities and respond to emergency situations  Proponents believe that current progress will translate into profits and disruptive robotic products within this decade    Follow  to learn more about this exciting technology  The following table provides a partial listing of companies that are participating in this exciting technology  Some of these companies look attractive today  some do not  therefore  it s up to the individual to conduct their own due diligence regarding what the future may hold Nanoscale Materials   Nanoscale technologies are advancing rapidly with implications that can open a proverbial floodgate of game changing commercial applications  From batteries made from carbon nano tubes with 400 times the storage capacity of conventional batteries to nano tubes that promise to increase computer speed while lowering power consumption  Even desalination technology that can filter the salt out of seawater thereby solving the world s pending water crisis  Also  more efficient solar panels and the lists go endlessly on    Follow  to learn more  The following is a partial list of companies that are already participating in this exciting nascent technology  Although the growth prospects are enormous  there is no clear and apparent winner as of yet  So once again  personal due diligence is required Biotech Innovations   Even though the biotechnology sector has already spawned so much business activity that is difficult to keep up with  the progress has only just begun  According to Trends   just as computer chips became cheap enough for hobbyists like Steve Jobs to take over computer development in the 1970s  so today the experimental equipment used for genetics is getting cheap enough for people to set up labs in their garages   Thereby  indicating a great example of the power of a free people operating in a free marketplace  The following represents a partial list of publicly traded companies that are already exploiting the biotechnology Revolution  Once again  these are not recommendations  but instead  starting points for further due diligence Distributed Power TechnologiesDistributed Power Technologies represents one of the most promising technological opportunities of them all  According to the book Abundance  there already exist technological advancements in Fourth Generation Nuclear that could ultimately lead to so much safe  cheap and abundant energy that energy literally becomes free to the world One of the most exciting potentialities is through a private company  Terrapower  in part funded and supported by no other than Bill Gates  Not only is Terrapower s traveling wave nuclear reactor safe  it could even eliminate the dangerous nuclear waste that the world is currently storing  Terrapower expects their traveling wave nuclear reactors to be available by the year 2020  Here is a link to the company s website  The following table lists a small sampling of companies working to bring us safer and cleaner energy sources in the future  Once again  we find established companies as well as startups on the list  Quantum ComputersQuantum computing is an area of technology that offers virtually unlimited potential because of its promise to increase computer capacity  performance and speed by orders of magnitude over anything that s come before it  The current leader in this technology is a private company  D Wave  here s a link to their website The following table represents a very small sampling of companies already exploiting quantum computing  IBM is the most prominent publicly traded company working on developing quantum computers Synthetic Life Forms   A controversial  but extremely exciting area of technological advancement is the field of synthetic life forms  Synthetic Genomics Inc   founded by J  Craig Venter  Ph D  and Nobel Laureate Hamilton O  Smith  M D has already conducted remarkable work in this promising area of science  Experts like Mr  Venter believe that      We will see tiny self reproducing factories  disease killing machines  and exotic creations performing many useful functions  Experts believe that by 2020  synthetic life creations could eliminate  or make manageable  nearly all human sicknesses  including most of today s dreaded age related diseases      Mr  Venter also offers the following forecast     The benefits of this technology are limited only by our imagination   Venter says  By 2030 or before  human made life forms could provide everyone with an affordable  ageless and forever healthy body  fashioned from newly created  designer cells   Welcome to the future of artificial lifeforms     Follow these two links to learn more    and     Big Data   Another technological area with some controversy  and the last area I will report on  is Big Data  According to McKinsey  retailers that fully leverage Big Data could potentially increase their operating margins by more than 60 percent  Follow  to learn more    The following is a sampling of companies that are already participating in Big Data  Again  these are not recommendations to buy  only recommendations to learn more about  Summary and ConclusionsThe major message that I am attempting to convey with this series of articles is the reality that there is a lot of opportunity lying in front of us  that goes mostly unreported  Mainstream media offers a myopic focus on the problems of the world  How many times do I need to hear about all the problems that are going on in Europe  I do believe that we need to be aware of the problems so that we can ultimately solve them  On the other hand  we also need to be aware of all the positive developments  of which there are many I will conclude by saying that what I ve written about here is oriented to the long term serious fundamental investor  When I invest in a business  I plan on owning it for many years  Clearly then  the future success and profitability of my businesses are going to be the major drivers of whether my investment works out or not  Consequently  I consider it imperative that I attempt to forecast future profitability within as reasonable a range of accuracy as possible  Being aware of future developments that the businesses are working on is a major component of successfully achieving that process In part three I will offer some concluding remarks and look at some publicly traded companies that I believe are fairly valued and poised to participate in the future prosperity of America I have been

177994,399510,IBM,Using Call Options To Bottom Fish In QQQ,opinion,Rick s Picks occasionally offers option trades suited to novices and experienced traders alike  Typically  these gambits go against major trends  since our proprietary Hidden Pivot System is especially useful for nailing turning points very precisely   Monday  for instance  we recommended buying QQQ June 65 calls if this proxy for the Nasdaq 100 index fell to within a dime of a 63 53 price target  That implied a wicked plunge from  the previous day s settlement price of 64 76  In the actual event  panicky sellers obliged by pounding the bejeezus out of QQQ on Tuesday  It opened 43 cents lower  at 64 33  on its way to an intraday bottom at 63 48   just a nickel from the low we d projected   This allowed us to buy June 65 calls for as little as 0 98  however  we used an official price of 1 03  since that was the worst fill reported by a subscriber in the Rick s Picks chat room  Later in the day  the calls rebounded to 1 42 as QQQ trampolined from our downside target   In the feverish promotion speak of the guru world  the paper profit on the calls worked out to  AN ANNUALIZED GAIN of 13 800               As QQQ screamed higher  we sent out a bulletin telling subscribers to take profits on half the position  Some reported fills as fat as 1 36  but we used a more conservative 1 25  effectively reducing the cost basis of our remaining position to 0 84    Our  1 Trading Rule   Now it ll be hard to lose  right   In fact  stranger things have happened  And that s why we always recommend taking at least a small partial profit early in a trade if possible  whether in stocks  options or futures  Of the three vehicles  options are arguably the toughest game to beat  especially for the retail customer  We say that after having traded puts and calls ourselves for nearly 40 years  12 of them as a dealer on an exchange floor  Options can be extremely difficult to play because it is not just price fluctuations in the underlying stock that causes them to move up and down  but also changes in supply and demand for the options themselves  For example  if Goldman Sachs  GS  were to sell 20 000 IBM  IBM  June 200 calls for 5 10  the pros who bought them would typically try to spread off the risk by selling other options against them  or perhaps by buying puts   But if the stock were to rally shortly thereafter  you can bet the June 200s would be leaden  And they might remain so for a week or more if the traders were unable to lay off all of the risk from purchasing the June 200s    Could you trade options profitably   We must confess that we need to employ nearly every trick we ve learned in 40 years just to eke out a small  positive expectation  on option trades  It s not a game one can beat if you give up a few cents  here and a few cents there  For your interest  and so you can get the flavor of our recommendations  here s the  trading tout  that went out to subscribers Monday night  Judge for yourself if you could have followed the instructions  either by using a broker or a direct access trading platform to execute the trade  Here s the tout  along with a chart that has been reproduced above   It begins with a reference to another  theoretically profitable  trade exited the day before    QQQ  64 76     Occasionally we benefit when we cast our lot with the scumballs who fill market orders on the opening rotation  Such was the case yesterday  when we exited a single August 68 put for 3 76   the high of the day   off a 3 50 offer  The purpose of this gambit had been to make  enough to pay for a year s subscription to Rick s Picks  and to do so using a strategy simple enough for traders of all levels of experience to employ  This we did  producing a theoretical gain sufficient to cover the price of a renewal   with enough left over to buy yourself a decent cigar  Let s plan on doing it again soon   i e   if and when this vehicle comes down to 63 63  10 cents above the  D  target of the pattern shown  Bid there for four June 65 calls  but stop yourself out if they trade for 20 cents less than you paid    UPDATE  2 14 p m  EDT    The 63 53 target shown in the chart was a bulls eye  As a result  we were able to buy four June 65 calls a few pennies off the low  I ll use 1 03  the highest price reported in the chat room  as our cost basis  For now  offer two of the calls to close for 1 22  day order  ,2012-05-09,Rick Ackerman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/using-call-options-to-bottom-fish-in-qqq-122591,122591

178000,399516,IBM,What Next For Hewlett Packard ,opinion,Judging by the quarterly results released in February  Hewlett Packard s  NASDAQ  HPQ  fortunes seem to have declined significantly over the past months and are a major indication that the company has not recovered from its poor performance under ex CEO Leo Apotheker  Apotheker s tenure was an incredibly bleak period for the company  in which it lost more than  30 billion in market value and 40  of the value of its stock In mutinous circumstances  some shareholders sued the company for deception as a result of Hewlett Packard s business plan being laced with all sorts of seemingly bad decisions  This included controversial decisions such as selling its tablet device and mobile phone business at a time when global demand and popularity for these products was at an all time high  Mercifully  the board brought in Meg Whitman who seems to have  at least for the time being  stemmed the tide of disastrous decisions and reappraised Hewlett Packard s position in the global market Looking at Hewlett Packard s quarterly results paints a fairly grim picture of the current situation  Revenues have fallen by  30 billion and net earnings have fallen by 40  over three months  This has inevitably dragged the earnings per share down by around 38  as a global slump in demand for Hewlett Packard products becomes apparent  Much of this decrease has been as a result of falling sales in Hewlett Packard s hardware product lines for such items as laptops  printers and imaging machines  Its software division has also experienced a decrease in activity as a direct result of the rising competition in this market from rivals such as Oracle Corp  ORCL O  who command a vast commercial following This is occurring whilst competitors such as Fujitsu Siemens  FJTSY  are producing highly affordable personal computer systems and the tablet market being dominated by the likes of Apple  NASDAQ APPL  and others who were pioneering and investing in this technology at an early stage  Software has always been lucrative but Hewlett Packard has seen itself squeezed out of the corporate market by the oligopoly of large providers such as Oracle Corp The situation which Hewlett Packard currently finds itself comes after years of boardroom squabbles  a well publicized sex scandal involving an ex CEO and several operational decisions which turned out to be absolute blunders  So what future does this stock hold as an investment The truth about Hewlett Packard is that it is still very far from the Promised Land  Meg Whitman inherited a company in chaos and it will take quite some time for any kind of recovery to be seen  and even more for this to be passed on to by investors  The necessity for the company to rejuvenate itself in the aftermath of poor leadership and at a time when technology is moving at an obscene rate is imperative for it to regain its status as a market leader In general  the PC industry is suffering from a period of sluggish growth as demand for tablet devices has skyrocketed  The birth of flat screen  ultra mobile devices stemming from the Apple iPhone has created both rising and falling stars in the technology industry  Those that have chosen to hang on to technology of the past in defiance of this revolution have generally seen their sales fall significantly  However  even in the face of a dwindling market appetite and reduced demand for products  competitors like IBM  NYSE IBM  have found a solution and been able to hold their own  especially in the areas of business support and consultancy services  IBM Global Technology and Global Business Services divisions collectively made  60 billion during this period while Hewlett Packard was conversely losing billions of dollars In an attempt to start the painfully long process of recovery  the board of Hewlett Packard has approved some operational changes such as the merger of its personal computing and printing divisions  But  if the truth be told  a lot of ground has been lost to companies such as IBM who are well established in the personal computing market  and to companies like Apple who are not only into personal computing and associated media but are also dominating the smartphone and tablet market with its iconic devices The stock is presently unattractive and price is expected to remain in a tight range with a bearish bias for a long time to come  We may see some accelerated recovery if there is improvement in the figures that will be shown to investors within the 2nd quarter results  However  despite the gloom  it is also worth bearing in mind that Hewlett Packard has a large base of commercial customers who are not necessarily looking for the company to become competitive in the flat screen tablet and mobile phone market  An interesting move for the company was focusing on cost reduction  not only its own energy use  but in that of its clients  The company produced some pretty impressive results relating to corporate energy reduction in its recent energy efficiency tour Furthermore  it may not all be bad for HP shareholders who are currently trapped holding the stock  HP still markets many of its products under the strong image of reliability that has brought the company corporate loyalty over the years  Meg Whitman has pointed out that this will continue to be a major selling point for the company that still values quality and understands the demand for this from its commercial core  Despite it lagging behind the touch screen technology market  HP may still regain its niche in the commercial sector in the future  which is a very large niche indeed ,2012-05-10,Jim Makos,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-next-for-hewlett-packard-122718,122718

which is based on aggregation of ratings of 28 ETFs and 151 mutual funds in the Information Technology sector as of April 16th  2012    Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the sector  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst ETFs and mutual funds  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks    To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Information Technology sector  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings    Investors seeking exposure to the Information Technology sector should buy one of the Attractive or better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2      Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5 Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNA s less than 100 million for

leader in the field  Not only is the company incredibly efficient  earning a return on invested capital  ROIC  of 15   but the expectations embedded in the stock price are unduly low  IBM s current stock price of  202 80 implies the company will grow its  by only 7  over its remaining life  Strong returns on invested capital and a cheap valuation are why I like this stock    PowerShares Lux

record of poor capital allocation  The company s dismal  6  return on invested capital  ROIC  places the company in the bottom 10th percentile of all Russell 3000 companies  Only twice during the 14 years I ve covered the company has it generated a ROIC over its weighted average cost of capital  WACC   During that time  the company has written off 28 cents for every dollar of shareholders  equity  And yet the stock s valuation forecasts the company will succeed in a phenomenal turnaround  Specifically  the current stock price    19 57  implies in the company will grow revenues at over 20  compounded annually for 11 years while also improving its ROIC from  5 7  in 2011 to over 20   Good luck with that  Figure 3 shows that 169 out of the 631 stocks  over 55  of the total net assets  held by Information Technology ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  However  only 8 out of 28 Information Technology ETFs  less than 82  of total net assets  and 7 out of 151 Information Technology mutual funds  1  of total net assets  get an Attractive or better rating    The takeaways are  mutual fund managers allocate too much capital to low quality stocks and investors in Information Technology ETFs do a great job at identifying ETFs with great portfolio management and low costs as 82  of the Value of ETFs are allocated to Attractive rated ETFs    Figure 3

178074,399590,IBM,Morning Report  April 18  2012,opinion,Market sentiment improved dramatically overnight as Spain successfully conducted a debt auction and the International Monetary Fund raised its global growth forecasts  Spain successfully sold EUR 3 18 billion of bills against a target of EUR 3 billion  The average 12 month yield for the sale was 2 62   which is still significantly higher than an average yield of 1 42  for an auction held in late March The International Monetary Fund  for the first time since January 2011 raised its global growth forecast to 3 5  this year from a January projection of 3 3   It also raised its forecast for growth in the US to 2 4  for 2013  While recognising that the eurozone still faces a recession with the potential risk of further defaults  the IMF noted that the region had stabilised since last year  The EUR opens the Asia morning slightly higher at 1 3120 after trading in an 80 point range yesterday Further aiding investor appetite was the release of the stronger than expected German ZEW index  which looks to predict economic developments 6 months in advance  The index rose to its highest level since 2010 despite a majority of economists predicting a fall  However  it wasn t all good news as investors chose to ignore declines in US housing starts and factory production Industrial production in the US came in at 0  against expectations of 0 4  and housing starts rose by less than expected at 650K  Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors will meet in Washington later this week  The Australian dollar has gained more than a a cent from its lows yesterday to open this morning just below 1 0400 Global equity markets gained on a significant flow of good news  The S P 500 recorded it biggest rally this month to close 1 55  higher at 1 391  Apple surged almost 5  after recording its longest losing streak since October and financial shares gained almost 2  as Spain successfully completed its latest debt auction  The index had slumped more than 3 5  though yesterday from a four year high recorded on April 2  European shares powered higher with most indices gaining more than 2   Spain s IBEX rose 2 28   Asian equities recorded marginal loses Commodity prices gained as investor sentiment improved with the CRB gaining 1 28 points to 302 04  WTI continued to gain from the previous days release of strong US retail sales growth figures  rising 1 3  to  104 25  Precious metals remain subdued despite strong gains on the equity markets with gold gaining only 0 1  to  1 651 while silver is higher by 1  at  31 70  Soft commodities are broadly higher with cocoa and cotton recording the biggest gains  Copper is higher by 0 4  Gold again opens the Asian morning flat at  1650 after a false break under the support of  1641 triggered by a brief fall in euro saw the price rebound sharply  The trading range of  1634  1657 is nonetheless modest with investors focused on equity markets overnight  whose stellar performance once again overshadowed the traditional safe haven gold as names such as IBM  Goldman Sachs and Coca Cola all reported higher than expected profit A US economic recovery that looks more and more likely to be self sustainable as about 75  of S P 500 companies that had reported earnings beat estimates is likely to further put pressure on the yellow metal  The successful auction of Spanish bonds and a more than 3 years high of German investors confidence survey released last night also eased market fear The good earnings results from US companies have had us keep in mind a diminishing probability of any further monetary stimulus from policy makers  Gold could therefore fall in the long term  However in the short and medium term we remain neutral towards gold before we see any confirmation from future price moves Compass DirectionShort Term Medium TermNEUTRAL NEUTRALAUD USD fell in the expected Asia pattern despite upbeat New Vehicle Sales and the same old chin

178107,399623,IBM,3 High Yield Stocks That Could Easily Boost Dividends,opinion,Creating a list of high yielding stocks is simple  but seasoned investors know that high yield alone is not a good reason to own a stock  That s because sometimes high yield stocks report earnings that are too weak to sustain the current dividend    If your goal is to build a portfolio that s able to deliver steady income through good times and bad  then you ll need to find high yielding stocks with solid fundamentals  good earnings growth and a more conservative payout     Companies with modest payouts have a higher safety margin and the ability to increase the dividend to maintain the payout during bad times  or even raise the payout during good times  This makes these stocks especially appealing  In fact  studies show high yield stocks that also have low payout ratios deliver the best long term returns    With this in mind  I created a list of high yield stocks with room to boost future payouts  I ran a screen for stocks yielding more than 3  while paying out less than 40  of earnings and at least five years of positive earnings growth    Here are three high yield champions that could easily afford to raise dividends    1  BHP Billiton plc   NYSE   Yield  3 7  BHP Billiton is the world s top producer of major commodities such as aluminum  coal  copper  manganese  iron ore  uranium  nickel  silver and titanium minerals  These are all natural resources that have become increasingly scarce  so BHP is ideally positioned to benefit as rising demand pushes up prices    BHP is quickly expanding  It plans to spend  80 billion in the next five years to boost output of iron ore  copper and coal  Last year  it acquired U S  shale assets  making the company the world s 10th largest independent oil and gas producer as well  The company also has a major advantage in that most of its major assets are located in low risk regions such as Australia  Canada and Europe    BHP also has a strong balance sheet and exceptional annual cash flow     30 billion    which exceeds total debt of  25 billion  This has earned BHP a debt rating of  A   from ratings agency Standard   Poor s    In the past five years  BHP has delivered 15  yearly earnings growth and a 37  average return on equity  ROE   Dividends have risen more than 30  a year  and with a payout at just 26  of earnings  there s plenty of room for further growth    2  CA Technologies  Nasdaq   Yield  3 9  CA Technologies is the world s leading vendor of software for information technology management  More than 99  of Fortune 1000 companies use CA software for IT tasks such as managing databases  backing up data and running compliance checks    CA benefits from demand for evolving IT technologies such as virtualization  cloud computing and software as a service  In addition  the company invests  600 million a year in research and development and as much as  500 million a year in technology acquisitions    CA s earnings rose 11  in 2011 and an average of at least 9  in each of the past five years  The company generates more than  1 3 billion of annual cash flow and is returning more cash to investors  With payout at just 11   CA was able to hike its dividend five fold in the first quarter of 2012 to a new annualized rate of  1 00    CA has a very healthy balance sheet showing  2 5 billion of cash and only  1 4 billion of debt  The new 4  yield puts CA in the top tier of dividend paying technology companies  There is still room for growth because the new payout is still only about 40  of projected 2012 earnings    3  Royal Dutch Shell plc   NYSE   Yield  4 9  With proven reserves of 14 3 billion barrels  Shell ranks as the world s fourth largest oil company  The company produced 1 2 billion barrels of oil last year and replaced 160  of reserves  meaning the company discovered 16 new barrels for every 10 barrels it produced     Shell is divesting noncore assets and reinvesting the proceeds in exploration and production  The company has a huge oil sands project underway in western Canada that is expected to raise overall oil and gas production by as much as 10   Shell also has a large shale gas position in North America that is projected to add to the bottom line  Its deep water drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico also hold considerable promise    These projects should result in cash flow 30  to 50  higher in the next three years compared with the previous three years  Since listing American depositary receipts  ADRs  on the New York Stock Exchange seven years ago  Shell s earnings have grown more than 75   The company produces  37 billion a year of cash flow and has an exceptional balance sheet  showing  11 billion of cash and debt at only 16  of capital    With payout at only 30  of earnings  Shell s dividend looks very secure  Shares offer a rich 4 9  yield  While Shell hasn t increased the dividend in three years  a modest increase is planned in 2012    Risks to consider  BHP shares have a high 1 5 beta  which means the stock is roughly 50  more volatile than the overall market  CA faces increasing competition from tech giants IBM  NYSE    and Hewlett Packard  NYSE     as well as earnings challenges because of the eurozone crisis  The Dutch government takes a 15  withholding tax on Shell dividends  though U S  investors can reclaim that from the Internal Revenue Service as a tax credit     Action to take      All three of these stocks carry high yields  yet each of these companies could easily afford to raise dividends  My top pick overall is BHP because of its control over scarce assets and the diversity of its revenue sources  which reduces risk  CA is attractive based on a growing dividend and unusually high yield for a technology stock  Shell should appeal to investors who want a rich dividend and a pure energy play By Lisa

178135,399651,IBM,Buy This Safe Stock    And Double Your Money In Five Years,opinion,Back in the fall of 2010  I touted technology giant International Business Machines  NYSE    in the belief that its stock was poised to have a strong run  A key part of this bullishness was a bold prediction by its management team that it would double earnings per share  EPS  from  10 to  20 by 2015    So far  so good     IBM grew EPS to more than  13 in 2011 and could hit  15 by the end of this year  The stock is following suit and is up nearly 70   This is a great return overall  and well ahead of the market s 36  gain  Another important ingredient to a company making a bold prediction on its future prospects is its credibility     In IBM s case  it has been around for more than 100 years  And though it has had low points during its history  the company s management team  has nearly flawlessly executed for more than a decade now    I have found another stock that could be on the cusp of a sustainable rally  In fact  it recently provided investors with a similarly bold prediction on its earnings and dividend levels within the next five years    I m talking about big box retailer Target  NYSE       Target recently announced plans to nearly double the  4 28 EPS it reported in 2011 to  8 or more by 2017  This announcement came right after the company completed a program to repurchase  10 billion of its own shares  This move was not at all inconsequential  given it represented 25  of its total market cap of  40 billion and benefits existing shareholders by reducing the number of shares outstanding    I think management has credibility to make this plan come to fruition for a couple of key reasons  First  Target s business is straightforward and easy to understand  Investors and consumers alike are probably well aware of its large retail stores and bulls eye logo  None of the products it sells are overly unique  but rather focus on everyday necessities  including groceries  toiletries and basic clothing and related apparel    This business model may sound mundane  but Target has carved out a special niche among shoppers  Retailing giant Wal Mart  NYSE    may be slightly more competitive on price  but certain shoppers don t like frequenting its crowded and sometimes dingy  utilitarian stores just to save a buck  Instead  these consumers flock to Target  where they can buy more fashionable clothing  house wares and even furniture     Because it sells more basic goods  Target is also somewhat recession resistant  During the credit crisis  Wal Mart performed better because shoppers wanted to stretch their dollars farther  but Target remained the go to store for many consumers  On the flip side  Target is a better performer when consumers are more optimistic about the economy    and this slowly but surely seems to be happening now     Its past track record is sound  During the past three years  despite the recession  average annual sales are up by only a few percent  Yet management has performed admirably and controlled costs to boost earnings by more than 14  annually    Downside protection and upside growth potential Since the crisis  Target has been returning to its roots and remodeling existing stores in order to offer a wide variety of groceries  This move has pure growth potential  Wal Mart has grown into the largest grocery retailer in recent years  Though Target is a bit behind  the catching up should boost growth  Also  Target recently announced ambitious growth plans in Canada  The company inked a deal to control 220 store sites in Canada and plans to open 100 to 150 stores by the end of 2014  In total  it can boost store count by more than 12  from its current count of 1 765 locations    Target also plans to boost its annual dividend from a current  1 20 per share to  3  or more  in the next five years  Its current dividend yield is nearly 2 0   and for investors who buy the stock now  the future dividend would represent a 5  yield  For investors  this is better than owning any sort of bond  as dividends can grow along with the company  And for Target  this is yet another bullish sign               Risks to Consider  A down economy would be more of a negative to Target than to archrival Wal Mart  but I don t see another recession happening for the time being  Of course  the economy can stall out unexpectedly  but because Target focuses on food and other necessities that can maintain foot traffic regardless of the economic cycle  I don t see this as an imminent risk either    Action to Take     Simply applying Target s current price to earnings  P E  multiple of 14 to its projected earnings of  8 by 2017  14 x  8  gets me to a stock price of  112  or 90  ahead of current levels  Dividends during this period would get total returns above 100   meaning investors have the opportunity to potentially double their money with this stock over a five year period  Annually  this would boil down to a solid total return of about 20  ,2012-03-29,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/buy-this-safe-stock----and-double-your-money-in-five-years-118623,118623

178146,399662,IBM,The Financial Crisis Of 2008 Was Just A Warm Up Act For The Economic Horror Show That Is Coming,opinion,The people out there that believe that the U S  economy is experiencing a permanent recovery and that very bright days are ahead for us should have their heads examined   Unfortunately  what we are going through right now is simply just a period of  hopetimism  between two financial crashes   Things may seem relatively stable right now  but it won t last long   The truth is that the financial crisis of 2008 was just a warm up act for the economic horror show that is coming   Nothing really got fixed after the crash of 2008   We are living in the biggest debt bubble in the history of the world  and it has gotten even bigger since then   The  too big to fail  banks are larger now than they have ever been   Americans continue to run up credit card balances like there is no tomorrow   Tens of thousands of manufacturing facilities and millions of jobs continue to leave the country   We continue to consume far more than we produce and we continue to become poorer as a nation   None of the problems that caused the crisis of 2008 have been solved and we are even weaker financially than we were back then   So why in the world are so many people so optimistic about the economy right now Just take a look at the chart posted below   It shows the growth of total debt in the United States   During the financial crisis of 2008 there was a little  hiccup   but the truth is that not much deleveraging really took place at all   And since the recession  ended   total credit market debt has gone on to even greater heights    So what does this mean for the future  Well  if a small  hiccup  in the debt bubble caused so much chaos back in 2008  what is going to happen when this debt bubble finally bursts  That is something to think about  Sadly  most Americans seem oblivious to all of this  If you go out to malls in the wealthy areas of America today  people are charging up a storm   In all  Americans charged a whopping 2 5 trillion dollars on their credit cards during 2011   Way too many people have already forgotten the lessons that we all learned back in 2008  Of course some Americans pay off their credit cards every month  but way too many Americans are not doing that   In 1980  Americans were carrying 54 million dollars in revolving credit balances   Today  Americans are carrying 794 million dollars in revolving credit balances  And student loan debt is an even bigger bubble than credit card debt is   As I have written about previously  total student loan debt in America is rapidly approaching a trillion dollars  So it looks like U S  consumers have not learned to stay away from debt  That is not good  Well  what about the banks  Has the financial system learned any lessons since 2008  No  not really  Sadly  the  too big to fail  banks are now even bigger than ever   The total assets of the six largest U S  banks increased by 39 percent between September 30  2006 and September 30  2011   If they were to fail today  they would be even more of a threat to our financial system than they were back in 2008  And our major banks continue to be very highly leveraged   In fact  major banks all over the world are absolutely swamped with debt  The following statistics come from Zero Hedge     The U S  banking system is leveraged 13 to 1  The Japanese banking system is leveraged 23 to 1  The French banking system is leveraged 26 to 1  The German banking system is leveraged 32 to 1  These are insane levels of leverage  and they are just inviting another major financial crisis  Do you all remember Lehman Brothers   The fact that they were leveraged so highly is what did them in back in 2008   When the value of their holdings declined by just a little bit they were totally wiped out  Well  during this next financial crisis large financial institutions are going to be wiped out all over the world   Major banks all over the globe are going to be crying out for more bailouts when things take a turn against them  They are making the exact same mistakes that they made before  and they are going to be expecting more government handouts when things go bad  Will we ever learn  So obviously the banking system has not learned any lessons  What about the federal government  Well  if you follow my blog regularly  you know that I love to write about how horrific U S  government debt is  Unfortunately  over the past four years things have gotten so much worse  Back in 2008  the U S  national debt crossed the 10 trillion dollar mark  Just recently  it crossed the 15 trillion dollar mark  So now we are in a much weaker position financially to respond to another major financial crisis  Just check out the chart posted below   This is a recipe for national financial suicide    During fiscal 2011  the Obama administration stole close to 150 million dollars from our children and our grandchildren every single hour At the moment  the legacy of debt that we are passing on to future generations is sitting a grand total of  15 351 406 294 640 49 But keep in mind that it is going up every single hour Meanwhile  our ability to service that debt is declining   We are rapidly getting poorer as a nation During 2011  the amount of money that left the United States exceeded the amount of money that entered the United States by more than a half a trillion dollars This gap is called a trade deficit  and it is absolutely ripping our economy to shreds For a moment  imagine Uncle Sam standing next to a giant pile of money on a map of the United States   Then imagine a half a trillion dollars being taken out of that pile every single year So why haven t we totally run out of money yet Well  it is because we borrow those dollars back   In order to maintain our false standard of living  our federal government  our state governments and our local governments have to go out and beg the rest of the world to lend us our dollars back Sadly  our government schools have  dumbed down  the population so much that most of them don t even know what a  trade deficit  is anymore Meanwhile  our economic infrastructure is being gutted like a fish Look  I know that I go over this point over and over and over  but it is absolutely imperative that we all understand this The half a trillion dollars a year that leaves this country every year could have gone to support businesses and jobs inside the United States But instead it is going to support businesses and jobs on the other side of the world The consequences of this are absolutely devastating According to U S  Representative Betty Sutton  an average of 23 manufacturing facilities a day closed down in the United States during 2010   Overall  more than 56 000 manufacturing facilities in the United States have shut down since 2001 Even many so called  American companies  have been bought up by the rest of the world   The following comes from a recent article posted on Economy In Crisis    RCA is now a French company  Zenith is a Korean company  Frigidaire is a Swedish company  IBM s Personal Computer Division with its 500 patents is now a Chinese company  Westinghouse Nuclear Energy s major shareholder is Toshiba a Japanese Company  Lucent Technologies  a former research division of AT T  along with all the patents acquired from the beginning of the phone system  is now a French company  In 2008  Brazilian Belgian brewing company InBev purchased the iconic American brewer Anheuser Busch  makers of Budweiser  With the sale of these manufacturing companies  the future profit and technologies all belong to foreign entities We once had the greatest economic machine in the history of the world  Now it is being dismantled and bought up by foreigners  When America s economic infrastructure declines  that means that there are less jobs available for all of us  As I wrote about the other day  the employment situation in this country is not getting better and we have never even come close to recovering from the recession that started back in 2008  During 2008 and 2009  the U S  economy lost millions of jobs   Since the beginning of 2010  the percentage of the U S  population that has had a job has remained very stable    Normally  when a recession ends the percentage of Americans that have a job bounces back pretty dramatically So considering the fact that the employment situation has never recovered from the last financial crisis  what is going to happen when the next financial crisis hits And most of the jobs that have been  created  during this so called  recovery  have been low income jobs   In fact  if you look closely at the employment numbers that were released last Friday  you will find that the vast majority of the  new jobs  were part time jobs But you cannot pay a mortgage and support a family on a part time job Sadly  the truth is that median household income in America has been steadily dropping over the past several years   Tens of millions of American families are deeply struggling and more Americans than ever are falling into poverty Back in the year 2000  about one out of every nine Americans was living in poverty   Today  about one out of every seven Americans is living in poverty All of this is causing a great deal of anxiety in America today   Large numbers of Americans know that something has fundamentally changed  even if they don t understand the specifics   That is one reason why sites such as this one have become so popular   People want some answers And once people get some answers about what is really happening  they tend to want to prepare for the hard times that are coming In a few days  a new series on National Geographic entitled  Doomsday Preppers  premieres   The mainstream media is starting to take notice of the growing  prepper  movement in America today   It is estimated that there are at least 2 million  preppers  in the United States at this point   Of course people are  prepping  for a whole host of reasons  but the number one concern among most groups of preppers is the economy As the economy crumbles  more Americans than ever have decided that it is not a good thing to be 100  dependent on the system Back in 2008 and 2009  millions of Americans suddenly lost their jobs   Because they did not have any finances stored up  large numbers of them also lost their homes   Many went from being solidly middle class to being out on the street in a matter of months That doesn t have to happen to you   Instead of blowing your money on frivolous things  do what you can to set something aside for the difficult times that are on the horizon A lot of those  in the know  are quietly making their own preparations   For example  legendary film director James Cameron  Avatar  Titanic and Terminator  has purchased more than 2600 acres of farmland in New Zealand and he is getting out of the U S  for good apparently Unfortunately  most of us do not have the resources for something like that   But what most of us can do is we can change our priorities and start focusing on the things that will help us survive the hard times that are coming ,2012-02-06,Michael T.

178163,399679,IBM,Throwing Good Money After Bad,opinion,Massive purchases of Club Med country  Italy  Spain  Portugal  Greece  debts  funded by the European Central Bank  ECB   a collective Eurobond  the European Financial Stability Facility  EFSF  or the International Monetary Fund  IMF  any of these   will be a colossal misallocation of resources and a classic example of throwing good money after bad  In 1999 when the euro was launched  all participants   governments  investors  banks  bank regulators bought into a fundamental error  That error was that solely by adopting the euro somehow weaker credit countries like Portugal  Greece  Ireland  Spain and Italy were now to be treated like the AAA rated Germany  And  like a college student who has just been granted unlimited access to his parents  credit card  these weaker credit countries and their private sectors borrowed with wild abandon  The banks of the EU  encouraged by their governments and misguided regulation  feasted on the debts of these countries  And Germany s export engine significantly benefited from these countries as markets  Unfortunately the world has now  discovered  that the weaker credit countries really are weaker credits and the past twelve years of borrowing was a mistake  For me it s very simple  If credit has been misallocated  you stop the misallocation process and when necessary write off the past mistake  You don t throw more good money after bad  Let s start with the ECB  One hears deafening demands that the ECB begin printing money and buy the Club Med bonds  The world stock markets would no doubt rally  Just pick up any copy of the widely respected Financial Times and I m sure you ll find one of their columnists advocating just that  The German Chancellor Angela Merkel  who has been resisting this  is portrayed as the stubborn bad guy  For me  the ECB printing money to enable Italy to roll over its massive debt is the equivalent of destroying the euro in order to save it  The Germans of all people have a history of no less than six currencies in the twentieth century plus the memory of the early 1920s hyperinflation  I hope the Chancellor can stick to her guns  But I m not sure she can Funding the Club Med countries by a Eurobond would also be a mistake as would funding by the bewilderingly complicated financial contortion called the EFSF   Cut through the turgid language of any hypothetical future prospectus for a eurobond or the EFSF and this essentially amounts to Europe putting its hand into Germany s back pocket  Without a German  cosign  on the eurobonds or the EFSF borrowings  they are in the junk category  How can a gaggle of weak credit  bankrupt countries raise money through Eurobonds or the EFSF to bail out themselves Now we come to the IMF  The IMF was set up as part of the Bretton Woods system to offset imbalances that arose in a regime of fixed exchange rates   Unfortunately the fixed rate Bretton Woods system was ended in 1971   But for the IMF no problem  To corrupt General of the Army Douglas MacArthur s famous quote  old international agencies never die and they certainly don t fade away  Post 1973 the IMF reinvented itself and  went on to bail out one country after the other including Mexico in 1994  Indonesia  Thailand and Korea in 1997   Russia in 1998 and Argentina in 2001   The IMF has been widely criticized for its bailouts  In Asia  conditions were imposed that for example with Indonesia upset the domestic political order  Billions of dollars were stolen or wasted along the way  The Russian bailout was a particularly egregious example  Worst of all market participants learned that the IMF was always going to be there if they screwed up  The IMF has played a major role in global bubble creation and the installation of moral hazard in the world s financial sector   If the IMF gets involved with bailing out Europe  essentially this means that the rest of the world is going to do the bailing  Right now  the IMF doesn t have the cash to take on a full European bailout   According to Bloomberg  Euro area governments have to repay more than 1 1 trillion euros   1 5 trillion  of long  and short term debt in 2012  with about 519 billion euros of Italian  French and German debt maturing in the first half alone  European banks have about  665 billion of debt coming due in the first six months  with a further  370 billion by the end of the year   Europe is facing a huge problem  How to fund the upcoming Italian and Spanish debt and keep its insolvent banks from collapsing   Christine Lagarde  the head of the IMF  has said she expects the non European rest of the world to bolster the IMF s currently  inadequate  resources   There are those who would argue that the IMF s resources are too  adequate    That isn t going to go down well with the American public which views its own fiscally out of control government as unable to afford such a task   The Tea Party will be out in force if there is any hint of American backdoor participation via the IMF   To get around Congress and help bail out Mexico in 1994  US President Clinton pulled some  20 billion out of a US Treasury  shoebox  called the Exchange Stabilization Fund  He got away with that then but this time it won t be so easy  And I wonder about China  Spending a great deal of time in Hong Kong as I do  all I hear there is  China is still poor and Europe is rich but lazy  Why should we give money to these lazybones   Default Is the Best Option I believe Europe needs to find a way to allow its member states to default if necessary  Despite what seems to be the conventional wisdom  I hold the heretical view that increased fiscal union is not necessary for the euro to survive  Angela Merkel is pushing for tight fiscal controls to be imposed on the Club Med states  I would argue that the market can do the disciplining   Europe isn t ready for the kind of fiscal union Merkel seems to want  The problem is the Europeans don t trust markets  As I have argued repeatedly  nine American states defaulted in the 1840s  The defeated states defaulted after the American civil war in 1865   The US survived  Moreover  according to a new Peterson Institute paper by Reinhart and Rogoff  the province of Alberta defaulted on its debt in the 1930s  The last time I checked Canada was still there  Of course  the European banking systems will require massive recapitalization  especially since they are stuffed to the gills with Club Med debt  This recapitalization should take place with management changes and losses to bondholders as well as shareholders  Nobody including me has the stomach to let an entire banking system go down Having said all that  I seriously doubt the European leaders will do what I am suggesting  Instead  they will push for the ECB to print money  the IMF to join the bailout and the Club Meds to promise to fiscally sin no more  I would give them no better than a fifty percent chance of pulling this off   It is my belief any fiscal austerity will consist of largely growth destructive tax increases coupled with half hearted efforts at cutting back government  expenditures  Regardless of what they do  a major recession in Europe seems all but inevitable in 2012   The euro will survive at least until this  solution  is seen to be a failure  I will conclude this section with a quote from a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal  which summarizes my own views and is an example of reason in a cacophony of ill thought out global advice  Not all the financial media is advocating the easy way out  Europe s original sin in this crisis was not letting Greece default  remaining in the euro but shrinking its debt load as it reformed its economy  The example would have sent a useful message of discipline to countries and creditors alike  The fear at the time was that a default would spread the contagion of higher bond rates  but those rates have soared despite the bailouts of Greece and Portugal  The Recent Central Bank Moves Were NecessaryThe Federal Reserve  the Bank of Canada  the Bank of England  the Bank of Japan  the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bankfive other major central banks last week announced that they would take measures to provide cheap dollar financing for the ECB  The stock markets soared upward signaling their approval This was not designed to be a bailout of the Club Med countries  Rather it was to keep the European banking system functioning  I think in this case the Fed did the right thing  For those who care to look  the original purpose in the founding of the Fed was to offset seasonal funding shortages in the New York money markets and to be available in the case of a financial panic  The  Progressives  of the day didn t want America depending on the wisdom and goodwill of evil profit making private bankers  It will be recalled that J P  Morgan single handedly rescued the United States in the Panic of 1907   For that the he was vilified by the Progressives who were upset he might have made a profit on the whole thing  No good deed goes unpunished  Of course in 1914 the supporters of the new Fed couldn t imagine that their creation would be providing liquidity for European banks  What has been happening is a massive run on European banks  For example the vulnerability of American money market funds to European bank problems was exposed about two months ago in a Wall Street Journal article  Since then the American money funds have been pulling their deposits out of European banks  of course denying all the while that they had any vulnerability  This action was not some kind of back door bailout of Europe  Rather it is keeping Europe s fundamentally insolvent banking system functioning until a genuine bailout and recapitalization can be arranged  The European banking system was approaching the point where it could not fund and was about to implode  A Note on Global MarketsNo question that  as we have seen recently  gold can go down as well as up  Given that the advanced nations appear to all be headed for insolvency and that currency destruction is a time honored method of sovereign default  I continue to believe that holding some gold is a prudent investment strategy Having said that  investors have to face the facts  The global stock and bond markets are being manipulated by the central banks of the world  Quantitative easing is another word for market manipulation  Warren Buffet pretty much summed up how he was being manipulated  Interest rates are zero  he s got oodles of cash  IBM is a great company  he had to buy something  So long as there is no serious bad news  the market will  default  to an upward direction  Unfortunately  lately there has been a lot of bad news On the side of the bulls the US seems to be avoiding a recession  The coming European downturn is presumably already largely priced into share prices  If the Europeans can cobble together a deal that refinances the Club Med countries over the next year  no matter how bad this deal the markets will likely react positively  If no agreement is reached and the euro falls apart  the world enters a monetary abyss that could be very ugly  And so unnecessary  China remains a big question mark for global investors who long to find a place to hide  Right now  everything seems to be following the soft landing scenario in China  The economy is slowing in response to prior tightenings  plus exports to Europe will certainly be weak  and the Peoples Bank of China  PBOC  has started to ease  But as we should have learned by now  Chinese statistics are not reliable and China is a country where information does not flow freely  Is a hard landing lurking below the official numbers  I don t know the answer to this question and I m not sure anyone else does either   But I remain skeptical about China near term  The state owned Chinese banking system is not a real banking system in the Western sense and in some ways resembles a collection of Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs   Managements report ultimately to their political masters  in this case the Communist Party  and not shareholders  money is directed to capital wasting state owned firms and profligate local entities   repayment is always problematic and periodic state sponsored bank recapitalizations   sometimes fake  sometimes real    have been necessary   China follows a state   not a market   directed industrial policy where Solyndras abound and there is an overinvestment in real estate and some types of infrastructure   Environmental quality is a disaster  Offsetting all this has been the fact that hundreds of millions of Chinese have moved from the countryside to work in factories thus upping China s total factor productivity  And it should never be forgotten that Chinese people are on a global basis relatively intelligent  hardworking and well educated  And driven to get rich albeit no matter how  Economists find it hard to model the quality of a population in comparing countries and generally shy away from this since it is politically incorrect to do so  But in my opinion its people are China s major asset and so far have offset what is a terrible economic system  It is no fluke that Chinese dominated Hong Kong and Singapore   with Chinese energy and the inheritance of British law and a sense of honesty and transparency   have become economic miracles  My advice to any investor looking at China as a refuge from the bankrupt West is to stick to firms which have zero state ownership and zero connection to the real estate or state owned banking sectors   And remember  A Chinese hard landing will pull down all Chinese stocks

178166,399682,IBM,Bad News Is Good News ,opinion,FORECASTSTOCKS  As 2012 begins  very little has changed from the end of 2011  the European debt contagion remains in place and is growing  China remains on a growth deceleration curve   while the US is showing stable  albeit it very low growth  What is clear to us  is that at this point   the US is better positioned than the rest of the world  which simply means that it shall outperform yet again this year STRATEGY  Technically speaking  the S P 500 remains above longterm support at the 45 mema at 1190  which is critical given it delineates bull   bear markets  Now  given we are 5 trading days into the New Year  we ve witnessed lackluster trade on what has in past cycles been a very volatile period  The nascent 2012 rally is technically weak  and therefore suspect  Rallies are to be sold WORLD MARKETS ARE HIGHER ON THE OLD AX  BAD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS  as this morning s trade revolves completely around China and the fact her import growth slowed to  11 8    its lowest point in 2 years   and below all economists expectations  This is part and parcel of what we believe to be a  China hard landing  as opposed to a  soft landing  coined in the US back during the 90 s when Mr  Greenspan    The Maestro    was head of the US Fed  There is no such thing as a soft landing  it s a fallacy  but many now believe that the Chinese authorities shall loosen the purse strings in a bout of monetary and other fiscal ease that will support the Chinese economy from its major misallocation of capital in building out its infrastructure  History shall be the final arbiter of this period  but they shall look upon it with disdain and say  didn t they know would be the outcome   It reminds of the US housing bubble  which at the time was inconceivable That said  all the major bourses are higher  with the China s Shanghai Index rising 2 7   Europe is even higher except for Athens which is once again lower  This has also pushed up all manner of the commodity markets as one would expect  the precious metals are sharply higher  copper is higher  crude oil has topped  103 barrel   and this is a whole other situation no one seems to care about as when oil approaches  105 the stock market tends to have difficulty moving forward  Also  the US dollar is lower  which ostensibly means the Euro is higher   although it is only modestly higher now after having lost over   its gains Today  we ve included a chart of the S P 500 versus Italy s FTSE MIB Index  which are the top 40 liquid stocks trading in Italy  The chart clearly shows prices approaching the 2009 lows  and then if one flips to page 4 of this report   will even see more clearly the bearish consolidation that is carrying prices lower and perhaps to new lows before long  Even through today s  risk on  trade is the highlight  Italian 10 year bond yields are still at 7 13    down  3 bps on the session  with Thursday s note and bond auction looming rather large right now ON THE US FRONT  Today brings forth a number of tertiary economic reports and a bevy of Federal Reserve speakers  We aren t concerning ourselves with the data points  for they shouldn t make much difference in today s trade  However  SF Fed President Williams is speaking on the economy at 10am EST  and he just yesterday said that the economy would benefit from a further expansion of the Fed s balance sheet  This isn t surprising given it comes out of SF  which is Fed Vice Chairman s former stomping ground   and always considered dovish  Cleveland Fed President Pianalto is speaking on the labor markets at 11 10am EST  while Kansas City Fed President George speaks on the economy as well  Only Mr  Williams and Ms  Pianalto are voting members in 2012 TRADING STRATEGY  Yesterday we went long Volatility  VXX   and will do so given the myriad of negative fundamental and positive technical reasons  And  we shall keep a bit wider stop on this position as we move into Thursday s Italian bond auction given its yields stand at 7 13    above the 7 00  threshold for pain  For now  the market believes in a pan European solution  but we believe they shall continue to dither until the market inflicts enough pain that they will be forced monetize European debt much in the same manner as the US Fed has done Thereafter  we ll allow our short S P 500 position to remain in place using a buy stop  and we ll look upon the S P failing below the 1255 to 1260 zone as being sufficient to add further short positions in both our Short List and our Model Portfolio Lastly  we note yesterday s trade where four very large and important stocks traded lower on a day when the markets were higher  Google  GOOG   Apple  AAPL   Amazon  AMZN  and IBM  IBM   GOOG was down sharply  AAPL

and therefore suspect  Rallies are to be sold WORLD MARKETS HAVE CAUGHT A BOUT OF  DEFENSIVENESS  as the Euro currency has turned sharply lower overnight on news that Fitch s head of sovereign debt ratings said that the ECB must step up its purchases of Italian debt to prevent a  cataclysmic  Euro collapse  The European bourses turned lower from  even levels  and are trading lower by  0 6   the S P futures are lower by  4 points  and off their lows by several points  The commodity markets too are lower  with the energy complex leading the charge lower  precious metals are  mixed  after having been strongly higher  Regardless  we ll note that anytime the Euro stops going down  risk assets do gain a minor bid   so it seems as if markets are once again tethered to the Euro  Therefore  we re starting to see what may amount to being the first  risk off  day of the New Year The major overnight news is that Germany indeed contracted in 4Q 2011 to the tune of   0 25   We think many were surprised by this as many thought Germany was immune to the contagion taking place throughout Europe   much in the same manner as many believe the US is an  island  that can weather the storm as well  We think not  and the incoming data will likely confirm a deceleration is underway given the ECRI weekly index has turned lower signaling the risk of a negative growth or recession has increased substantially Also of note  Germany auctioned off  4 billion in 5 year notes yielding a paltry 0 9   Demand was rather high for the German notes  which to us shows  risk aversion  much in the same manner as the record amounts beingdeposited overnight by European banks the ECB  This bodes ill for tomorrow s Friday s Italian and Spanish debt auctions as the rush is towards safety and not risk  If this becomes the prevailing view  then the Euro shall move lower and sharply lower   likely taking all the asset markets lower with it FED OFFICALS SPEAK THEIR MIND  Yesterday  we noted that several Fed members were speaking on the economy  and indeed   they spoke virtually from the same playbook with the exception of new KC Fed President George  Both SF and CLE Fed Presidents stated that their economic GDP forecasts for 2012 were for growth of 2 5   while 2013 being a bit higher at 2013  They went to both say that the Fed was far below its employment mandate  and that inflation would be quiescent  Remember  both Williams and Pianalto are voting members of the 2012 FOMC That said  KC Fed President George basically reiterated what her predecessor was famous for  stating that the low level of interest rates were causing  risk chasing  and that I was inherently an unstable policy  Unfortunately or fortunately as the case may be   she isn t a voting member of the board this year she get to cast her vote in 2013 ostensibly when economic growth is back on track above 3 0  To sum it up   they didn t tread any new ground whatsoever  However  TODAY is a different day  and we ll hear from the likes of Chicago Fed President Evans  Atlanta Fed President Lockhart and our own Philly Fed President Plosser  We suspect that Messrs  Evans and Lockhart will virtually repeat the very same words that Mr  Williams and Ms  Pianalto spoke yesterday  Mr  Plosser is another story  his comments shall likely be from the same vein as Ms  George s speech  and should be more  hawkish    and perhaps stepped up a bit given that he isn t a voting member and the Committee that does vote has become decidedly more  dovish  TRADING STRATEGY  We are long Volatility  VXX   and are so given the myriad of negative fundamental and positive technical reasons  And  we shall keep a bit wider stop on this position as we move into Thursday s and Friday s Italian bond auction given its yields stand at or above the 7 00  threshold considered by many to be unsustainable  For now  the market believes in a pan  European solution  but we believe they shall continue to dither until the market inflicts enough pain that they will be forced monetize European debt much in the same manner as the US Fed has done We should note however  that although we want to be short the S P 500  yesterday s price action was rather  positive  in that it expanded  but did so right into major overhead resistance  This could very well be a  blow off  that shall reverse itself  and indeed that is what we expect  We ll look upon the S P trading below the 1255 to 1260 zone as being sufficient to add further short positions in both our Short List and our Model Portfolio Lastly  we noted Monday s trade where Google  GOOG   Apple  AAPL   Amazon  AMZN  and IBM  IBM  all traded lower as the market was higher  GOOG was down sharply  AAPL reversed lower after hitting new all time highs  Yesterday  given the strength of the rally   one would have thought each would have been sharply higher  Ney IBM was lower  with the other 3 closing not far above unchanged  This is a divergence  and it must be noted and respected

178173,399689,IBM,The Week Ahead   Rising Signs of Worry Amid the Complacency,opinion,S P s downgrades of a number of EU sovereigns appears to have had limited impact so far on risk appetite  which remains healthy on the surface  But beneath the surface signs of strain are increasingly evident EU focusThe key focus this week is the aftermath of the downgrade Friday by the S P bond ratings agency of multiple EU countries  including Spain  Portugal and Italy by two notches  and importantly  the downgrade of two of the triple AAA countries  Austria and France  by a notch  See our Chief Economist Steen Jakobsen s  in his chronicle from this weekend  The most important direct fall out from the downgrades is on the status of the EFSF  as only a shrinking minority of its sponsors are now AAA  The other hot potato issue for the week is the Greek PSI deal  where talks have fallen apart and various scenarios are on the table   the market continues to express the opinion that Greek debt is only worth about 20 cents on the dollar while the PSI deal is for only a 50 percent haircut  The risk is that Greece renegs on the deal and imposes new harsher terms that effectively constitute a default  which might in turn trigger an exit from the Euro Zone because the  troika   ECB  EC and IMF  refuses to advance any further bailout money  That would also have important implications for the ECB balance sheet and any contagion worries  Portugal the next in line  could deepen those worries EU bond auctionsSo far today  the fall out from the S P downgrades has been minimal in terms of bond yields across Europe  but the ECB is doubtless intervening to keep a lid on things again  The auction calendar this week is fairly light  shorter term bills from France  Spain and Belgium on Mon Tue  until Wednesday  when we have an auction of German 2 year debt and then on Thursday  the key day on the auction calendar  when Spain will be auctioning debt from 4  to 10 years and France will be auctioning a wide range of maturities  from 2 yeard up to almost 30 years  Technical and Intermarket indicators   rising worry evident amid complacencyIntermarket technicals are inconclusive   bond yields are easing back to the bottom of the medium term range   pointing to continued safe haven seeking and expectations for low growth  But asset markets appear rather complacent and are perhaps warming up for the next round of expected liquidity from the Fed in the form of QE3 and possibly looking for another wave of stimulus from China  We noted very complacent investor surveys last week and some divergence in the VIX  both of which continued this week  The new development over the last week has been signs of increased worry in the likes of Emerging Market bond spreads and Junk bond spreads EquitiesLooking ahead toward the end of this week for a heavier dose of  real economy  earnings reports from the likes of IBM and other US tech giants  though better indications on corporate earnings and outlooks are up next week  JP Morgan set the tone for weak bank earnings last week  with its major rivals reporting this week FXEuro very weak  but is trade getting crowded  Aussie is getting odd safe haven behavior  considering its historically very pro cyclical behavior  as a solid AAA sovereign in a world of increasingly ugly sovereign balance sheets elsewhere  But how would the Aussie fare in the event of a 8 10  correction in the S P500  USDJPY and EURJPY at painful levels once again for Japan   will they intervene again soon Economic Calendar this week   highlights

178191,399707,IBM,Quality of Earnings  Chapter 6,opinion,Investors rely heavily on the financials that companies release  But managements have significant leeway when it comes to creating its results  In this book  Thornton O Glove tells investors how to judge the quality of a company s earnings  in order to both protect against fraud and find value This chapter is about how one time charges or benefits can mask true earnings growth  or declines   The author takes the reader through a number of public company examples where temporary impacts to earnings masked changes in earnings power For example  O Glove shows the reader how IBM s 19  annual earnings growth is deceptive  After taking into account pension plan assumption changes  temporary tax rates  incentive compensation freezes and changes in depreciation  earnings are actually far less impressive A common theme throughout this chapter is related to advertising expenses  New managers will often increase or decrease advertising expenses  which can dramatically alter current earnings without much affecting current revenue  Future revenue  however  is often affected  Shareholders who take the time and effort to dig into such changes can profit from a market that misunderstands the earnings impact of increases or decreases to advertising expenses ,2011-10-23,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/quality-of-earnings:-chapter-6-103204,103204

178194,399710,IBM,Week in Review Part I  Europe  Washington and Wall Street,opinion,Last week  in patting myself on the back for being spot on with my yearend predictions for equities and commodities  as of that point  I added  But five weeks is an eternity these days and I wouldn t be the least bit surprised to see a big rally before yearend  No one said it has to be a rational one  Well  we sure got our rally  spurred by events in Europe  and also China  that were precipitated by just how awful the financial crisis had become across the pond  Make sense  It shouldn t  but then financial markets aren t always rational Talk about the wild and wacky  the week actually began with a little note from Greece that pretty well sums up just how nuts things have become there  Andreas Georgiou is the head of Elstat  Greece s new independent statistics agency  and he faces life in prison for  get this  allegedly inflating the scale of the country s fiscal crisis  Georgiou told the Financial Times  I am being prosecuted for not cooking the books  We would like to be a good  boring institution doing its job  Unfortunately  in Greece statistics is a combat sport   Georgiou is to appear in court on Dec  12 to answer the charges and the life in prison possibility hangs over him if he s convicted of  betraying the country s interests  As reported by the Financial Times  Kerin Hope  The investigation follows a public dispute over the 2009 budget deficit figure  Under Mr  Georgiou  the figure was revised upwards from 13 4 percent to 15 8 percent of gross domestic product   a record for a eurozone member state  The revised figure was accepted without reservation by Eurostat  the Brussels statistical service  The prosecutor cites a claim by professor Zoe Georganta  a senior statistician who was sacked along with other members of Elstat s board by Evangelos Venizelos  the finance minister  earlier this year  According to Ms  Georganta  the 2009 deficit was exaggerated by Elstat  so it would become larger than that of Ireland and Greece would be forced to adopt painful austerity measures   The thing is  according to revised Eurostat data  Greece would have failed to gain admission to the eurozone in 2001 in the first place because its deficit was too large  but back then the Greeks did nothing but lie about the books which is why they were let in So all the political parties are now blaming Georgiou for the harsh austerity programs they face  even though they d face them anyway if  say  he was off by a percent or two  It s nuts  But then this is Europe and the southern tier of the eurozone  be it Greece  Portugal  Italy or Spain  all played with the books in one form or another  They all did nothing  in essence  but lie  and or put their heads in the sand as debt levels exploded  So because of the acts of these nations  Ireland s situation is somewhat different in nature  a pure banking real estate crisis  but go ahead and lump them in with the other miscreants if you want   you have the likes of Sir Mervyn King  governor of the Bank of England  warning this week that eurozone woes have created  an exceptionally threatening environment  that threatens to  spiral  into a systemic financial crisis  The crisis in the euro area is one of solvency not liquidity  And the interconnectedness of major banks means the banking systems and economies around the world are all affected  Only the governments directly involved can find a way out of this crisis   he said Only Germany  that is  One of the more extraordinary statements of the week came from Poland s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski  delivered in the shadow of the Brandenburg Gate Sikorski declared that the biggest threat to his nation s security was not terrorism  or German tanks  or even Russian missiles  but  the collapse of the eurozone   I demand of Germany that  for your own sake and for ours  you help it survive and prosper  You know full well that nobody else can do it  I will probably be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so  but here it is  I fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity  You have become Europe s indispensable nation  Sikorski backed Germany s drive for deeper integration   deeper integration or collapse   he said  Of course this is exactly what German Chancellor Angela Merkel seeks  Or  as the Washington Post editorialized during the week  The choice is between a truly desperate future and a merely bleak one  It s up to Germany  And so it was that Merkel  speaking before the Bundestag on Friday  confirmed that she and French President Nicolas Sarkozy would meet in Paris on Monday  Dec  5  to go over a reform plan that would aim to create a  stability union  of the 17 eurozone nations  with far stricter budget rules  stricter surveillance of national budgets  and tougher penalties for non compliance  which is what the eurozone was supposed to have in the first place since formation of the union  The day before  Sarkozy echoed these themes Merkel said the euro s future was  inseparable from the future of European unity   noting how much Germans had benefited from the common currency   Too much is at stake  precisely for Germany and the Germans   she said  adding that German unification and European unity were  two sides of the same coin We will never forget that  But Merkel once again poured cold water on the idea of joint euro area bonds  adding the European Central Bank  ECB  cannot be relied upon to resolve the crisis because of its statutory limitations that make it different from the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England  Euro bonds were thus  unthinkable   said the chancellor  who was once freaked out when then President George W  Bush approached her from behind and put his hands on her shoulders  but I digress Earlier  Sarkozy warned his fellow euro zone leaders that they must accept a tighter union bound by enforceable fiscal rules or face dire consequences  There cannot be a single currency without economic convergence  Or the eurozone will explode  But while Chancellor Merkel said that for its part the ECB couldn t resolve the crisis  the ECB is indeed a huge key  and to that end ECB President Mario Draghi signaled he was prepared to ramp up the bank s role in supporting the likes of Italy and Spain if eurozone governments took the tough steps  such as deficit reduction  that Merkel is talking of  Heretofore  the ECB s bond buying program has been relatively minimal and  as a result  hasn t had the impact the bank sought to have  But at week s end  Draghi was talking as if the ECB was preparing to step up in a big way So you begin to see the workings of the deal that Merkel  Sarkozy and the ECB will be working on and then presenting  next week  culminating in the Dec  9 EU summit Now some of you might be thinking  hey  editor  you re leaving some important elements out in terms of the week s action and the huge rally in equities  Indeed I have  but before I get into them  understand that all of the above doesn t in any way resolve the growth crisis on the Euro continent  and how the massive austerity programs currently being launched  or about to be  i e   Italy and Spain  will in no way lead to the needed growth in the short to intermediate term  But it will  eventually  if governments have the guts to stick to their guns and the people accept the pain  one day lead to a much brighter future  This  though  is where leadership comes in and we all know that has been in short supply across the globe It s because of a current crisis of confidence  and a freeze up at the bank funding level  that we also saw a bazooka fired at Europe s financial institutions in the form of a massive  coordinated global central bank infusion of unlimited amounts of each country s money at a reduced interest rate  The action on the part of the U S  Federal Reserve  the ECB  and the central banks of Britain  Canada  Japan and Switzerland  pumped dollars into the troubled eurozone s banks   Investors had stopped lending money to these institutions  fearing the huge exposures the banks had to the sovereign debt of troubled euro nations and the banks needed dollars to fund their daily operations  for starters  amidst a classic credit squeeze  that in turn is leading to a continent wide credit crunch that is killing small businesses in particular at the worst possible time   As most easily explained in a London Times piece   There is a shortage of dollars because European banks have many outstanding loans  investments and market positions denominated in the American currency  but only limited supplies of dollar deposits   Traditionally  U S  money market funds have filled the gap but in recent months these funds have significantly slashed their European exposure  thus cutting off the flow of greenbacks Again  however  the move on the part of the central banks  which led to Wednesday s stupendous rally  including a rise in the Dow Jones of 490 points  in no way addressed the actual crisis in Europe  which is about massive debt and zero growth  It only addressed a symptom  which is why some of us say the week s action wasn t entirely rational but let the bulls have some fun  especially since I m not  short  In fact  Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul was correct in saying of the massive liquidity injection   Rather than calming markets  these arrangements should indicate just how frightened governments around the world are about the financial crisis  And remember the European Financial Stability Facility  or EFSF  the 440 billion euro rescue fund  with less than 250 billion still available  that was to be increased to at least 1 trillion euros in order to attempt to combat the issues facing Italy and Spain  1 trillion was never going to be enough  but you can stop worrying about it because it seems Europe s leaders  at least for this week  gave up trying to boost the fund  As the Financial Times editorialized   Turning the  remaining 250 billion euro  into 1 trillion or more would require a degree of financial engineering that the slickest bond trader would have struggled to flog in the boom years  Instead  eurozone ministers are working on credit protection for new sovereign bond issues  early details of which aren t worth getting into for this space  But here s something to ponder  if you re of the mind that the euro crisis is nearing a solution  though why you would think that I ll never know  Aside from the growth and austerity conundrum  Europe s banks and governments will be borrowing about  2 trillion next year   400 billion or more involving Italy alone   200 billion  Spain   So while the ECB  through its bond purchases this past week was successful in bringing down  for example  the yield on the Italian 10 year bond from 7 30  to about 6 50   and Spain s a record 100 basis points  who is going to continue to buy this stuff  assuming the ECB doesn t just fall asleep with its head pressed against the  Buy  button   We re talking it s easy to paint a picture for 2012  for starters  where we re still just lurching from one bond auction to the next in terms of influencing market sentiment  The likes of Italy and Spain would eventually have to default over time unless rates stabilize at levels much lower than even today  And the banks  Nationalization is a solution  such as with France  but that bears its own huge costs  especially  again  when there s no growth Just a few other tidbits on the topic   The other week I told you that for its part  the IMF had only  400 billion in funds to use on its various missions  hardly enough to help the eurozone further in any sizable way  especially with other obligations around the world  plus existing commitments to Greece  Portugal and Ireland  the three already having formally accepted bailouts  So  Christine Lagarde is going begging amongst the G 20 nations for further funding   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  in its twice yearly report on the global economic outlook  expects the eurozone to contract by 1  at an annualized rate in the current quarter and by 0 4  in the first three months of 2012  or the definition of a recession  albeit a mild one  We should be so lucky  For the OECD s 34 members  it is calling for growth of just 1 6  in 2012  down from its May forecast of 2 8   The OECD expects the U S  to grow by 2  in 2012    Britain suffered its worst work stoppage in a generation as the trains were halted and schools shut  though the airports remained open with few delays  An estimated 1 5 million public workers walked out to protest the Cameron government s draconian austerity program and pension cuts  but it could have been worse  Chancellor of the Exchequer  Treasury Secretary  George Osborne said Britain would remain resolute after sailing into  a debt storm   as Osborne conceded growth would be less than 1  this year and next   The Institute for Fiscal Studies  IFS  in the U K  estimates that British families are suffering through a squeeze in living standards that will have them no better off in 2016 than they were in 2002  But  and this gives you a sense of the real problem across the continent  and in the U S    the called for reductions in pensions  would still leave public sector workers with a far more generous package than their private sector counterparts  And  the IFS  added that public sector employees enjoyed an average pay premium of 7 5 percent over the private sector   Nonetheless  what the public employees only see is Osborne s plans to cut spending on the sector by 16 2 percent  the largest rolling back of the State since World War II   Anushka Asthana   London Times    Greece did finally receive its 8 billion euro tranche of aid from Bailout I  so it will be able to meet its payrolls and pension obligations for a spell   One reading on manufacturing activity in the eurozone had the PMI at 46 4 for November vs  47 1 the prior month  or below the 50 dividing line between growth and contraction  In non euro U K   the figure was 47 6 Washington and Wall Street  Stocks soared  with the Dow Jones up 7 0  and the S P 500 up 7 4   the best week for the latter since March 2009   The spring  09 comparison is a good one because if you believe that Europe is finally getting its act together  I obviously don t   it was Monday  March 9  2009 that markets around the world bottomed and by week s end  in the case of the Dow Jones  stocks had risen 9 0   10 6  for Nasdaq   That started a six week winning streak for the Dow  nine weeks for Nasdaq  So that s what the bulls are pinning their hopes on in terms of market history As noted above  the main catalyst for the U S  move was Europe  What s funny  though  is that Friday morning s employment report  showing a gain of 120 000 for November  as expected  with upward revisions to prior months and an unemployment rate falling from 9 0  to 8 6   had zero impact on stocks as by day s end the major averages were flat  Why would this be so  First off  the 8 6 figure was viewed skeptically by many seeing as it is partly a result of 315 000 leaving the labor force  i e   they quit looking for a job  That s not good  Plus the underemployment rate  while coming down  is still 15 6  and  importantly  average hourly earnings fell 0 1  in the month But 8 6  looks great in the headlines compared to the 9  plus we ve been dealing with and I imagine President Obama feels like Old Man Fezziwig  at least a slimmed down version   who enjoyed a party come holiday time with the best of them  On Thursday night I had dinner with a friend and we were talking about Obama  2012  and unemployment rates and I offered that if it s 8 4  come next November  Obama is re elected  Mark thought we d struggle to get below 9   At least for one month he owes me a beer  even as most everyone is in agreement the 8 6  will be adjusted upward before we see 8 5  or better One thing is for sure  however  The U S  is by some measurements  like manufacturing  performing better than any developed  or developing  nation on earth  hard as that might be to believe  Our own national ISM reading on manufacturing for November came in at 52 7  It fell to 49 0 in China  more on this later   The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index came in at a far better than expected 62 6  A reading on October construction spending  up 0 8   was better  The economy grew at 2  in the third quarter and seems likely to do just as well  if not a little better  in the current one  The Federal Reserve s Beige Book on regional economic activity showed the economy  increased at a slow to moderate pace  in 11 of 12 regions  St  Louis being the exception   And the White House  or Congress  had absolutely nothing to do with this  We ve gone through a huge retrenchment  slashed our debt  stopped paying our mortgages in many cases yes  it s twisted but that s available cash for major purchases and you add it all up and it s a recipe for slow growth But speaking of mortgages  the housing sector is still dead in the water  especially in terms of prices  as the latest S P Case Shiller data for September  these guys are slow data collectors  showed that prices in the 20 city index fell 0 6  over August and 3 6  from year ago levels  Still very tight lending standards  foreclosures and an ever looming inventory overhang will keep prices down and many an American underwater A few other items of note   Auto sales  as noted further below  were strong in November   Sales at the big box retailers  though  were only so so  up 3 1  year over year for the same month despite all the Black Friday hoopla you read about  or were a participant in  with sales that day up 6 6  over 2010  according to ShopperTrak  while Cyber Monday sales rose about 24   this according to IBM  So how do you only get 3 1  then  Discounting lots and lots of discounting with more to follow  But if stocks were to continue to rally into Christmas that will only help consumer confidence  which has been improving  and thus spending Finally  as Britain s Osborne talked about his country s  debt storm   we of course have one of our own  with record budget deficits each of the last three fiscal years  As I begin to think about what I ll predict for 2012  I have zero reason to change my early call of a debt related Crash I also have begun thinking heavily about international affairs and what could go wrong next year that in some cases could have a heavy bearing on sentiment and  boy  catch up on your sleep now because I can tell you already  either avoid my year end missive  posted Dec  31  or read it at your own risk because I m looking at a year with some awful potential flashpoints  massive civil unrest in Europe over austerity programs being but a mild one  though I have a month to fine tune things  Now who wants a beer ,2011-12-05,Brian Trumbore,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/week-in-review-part-i:-europe,-washington-and-wall-street-107691",107691
