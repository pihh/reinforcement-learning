117665,339180,URBN,Bear Of The Day  Urban Outfitters  URBN ,opinion,"Headquartered in Philadelphia  Urban Outfitters Inc  NASDAQ URBN    URBN  is a specialty lifestyle retailer that offers women s and men s apparel  accessories  footwear  and home d cor under five brand banners  Urban Outfitters  Anthropologie  Free People  BHLDN  and Terrain 
Holiday Sales Disappoint
Earlier this month  Urban released sales figures for the two months ended Dec  31  2019 that failed to impress Wall Street 
Net sales gained only 2 9  year over year  though this slight decline in retail sales was offset by 3  growth across its digital platforms  Comparable sales fell 1  year over year at the company s namesake brand  while comps grew 5  and 8  at Anthropologie and Free People  respectively 
What s more  gross margin is now expected to be low in the fourth quarter  mostly due to promotions and discounts during the holidays  Plus  delivery and logistics expenses jumped in order to  meet customer delivery expectations   most likely due to the shortened holiday season 
Analysts have turned bearish on Urban Outfitters  with twelve cutting estimates in the last 60 days for fiscal 2020
Earnings are expected to see double digit negative growth for the year  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 17 cents for that same time period from  2 29 to  2 12 per share This sentiment has stretched into 2021  though sales and earnings growth could return to positive territory 
URBN is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Shares of the retailer are down 15 7  in the last one year  and URBN took a hit after announcing underwhelming holiday sales  The S P 500 is up over 27  in comparison 
Bottom Line
These holiday sales figures definitely aren t the best news for Urban  especially coming off its disappointing third quarter  Like many apparel focused retailers  the company has been impacted by tariff pressures and high inventory levels  Despite consistent growth in its digital channels  investors seemed to have lost confidence in the stock 
Investors who are interested in adding a mall retail peer to their portfolio could take a look at Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ranked Zumiez  ZUMZ   which is seeing double digit earnings growth and positive estimate revisions for fiscal 2020

117667,339182,URBN,Retail Apparel   Shoes Industry Outlook  Prospects Bright,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies that offer apparel  activewear  footwear  accessories as well as fitness and lifestyle products under various brand names in domestic and international markets  These companies showcase products through their own outlets and websites  However  some of the industry participants distribute products via other specialty retail outlets  department stores  franchise stores and catalogs  Some of the prominent names in the industry are Capri Holdings Limited  CPRI   Foot Locker  NYSE FL   Inc   FL   L Brands  NYSE LB   Inc   LB   The Gap  Inc   GPS  and Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN   Inc   URBN  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry s prospects are closely tied to the purchasing power of consumers  who look pretty confident now  A sturdy labor market and rising income levels are paving the way for higher spending  While apparel is the core segment of the industry  increasing popularity of fitness activities is driving the need for suitable footwear  Quick product innovation plays a crucial role in bolstering sales  Companies  constant endeavors toward bringing new styles enable them to resort to full price  instead of markdowns  which in turn help drive revenues  Notably  sales at both clothing   clothing accessories stores have increased 1 6  on a sequential basis during the month of December 2019  Industry participants are playing dual in store and online roles with evolving consumer shopping pattern  Apart from upgrading digitally  companies are coming up with unique products and better deals  Some of the companies are even trying their hand at subscription or rental services for its offerings  Again  the growing popularity of second hand clothes and accessories are persuading fashion retailers to change business model  Initiatives such as building omni channel  coming up with loyalty and marketing programs  enhancing supply chain and providing faster delivery options are also worth mentioning  Simultaneously  companies are investing in renovation and improved checkouts and mobile point of sale capabilities to keep stores relevant  These should boost revenues of the industry players as well  The industry is quite fragmented with companies vying for a bigger slice of the pie on attributes such as price  products and speed to market  Players in this space are battling competition from online retailers  particularly Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and private label brands and fashion fast names like H M and Zara  Addressing these  a significant number of players in the industry have been making investments to strengthen their digital ecosystem and accelerating shipping and delivery capabilities  While these endeavors might boost sales  they entail high costs  Apart from these  higher marketing  advertising and other store related expenses  and adverse currency rates thanks to a strong U S  dollar might also compress margins  Nevertheless  companies are trying all means to contain costs Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Retail   Apparel And Shoes industry is a 36 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  103  which places it in the top 40  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates encouraging near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1  The industry s position in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence on this group s earnings growth potential  Since the beginning of December  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has increased approximately 5 3  We will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation first Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Zacks Retail   Apparel And Shoes industry has underperformed both the broader Retail   Wholesale Sector and the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 25 1   the Zacks S P 500 Composite and Zacks Retail   Wholesale Sector have gained 23 8  and 17 9   respectively One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to earnings  P E   which is commonly used for valuing retail stocks  the industry is currently trading at 11 67X compared with the S P 500 s 19 13X and the sector s 25 54X Over the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 18 38X and as low as 10 23X  with the median being at 14 26X  as the chart below shows Price to Earnings Ratio  Past 5 Years  Bottom LinePlayers in the industry are gaining from a conducive consumer environment  Endeavors such as ramped up digital penetration  store openings  merchandising improvement and international expansion bode well  The industry participants are making every effort to enhance brand offerings through store refurbishment and bringing in more compelling assortments  These factors are likely to help the industry players in generating higher revenues  However  SG A expenses are on the rise and competition is intense  Even though retailers have undertaken e commerce initiatives and are seeing sales growth in the channel  online sales usually generate lower margins owing to factors like shipping charges  and costs related to deliveries and returns  among others That said  we are presenting four stocks from the Retail   Apparel And Shoes space that are well positioned to capitalize on

s third quarter fiscal 2020 results failed to impress investors  While the company s positive earnings surprise streak came to an end  net sales fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter in row Again  bottom line declined year over year but top line improved from the year ago period benefiting from favorable response to apparel assortments and growth in the digital channel  Notably  comparable Retail segment net sales increased during the quarter under review  Moreover  management remains encouraged by positive sales so far in the fourth quarter that coincides with the holiday season An InsightThis lifestyle specialty retail company delivered earnings of 56 cents a share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  The company witnessed negative earnings surprise  after nine straight quarters of beat  Again  the bottom line declined 20  year over year on account of gross margin contraction  increased SG A expenses and higher effective tax rate In the reported quarter  net sales of  987 5 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 001 million but increased 1 4  from the prior year period  Notably  the company witnessed sales

at the Retail Segment but fell 6 7  to  88 3 million at the Wholesale Segment Comparable Retail segment net sales rose 3  on account of strength in the digital channel  partially offset by lower retail store sales  Brand wise  comparable Retail segment net sales rose 9  at Free People and 4  at the Anthropologie Group but were flat at Urban Outfitters Margin PerformanceIn the quarter under review  gross profit came in at  321 1 million  down 4 9  from the year ago quarter  Gross margin shrunk 217 basis points to approximately 32 5   primarily due to increased markdowns  deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses  and lower Wholesale segment margins SG A expenses rose 1 9  to  245 8 million  while as a percentage of net sales  the metric increased 11 basis points to 24 9   This

quarter URBN Retail segment comps to improve in low single digit  Gross margin is expected to contract roughly 200 basis points in the final quarter  This can be attributed to increased markdown rates

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Urban Outfitters due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Urban Outfitters Q2 Earnings Beat Estimate  Fall Y YUrban Outfitters Inc  NASDAQ URBN   s second quarter fiscal 2020 results failed to impress investors  Although  this Philadelphia  Pennsylvania based company continued with its positive earnings surprise streak  net sales fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate after surpassing the same in the preceding quarter  We note that both the top and the bottom line declined from the year ago period  Also  gross margin contracted and comparable Retail segment net sales fell year over year Management stated that the reported quarter was not the  finest  one  It further added that Anthropologie and Urban brands witnessed lower than expected sales and margins  Soft customer acceptance resulted in higher markdowns and lower merchandise margins  Moreover  sluggish store traffic weighed on comparable Retail segment net sales Nonetheless  the company highlighted there has been a favorable response to its early fall apparel assortments and  comp sales  so far in the third quarter have been positive across all three brands An InsightThis lifestyle specialty retail company posted earnings of 61 cents a share that surpassed the consensus mark of 58 cents  This was the ninth straight quarter of earnings beat  However  the bottom line declined 27 4  year over year on account of lower net sales  gross margin contraction and higher effective tax rate In the reported quarter  net sales of  962 3 million came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  985 million and fell 3  from the prior year period  The year over year fall in net sales can be attributed to negative comparable Retail Segment net sales and decline in the Wholesale segment Well the company witnessed dismal performance across all its brands  namely Anthropologie Group  Urban Outfitters and Free People  However  Food and Beverage segment sales increased in double digits At Anthropologie Group  net sales were down 1 7  to  394 3 million  while the same at Free People fell 0 2  to  205 9 million  At Urban Outfitters  net sales decreased 6 4  to  355 million  Meanwhile  Food and Beverage net sales came in at  7 1 million  up 29 9  from the prior year quarter The company s net sales tumbled 2 6  to  878 7 million at the Retail Segment and 7 5  to  83 6 million at the Wholesale Segment Comparable Retail segment net sales declined 3  on account of lower retail store sales  partially mitigated by improvement in the digital channel  Brand wise  comparable Retail segment net sales rose 6  at Free People but decreased 3  at the Anthropologie Group and 5  at Urban Outfitters Margin PerformanceIn the quarter under review  gross profit came in at  315 9 million  down 11 2  from the year ago quarter  Gross margin shrunk 304 basis points  bps  to approximately 32 8   mainly due to increased markdowns and deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses as well as store occupancy SG A expenses edged down 0 5  to  237 8 million  However  as a percentage of net sales  SG A expenses increased 62 basis points to 24 7  on account of higher marketing expenses to drive digital sales as well as the launch of new monthly women s apparel subscription rental service  Nuuly Operating income came in at  78 1 million  down 33 2  from the year ago quarter s figure  while operating margin shriveled 370 bps to 8 1  Store UpdateDuring the six months ended Jul 31  2019  the company opened seven new retail locations  three Anthropologie

URBN Retail segment comps to improve in low single digit  Gross margin is likely to contract roughly 200 basis points in the third quarter  This can be attributed to increased markdown rates  deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses and the launch of Nuuly  SG A expenses are likely to increase roughly 5  in the third quarter  owing to elevated digital marketing investments to drive

117781,339296,URBN,Will Margin Woes Hurt Fastenal s  FAST  Earnings In Q3 ,opinion,Fastenal Company   NASDAQ FAST   is scheduled to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 11  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 7   That said  it surpassed the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters  while met the same once  with average positive earnings surprise of 0 45  Markedly  second quarter 2019 earnings declined 2 7  but revenues increased 7 9  year over year  Notably  sales growth slowed to 7 9  year over year  marking the first sub 10  reading in nine quarters  The increase was driven by higher unit sales  primarily related to growth drivers  with notable contributions from industrial vending  Onsite locations and construction  Higher underlying market demand than second quarter 2018 also contributed to the growth How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to be reported quarter has remained unchanged at 36 cents over the past 60 days  This indicates 2 9  growth from the year ago level  Revenues are expected to be  1 37 billion  up 7 4  year over year  Fastenal Company Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Key FactorsWe expect the U S  industrial market to register growth in the third quarter  albeit at a slower rate than in 2018  thereby driving high single digit revenue growth  Over the past couple of months  Fastenal s sales have softened on a year over year basis  with average daily sales growth of 6 1  and 6 3  in July and August  respectively  Considering these readings  average daily sales growth is certainly expected to slow down in the third quarter from the year ago level  13   and last reported quarter  7 9   This modest growth rate in daily sales is consistent with management s softer macro outlook  general market slowdown and inventory destocking seen across the industrial space Nonetheless  growth in core product offerings like Onsite Locations vending machines managed inventory is expected to benefit Fastenal in the third quarter of 2019 Higher Non Residential End Market Demand  Construction market  especially non residential and manufacturing  is expected to act as a major tailwind for Fastenal s performance in the quarter Vending Machines to Drive Growth  Over the last few quarters  Fastenal s sales have been driven by increased installation of industrial vending machines  Sales through vending devices continue to grow at a double digit pace  primarily due to higher installed base  This trend is likely to continue in the quarter to be reported Onsite Locations to Boost Sales  A consistent increase in the number of on site locations is likely to strengthen Fastenal s market share and boost quarterly numbers  The increased number of onsite locations is likely to expand its market share  The trend is expected to continue in third quarter 2019 as well  The company aims at achieving 375 400 onsite signings in 2019  implying an increase from 336 a year ago In a nutshell  strong momentum in construction  vending machine installations and onsite locations are likely to support top line growth in the to be reported quarter Gross Margin Pressure  Fastenal s changes in product and customer mix have been hurting gross margin for quite some time now  Increased product costs  higher freight expenses  and changes in product and customer mix are expected to impact its third quarter gross margin To offset tariffs placed on products sourced from China to date  Fastenal has been successfully raising prices  However  those increases were not sufficient to counter general inflation in the marketplace  The company has undertaken additional steps in third quarter 2019 to counter cost pressure and the incremental tariffs that were levied on China sourced products in May 2019 Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts Our proven model does not suggest that Fastenal is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP  The company has an Earnings ESP of  0 16  as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at 36 cents  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Fastenal currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions You can see  Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the Zacks  sector

117821,339336,URBN,Analysts Estimate Urban Outfitters  URBN  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 20  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This clothing and accessories retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 59 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  29 8  
Revenues are expected to be  986 61 million  down 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 95  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Urban Outfitters 
For Urban Outfitters  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 39  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Urban Outfitters will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Urban Outfitters would post earnings of  0 26 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 31  delivering a surprise of  19 23  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Urban Outfitters doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-urban-outfitters-urbn-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200454662,200454662

117823,339338,URBN,Retail Apparel   Shoes Industry Outlook  Prospects Galore,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies that offer apparel  activewear  footwear  accessories  electronics as well as fitness and lifestyle products under various brand names in domestic and international markets  These companies showcase products through their own outlets and websites  However  some companies distribute products via other specialty retail outlets  department stores  franchise stores and catalogs  Some of the prominent names in the industry are Capri Holdings Limited  CPRI   Foot Locker  NYSE FL   Inc   FL   L Brands  NYSE LB   Inc   LB   The Gap  Inc   GPS  and Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN   Inc   URBN  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry s prospects are closely tied to the purchasing power of consumers  who look pretty confident now  A solid labor market and rise in disposable income make way for higher spending  Consumer spending  which is one of the driving factors of the economy  rose at a 4 7  rate in the second quarter  While apparel is the core segment of the industry  increasing popularity of fitness activities is driving the need for suitable footwear  Quick product innovation plays a key role in bolstering the sales graph  Companies  constant endeavors toward bringing new styles allow them to resort to full price  instead of markdowns  which in turn help lift revenues  Industry participants are playing dual in store and online roles with evolving consumers  shopping pattern  Apart from upgrading digitally  companies are coming up with unique products and better deals  Initiatives such as building omni channel  coming up with loyalty and marketing programs  enhancing supply chain and providing faster delivery options are also worth a mention  Simultaneously  companies are investing in renovation and improved checkouts and mobile point of sale capabilities to keep stores relevant  These should boost revenues of the industry players as well  The industry is quite fragmented with companies vying for a bigger slice of the pie on attributes such as price  products and speed to market  The space has turned highly competitive since Amazon  AMZN  started dominating all possible business arenas and altering the way consumers shop  A significant number of players have been making heavy investments to strengthen their digital ecosystem and accelerating shipping and delivery capabilities  While these endeavors might boost sales  they entail high costs  Apart from these  higher marketing  advertising and other store related expenses  and adverse currency rates due to a strong U S  dollar might also compress margins  Nevertheless  companies are trying all means to contain costs  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Retail   Apparel And Shoes industry is a 53 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  49  which places it in the top 19  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates encouraging near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1  The industry s position in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence on this group s earnings growth potential  Since the beginning of July  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has increased approximately 6 8  We will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation first Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Zacks Retail   Apparel

industry has traded as high as 18 35X  as low as 9 62X and at the median of 14 44X  as the chart below shows Price to Earnings Ratio  Past 5 Years  Bottom LinePlayers in the industry are gaining from a favorable consumer environment  Endeavors such as ramped up digital penetration  store openings  merchandising improvement and international expansion bode well  Participants in the industry are making all possible efforts to enhance brand offerings through store refurbishment and bringing in more compelling assortments  These factors are likely to help companies in the industry generate higher revenues  However  SG A expenses are on the rise and competition is intense That said  we are presenting four stocks from the Retail   Apparel And Shoes space that are well positioned to

lines came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This was the eighth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise While net sales showed a marginal improvement  earnings fell sharply from the year ago period  Also  gross margin contracted year over year and rate of growth of comparable Retail segment net sales decelerated sequentially  Management also highlighted that the company has been grappling with soft store traffic so far in May These factors along with a soft guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 seem to have weighed on investors  sentiments  Markedly  shares of the company fell roughly 6  during the after market trading session on May 21  Even the announcement of a subscription rental service for women s clothes called Nuuly failed to provide any impetus to the stock In fact  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has lost 11  in the past three months compared with the  s decline of 13  Coming to the quarterly outcome  this lifestyle specialty retail company posted earnings of 31 cents a share that surpassed the consensus mark of 26 cents  However  the bottom line declined 18 4  year over year on account of higher cost of sales resulting in lower gross margin and increased SG A expenses An Insight Into RevenuesIn the reported quarter  net sales of  864 4 million topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  857 3 million and advanced a meagre 1  from the prior year period  The year over year growth in sales came on account of positive comparable Retail Segment net sales and continued growth in the Wholesale segment Well the company witnessed decent

double digit improvement in the digital channel  somewhat negated by lower retail store sales  Brand wise  comparable Retail Segment net sales rose 2  at Free People and 1  at Anthropologie Group  while it remained flat at Urban Outfitters Urban Outfitters  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Margin PerformanceIn the quarter under review  gross profit came in at  269 1 million  down 4 1  from the year ago quarter  Gross margin shrunk 167 basis points  bps  to approximately 31 1   mainly due to lower gross profit in the Retail segment  partly offset by higher gross profit in the Wholesale segment  The decline in Retail segment gross margin was due to increased markdowns  and deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses SG A expenses rose 1  to  229 million on account of higher marketing expenses to support the digital channel sales growth  As percentage of net sales  SG A expenses remained flat at 26 5  Operating income came in at  40 million  down 25 7  from the

it has started second quarter fiscal 2020  below first quarter trend and internal expectations   On the basis of its quarter to date performance  management anticipates second quarter URBN Retail segment comps to decline in low single digit range Based on the comps projection  gross margin is likely to contract more than 300 bps in the second quarter  This can be attributed to increased

Even though retail is one of the weaker industries  as poor weather and Chinese tariffs played havoc on them in the second quarter of the year  there are a bunch of retail innovators  some that are publicly traded  and some that aren t  that are bucking the trend 
The Hot Private Innovators
These companies haven t gone IPO 
Not yet 
But they are certainly on many people s lips because of what they are doing right now in retail  And you never know who is suddenly going to file to go public 
1        Rent the Runway has a valuation of about  1 billion as of March 2019  Did you know you can rent a prom dress from the site 
2        Glossier is one of the top new beauty brands  It has brick and mortar stores in New York and LA  It also has a fiercely loyal customer base 
These Innovators Have Gone Public
1        Stitch Fix   NASDAQ SFIX   is the old man on this list  They went public in 2017  Last quarter  active clients was up 17  to 3 1 million  Revenue per active client grew 8  to  467  It s expanding its men s business and is now in Kids  Also  it recently jumped the pond to the UK

Some of the old school retailers also have divisions that are innovating 
Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   bought Trunk Club which is a similar business model to Stitch Fix  It s so similar that when I googled  Trunk Club   Stitch Fix ads appear at the top of the search 
Yet Nordstrom is trading at just 9x earnings

3     Thor Industries   NYSE THO   has missed three quarters in a row  This RV maker has seen its stock crushed down as tariffs and higher commodity costs have hit earnings  Additionally  the Street is concerned that the Baby Boomer buying frenzy may come to an end in a recession  Have the shares bottomed

lines grew year over year and the latter marked its seventh straight quarter of positive surprise  However  sales fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate after delivering six consecutive beats  Also  the company initiated fiscal 2020 with lower than expected sales These factors along with a soft guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 seem to have weighed on investors  sentiments  Markedly  shares of the company lost 3 8  during the after market trading session on Mar 3  In fact  Urban Outfitters has tumbled 18 1  in the past three months  against the  s growth of 0 8  Coming to the quarterly outcome  this lifestyle specialty retail company posted adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents and improved 20 3  year over year  We note that bottom line growth was backed by improved sales and margins along with lower taxes Urban Outfitters  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   An Insight Into RevenuesIn the reported quarter  net sales of  1 128 9 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 133 million  though it advanced 3 7  year over year  Sales growth was driven by improvements in retail segment comps and increased wholesale sales  The company also appears to have benefitted from record holiday sales unveiled recently  However  currency headwinds dented fourth quarter sales by roughly 50 basis points  bps  Well  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company witnessed decent performance at its Urban Outfitters  Anthropologie Group and Free People brands  Also  Food and Beverage segment sales increased double digits  At Urban Outfitters  net sales were up 3 1  to  447 5 million  while the same at Anthropologie Group improved 3 9  to  464 6 million  At Free People  nest sales increased 3 8

2 9  to  81 2 million at the Wholesale Segment  The increase in Wholesale Segment net sales can be attributed to sales increase at Anthropologie Home business and slight growth in Free People wholesale revenues Comparable Retail Segment net sales increased 3  on double digit improvement in the digital channel  somewhat negated by lower retail store sales  Brand wise  comparable Retail Segment net sales rose 4  at Free People  2  at the Anthropologie Group and 4  at Urban Outfitters  This was the sixth successive quarter when each of the company s brands reported positive comparable Retail Segment net sales Margin PerformanceIn the quarter under review  adjusted gross profit came in at  376 1 million  up 6 8  from the year ago quarter  Adjusted gross margin expanded about 100 bps to approximately 33 3   mainly due to lower markdowns and better initial mark ups  Additionally  adjusted gross margin was fueled by store occupancy cost leverage Adjusted SG A expenses increased 4 2  to  258 3 million  As percentage of net sales  adjusted SG A expenses grew more than 10 bps to roughly 22 9  Adjusted operating income came in at  117 8 million  up 12 9  from the year ago quarter s

it has started fiscal 2020 with softer than expected sales  On the basis of its quarter to date performance  management anticipates first quarter fiscal 2020 comps in the range of flat to low single digits decline for the Retail segment Based on the comps projection  gross margin is likely to contract about 150 bps in the first quarter  This can be attributed to increased markdown rates  escalated logistic costs and store occupancy expense deleverage  SG A expenses are likely to increase roughly 3  in the first quarter  owing to elevated digital investments to aid digital channel

117908,339423,URBN,Foot Locker  Urban Outfitters  FedEx And United Parcel Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 20  2019    Foot Locker   NYSE FL   as the Bull of the Day  Urban Outfitters  Inc    NASDAQ URBN   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on FedEx   NYSE FDX   and United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  Here is a synopsis of all four stocks   Shares of Foot Locker have climbed 14  this year to outpace the S P 500 and its industry s 9  average climb  The sneaker focused sporting goods retailer is also coming off a better than expected quarter and looks poised to expand its bottom line as it invests in the future of its industry OverviewFoot Locker saw its comparable store sales  which includes existing stores and its website  surge 9 7   This blew away Wall Street s 4 5  estimate  More specifically  physical same store sales popped 5 7   while online sales skyrocketed roughly 30   This strength was important for Foot Locker during the vital holiday shopping period and helped shake off concerns that sportswear giants such as Nike  NYSE NKE  and Adidas  direct to consumer push in the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  age would hurt FL Investors should note that some of the strength came on the back of consumers  willingness to spend more money on sneakers  In fact  average selling prices jumped by a double digit percent to help offset a low single digit decline in traffic  Yet  executives noted that Foot Locker s traffic outpaced overall mall traffic Growth InitiativesThe New York based company announced in early February a  100 million minority investment in secondary sneaker market firm GOAT Group  Foot Locker s investment comes as the sneaker market continues to explode  For instance  luxury fashion e commerce company Farfetch purchased Stadium Goods for  250 million late last year in an effort to capture a portion of this quickly growing market Foot Locker s core customers are digital natives that range from 12  to 25 year olds  This means FL must adapt with the times and cater to its tech savvy  sneakerhead  consumers  The company currently boasts 9 7 million followers on quickly expanding Instagram where brands are built and people shop to top the likes of Under Armour s 7 million and blow away Dicks Sporting Goods Foot Locker has also invested millions in children s lifestyle brand Super Heroic  women s luxury activewear brand Carbon38  and footwear design academy Pensole  Plus  late last month  FL invested in subscription based clothing service Rockets of Awesome  which is akin to Stitch Fix for kids OutlookClearly  Foot Locker is looking to the future in order to grow in a quickly changing retail landscape  As we mentioned at the top  shares of FL have climbed 14  so far this year and are now up 39  over the last 12 months  This crushes the Retail Apparel Shoe Market s 14  average decline and easily tops the S P 500 s 5  growth  Investors will also notice that FL stock has been able to return to growth  while its industry and the likes of Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  and Dick s have failed to regain traction Looking ahead  FL s first

Outlook   Earnings Trends
Urban Outfitters  management earlier this month provided subdued first quarter fiscal 2020 guidance on the company s conference call with analysts  The company said that its sales started out the year weaker than it had anticipated  This prompted URBN executives to call for its retail segment s comparable sales to come in flat or decline by low single digits in Q1   If comp sales do come in low single digit negative  we believe URBN s gross margin rate for the first quarter could decline by approximately 150 basis points   CFO Frank Conforti said on its earnings call 
 The decline in gross profit margin could be due to higher markdown rates in order to keep inventory current and allow for necessary new receipts

Bottom Line
Urban is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  at the moment due  in large part  to its recent wave of negative earnings revision activity  This shows investors that analysts are more bearish on the company s near term earnings outlook 
Plus  the company s stock price has fluctuated pretty widely despite solid growth  which might make it more of a trader s stock than an investor s right now  URBN also doesn t pay a dividend  so there are limited silver linings to owning it when its price continues to fall   
Investors still interested in the industry might instead look to other retailers  such as Abercrombie   Fitch  ANF   Boot Barn  BOOT   Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   JWN   Foot Locker  NYSE FL   FL   and Canada Goose  GOOS   which are all either Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  stocks at the moment

117911,339426,URBN,Urban Outfitters  URBN  Up 4 8  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Urban Outfitters  URBN   Shares have added about 4 8  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Urban Outfitters due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Urban Outfitters Q4 Earnings Beat  Sales MissUrban Outfitters Inc  NASDAQ URBN   reported fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein both top and bottom lines grew year over year and the latter marked its seventh straight quarter of positive surprise  However  sales fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate after delivering six consecutive beats  Also  the company commenced fiscal 2020 on a soft note These factors along with a soft guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 seem to have weighed on investors  sentiments Coming to the quarterly outcome  this lifestyle specialty retail company posted adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents and improved 20 3  year over year  We note that bottom line growth was backed by improved sales and margins along with lower taxes An Insight Into RevenuesIn the reported quarter  net sales of  1 128 9 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 133 million  though it advanced 3 7  year over year  Sales growth was driven by improvements in retail segment comps and increased wholesale sales  The company also appears to have benefitted from record holiday sales unveiled recently  However  currency headwinds dented fourth quarter sales by roughly 50 basis points  bps  Well  the company witnessed decent performance at its Urban Outfitters  Anthropologie Group and Free People brands  Also  Food and Beverage segment sales increased double digits  At Urban Outfitters  net sales were up 3 1  to  447 5 million  while the same at Anthropologie Group improved 3 9  to  464 6 million  At Free People  net sales increased 3 8  to  209 3 million  Meanwhile  Food and Beverage net sales came in at  7 5 million  up 18 1  from the prior year quarter The company s net sales grew 3 7  to  1 047 7 million at the Retail Segment and 2 9  to  81 2 million at the Wholesale Segment  The increase in Wholesale Segment net sales can be attributed to sales increase at Anthropologie Home business and slight growth in Free People wholesale revenues Comparable Retail Segment net sales increased 3  on double digit improvement in the digital channel  somewhat negated by lower retail store sales  Brand wise  comparable Retail Segment net sales rose 4  at Free People  2  at the Anthropologie Group and 4  at Urban Outfitters  This was the sixth successive quarter when each of the company s brands reported positive comparable Retail Segment net sales Margin PerformanceIn the quarter under review  adjusted gross profit came in at  376 1 million  up 6 8  from the year ago quarter  Adjusted gross margin expanded about 100 bps to approximately 33 3   mainly due to lower markdowns and better initial mark ups  Additionally  adjusted gross margin was fueled by store occupancy cost leverage Adjusted SG A expenses increased 4 2  to  258 3 million  As percentage of net sales  adjusted SG A expenses grew more than 10 bps to roughly 22 9  Adjusted operating income came in at  117 8 million  up 12 9  from the year ago quarter s figure  while adjusted operating margin increased 80 bps to 10 4  Store UpdateDuring fiscal 2019  the company opened 18 retail locations   four Anthropologie Group stores  five Urban Outfitters stores  six Free People stores  and three Food and Beverage restaurants  It shuttered 11 locations   three Anthropologie Group stores  three Free People stores and five Urban Outfitters stores  During the said period  the company opened five franchisee owned stores   four Urban Outfitters outlets and one Free People outlet Management intends to inaugurate 24 stores and shutter 13 in fiscal 2020 Other Financial DetailsThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  358 3 million  marketable securities of  57 3 million and total shareholders  equity of  1 489 1 million  Management incurred capital expenditures of  25 million during the fourth quarter and  115 million in fiscal 2019  For fiscal 2020  management anticipates capital expenditures of nearly  260 million In August 2017  the company s board of directors authorized buyback of 20 million shares  out of which 14 4 million were remaining at the end of fiscal 2019  During the year ended Jan 31  2019  the company repurchased and thereafter retired 3 5 million shares for about  121 million  This includes 2 million shares repurchased for about  64 million during the fourth quarter OutlookManagement stated that it has started fiscal 2020 with softer than expected sales  On the basis of its quarter to date performance  management anticipates first quarter fiscal 2020 comps in the range of flat to down low single digits in the Retail segment Based on the comps projection  gross margin is likely to contract about 150 bps in the first quarter  This can be attributed to increased markdown rates  escalated logistic costs and store occupancy expense deleverage  SG A expenses are likely to increase roughly 3  in the first quarter  owing to elevated digital investments to aid digital channel sales 
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
It turns out  fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month  The consensus estimate has shifted  34 46  due to these changes 
VGM Scores
At this time  Urban Outfitters has a strong Growth Score of A  though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F  However  the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side  putting it in the top 40  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise Urban Outfitters has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-04-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/urban-outfitters-urbn-up-48-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200403962,200403962
117912,339427,URBN,Earnings Preview  Urban Outfitters  URBN  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN  reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 21  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This clothing and accessories retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 26 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  31 6  
Revenues are expected to be  857 36 million  up 0 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 92  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Urban Outfitters 
For Urban Outfitters  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 88  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Urban Outfitters will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Urban Outfitters would post earnings of  0 78 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 83  delivering a surprise of  6 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Urban Outfitters doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-urban-outfitters-urbn-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200421200,200421200

117980,339495,URBN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Amazon  Abercrombie   Fitch  Urban Outfitters  DSW And RH,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 7  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Amazon Inc   NASDAQ AMZN    Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF    Urban Outfitters  Inc    NASDAQ URBN    DSW Inc    NYSE DSW   and RH   NYSE RH   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Cheer Up  Retailers Enjoyed Best Holiday Season in YearsIt seems nothing could dissuade U S  shoppers from splurging during the holiday shopping season  Although Wall Street did go through a topsy turvy ride  not even the threat of a U S  government shutdown or concerns raised by eminent economists of a global economic slowdown could deter the shopping spree  Instead a healthy U S  economic backdrop provided the wherewithal to consumers to throng at stores and log onto online sites for the best bargains It goes without saying that retailers have finished off the holiday shopping season with a bang  which undoubtedly calls for investing in the space Retail Sector Enjoys Best Holiday Season in 6 YearsAccording to the most recent Mastercard  NYSE MA  SpendingPulse report  holiday retail sales  from November 1 through December 24  grew 5 1  last year to more than  850 billion  the strongest in six years  Apparel and home improvement mostly lifted retail sales Apparel sales from before Thanksgiving through Christmas soared 7 9  last year compared with 2017   registering the best growth rate since 2010   per Mastercard SpendingPulse that mostly tracks outlays in stores and online across all payment options  In fact  apparel sales gained momentum during the back to school season and accelerated right up to the Christmas season  Home improvement spending  by the way  increased across the United States at a rate of 9  over the holiday season  The trend commenced before the holiday season and continued all through the end of 2018  At the same time  home furniture and furnishing witnessed an increase of 2 3  It was also a memorable year for online retail  with sales climbing 19 1  over 2017  per the Mastercard study  One of the major online players  Amazon Inc  itself  recorded the best holiday season sales ever  The e commerce giant claimed that it shipped a billion products for free in the United States alone through its Amazon Prime subscription program Steve Sadove  senior advisor  Mastercard and former chief economic officer and chairman  Saks Incorporated chipped in and said that  by combining the right inventory with the right mix of online versus in store  many retailers were able to give consumers what they wanted via the right shopping channels  Black Friday   Thanksgiving Sales Have Been Massive in 2018Mastercard total spend for Black Friday  online and offline  was  23 billion in 2018  up nearly 9  from the day after Thanksgiving in 2017  Further  Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  Analytics that predominantly tracks digital sales announced that online purchases on Black Friday climbed 24  to  6 2 billion in 2018 compared with 2017  In fact  many shopped on their smartphones on Thanksgiving Online sales during Thanksgiving were  3 7 billion  up 28  from a year ago  This marked the fastest growing online sales in history on Thanksgiving Day  added Adobe  The Thanksgiving Day also turned out to be the first day in 2018 to witness  1 billion in sales on smartphones Customer Growth Partners  nonetheless  summed up by saying that the overall four day Black Friday weekend sales totaled a whopping  60 billion  While consumer electronics and appliance sales jumped 6 4   apparel sales climbed 5 4    the best since 2011 Catalysts Behind the Rise in SpendingThe strong holiday sales are being fueled by a healthy economy and high levels of consumer confidence  The U S  economy got a boost in the third quarter of 2018  with GDP increasing at an annualized pace of 3 5   per the U S  Commerce Department  In fact  the country s total output of goods and services followed an even stronger growth of 4 2  in the second quarter  The U S  economy  thus  in the second and third quarters of 2018  taken together recorded the fastest six month growth in four years and is on track to hit the Trump administration s annual growth target of 3  Also  let s admit spending rose primarily due to confident consumers  Skeptics may say that the Conference Board  a business research group  indicated that the confidence index had fallen to 128 1 last month from 136 4 in November  However  such a reading still shows that consumer spirits are high by historic standards 4 Top Retailers to Buy NowGiven the record holiday shopping season  retailers are undoubtedly off to a strong start  Hence  it will be

Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN  soared on Wednesday morning  trading 4  higher 
Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  upgraded the clothing retailer from equal weight to outperform 
However  the stock s market cycles suggest a move lower by February and beyond 


Morgan Stanley equity analyst Kimberly Greenberger upgraded Urban Outfitters to overweight  with a price target of  44  Of the 10 analysts covering URBN  none had recommended buying the stock 
Yet given Morgan Stanley s recent survey of 2000 consumers on topics related to clothing preferences  Greenberger believes the retailer derives competitive advantage from its fashion credibility relative to companies in the same industry 
We disagree on her recommendation  This is based on our analysis of the market cycles for URBN  We can see that stock is in the declining phase of its current cycle  Our projections suggest a price of around  30 by February 
Beyond that  we believe the stock is in a negative cycle pattern  which suggests a downward zig zag for months to come  Likewise  its head and shoulders top projects to a price around  20 later this year

The retailer posted net sales of  1 032 million for the fourth quarter  up 1 7  compared to the same period last year  but below estimates of  1 037 million 
Comparable sales remained flat as CEO Richard Hayne said  higher markdowns than expected  weighed on holiday season sales and pointed out that the increasing number of stores selling apparel is one the broader problems in the industry 
 The U S  market is oversaturated with retail space and far too much of that space is occupied by stores selling apparel   he said   Retail square feet per capita in the United States is more than six times that of Europe or Japan  And this doesn t count digital commerce  
Some analysts remained bearish about Urban Outfitters  ability to grow margins amid a period of a slowdown in foot traffic in malls 
William Blair analyst Dylan Carden downgraded Urban Outfitters to Market Perform on Wednesday  and warned investors that near term investment spending and a  more subdued  comparable sales outlook should continue to delay margin recovery

118061,339576,URBN,Can Urban Outfitters  URBN  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this clothing and accessories retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 18 60   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Urban Outfitters came out with earnings of  0 84 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 76 per share  representing a surprise of 10 53   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 30 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 38 per share  delivering a surprise of 26 67  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Urban Outfitters  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Urban Outfitters currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 28   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on November 19  2018 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-11-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-urban-outfitters-urbn-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200358245,200358245
118062,339577,URBN,Urban Outfitters  URBN  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 19  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This clothing and accessories retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  53 7  
Revenues are expected to be  968 63 million  up 8 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Urban Outfitters 
For Urban Outfitters  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 28  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Urban Outfitters will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Urban Outfitters would post earnings of  0 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 84  delivering a surprise of  10 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Urban Outfitters appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/urban-outfitters-urbn-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200358308,200358308

118097,339612,URBN,Why Hold Strategy Is Apt For Dollar Tree  DLTR  Stock Now ,opinion,Shares of Dollar Tree  Inc    NASDAQ DLTR   have lost 9 4  since the company reported lower than expected first quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 31  Also  management s trimmed earnings forecast for fiscal 2018 and higher SG A expenses are hurting investors  sentiment A glance at the company s share price performance shows that it has declined 17 6  year to date against the  s rally of 11 6   The stock s dismal run is also evident from its  of F  which indicates that the chances of recovery are bleak  What s Hurting the Stock Dollar Tree s first quarter fiscal 2018 results marked its second straight sales and earnings miss  Furthermore  deleverage in SG A rate owing to higher labor expenses  store payroll costs and utilities expenses are weighing on margins  Evidently  gross margin in the quarter contracted mainly due to increased shrink  distribution and occupancy expenses  Lower gross margin coupled with increased expenses weighed on the operating margin that declined year over year Additionally  analysts are becoming bearish on the stock as apparent from the downward revisions in its earnings estimates  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 58 for fiscal 2018 and  6 26 for fiscal 2019 moved south 7 cents and 13 cents  respectively  in the last 30 days  Also  the estimate of  1 15 for the fiscal second quarter revised downward by 3 cents in the last 30 days  Management now envisions earnings per share in the range of  4 80  5 10 for fiscal 2018  down from  5 25  5 60 guided earlier  Earnings for the impending quarter are envisioned in the range of  1 07  1 16 per share This apart  Dollar Tree is facing higher freight and fuel cost related challenges  which is expected to continue  Also  the company operates in the highly competitive discount retail merchandise sector  Consequently  it faces stiff competition from well known industry players  This  in turn  might hurt the company s top line and profitability Is There Any Upside Potential Though the aforesaid factors reveal Dollar Tree s darker side  its ongoing integration of Family Dollar  which represented nearly 50  of the company s consolidated sales in first quarter fiscal 2018  is noteworthy  In addition  the company is undertaking significant store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar to attract more customers  While the increased costs and cannibalization during the integration and re banner process are expected to weigh on the company s results for some time  it expects to generate annual run rate synergies worth at least  300 million by the end of the third year of this acquisition In fact  Dollar Tree has become a mega U S  discount with this transaction  The combined chain is positioned to reach out to more value seeking consumers through a network spanning across vast geographies  Further  the company offers broader and multiple assortments at more compelling prices and is better positioned to negotiate with suppliers Moreover  Dollar Tree remains committed toward expanding its store base while incorporating technological advancements  The company also leverages an extensive network of stores to effectively penetrate targeted markets  which is expected to generate increased sales and market share  Notably  the company added the Snack Zone to 214 Dollar Tree stores in the fiscal first quarter and plans to launch this into 750 Dollar Tree stores in fiscal 2018  In fact  management remains on track to operate over 10 000 Dollar Tree and over 15 000 Family Dollar outlets across the United States in the long term Also  the company s focus on consumables and discretionary categories  and the everyday low price model are expected to boost traffic  We believe that this

At 16 15GMT or 11 15AM ET  the Dow 30 fell 111 points or 0 65   while the S P 500 slipped 17 points or 0 86  and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite lost 40 points or 0 82  
Chinese exports plunged 25 4  from a year earlier in February  far worse than forecasts for a decline of 12 5  and the worst monthly performance since May 2009  while imports dropped 13 8   compared to expectations for a fall of 10 0  
Amidst similar global growth worries  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  said on Tuesday that its January monthly composite leading indicators  which are supposed to capture economic turning points  flagged  signs of easing growth  in the 34 advanced economies belonging to the group 
Additionally  International Monetary Fund  IMF  deputy chief David Lipton warned on Tuesday that the global economic recovery was at risk of becoming derailed and urged global leaders to take coordinated action 
In other discouraging news on a light calendar day stateside  small business optimism unexpectedly declined in February  according to the National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  survey 
With the pending monetary policy meeting from the Federal Reserve  Fed  scheduled for March 15 and 16  no officials were scheduled to speak on Tuesday as the 7 day blackout period for communications began

However  Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer offered an opposing view as he insisted that  we may well at present be seeing the first stirring of an increase in the inflation rate  
Oil prices showed massive volatility throughout Tuesday s session but finally took a leg down as it pulled back from 3 month highs as investors weighed the worrying data from China  the world s second largest oil consumer  along with comments from Kuwait s oil minister that freezing production would only be considered if all the major producers agreed and a report from Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  that insisted that the recent rally was overdone and unsustainable 
This bearish news flow appeared to outweigh the message from Latin American ministers that planned to hold discussions about supporting market prices on Friday 
Meanwhile  market players looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U S  stockpiles of crude and refined products to gauge the strength of demand in the world s largest oil consuming country

 All things considered this was a good number but not too strong where you feel the Fed is behind the curve   equity trader Mark Kepner from Themis Trading told Bloomberg 
Chicago Fed president Charles Evans had said in various interviews this week that a strengthening of labor market conditions could put a rate hike on the table for the Fed s June meeting

118101,339616,URBN,Canada Goose Holdings  GOOS  Hit Fresh Highs  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Canada Goose Holdings   NYSE GOOS    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 60 2  over the past month  GOOS hit a new 52 week high of  68 75 in the previous session  Canada Goose Holdings has gained 102 8  since the start of the year compared to the 14 5  move for the Retail Wholesale sector and the 7 6  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on June 15  2018  Canada Goose Holdings reported EPS of  0 07 vs  the Zacks Consensus of   0 08 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 62 74  
For the current fiscal year  Canada Goose Holdings is expected to post earnings of  0 81 per share on  542 61 million in revenues  This represents a 22 73  change in EPS on a 16 3  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 01 per share on  654 45 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 24 38  and 20 61   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Though GOOS has recently hit a 52 week high  what is next for Canada Goose Holdings  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Canada Goose Holdings has a Value Score of F  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 78 8X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 82 3X versus its peer group s average of 10 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 3 1  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Canada Goose Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Canada Goose Holdings passes the test  Thus  it seems as though GOOS shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 8  2018  Canada Goose Holdings reported EPS of  0 46 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 36 
For the current fiscal year  Canada Goose Holdings is expected to post earnings of  0 72 per share on  431 14 million in revenues 
Valuation Metrics
While GOOS has moved to its 52 week high in the recent past  investors need to be asking  what is next for the company  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Canada Goose Holdings has a Value Score of F  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 62 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 22 3X versus its peer group s average of 10 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 39  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Canada Goose Holdings Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Canada Goose Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Canada Goose Holdings fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though GOOS shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Canada Goose Holdings Stack Up to the Competition

regardless of higher gas prices Continued upswing in retail numbers from April through May confirmed that a tightening labor market  upbeat wage rates and lower taxes are leading to more money in commoners  wallets   Apparel shops  restaurants  departmental stores  automobile retailers  building materials outlets  to name a few  saw an uptick in sales last month  So  it s time to invest in retailers that are likely to make the most of the bullish economic sentiments What Do the Numbers Exhibit Yesterday s Commerce Department report revealed that overall U S  retail sales in May jumped 0 8  to  502 billion  marking its biggest gain since November 2017  Sales upswing was 5 9  last month  on a year over year basis  April sales were  in fact  revised to show a 0 4  advance instead of 0 2  The so called core retail sales that exclude food services  auto dealers  building materials stores and gasoline stations rose 0 5   subsequent to an upwardly revised 0 6  gain in April  This indicated that the rise in gasoline prices failed to curb consumer spending levels Per the U S  Energy Information Administration  the national average price for a gallon of gasoline was  2 92 in May  up almost 16 cents from April and the highest since mid 2014  With global oil prices rising on account of   Trump s Iran deal pullback and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  intension to curb production  gasoline prices are likely to remain elevated Winners   LosersRetail sales growth was mostly broad based in May  with 10 of the 13 major retail categories witnessing a rise in sales Sales at clothing stores shot up 1 3   notching the highest advance in more than a year  Receipts at restaurants and bars also grew 1 3   marking its best advance since January 2017  Last month s sales in departmental stores rose 1 5     the best level since the beginning of 2017 Heightened hurricane rebuilding activities pushed up building materials  sales by 2 4   against the dip of 0 8  in April  Purchases from automobile and part dealers improved 0 5   outperforming the 0 2  growth recorded in the prior month Sales at service stations improved 2   on account of higher gasoline prices  The continued upswing in prices  if sustained  might pull away spending from other categories going forward   Three sectors   sporting goods and hobby stores  food and beverage  and furniture and home furnishings failed to add up in May s retail numbers  Notably  sales at the furniture stores skidded 2 4   marking the worst fall since December 2013 What Stoked Spending Thursday s solid retail report signaled that U S  economy will likely remain a bustling one in the second quarter  Perhaps that s why the Fed policy makers lifted interest rates for the second spell in 2018 on Wednesday and signaled additional hikes in the back half of the year A separate report released by the Labor Department yesterday disclosed that weekly jobless claims  in America  bolstering the country s stretched workforce market scenario  The unemployment rate dipped to 3 8  in May  its lowest level since the dot com roar of the early 2000  Also  a 2 7  year over year upswing in last month s average hourly earnings wiped out fears of wage stagnation Additionally  the December enacted tax overhaul helped to boost up Americans  take home pay   While the top rate of individual income tax brackets got trimmed from 39 6  to 37   the 33  bracket declined to 32   the 28  bracket to 24   the 25  bracket to 22   and the 15  bracket to 12  Notably  upbeat consumer sentiment propelled

118160,339675,URBN,Deeper back to school discounts to hurt teen clothing retailers,news,"By Sruthi Ramakrishnan
 Reuters    U S  teenage apparel retailers face another tough back to school season as they are forced to discount more to lure customers who are flocking to trendier shops and embracing online shopping 
This could be a major setback for apparel companies such as Abercrombie   Fitch Co  N ANF  and  Aeropostale  Inc  N ARO   which have been struggling to revive their businesses 
The back to school season  spanning mid July to early September  generates the most sales and profits for apparel retailers  second only to the end of the year holiday season 
Retailers that sell apparel to teens and young adults are expected to discount 5 10 percent more than in 2014  said Bill Martin  founder of research firm ShopperTrak 
Martin noted that last year was the worst for the apparel industry since 2010  with retailers offering discounts of 35 percent on an average 
There is little choice but to discount 
 Other than discounting  they have no other tool in their arsenal  short term  to stimulate sales   Kurt Jetta  chief executive of consumer analytics firm Tabs said 
If these retailers don t discount  they will face significant losses from selling their merchandise at clearance sales  further hurting margins  he said 
Discounting  however  doesn t guarantee higher sales 
Abercrombie is expected to report a 5 percent fall in sales for the August October period  from a year earlier  while Aeropostale s sales are expected to decline 12 percent  according to Thomson Reuters data 
Consumer sentiment has improved but parents are more likely to spend on big ticket items such as iPhones for their kids  rather than on clothes from retailers like Abercrombie  whose preppy designs have lost appeal 
National Retail Federation  the biggest retail association in the United States  has said it expects consumers to spend  68 billion on back to school items this year  down 9 percent from last year 
 Out of financial necessity  the retailers doing the worst going into back to school season will promote the most  This would include Gap Inc  N GPS  and Abercrombie   Jetta said  He also expects Aeropostale and Urban Outfitters  O URBN  to offer heavy promotions 
Abercrombie is expected to post a 31 percent fall in profit for the August October period 
Aeropostale is expected to report a smaller loss for the same period  mainly because it is cutting costs aggressively  including store closure and jobcuts  It has reported falling sales and losses for the last 10 quarters 

Aeropostale s shares have lost a third of their value this year  while Abercrombie is down by a quarter ",2015-07-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/deeper-back-to-school-discounts-to-hurt-teen-clothing-retailers-352277,352277

efforts and technological advancements is commendable  Moreover  the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed estimates in seven of the trailing eight quarters  Also  sales outpaced the same in three of the last four quarters In the past six months  shares of the company have gained 14 9   outperforming the  s 5 8  upside  Also  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has a  of B and a long term earnings growth rate of 6   which is impressive Furthermore  analysts are growing bullish on the stock as evident from increase in earnings estimates over the last 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 45 for fiscal 2018 and  3 58 for fiscal 2019 moved up 3 cents  respectively  Let s delve deeper Growth DriversNordstrom remains on track to reach the long term growth target of  20 billion by 2020  driven by its solid customer based strategy  Also  the company plans to strike a balance between its sales and expense growth  Further  Nordstrom is making amendments to its operating model in response to the constant slowdown in mall traffic resulting from customers  shift to online shopping In addition  the company is executing its strategy of enhancing market share through persistent store expansion and further investments  particularly in digital growth  Opening of new stores attracts customers and boosts the company s top line via synergies across other channels  Notably  the company has successfully completed its planned full line store expansion in Canada by opening six stores therein  Moreover  Nordstrom opened three stores in the Toronto and Calgary areas this spring and is on track to open three new stores in fall 2018  Simultaneously  the company remains keen on domestic store expansion Apart from widening its footprint through store openings  Nordstrom is strengthening capabilities by advancing in the technology space  Management is boosting e commerce and digital networks as well as improving its supply chain channels and marketing efforts  It also purchased two major retail technology entities   BevyUp and MessageYes   to cater to customers preferring online shopping  While BevyUp is a leading digital selling device  MessageYes is an iconic platform for conversational trading  In fact  the company s first quarter fiscal 2018 results reflected significant progress on its digital strategy  We believe these efforts will help Nordstrom to deliver sustainable growth over the long term Furthermore  Nordstrom runs in coherence with the evolving retail industry that is focused on offering maximum choices to customers to enhance their shopping experience  Recently  management announced the expansion of extended sizing for 100 brands across 30 stores  This will include various merchandising categories such as dresses  denim  swimwear  activewear and lingerie  Meanwhile  the company continues to efficiently allocate a major portion of its capital toward the multichannel growth strategy focused on improving its merchandise  developing IT infrastructure  renovating stores with a modern look  and developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery to online customers  We believe these initiatives should build a healthy relationship with customers  thereby enhancing customer loyalty DeterrentsWhile the aforesaid initiatives speak well about Nordstrom  investments related to occupancy  technology  supply chain and marketing expenses remain a short term headwind for the company  In fact  this has been impacting its gross margins  which contracted 21 basis points  bps  in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 after a respective decline of 42 bps  12 bps and 25 bps in the fourth  third and second quarters of fiscal 2017  This  in turn  might hurt the company s overall profitability

118168,339683,URBN,The World Cup Begins  Global Week Ahead,opinion,"We have lots of global events this week  counted in terms of soccer games  a historic diplomatic summit  and three major monetary policy meetings 
Coming hot out of the trading gates on Monday  global stock markets will already be digesting the chaotic meetings over trade and security between Trump and leaders of the other G7 nations at a weekend summit in Canada 
Below are five big Reuter s in London world market themes  These are likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders alike  in the coming Global Week Ahead 
I put Thursday s World Cup opener at number 4 out of 5  with Brexit the caboose 
 1  The U S  and North Korea Summit Happens on Tuesday
On Tuesday  U S  President Donald Trump and North Korea s Kim Jong Un are due to meet for a historic summit in Singapore  In an ideal scenario  Kim would agree to abandon all of the North s nuclear capabilities in return for Trump easing sanctions on his economy 
But things are rarely ideal  and they are unlikely to be simple  either  Complete  verifiable and irreversible dismantlement   or CVID as it is known in nuclear circles   almost certainly isn t what Kim has in mind  so whether Trump shows any flexibility will be crucial 
Financial markets barely reacted when the two were trading bombastic barbs last year but investors still aren t sure how to trade Trump s new softer side or Kim s readiness to trade his nuclear arsenal for recognition and aid 
There is a whole multitude of options  and assigning probabilities to scenarios as extreme as nuclear Armageddon or lasting peace on the Korean peninsula is no easy task 
 2  The FOMC Meets and Hikes Rates 25 bps on Wednesday
On Wednesday  the world s most influential central bank  the Federal Reserve  looks all set to raise U S  interest rates for a second time this year and the seventh since December 2015 
Strong jobs data last week and signs that inflation is nearing the 2 percent sweet spot mean Fed chairman Jerome Powell and his Open Market Committee are in a good position to lift rates again despite the angst over Trump s global trade tariffs 
Markets are fully priced for the move so what could the effects be  According to a recent poll by Reuters  the average 30 year mortgage rate will rise to 4 60 percent by year end and then touch 5 0 percent by end 2019  That will mean loan affordability is getting steadily worse 
Emerging markets who borrow heavily in dollars won t enjoy it much either if it pushes up the greenback again  A number of key countries in the EM complex are already under intense pressure and higher U S  rates won t help at all 
 3  The European Central Bank  the ECB  Discusses Exiting  QE 
European Central Bank rate setters have put the cat among the pigeons by suggesting they will look past Italy s political problems when they meet on Thursday and push on with discussions to close their 2 55 trillion euro bond buying scheme 
It has made it one of the most keenly anticipated meetings for a long time  If the bond buying ends  rate hikes can t be far behind  Investors are starting to price in the summer of 2019 for a possible first move  with some even suggesting the bank s  0 4 percent deposit rate could be back up to zero by the end of next year 
Italian politicians have also ramped up their war of words  accusing the ECB of showing  bias  against Italy by favoring Germany in its bond buying program While Mario Draghi   Co  are unlikely to take the bait  investors are speculating that they may decide it is not worth the hassle to continue with the program and get embroiled in further political squabbles 
 4  The World Cup Begins on Thursday
The biggest sporting event on the planet   the FIFA World Cup   starts in Russia on June 14th  And as much as bookmakers agree either Germany or Brazil will lift the famous trophy  financial analysts are equally unified on another matter  large amounts of beer will be consumed 
Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  found that 2 3 percent more beer gets drunk in a host country during a World Cup year when they looked at the four previous hosts   France  Germany  South Africa and Brazil 
Carlsberg  CO CARLa   the market leader in Russia  and Budweiser maker ABInBev  an official sponsor  could therefore be the top scorers 
ABInBev has also estimated that its sales in soccer hotbeds Brazil and Argentina will go up by 0 5 to 1 percentage points and though it s difficult to attribute it to football fever with certainty  both Heineken and ABInBev outperformed other brewers during the last World Cup in 2014 
 5  Brexit Gets Attention in Britain s Parliament
After months of building up immunity to the slow moving Brexit saga  investors may be hit by a dose of sterling volatility next week as the process enters a potentially critical phase  Britain s parliament votes on June 12th on amendments to the government s EU withdrawal bill  ahead of a critical summit of EU leaders later in the month 
Time is running out for Prime Minister Theresa May  and her cabinet appears more divided than ever  May s future is again being called into question  and speculation is even growing again that there could be a general election later in the year 
While sterling and gilts look relatively calm on the surface  traders are beginning to take cover via the options market  1 month sterling dollar implied volatility this week rose nearly 1 per cent  a relatively small move in nominal terms  but the biggest weekly rise in four months 
Top Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Stocks 
 1  Oshkosh Corp    NYSE OSK    On top of a high  1 Rank  this  5 5B market cap stock holds a Zacks long term VGM score of B  led by an A in Value  This is an equipment maker for autos and trucks  2  Chemed Corp    NYSE CHE    This is a  1 ranked   5 2B market cap  outpatient and home health care player  with a long term Zacks VGM score of B  Help to the aging is very profitable right now in the USA     3  Urban Outfitters   NASDAQ URBN    Yes  a  1 ranked retail apparel and shoe seller is on the lists this week  Not all of retail is dead  but the USA is still grossly over stored  The long term Zacks VGM score is A    
Key Global Macro 
Tuesday s U S  North Korea summit will get lots of coverage The FOMC meeting wraps up on Wednesday  That is a high for the week  But don t forget that the ECB meets and the BoJ meets too   
The 25 bps hike by the Fed is a done deal  The summary of economic projections should move little  The one trade able issue is whether the FOMC heads for one more or two more rate hikes this year 
Late in the week  we get the U S  Trade Representative release of its final list of targeted Chinese imports  That could be a stock market buzz killer

On Wednesday  the U K  s CPI comes out  It could rise from  2 4  y y to  2 6  y y 
The FOMC meets and is likely to get the Fed Funds rate from 1 75  to 2 0  Argentina s unemployment rate comes out  It could go from 7 2  to 8 2   That pretty good  given the financial chaos

The HICP for the Eurozone as a whole is out  It has been  1 1  y y 
On Friday  Russia s main monetary policy rate  the Key Rate should stay at 7 25

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Urban Outfitters and Stitch Fix are sporting Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy   respectively  right now  This means that URBN s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
URBN currently has a forward P E ratio of 19 13  while SFIX has a forward P E of 119 25  We also note that URBN has a PEG ratio of 1 59  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  SFIX currently has a PEG ratio of 7 95 
Another notable valuation metric for URBN is its P B ratio of 3 79  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  SFIX has a P B of 8 54 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to URBN s Value grade of B and SFIX s Value grade of D

118176,339691,URBN,Teen apparel retailer Aeropostale rehires former CEO Geiger,news," Reuters    Teen apparel retailer Aeropostale Inc said it had reappointed Julian Geiger as chief executive as it seeks to win back customers and stanch six quarters of losses 
The company s shares rose as much as 11 percent in extended trading on Monday 
Geiger  63  was CEO of the retailer from 1996 to 2009  and drove up sales at Aeropostale to  1 9 billion in 2008  from  140 million in 1998  Geiger  who joins with immediate effect  will also continue to serve as a member of the board  
Geiger replaces Thomas Johnson  who has held the position since 2010 
The company has struggled to keep pace with changing fashion trends and attracting its mostly teen customers  who are cutting back on spending amid a weak job market and low wage growth 
Like other teen apparel retailers  Aeropostale has also been losing out to fast fashion brands such as H M  Forever 21 and Inditex s Zara  which bring the latest styles from the runway to their stores within weeks 
Aeropostale said it expects a loss of 42 45 cents per share  excluding items  for the second quarter ended Aug  3  It had earlier forecast a loss of 55 61 cents per share 
Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 58 cents  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
Morgan Stanley analysts had warned in May that the company could raise going concern doubts next year as it burns up cash amid mounting losses 
Many large retailers that cater to low  and middle income consumers reported disappointing quarterly sales at their established stores last week  pointing to a cutback in spending on discretionary items 
The teen retailer said revenue fell 13 percent to  396 2 million in the second quarter  Sales at stores open for at least a year fell 13 percent  making it the eighth straight quarterly comparable sales decline 
Rival American Apparel Inc also said same store sales fell 6 percent  while revenue was flat in the second quarter ended June 30 
Urban Outfitters Inc also reported flat same store sales growth in the quarter ended July 31

118186,339701,URBN,Retailers give themselves makeover as millennials follow own beat,news,By Jilian Mincer  NEW YORK  Reuters    Alison LePard  a 19 year old college sophomore from Wellesley  Massachusetts  says that when she shops for clothes and accessories  her goal is a look that is uniquely hers  So she does a lot of mixing and matching    I don t blindly follow what they put out   LePard said of store displays   I don t want to wear just one brand  I don t want to be a stereotype    She s hardly alone  Recent surveys have found that members of the U S  Millennial Generation   the roughly 80 million Americans born between 1977 and 2000   pride themselves on their individuality  and shop accordingly   Compared with their parents  millennials are far less likely to identify with a political party or to formally affiliate with a religion   key indicators of an independent streak   according to Pew Research Center  As shoppers  they are less attached to brands and more willing to create their own style  surveys by Nielsen  The Boston Consulting Group and other researchers have found   This generational trait is forcing retailers to rethink everything from their merchandise and marketing to their dressing rooms and logos  Some companies  including H M and Urban Outfitters Inc  O URBN   have ridden the individuality wave while others  such as Abercrombie   Fitch  N ANF  and Aeropostale  N ARO   have been slow to react and are paying the price   At stake is the  600 billion millennials spend a year in the United States  according to Accenture  a sum that s projected to grow to an estimated  1 4 trillion in 2020  when the oldest of the cohort will be 43  Millennial men spend twice as much a year on apparel as non millennial men  while millennial women outspent other generations by a third  the consultants said   Abercrombie s woes came into sharp relief last month when the company said it was shrinking its well known logo and increasing its assortment of fashion for women  all to appeal more to 16  to 22 year olds who don t want to look like everyone else  The move came after 10 straight declines in quarterly same store sales    They no longer want to be a walking billboard of a brand   said Michael Scheiner  an Abercrombie spokesman   Individualism is important to them  having their own sense of style    Other companies are also adjusting their strategies to reach this elusive group   Gap Inc s  N GPS  new ad campaign  with the facetious tag line   dress normal   is all about creating an individual style    the idea being that there is no normal  Aeropostale  for its part  says its new product lines by blogger Bethany Mota are meant to convey  authenticity  emotion and relevance    Mall owners have had to adjust  too  Indianapolis based Simon Property Group Inc  N SPG  is now working with fashion magazines and fashion website Refinery29 com to entice millennial shoppers to the mall with videos  new designers and personalized advice    Not looking like everyone else is key to everything about what we do   said Chidi Achara  Simon s global creative director   The drive to reach millennials comes during a difficult environment for retailers  Retail spending was flat in August  according to the U S  Commerce Department  and household spending dropped by 0 1 percent in July  the first decline since January  In August  retailers ranging from Wal Mart Stores Inc  N WMT  to Macy s Inc  N M  cut their sales forecasts   HOW MILLENNIALS SHOP  Thanks to the Internet and smart phones  millennials are more informed shoppers than older generations  More than 70 percent of 18  to 34 year olds recently surveyed by The Intelligence Group said they research options online before going to a store   Millennials spend a higher share of dollars online than other generations  according to market research and consulting firm NPD Group  though they still make 75 percent of their purchases at brick and mortar stores   With vast amounts of information easily available  they are savvy shoppers who know how to compare price  quality and convenience   Accustomed to building Facebook pages and other online identities  millennials are comfortable with the notion of mixing and matching different elements of their persona  a trait that carries over into their shopping choices  according to analysts and academics   To reach this first generation of  digital natives   it s no longer enough for stores to offer a rack and a dressing room    People are looking to create a unique identity   said Allen Adamson  an author and branding expert at Landor Associates   They want to put together their own story rather than have someone else tell them    In addition to an inviting website and easy payment system  retailers are trying to make shopping more exciting for this over stimulated generation  At H M s midtown Manhattan store  for example  shoppers can strut their stuff on the store s fashion walk and then possibly have their video selected to be displayed outside   Gap is stressing that same aspiration with its new  dress normal  ad campaign  which uses taglines such as  dress like no one s watching  and  simple clothes for you to complicate   Sales at Gap stores fell 5 percent in the last quarter   The company said the ad campaign is aimed at customers who want to  dress for themselves    That certainly describes Brianne Casey  a 24 year old New Yorker  who studied marketing and now works as an assistant to a buyer for a retail chain   Casey said she shops at a variety of stores to get the best prices and follows fashion trends on blogs to see what s hot  But in the end  she said   I like creating my own style      Reporting by Jilian Mincer  Editing by Eric Effron and

118194,339709,URBN,Shoe Carnival  SCVL  Hits Fresh Highs  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Shoe Carnival  LON CCL    NASDAQ SCVL    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 34 3  over the past month  SCVL hit a new 52 week high of  33 18 in the previous session  Shoe Carnival has gained 21 7  since the start of the year compared to the 7 8  move for the Retail Wholesale sector and the  4 5  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 24  2018  Shoe Carnival reported EPS of  0 83 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 75 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 91  
For the current fiscal year  Shoe Carnival is expected to post earnings of  2 03 per share on  1 02 billion in revenues  This represents a 36 24  change in EPS on a  0 12  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 28 per share on  1 02 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 12 32  and 0 2   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Shoe Carnival may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for SCVL  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Shoe Carnival has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 16 1X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 11 4X versus its peer group s average of 9 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 34  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Shoe Carnival  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Shoe Carnival currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Shoe Carnival fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though SCVL shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Shoe Carnival Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Shoe Carnival have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Buckle    NYSE BKE    Burberry Group   OTC BURBY    and Urban Outfitters   NASDAQ URBN    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 32  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for SCVL  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-05-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/shoe-carnival-scvl-hits-fresh-highs-is-there-still-room-to-run-200320498,200320498

118228,339743,URBN,Volvo s PR Flub In China Shows Why Social Media Managers Matter ,news,"By    If you re looking for a reason to choose carefully who controls your company s social media operations  look no further than what Volvo Car Corporation did over the weekend 
On Saturday the Gothenburg  Sweden based automaker posted the following message to its Sina Weibo account in Chinese 
 The rescue operation for the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane is in full swing  Passenger safety is also a top priority at Volvo Cars  let s pray together for the 239 lives that were on board of the plane  Bless them  and may a miracle occur  

The post  which the company says was up for about an hour before being removed  drew fire from Chinese social networkers that criticized the automaker for trying to promote its vehicles on the back of what increasingly appears to be a fatal mid air incident of a Boeing 777 200 that has disappeared over the South China Sea early Saturday morning en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing 
A Volvo spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that the post originated from an outside agency the company uses to manage its digital communications 
 We knew immediately this was inappropriate and wrong   said the company representative  who declined to name the agency in question 
Volvo Car  which was bought From Frod Motor Co   NYSE F  by Zejiang Geely Holding Group Co  Ltd  in 2010 for  1 8 billion  is trying to reinvent itself after a marked decline under Ford s ownership from its previous heyday as a paragon of safety and Swedish engineering  The company has said it will rely heavily on social media and digital marketing as it unveils a wave of new products starting with the new second generation XC90 mid sized luxury crossover  
Sina Weibo is China s answer to Facebook and Twitter  and with more than 500 million users it s a powerful marketing tool for companies doing business in China  Volvo s PR mistake underscores the increasing importance of both digital marketing and the need to have conscientious social media directors who know when something is inappropriate or risks raising ire against a brand 

The incident is reminiscent of a Twitter post by the National Rifle Association that went up the morning after the July 20  2012  multiple homicide shooting in Aurora  Colo   that resulted in the murder of 12 people  The post read   Good morning shooters  Happy Friday  Weekend plans   The post was removed about two hours later  but not before the NRA was forced to issue a statement saying the post was taken out of context and was published before the events in Aurora were known to the individual who published the tweet 
San Francisco based specialty apparel company The Gap Inc   NYSE GPS  received considerable flack for a Oct  29  2012  post in which it used Hurricane Sandy to urge people to shop at its website  The post read   All impacted by  Sandy  stay safe  We ll be doing lots of Gap com shopping today  How about you

118238,339753,URBN,4 Hot Momentum Stocks For Remarkable Returns,opinion,When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  Translated  one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift  Thus  this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast moving train  without fretting about valuations or growth prospects  But why does the momentum strategy work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases which most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason why momentum strategy works  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence  hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in the prices  On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends  and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to benefit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is  thus  based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over a long period of time and across market stages  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains  Our screen will help you benefit from both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which reflects

118239,339754,URBN,Urban Outfitters  URBN  Soars To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Urban Outfitters   NASDAQ URBN    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3 1  over the past month  URBN hit a new 52 week high of  43 58 in the previous session  Urban Outfitters has gained 16 4  since the start of the year compared to the 7 8  move for the Retail Wholesale sector and the  5 4  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 22  2018  Urban Outfitters reported EPS of  0 38 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 3 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 22  
For the current fiscal year  Urban Outfitters is expected to post earnings of  2 38 per share on  3 88 billion in revenues  This represents a 42 51  change in EPS on a 7 36  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 62 per share on  3 95 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 10 2  and 1 72   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Urban Outfitters may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for URBN  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Urban Outfitters has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 17 1X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 14 1X versus its peer group s average of 9 1X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 43  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Urban Outfitters  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Urban Outfitters currently has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Urban Outfitters passes the test  Thus  it seems as though URBN shares could still be poised for more gains ahead

118276,339791,URBN,Stocks End Challenging Week With Modest Losses,opinion,"Whether this week was a disappointment or not depends on the way you look at it  The major indices all lost ground over the past five sessions after jumping by more than 2  last week 
	However  stocks had to deal with two of their biggest concerns this week  rising rates and trade  Yet  there were no 1000 point plunges in the Dow or concerns about a faltering bull like in early February  Instead  the NASDAQ slipped about 0 7  this week while the Dow and S P each dipped about 0 5   That s nothing to write home about but its far from the hemorrhaging we saw before 
	On Friday  the Dow broke even  but was technically up 0   or 1 11 points  to 24 715 1  The NASDAQ slipped 0 38  to 7354 3 and the S P was down 0 26  to 2713  But the Russell hit another new high for the third straight day  gaining 0 08  to 1626 6 
	Earlier this week  the 10 year Treasury note soared past 3  and continues to hang around its highest point in nearly 7 years  A few months ago when the note hit 2 88   the major indices sold off by about 4  on one day  So its looks like the market may have gotten used to higher rates or at least it s not as petrified as before 
	We also got mixed messages this week on the trade negotiations with China  President Trump was downright pessimistic yesterday when saying that he doubted the talks could be successful  though there was a more optimistic tone from the Director of the U S  Economic Council Larry Kudlow today

118298,339813,URBN,Factors Setting The Tone For Fossil  FOSL  In Q1 Earnings,opinion,Fossil Group  Inc    NASDAQ FOSL   is slated to release first quarter 2018 results on May 8  This designer and manufacturer of accessories has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters  the average beat being 36   Let s see what awaits this quarterly release Factors Influencing the Quarterly ResultsTop   Bottom Line Story DrearyFossil has been witnessing soft traditional watch sales for long due to increased competition and rising demand for more advanced versions Sales of leather and jewelry have also persistently declined over the past few quarters on account of sluggish demand  These trends were reflected in the company s fourth quarter 2017 results  wherein jewelry and leather business sales fell 9  and 14   on constant currency basis   respectively  owing to declines across all the broad geographical market regions  Also  watch sales dropped 3  mainly due to sluggishness in the traditional category Well  these concerns have been leading to dismal results for more than two years  with both the top and the bottom line declining year over year  For first quarter 2018  the company expects net sales decline of 6 12   Moreover  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  539 4 million  down 7 3  from a year ago Fossil Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of  1 05  wider than the loss of 35 cents reported in the year ago quarter  Notably  the estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days Will the Margin Debacle Continue Fossil has been witnessing lower gross margin for a year now  primarily due to a weak retail margin stemming from increased promotions to drive sales  in stores and e commerce  as well as higher mix of connected products  In the fourth quarter  gross margin contracted 230 basis points to 48 7  due to lower margins from connected products and increased product valuation reserves Lower retail margins from greater promotional activity  unfavorable currency impact and increased off price sales dented the gross margin  Prior to this  gross margin had contracted 580 bps  140 bps and 300 bps in the third  second and first quarter of 2017  respectively However  for first quarter 2018 management anticipates gross margin in the range of 50 52   reflecting a marginal improvement from the year ago quarter s 49 8  It seems that the company is well on track with its New World Fossil plan which helped cut costs by  95 million in 2017  positioning it well to achieve the profit improvement target of  200 million by the end of 2019 Key CatalystsFossil has been taking significant efforts to keep pace with the rising demand for technologically advanced watches  Notably  wearables represented more than 20  of the company s sales in the fourth quarter  marking a steady improvement on a year on year and sequential basis As the wearable business is expected to grow  36 billion by 2020  Fossil is poised to improve its wearables portfolio by adding new brands to its smartwatch line up in 2018  Powered by Android Wear  these brands will add premium brands to Fossil s portfolio like Diesel  Emporio Armani  Fossil  Michael Kors and Misfit Given the favorable consumer response and impressive performance by some of the key brands  management believes that wearables can play a key role in turning Fossil s performance around  Thus  it plans to carry out incremental marketing investments in this category Fossil is keen on expanding its digital platform and meet consumers  growing demand for online purchasing  Toward this end  the company has been making several investments to improve digital marketing and drive online sales  both for the company s website as well as other online wholesale partners In fact  such dedicated endeavors in the e commerce space bore favorable results in the fourth quarter of 2017  E commerce sales during the period rose as much as 31   The e commerce platform has also served as an important sales channel for wearables  Further  management is optimistic regarding the company s expansion plans in the smartwatch and other digital offerings category and expects such moves to bolster online sales What the Zacks Model UnveilsNevertheless  our proven model shows that Fossil is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter  For this to happen  a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Notably  Fossil has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  4 58   This makes us reasonably confident of an earnings

Consumer spending  which accounts for 70  of the economic activity  rose 0 4  in March  following 0 2  growth in January and remaining flat in February  This renewed momentum in March emerged from continued rise in incomes  indicating that consumers may drive economic growth in 2018 
The well being of consumers is usually linked to the prosperity of retailers as this segment attracts a large sum of total spending  We believe that the increased spending in March will somewhere reflect in earnings of retailers  who will report first quarter outcomes very soon As per National Retail Federation  NRF   total retail sales increased 5  year over year in March and 0 3  from February  This included a 7 6  increase in online and other non store retail sales  Moreover  NRF continues to project retail sales growth of 3 8 4 4  for 2018 A close look at the sector reveals that retailers are reaping the benefit of increased investments in digital commerce  as evident from significant growth in e commerce sales  Digital sales have been the key contributing factor in the top line growth of most retailers  Additionally  this has led to a revival in the comparable store sales  comps  trend of the sector on the whole However  the sector is grappling with soft margins due to higher investments to enhance presence and increased operating costs  Increased promotional activities  higher spending toward online portal and lower traffic at stores are some other issues  denting retailers  margins  While retailers are resorting to strict cost cutting measures to lift margins  a turnaround on this front may take time Q1 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of

118307,339822,URBN,Urban Outfitters  Credit Suisse  KLA Tencor  Harsco And Grupo Simec As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate Release         Chicago  IL   May 7  2018    highlights Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN   as the Bull of the Day and Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN    NYSE CS   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onHarsco Corp    NYSE HSC    KLA Tencor   NASDAQ KLAC    Grupo Simec SA de DV   NYSE SIM   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks                                                 The retail sector has slowly found its footing in the wake of the e commerce revolution  and just as investors were ready to declare the death of brick and mortar as we knew it  plenty of great stocks emerged from the special retail industry  For example  Urban Outfitters is an option that every investor should be aware of right now Urban Outfitters is a specialty retailer and wholesaler offering a variety of lifestyle merchandise to highly defined customer niches through Urban Retail stores in the United States  Canada  and Europe  an Urban Outfitters website  Anthropologie retail stores in the United States  and Free People  the company s wholesale division New store openings  increasing digital penetration  merchandising improvements  and international expansion have set Urban Outfitters up for success in the long term  and an improving earnings outlook and attractive valuation metrics make this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  a stock to consider right now Latest Outlook and ValuationAnalysts have become increasingly bullish on URBN recently  Within the past 60 days  the company has witnessed nine revisions to its current quarter EPS estimates and 12 to its full year EPS estimates  with 100  agreement to the upside  Urban Outfitters is now expected to post earnings growth of 36 5  in its current fiscal year This is likely a tailwind effect from the company s latest earnings report  which saw Urban report positive comps at all of its brand while notching its third consecutive positive earnings surprise  Management also noted that it had seen  positive customer reaction  to its new spring offerings and was  optimistic regarding the first half of the year  Urban s next earnings report is still about a month away  but things are looking up for the quarter  As mentioned  positive revisions have been pouring in  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved 11 cents higher in just two months  Analysts are now expecting the company to see an EPS improvement of 123 1  from the prior year quarter  Amid unpredictable trading and market wide volatility  investors should do their best to avoid stocks with questionable outlooks and stretched valuations  One such example is Credit Suisse  which currently sports a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and a  D  grade for Value in our Style Scores system Credit Suisse offers investment products  private banking and financial advisory services  as well as insurance and pension solutions  The company is wrapping up a multi year restructuring and might finally be able to see hope on the horizon  but its stock will likely remain anything but smooth in the coming weeks and months Latest Outlook and ValuationCredit Suisse reported its latest quarterly earnings results on April 25  posting EPS of  0 31 and revenue of  5 94 billion  Earnings were flat on a year over year basis  while revenue was able to move about 7 8  higher Some investors thought this marginal improvement might be enough to get the stock going  but shares are actually down about 2 5  since the company s report date  The stock has now lost more than 17  since reaching a new 52 week high in January Part of this decline is likely due to its sluggish earnings estimate revision picture  Analysts have revised EPS downward recently  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Credit Suisse s full year earnings dropping 13 cents in the past month alone Adding to the concern here is that CS still looks largely overvalued  The stock s P E of 13 0 might look attractive to value investors  but it is actually a noticeable premium to the average of 11 3 displayed by our  Banks   Foreign  group right now  Meanwhile  Credit Suisse is generating just  0 91 per share in cash  with cash flow growth heading in the wrong direction There are a number of questions lingering around the global markets  and with many investors choosing to sit things out entirely right now  there is simply no need to buy an overvalued foreign bank in the midst of a restructuring that has struggled to generate Industrial  Upgrade  Cycle Arrives  Zacks May StrategyThe following is an excerpt from Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank s full  To access the full PDF  One highlight in the May 2018 Zacks Market strategy report is the sudden dominance of Industrial spending The Industrial Products sector is currently placed at the top 6  out of the 16 Zacks sectors  It is one of the sectors expected to record double digit earnings growth  mainly driven by U S  tax reform  According to our latest projections  the sector is anticipated to log an earnings growth rate of  25 8  in the first quarter of 2018  on the back of a  12 8  rise in revenues Earlier this year  an Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation report focused on the  1T equipment leasing and finance industry  It highlighted the breaking trends Investment in equipment and software is projected to expand  9 1  in 2018 That 2018 investment growth projection is well above the  5 2  growth rate experienced in 2017 It continued a strong improvement trajectory seen over the last 12 months While a few headwinds persist  they should be outweighed by an encouraging business investment climate In addition  an upbeat outlook for industrial companies   such as defense contractors  building products and machine makers   is a bet on continuing global economic revival Stronger growth around the globe means companies spend more on new machinery  see increased cargo demand on railroads  and profit from an increased pace of automation Internally  U S  corporations must spend more to replace aging equipment and tech systems  The age of equipment in the U S  remains at all time highs and desperately needs to be replaced  This so called  upgrade  cycle is creating a boom for industrial companies What about the money to finance the spending  It comes from the new lower 21  corporate profit tax   that stronger U S  and global economy   and an internal change in U S  tax rules  This change will allow companies to take a deduction for the full value of new plant and equipment upon purchase  rather than stringing it out over a number of years Every four years  the American Society of Civil Engineers issues a report card on the condition of the nation s infrastructure  In 2013  the country received a sad D   The 2017 report card was no better   another D  Clearly  the need for a U S  infrastructure overhaul had been there  But what exactly did that mean  who pays for it  and how much should be spent That Society of Civil Engineers Report Card had put up many questions and few answers It appears  until now Zacks May Sector

118338,339853,URBN,Stocks Hang On To Modest Gains Amid FBI Raid ,opinion,"Stocks managed a positive session to start off the week  but things were looking a whole lot better earlier in the day 
	Reassured by a softer tone on trade from President Trump  the major indices took off right at the open and seemed on their way to a strong finish  Then came news that the President s lawyer was raided by the FBI  Stocks responded by giving up a lion s share of the gains 
	Each of the indices had advanced by about 2  at their highs of the day but would have to settle for much less by the closing bell  The NASDAQ registered the best performance thanks to a strong showing from tech  it increased 0 51  to 6950 3  The S P was up 0 33  to 2613 2  while the Dow inched forward by 0 19  to 23 979 1 
	So the market has a brand new piece of uncertainty to deal with  which goes along with fears of a trade war  technology pressures and rising rates  But the one thing that we can be certain of is that earnings season is about to start and the editors can t wait  It s expected to be a good one and might help get the market back on a roll if nothing else pops up to derail it  It would be nice to move on from Washington headlines and do what we do best in picking stocks  but I think that is a way away  Earnings are coming up quickly  so that could switch focus of market participants  This Friday we will see a handful of financials report  including JPM  WFC and C   said Jeremy Mullin in Counterstrike

118369,339884,URBN,5 Apparel Stocks Looking To Beat On Earnings In Q4,opinion,"The fourth quarter 2017 reporting cycle is at the half way mark  providing a robust picture of all around strength and momentum  We have positive earnings and sales surprises coming from an above average proportion of companies  Further  positive estimate revisions for the current quarter have been overwhelming  indicating there is more room for growth in the future 
Our focus here will be on the  industry  a key segment of the  sector  which is presumed to be invariably in business  The retail sector on the whole has been attracting attention as the robust holiday numbers and a favorable economic backdrop have turned it around  The sector is gaining from favorable economic data including a steady improvement in wages  a lower unemployment rate  rising consumer confidence and modest inflation  all of which contributed to increased consumer spending during the holiday period 
A prime beneficiary of this momentum has been the Apparel industry  which has performed well lately thanks to the rapid transformation in the space  The industry players are driven by the quick adoption of the omni channel retailing concept  renewed store formats and focus on providing the most fashionable and in trend merchandise  Additionally  the companies are benefiting from effective inventory management and cost control techniques 
Overall  the industry s growth graph shows a gain of 19 1  in the last three months  significantly outpacing the S P 500 s growth of just 6 7   Further  the industry is placed at the top 21   53 of 256  of the

Total fourth quarter earnings for the S P 500 are expected to increase 13  year over year  with a 7 7  rise in revenues  This follows 6 7  earnings growth and 5 9  revenue increases recorded in the third quarter 
For the retail sector  earnings in the fourth quarter are expected to improve 6 6   with 8 8  revenue growth  However  it is too early to predict anything for the sector as it has a sizable chunk of earnings yet to be reported 
The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest  report published on Feb 2 
That said  here are five stocks from the Apparel and Shoes industry that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive   Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   It makes sense to add these potential winners to your portfolio ahead of their releases  A rational investment can fetch higher returns on the heels of an earnings beat

Notably  the company delivered a negative sales surprise in six of the trailing nine quarters  While it is appropriate to note that Nordstrom s overall sales was ahead of estimates in the last two quarters  the outperformance was not significant  Meanwhile  its top line remains challenged due to decelerating rate of sales growth at Nordstrom Rack in recent quarters and soft sales at full line stores  Additionally  the company has witnessed soft comps of late

improvement in sales and comparable store sales  comps  for the combined months of November and December   The company recorded 2 5  increase in net sales for the nine weeks ended Dec 30  2017  while comps for the period rose 1 2   The solid holiday show was primarily driven by growth in Nordstrom s full line and Rack stores  compared with the year to date sales performance  as well as persistent strength in e commerce at Nordstrom com and  strength of the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company s full line and Rack was evident from sales growth of 0 7  and 8 2   respectively  at these formats

sales  including the comparable direct to consumer channel  gained 2   For the month of November and December comparable retail segment net sales rose 1  at Urban Outfitters  5  at Free People and 2  at the Anthropologie Group  Gain in comparable retail sales were driven by double digit growth in the direct to consumer channel  Despite reporting year over year increase in holiday sales  the stock came under pressure primarily due to lower than expected comps  In early December  the company in a filing stated that  Thus far during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  comparable Retail segment net sales are mid single digit positive   However  comps for the November and December increased by low single digit  which is an indication that the company failed to sustain its initial momentum in the latter part of holiday season However  we believe new store openings  increase in direct penetration  growing wholesale operations and merchandising improvements bode well for the long term

After the overwhelming sales numbers for Black Friday and Cyber Monday  that raked in as much as  335 47 average spending from individuals  the optimism for the Christmas sales has certainly doubled up 
The spending data from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday indicates that the U S  retail industry is ready to shed all worries and embrace a profitable holiday season this year  Data from the nation s largest retail trade group  National Retail Federation   NRF   revealed that more than 174 million Americans shopped in stores and online during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend  leaving behind its estimate to engage 164 million shoppers 
A sentiment that is ruling the retail sector this holiday season is that shoppers are willing to spend more online this holiday season  However  the charisma of in store shopping remains key to the overall shopping experience  According to a survey conducted by Deloitte  about 83  of the respondents are likely to use their smartphones  laptops  desktops and social media to shop this holiday season 
This trend was palpable during the recent Cyber Monday sales  when more than 81 million shoppers made purchases online  This popular online shopping day raked in online sales of a record  6 59 million  as per Adobe Analytics  Reflecting  1 billion  or 16 8   growth from last year  this day marked the largest online shopping day in U S  history 
However  the two top days for in store shopping this year were Black Friday and Small Business Saturday  when 77 million and 55 million shoppers  respectively  stepped out of their homes to take advantage of the big deals 
Holiday Projections
Coming to the forecasts for this year s holiday season  analysts remain optimistic on grounds of gradual wage growth  lower inflation  low unemployment rate  an uptick in the U S  consumer sentiment and a lift in economic activity post hurricanes  Characterized by the aforementioned improvement in the consumer backdrop  alongside early hour store openings  huge discounts  promotional strategies  price matching and free shipping on online purchases  this holiday season is likely to be a huge success 
Overall  NRF projects   excluding autos  gas and restaurant sales  to improve 3 6 4  to  678 75  682 billion  up from  655 8 billion  or 3 6  growth  last year and better than the five year average sales growth of 3 5

118434,339949,URBN,American Eagle s  AEO  Holiday Comps Surge  Keeps FY17 View,opinion,"American Eagle Outfitters  Inc    NYSE AEO   is one among the beneficiaries of this year s robust holiday sales season  which set cash registers at retail stores ringing  The solid holiday feat was driven by favorable economic scenario as well as heightened consumer spending 
Coming back to American Eagle  the company posted solid comparable store sales  comps  growth for fourth quarter fiscal 2017 to date  which mainly comprises holiday sales  Comps rose 8  for the period  Notably  the company has been posting positive comps for 11 straight quarters   Further  the company s quarter to date performance reflected sustained momentum in the fourth quarter  which drove better than expected Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales 
Moreover  the company s success in the holiday season can be attributed to record sales and strong momentum at its AE and Aerie brands  American Eagle also benefited from solid online and in store traffic as customers responded positively to the company s merchandising offerings 
Though American Eagle s shares did not respond much to the news  the stock has surged 59 6  in the past six months outperforming  s growth of 19 1

118455,339970,URBN,Despite Q3 Misses  American Eagle Is A Strong Value Stock,opinion,"Shares of American Eagle Outfitters   NYSE AEO   gained 2 42  on Wednesday despite missing both top and bottom line estimates in its third quarter 
American Eagle reported Q3 earnings of  0 37 per share  which missed our Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 39 per share  On top of that  the company s  960 4 million in revenues missed top line expectations by almost  5 million  Yet  the clothing company saw its stock price climb 
This movement is due in large part to the fact that American Eagle reported comparable store sales that jumped 3  from the year ago period  This vitally important metric helped show investors that the company might be headed in the right direction during these changing retail times 
What s more  American Eagle reported record third quarter sales  And now the company projects it will post fourth quarter EPS in the range of  0 42 to  0 44 
More Fundamentals 
Looking forward  the company s sales are expected to grow 4 76  in its fourth quarter to hit  1 15 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  For the full year  AEO s earnings are projected to hit  3 72 billion  which would mark 3 16  year over year growth 
These aren t eye popping numbers  although they aren t too shabby for a well established company such as American Eagle  But what should get American Eagle investors excited is that the company currently offers outstanding bang for their buck at these price levels 
This clothing retailer  which has been a staple at American malls for years  currently rocks an  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system 
American Eagle is currently trading at just 14 23x earnings  which marks a discount compared to the  Retail   Apparel and Shoes  industry s average  Furthermore  AEO s strong P E ratio crushes its rivals Urban Outfitters   NASDAQ URBN   and Abercrombie   Fitch   NYSE ANF   and compares favorably to the S P 500 s average American Eagle Outfitters  Inc  PE Ratio  TTM    The teen focused retailer s 0 78 P S ratio also helps demonstrate its value for inventors  as they pay less than  0 80 for every dollar of American Eagle sales  The company s P B ratio of 2 54 is also solid compared to some of its biggest competition  
American Eagle is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and rocks an overall  A  VGM Grade  which is bolstered by its  B  Momentum grade in our Style Scores system  Shares of American Eagle have soared 26 16  in the last four weeks alone 
Better yet  even with today s gains  shares of American Eagle rest over 10  below their 52 week high  This means that the retailer still has room to climb without the added burden of having to break into a new range

118459,339974,URBN,5 Top Liquid Stocks For A Winning Portfolio,opinion,Liquidity of a stock is an important yardstick that investors often ignore  It primarily indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns  However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary  to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see   Growth Style Score less than or equal to B  Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks  These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only nine Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screen Tampa  FL based WellCare Health Plans Inc    NYSE WCG   is a leading managed care company  It primarily focuses on

Weight Watchers International  Inc  has used the power of Oprah to turn the company around  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  with earnings expected to soar 65  in 2017 Weight Watchers provides weight management services through Company owned and franchise operations as well as digital weight management products through its websites  mobile sties and apps In October 2015  as the company struggled to adjust to online competition  Oprah Winfrey bought a 10  stake  with the option to buy 5  more  and was given a seat on the Board of Directors Additionally  the billionaire entrepreneur  actress and media guru  became a spokesperson for the product In the 2 years since  it has been a bumpy road  but in 2017  Weight Watchers has clearly found the secret sauce as sales have turned around Another Beat in the Third QuarterOn Nov 6  Weight Watchers reported its third quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus for the 5th straight quarter Earnings were  0 65 compared to the consensus of just  0 48 Revenue jumped 15  to  324 million as total paid weeks in the quarter soared 20  year over year What s remarkable about its recent quarters is that it is seeing this growth outside of the usual  peak diet  quarter which occurs in January with New Year s resolutions  Prior to 2017  the business had been much more cyclical Raised Full Year Guidance AgainOnce again  the company raised full year guidance  this time to a range of  1 77 to  1 83 from its prior guidance of  1 57 to  1 67 In response  the Zacks Consensus Estimate rose to  1 60 from  1 45  which is earnings growth of about 65  as the company only made  0 97 last year The estimates for 2018 are also on the rise  jumping to  1 90 from  1 75 in the last 30 days  That s another 19  earnings growth Too Much Debt However  while annual revenue is now growing in the double digits  Weight Watchers  has  1 930 4 million outstanding consisting entirely of Tranche B 2 Term Loans On Nov 13  Weight Watchers announced that it would offer  500  million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 in a private offering It intends to use the net proceeds and cash on hand to repay all amounts outstanding under its existing credit facilities and terminate those facilities It will also enter into a new  150 million revolving credit facility to refinance its existing  50 million revolving credit facility Shares fell on the news Is the Rally Over Shares of Weight Watchers have been one of the hottest stocks on the Street in 2017 Year to date  they re up 303   After beating on earnings again  shares hit new highs but the announcement of the notes sent them lower Weight Watchers is now trading with a forward P E of 30 6 But it has the growth to support the valuation and it s entering its hottest quarter of the year with a lot of momentum For investors looking for a stock in the hot wellness and health food area  Weight Watchers is one to keep on the short list  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  Inc  is getting hit by the challenging dine in restaurant environment and higher labor costs  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  recently lowered full year EPS guidance Red Robin operates a casual dining restaurant chain of more than 560 restaurants in the United States and Canada that specializes in high quality burgers and Bottomless Steak Fries  It offers a wide variety of salads  soups  appetizers and entrees along with signature beverages including its extensive selection of local and regional beers Third Quarter MissOn Nov 6  Red Robin reported its third quarter results and missed on the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Earnings were  0 21 versus the consensus of  0 27 Comparable restaurant revenue  a key metric in the industry  fell 0 1  year over year due to a 0 1  decrease in the average guest check and flat guest counts Like everyone else in the industry  Red Robin is being hit by rising labor costs Guided Lower for the Full YearGiven the pressures in the industry  especially in the dine in category  Red Robin lowered its full year EPS guidance to a range of  2 16  2 31 from  2 80  3 10 It also lowered its comparable restaurant sales outlook to flat to up 0 5  Additionally  while it is expected to move forward with its planned 9 store openings in 2018  it s going to pause store openings going forward to reassess its service model Trying a New ModelAlong those lines  on Nov 13  the company announced it was going to test a first of its kind  delivery only concept in downtown Chicago on North Michigan Avenue It won t have a traditional storefront but it will have the same signature menu and catering services All orders placed in downtown Chicago will be self delivered by Red Robin Express but also will offer third party delivery through Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Door Dash Is delivery the wave of the future  even for the casual dining chains  Stay tuned 2017 and 2018 Estimates LoweredFor now  the analysts are bearish on the outlook Given the guidance cut  it s not surprising that 6 estimates were lowered for 2017 in the last 30 days which pushed the Zacks Consensus down to  2 35 from  2 78 That s a decline of 15 6  from 2016 s earnings of  2 78 But analysts also cut 2018  with 6 estimates lowered in the last 30 days to  2 71 from  3 28 Shares Fall But Are They Cheap Shares fell on the guidance cut and are now down 11  year to date But Red Robin shares

and responsiveness to changing consumer trends  Also  the company has been making constant efforts to boost digital and mobile offerings  besides improving product acceptance  Though currency headwinds and its Banana Republic brand continue to play spoilsport  we believe these to be offset by initiatives undertaken In fact  Gap s endeavors are well reflected in its share price movement  So

shifting focus to its two growth brands   Old Navy and Athleta  Over the next few years  it expects net sales of more than  10 billion and  1 billion  respectively  at each of the brands owing to U S  store expansion and mobile and e commerce growth Additionally  management plans to open 270 Old Navy and Athleta stores while closing 200 underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores  simultaneously  over the next three years As consumers have been gradually shifting to online shopping  Gap is enhancing its e commerce and omni channel capabilities by adopting a number of initiatives  To this end  the company has increased its online presence across all of its brands  In fact  its online division is posting double digit sales growth  Gap also announced plans to launch the buy online  pick up in store service  a new personalization engine that is powered by customer data  and continued significant investment in its omni channel services  We believe these initiatives should boost Gap s top line and overall performance Robust Surprise History   Upbeat OutlookGap delivered its third consecutive positive earnings surprise with fourth straight sales beat in third quarter fiscal 2017  In addition  comparable store sales  comps  reflected strength for the fourth consecutive quarter amid a tough retail scenario  Though comps growth was backed by continued gains at Old Navy brand and growth at its namesake brand  it was partly offset by comps decline at Banana Republic Driven by its initiatives and a solid performance in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017  management raised full year outlook  Gap now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of  2 08  2 12 per share compared with  2 02  2 10  projected earlier  Further  comps are anticipated to be up low single digits versus previous projection of flat to marginal improvement Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has moved up by 4 cents to  2 10 in the last seven days Concerns WeaknessesGap s significant international presence exposes the company to adverse currency fluctuations  Though its earnings and sales topped estimates in third quarter fiscal 2017  currency headwinds caused earnings to decline year over year  Evidently  the bottom line fell 3 3  in the quarter compared with the year ago period  In the fiscal second quarter  earnings and revenues were down on a year over year

118499,340014,URBN,3 Retail Stocks To Buy After Strong Black Friday Weekend  ,opinion,"The holiday shopping season kicked off in earnest last week  as shoppers poured into stores and filled up their online carts in droves  In total  more than 174 million Americans shopped in stores or online during the holiday weekend  which spilled over through Cyber Monday 
This year s total topped the National Retail Federation s estimates by 10 million  On top of that  the average shopper spent  333 47 over the five day shopping bonanza  Many retailers likely relished the successful weekend that was bolstered by a few factors completely out of their control 
 From good weather across the country to low unemployment and strong consumer confidence  the climate was right  literally and figuratively  for consumers to tackle their holiday shopping lists online and in stores   NRF CEO Matthew Shay 
This strong performance will not necessarily carry over into December or lead directly to a strong overall holiday shopping season  However  the NRF noted on Tuesday that the firm still  total retail sales excluding automobiles  gasoline  and restaurants for November and December to hit  682 billion  which would mark 4  growth 
With all that said  let s take a look at three retailers that could benefit from this uptick in holiday shopping that also currently sport great Zacks Ranks 
Urban Outfitters  Inc    NASDAQ URBN  
Just last week  this clothing and apparel retailer topped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for Q3 earnings by 24 24   Urban Outfitters  which also owns Anthropologie and Free People  is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports an  A  VGM score 
The company s  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system is backed up by its 0 93 P S ratio and P B ratio of 2 58  What s more  Urban is currently trading at 19 71x earnings  which helps demonstrate its value 
Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  the company s fourth quarter sales are expected to gain 4 78  to hit  1 08 billion  Furthermore  Urban s Q4 earnings are projected to jump 10 07  year over year 
Urban has seen its stock price surge 45  in the last 12 weeks as the company picks up steam  helping it earn an  A  for Momentum in our Style Scores system  And within the last 60 days  the company has received 10 upward earnings estimates revisions for its fourth quarter  against just one downgrade 
American Eagle Outfitters  Inc    NYSE AEO  
This clothing retailer  which has been a staple at American malls for years  is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and sports an overall VGM Grade of an  A  
For its upcoming third quarter  American Eagle s sales are projected to climb 2 57  to hit  964 78 million  based on our current consensus estimates  For the full year  the company s sales are projected to climb 3 13  to reach as high as  3 78 billion 
American Eagle also boasts an  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  This is supported by the company s current 0 73 P S ratio  as well as its P B ratio of 2 38  What s more  American Eagle is trading at 13 33x earnings  which marks a discount compared to its industry s average and fairs well against the S P 500 
The youth focused retailer also rocks a  B  grade for Momentum  In the last four weeks alone  shares of American Eagle have surged 15 10   Still  even with this positive momentum  shares of
American Eagle rest around 15  below their 52 week high  Therefore  the retailer still has room to climb without the added burden of having to break into a new range 
Lastly  American Eagle has missed earnings estimates just once since the start of 2013 
Skechers U S A   Inc    NYSE SKX  
This shoe brand and retailer known mostly for its low prices is currently a Zacks Rank 1   Strong Buy   Based on our consensus estimates  Skechers  fourth quarter earnings are projected to skyrocket 225   while its Q4 sales are set to surge 15 82   For the full year  the company s EPS are expected to climb 8 60   What s more  Skechers  full year revenues are projected to pop 13 70  to reach  4 05 billion 
Skechers hired a new CFO in mid November  which allowed David Weinberg to focus his attention on his COO duties after he spent time filling both roles  The move will reportedly allow the company to focus on its global expansion 
Over the last 12 weeks  shares of Skechers climbed 29 68   Since the start of the year  the low cost shoe retailer s stock price has climbed 41 13   which crushes its industry s average and blows the S P 500 s 12 94  gain out of the water  The company now hovers right around its 52 week high of  34 95 per share 
However  it should not be too hard for the company to break into a new range as Skechers has earned four full year upward earnings estimates revisions against no downgrades  all within the last 60 days 
Finally  Skechers has a respectable price to book ratio of 2 70 and a solid 1 39 P S ratio  On top of that  the company is currently trading at 20 35x earnings

118533,340048,URBN,Should Value Investors Pick Urban Outfitters  URBN  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Urban Outfitters  Inc    NASDAQ URBN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Urban Outfitters has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 3   If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Urban Outfitters  current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Urban Outfitters has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 8  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Urban Outfitters has a P S ratio of about 0 7  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Urban Outfitters currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Urban Outfitters a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Urban Outfitters might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives URBN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen four up and one down in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has remained stable in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Urban Outfitters  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineUrban Outfitters is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the top 37  out of more than 250 industries  instills investor confidence  However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past one year  its industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Also with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick New Report  An Investor s Guide to CybersecurityCyberattacks have become more frequent and destructive than ever  In fact  they re expected to cause  6 trillion per year in damage by 2020  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to these threats  In fact  a projected

The advantages of model based trading seem clear  For example  models are much more disciplined in their decisions than are humans  For example  we ve written about this previously by describing the importance of  for your trades  as well as using disciplined   Further  model based trading eliminates emotion  For example  according to Dr  Brett Steenbarger  evidence shows that emotions can really screw up your trades  especially if you are a newbe   but they can also be used to help  if you know what you re doing  And on that note  we ve written previously about the importance of making sure your trading process

For more perspective on the recent strength of momentum  James Picerno provides a lot of details in this recent article  Momentum Continues To Lead US Equity Factor Strategies 
However  despite the strong performance by momentum  our other models have held their own  For example  over the last four months  our results  including commissions and fees  are approximately even for Holmes and RoadRunner and up approximately 20  for Felix and Athena  And if you had an equal weighted portfolio of these four models you d have roughly doubled the S P 500 s return during the time period  Obviously  short term success of an approach varies a great deal  And in a few months  the results could be just the opposite  i e  momentum could underperform   However  one strength of Holmes and RoadRunner is that they outperform over the long run with a low correlation to the market  This is important for volatility reduction purposes  i e  risk management  
And for a little more color on momentum  here are the previous  Stock Exchange  series write ups on a couple of Felix s previous recommendations that have been doing quite well  Felix is our momentum model with an average holding period of 66 weeks

Zacks Consensus Estimate of  864 million  it was down 2  year over year  The decline in the top line was primarily due to 5  fall in URBN retail segment comp  which somewhat offset a robust 10  gain

year over year  Comparable retail segment net sales fell 7 9  at Urban Outfitters and 4  at Anthropologie Group but increased 2 9   at the Free People  Decline in comparable Retail segment sales can primarily be attributed to dismal retail store sales performance which overshadowed growth in the company s direct to consumer channel  Meanwhile  Wholesale segment net sales jumped 10  Margin PerformanceGross profit for the quarter came in at  297 3 million  down 13 2  from the year ago quarter  while gross margin contracted 440 basis points  bps  to approximately 34 1  primarily due to deleverage in customer delivery and logistics expense rates  It was further impacted by higher markdowns due to dismal performance of women s apparel and accessories product at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters Management anticipates gross margin rate to decline year over year in third quarter fiscal 2018 on account of rise in delivery as well as de leverage in store occupancy expenditures

118569,340084,URBN,Will Free People Be Urban Outfitters  Answer To More Earnings Beats ,opinion,"Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc    NASDAQ URBN    holding company of Anthropologie  Free People  BHLDN  Terrain  and Urban Outfitters brands  delivered a massive second quarter earnings beat  reporting earnings of 44 cents per share on revenues of  873 million  Shares of Urban have been soaring ever since  and are up over 18  in late afternoon trading on Wednesday 
Despite these top and bottom line accomplishments  Urban s overall comparable sales did fall year over year  declining nearly 5   though not as much as Wall Street was expecting  Breaking it down by its main brands  comps fell 4  at Anthropologie and almost 8  at Urban Outfitters  while at Free People  same store sales increased 2 9  
Free People  a brand known specifically for its hippie style  has been a major growth factor for Urban Outfitters these past few years  Making up about 20  of Urban s total revenue  Free People could help the retailer stay on this profitable path  But what is it about the brand that resonates with consumers 
What is Free People 
Most importantly  Free People is one of the few apparel retailers today that understands its customer  Like TJX Companies   NYSE TJX   and Ross Stores   NASDAQ ROST   know that their core customer is always hunting for deals  Free People knows how much their customer identifies with its central bohemian aesthetic 
Free People s key customer is very specific too  a  26 year old girl  smart  creative  confident  and comfortable in all aspects of her being  free and adventurous  sweet to tough to tomboy to romantic  A girl who likes to keep busy and push life to its limits  with traveling and hanging out and everything in between   the company writes on its website 
And because the brand understands  her   Free People s seasonal collections continually reflect that vibe  a factor that makes it stand out from fast fashion giants Zara  H M  and Forever 21  three companies that have severely impacted traditional apparel retailers  and even its sister brand  Urban Outfitters 
This intuition  however  has gotten Free People in trouble  Earlier this year  the Coachella music and arts festival announced that  Urban for using the event s name at Free People in order to sell merchandise  The brand s retail items in question included things like the  Coachella Boot    Coachella Mini Dress   and  Coachella Valley Tunic  Coachella Is Suing Urban Outfitters for Using The Festival s Name To Sell Tunics And Boots    LAist   LAist  In addition to its 120 store boutiques across the country  Free People product is sold in upper end department stores like Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   and Bloomingdales  which is owned by Macy s   NYSE M    both of which have created in store concept shops to attract shoppers to the brand 
How Urban Can Capitalize
While it did suffer through a tough fiscal 2017  Free People is on the rebound  and in the last three quarters  the brand has posted positive comparable store sales  The same cannot be said for either the Anthropologie or Urban Outfitters brands  If Urban wants to continue surprising Wall Street like it did yesterday  it should absolutely take advantage of everything Free People offers 
In addition to its loyal customers  Free People has mastered the art of social media  where the brand has been able to connect with its customers in a meaningful way  Its Instagram   NASDAQ FB   account has 3 2 million followers  its Twitter   NYSE TWTR   account has 255 000 followers  and most notably  its Pinterest account has nearly 570 000 followers 
With this type of following  Free People  has been able to cultivate the type of targeted engagement with customers  both old and new  that many retailers strive for  By posting catalog quality pictures on Instagram  for instance  the company is able to see what products work and which ones don t 
  A post shared by freepeople   freepeople  on Aug 14  2017 at 4 35pm PDTAll of Urban s core brands are popular on Instagram  with Anthropologie boasting 3 million followers and Urban Outfitters sitting at 7 3 million  What makes Free People stand out is its ability to stay consistent in aesthetic and in product  Urban should take what Free People has learned from its own social media success targeted knowledge about its customers and apply it to its other brands 
Urban should also consider expanding Free People  Since its stores are much smaller in size compared to the average Urban Outfitters or Anthropologie  one could assume the company would not have to shell out a large amount of cash  This move  however  would be risky  as brick and mortar retail sales are in crisis  Over saturation of the market would also be a concern  since Free People is still considered a covetable brand 
But Urban Outfitters needs to do something  and Free People is right there for the taking  It s one of the most desired brands among young women  with a bustling social media presence that gives its management key information about what designs and merchandise to introduce next  Free People is Urban s bohemian dream  and has the potential to help boost the company s bottom line moving forward

Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up URBN had been in an overall downward trend dating back to November 22nd  2016 when it traded at  39 01  URBN has a float of 79 22 million shares and traded 3 40 times the normal daily trading volume on Tuesday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see URBN open trading on Wednesday above  19 00 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop order would be  0 30 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

118602,340117,URBN,Why Urban Outfitters  URBN  Could Be Positioned For A Slump,opinion,"Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio 
One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Urban Outfitters  Inc    NASDAQ URBN    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  further confirms weakness in URBN 
A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen 14 estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revision  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from  1 74 a share a month ago to its current level of  1 53 
Also  for the current quarter  Urban Outfitters has seen 12 downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to 45 cents a share from 59 cents over the past 30 days  
The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 17 8  in the past month Urban Outfitters  Inc  Price and Consensus   So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait 
If you are still interested in the Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   The Children s Place  Inc    NASDAQ PLCE    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be a better selection at this time  You can see

Earnings Season So Far
Per   as of Jul 21  out of the 97 S P 500 companies that have come up with their quarterly numbers  approximately 78 4  have delivered positive earnings surprises  while 72 2  beat top line expectations  According to the report  earnings of the S P 500 companies that have reported so far are up 8 4  from the same period last year  while revenues have increased 5 1  
Total earnings for the index are expected to improve 8 6  from the same period last year on 4 7  higher revenues  The report also indicates that the Retail Wholesale sector is expected to record top line growth of 3 9  but is likely to witness earnings decline of 0 2  this season 
However  before zeroing in on the stocks  let s have a look at all that is happening in the sector and how it is placed in the changing economic scenario 
Changing Retail Dynamics
The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change  with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping  This shift in buying pattern has forced retailers to come up with innovative ways to market their products  Retailers who have responded quickly to it by staying ahead technologically stand in good stead 
With a digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online  store and mall traffic has been hit hard  As a result  most retailers including big box ones are struggling to compete with e commerce channels  They are now focusing more on enhancing their omni channel capabilities  optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities 
Sector s Correlation with the Economy
The Retail Wholesale sector has not been an outstanding performer but it still holds some promise  given the favorable economic indicators  However  we understand that the space is not fully immune to global uncertainties  which could limit growth 
The rebound in oil prices from all time lows  improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode  These factors are favorable for retailers and definitely play a crucial role in raising buyers  confidence  Consumer confidence  which ebbed some time back  took an unexpected  U  turn in June 
However  the second straight month of slump in retail sales overshadowed steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration  U S  retail and food services sales in June declined 0 2   following a revised reading of 0 1  decrease registered in May 
How to Identify the Laggards 
Surely  not all retail stocks are going to beat or meet expectations  There will be some slow coaches  We can identify them before they report by combining our proprietary  and Earnings ESP system  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  along with negative Earnings ESP have no or a very slim chance of outperforming estimates

118637,340152,URBN,Children s Place  Urban Outfitters  Best Buy  Fred s And Ulta Beauty Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 22  2017   Children s Place  Inc   NASDAQ        as the Bull of the Day  Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN   Inc   NASDAQ        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Best Buy Co  NYSE BBY    Inc   NYSE         Fred s  Inc   NASDAQ        and Ulta Beauty  Inc   NASDAQ        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

The Children s Place  Inc   NASDAQ       appears to be the only mall based retailer that isn t just surviving  but is thriving  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  just had a blowout first quarter and raised full year guidance 
	The Children s Place sells children s apparel at retail and wholesale at 1033 stores in the US  Canada  Puerto Rico and online at the childrensplace com  It also has 156 international points of distribution operated by 6 franchise partners in 18 countries Another Beat in the First Quarter
	On May 18  The Children s Place reported its first quarter results and blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30 cents  or 18   It reported earnings of  1 95 compared to the consensus of just  1 65 
	The beat shouldn t have been that much of a surprise  as the company has one of the most consistent beat records in the retail industry  It hasn t missed on the earnings in 5 years 

  

Urban Outfitters  Inc   NASDAQ       continues to struggle as it missed on the apparel mix at one of its most popular brands  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  saw another quarter of declining same store sales 
	Urban Outfitters operates three well known apparel and accessory brands  Urban Outfitters  Anthropologie and Free People  It operates 242 Urban Outfitters across the US  Canada and Europe  225 Anthropologie stores in the United States  Canada and Europe  and 130 Free People stores in the United States and Canada 
	It also operates websites and catalogs for all three brands  ADditionally it has 12 Food and Beverage restaurants 
	Free People also sells its product wholesale  through 1 900 department and specialty stores and third party websites A Miss in the First Quarter
	On May 16  Urban Outfitters reported fiscal first quarter 2018 results and missed on the Zacks Consensus by 3 cents  Earnings were  0 13 versus the consensus of  0 16 
	But the earnings miss or beat isn t the whole story with the retailers  It s really about the comparable store sales but those weren t good either 
	Comparable store sales fell 3 1   This included the online sales

Is a Q1 Earnings Beat in the Cards for Best Buy  BBY   

Best Buy Co   Inc   NYSE       is slated to report first quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 25  In the previous quarter  the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 5   Notably  it has surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 27 7   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement What to Expect 
	The question lingering in investors  minds now is whether Best Buy will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 40 cents  reflecting a year over year decrease of nearly 9   We noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed upward revisions in the last 30 days  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  8 264 million  down about 2  from the year ago quarter 

Factors at Play

	Best Buy has been posting better than expected results in the last 17 quarters and the trend is expected to continue in first quarter fiscal 2018 as well  Sound promotional strategies  continuous optimization of merchandise margins as well as robust expense management have been driving the company s earnings  Moreover  Best Buy is making extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni channel capabilities and strengthening partnership with vendors 
	In the past few quarters  the company had reported massive gain in online comparable sales on the back of improved traffic  conversion rates and higher average order values  which is expected to boost results in the quarter to be reported 
	For first quarter fiscal 2018  management forecasts Enterprise revenues between  8 2 billion and  8 3 billion  and comparable sales decline of 1 2   Management also projects earnings in the range of 30 40 cents a share  Also in the fiscal first quarter  the company anticipates domestic comparable sales to fall in the range of 1 5 2 5   while international comparable sales are projected to be in the range of flat to up 3   However  the challenging retail landscape  aggressive promotional strategies and waning store traffic may hurt the stock What the Zacks Model Unveils
	Our proven model shows that Best Buy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  The Most Accurate estimate stands at 44 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 40 cents  So the ensuing difference   the Earnings ESP   is of  10 00   A positive ESP combined with the company s Zacks Rank  2  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates
	Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat

118657,340172,URBN,Caution Still Hampering Markets,opinion,"The U S  equity markets finished with only slight gains in choppy trading  with industrials doing the heavy lifting for the Dow following comments from President Trump on infrastructure overhaul  Meanwhile  a rebound in crude oil prices gave energy issues a boost  but caution and renewed trade anxiety ahead of the U S  China talks later this week kept sentiment in check  while late day news of Fed member Jeffrey Lacker s immediate departure after disclosing improper disclosure of confidential information had little effect  Treasury yields and gold gained modest ground  while the U S  dollar was little changed 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  rose 39 points  0 2   to 20 689  the S P 500 Index inched 1 point  0 1   higher to 2 360  and the NASDAQ Composite added 4 points  0 1   to 5 899  In moderate volume  801 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 8 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil rose  0 79 to  51 03 per barrel and wholesale gasoline gained  0 03 to  1 72 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price increased  2 65 to  1 256 15 per ounce  and the dollar index  a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies  was flat at 100 55 
Urban Outfitters Inc   NASDAQ URBN  22  reported that thus far during the first quarter  same store retail segment net sales are mid single digit negative  wider than the FactSet estimate of a 1 2  decline  Shares were solidly lower 
Shares of Staples Inc   NASDAQ SPLS  10  jumped following a report from the Wall Street Journal that the company is exploring a possible sale and is in early talks with buyout firms  SPLS did not commented on the report 
Acuity Brands Inc  NYSE AYI   174  reported fiscal 2Q earnings per share  EPS  of  1 53  or  1 77 ex items  compared to the FactSet estimate of  1 83  as revenues rose 3 5  year over year  y y  to  805 million  below the projected  828 million  The company noted that the growth rate of lighting solutions in the North American market in the first half of its fiscal year was lower than anticipated  Shares finished solidly lower 
Factory orders match forecasts  trade deficit narrows more than expected 
Factory orders    rose 1 0  month over month  m m  in February  matching the Bloomberg expectation  while January s figure was upwardly revised to a 1 5  gain  February durable goods orders preliminarily reported two weeks ago  were adjusted slightly higher to a 1 8  increase  from the preliminary reading of a 1 7  gain  and versus expectations of no revision  Orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft  a proxy for business spending  were unrevised at a 0 1  dip 
The trade balance    showed that the deficit came in at  43 6 billion in February  compared to the Bloomberg estimate of  44 6 billion  January s deficit was revised lower to  48 2 billion  Exports ticked 0 2  higher m m to  192 8 billion  while imports fell 1 8  to  236 4 billion 
Treasuries were lower  as the yield on the 2 Year note rose 2 basis points  bps  to 1 25   the yield on the 10 Year note gained 3 bps to 2 35   and the 30 Year bond rate advanced 4 bps to 2 99  
Bond yields and the U S  dollar have been diverging  with the former dropping to pressure financials  which have led the last two sessions of losses for the stock markets  while the latter has rebounded from a multi month low set in late March  The markets continue to grapple with upbeat economic data  exacerbated political uncertainty here and abroad  and the Fed s March rate hike and outlook for future increases 
This sets the stage for tomorrow s   which will bring MBA mortgage applications and ADP s employment change report  projected to show job growth of 190 000 for March ahead of Friday s key nonfarm payroll report  However  data that will likely garner the most attention is two key reads on March services sector activity in the form of the ISM non Manufacturing Index and Markit s Services PMI Index  ISM s report is expected to show a slight deceleration to 57 0 from February s 57 6 level and Markit s index is projected to show a revised figure of 53 1 from 52 9  and down from the prior month s 53 8 level  Readings above 50 for both indexes denote expansion  Moreover  the minutes from the Fed s March monetary policy meeting are poised to foster a reaction given the uncertainty and recent moves in the stock  bond and currency markets 
The modest downward pressure on stocks recently appears to be working off some overly optimistic sentiment  We view this as a healthy pause in an ongoing bull market  Investors are facing the realization that  soft  data  such as confidence readings and business surveys  doesn t necessarily translate immediately into  hard  data  like retail sales  capital expenditures  and industrial production  It s this hard data that translates into economic growth and increasing profitability  Looking at some of the parabolic moves in recent confidence surveys  it would be difficult for hard data to keep up  Historically  wide spreads between soft and hard data tend to narrow in both directions soft data tends to retreat  but hard data tends to play some catchup  We expect that pattern in this cycle  too 
Europe shows resiliency supported by energy  Asia lower in light action 
European equities finished mostly higher  showing some late session resiliency as financials paused from some recent weakness  while oil   gas led to the upside as crude oil prices rebounded  Stocks appeared to shrug off continued festering political uncertainty on both sides of the pond   with the U S  and China set to meet later this week and skepticism lingering regarding U S  President Trump s business friendly agenda 
Also  Brexit negotiations remained in focus and France heads toward a key Presidential election later this month  A stronger than expected read on Eurozone retail sales may have had a limited positive impact on the markets  along with weakness in the euro and British pound versus the U S  dollar  Bond yields in the region finished mostly lower 
Stocks in Asia finished lower amid heightened political uncertainty in the U S  and Europe being met with a flare up in concerns toward North Korea and the looming meeting between the U S  and China later this week  Also  the yen showed some strength  U S  auto sales figures came in softer than expected yesterday  and the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  held its monetary policy stance unchanged but appeared to be slightly more dovish  noting concerns about the labor market 
Volume was lighter than usual with markets in China and India closed for holidays  Stocks in Japan fell  pressured by the yen s strength  while financials contributed to a decline for Australia s markets  South Korean equities also traded to the downside  Emerging markets have enjoyed strong returns in 2017  led by Indian stocks  which have rebounded sharply after a brief post U S  election slide 
Service sector PMI reads will dominate tomorrow s international economic calendar  while the Reserve Bank of India will meet to discuss monetary policy  with economists expecting no change to its stance ",2017-04-06,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/caution-still-hampering-markets-200181450,200181450

The S P 500  Dow  and NASDAQ all broke records yesterday  Trading volume was unremarkable given that it is a shortened holiday week  but the S P rose 0 75  to end the day at 2 198 18  the Dow closed up 0 47  at 18 956 69  the NASDAQ rose 0 89  to 5 368 86  Small caps gained as well  as the Russell 2000 rose for a twelfth consecutive day  to a record high of 1 322 92 
In pre market trading the S P and Dow are both up 0 28   the NASDAQ rose 0 24  
Rising U S  Treasury yields seem to have tempted buyers back  and yields have taken a slight dip as a result  The 10 Year bond yield is currently at 2 301   30 Year yield is 2 969  
When it comes to Wall Street recently  bulls appear to hold all the cards  However  expect lighter trading volumes for the rest of the week  with a holiday tomorrow in Japan and Thanksgiving on Thursday  That could mean larger swings if something unexpected occurs  like controversial Trump staff designations   Also anticipate a little profit taking 
Forex
The dollar continues to gain strength off the expected December rate hike  helped along by positive U S  data  It could get a further boost today when Existing Home Sales figures are released  The Dollar Index currently stands at 100 86 
The yen recently fell to five and a half month lows versus the dollar  while the Swiss franc  another safe haven  is hovering near nine month lows against the greenback
The euro has struggled mightily against the dollar since Trump s election  falling to 11 month lows last week  It is unlikely to regain any sort of bullish footing until positive dollar sentiment dies down  Even after the probable Fed rate hike  in the wake of Brexit and Trump s victory  there is every possibility the euro will be plagued with European right wing nationalist concerns  with upcoming elections in Austria  Italy  France  the Netherlands  and Germany 
The pound lost value in early October  when relations frayed between the financial industry and Theresa May s government  with banks threatening to leave Britain in the wake of Brexit  However  sterling hasn t struggled appreciably since the U S  election like other currencies have  And now  bankers have begun mixing their dire warnings with optimism   I don t think London will lose its gravitational pull in terms of management of capital in any reasonable timeframe   Barclay s CEO Jes Staley said 

Looking at a technical chart  the cable is currently consolidating  perhaps even demonstrating a slight counter trend  but prices will have to reach the previous range before a breakout can be confirmed

Oil prices escalated four percent to three week highs yesterday  as Russian President Putin said he saw  high probability  that an agreement to curb oil production could be reached later this month  OPEC meets in Vienna on November 30  We ve been here before and talks could just as easily falter this time  so perhaps wait a bit longer before getting bullish on oil   You never know with OPEC   sometimes they go to the last minute  and there are a lot of false starts   said Phil Flynn  a senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago

Earnings season unofficially ended when Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  reported last week  but there s still a trickle of companies late to the game 
Tech giant Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co  NYSE HPE   NYSE HPQ   reports earnings after the market close  It s important to mention that the company recently completed its split into two separate companies  so there will be two reports  one for HPQ  the PC and printing business  and another for HPE  which retained the tech solutions segment

HPE is expected to report Q4 2016 ESP of  0 60 on  12 85 billion in revenue  HPE s largest revenue driver is servers  in which it owns approximately 25  of the worldwide service market share  by revenue   Importantly  the company  under CEO Meg Whitman  is making a concerted effort to spin off their large portfolio of non core businesses  to invest more in their higher margin segments  such as technology services  networking  and storage  These overhauls should yield short term benefits  It remains to be seen how cloud computing  and competition from companies like IBM  NYSE IBM   Oracle  NYSE ORCL   Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   impact them in the long run

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Liquid Stocks to Improve Your Portfolio Returns 

Investing in liquid companies is considered to be profitable as liquidity is a measure of a company s financial health  A company s liquidity measures its ability to meet short term debt obligations  Companies with favorable liquidity levels are not only considered to be financially strong but are also believed to provide healthy returns 

However  one should be careful before investing in securities of highly liquid companies as this may also be an indication of the company s inefficiency to utilize its assets  This is the reason why a strategy that successfully identifies efficient companies with favorable liquidity positions is poised to provide impressive returns irrespective of market conditions 

Key Ratios to Indicate Liquidity

Current  quick and cash ratios are considered as the main indicators of the liquidity level of a company  The current ratio or working capital ratio indicates a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations by measuring current assets relative to current liabilities  Contrastingly  quick ratio or acid test ratio or quick assets ratio only seeks to measure a company s ability to pay short term obligations  Due to this  current assets excluding inventory are considered while calculating quick ratio 

Separately  the cash ratio   the most conservative of the three ratios   indicates a company s potential to convert its most liquid assets to pay current debt obligations  This is the reason why it only considers cash and cash equivalents relative to the company s current liabilities  Values of all these ratios above 1 may signal that the company is in good financial shape  However  high values of these ratios may also indicate that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  we consider liquidity ratios between 1 and 3 for healthy choices 

Screening Parameters

In addition to favorable liquidity ratios  we have included asset utilization in our screening parameters in order to avoid screening high liquid but inefficient companies  Asset utilization  which is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  A company with high asset utilization is considered to be efficient 

Also  we have added our proprietary  to the screen with an objective to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential too 

Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3
	 While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency 

Asset utilization greater than industry average 
	 Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  

Zacks Rank equal to  1

118730,340245,URBN,Retail Sales Recover In September  ETF   Stock Winners,opinion,"After a downbeat August  U S  retail sales turned around in September  validating the solid U S  growth momentum  Sales came  with analyst estimates and grew 0 6  sequentially  following an upwardly revised 0 2  fall in August  On a year over year basis  sales grew 2 7  following an upwardly revised 2 1  jump in August 
Higher auto sales and increasing gasoline prices were behind this decent reading  Auto sales ticked up 1 1  following a 0 3  dip in the prior month and sales at service stations grew 2 4   Notably  miscellaneous store retailers saw 1 8  sales growth and sporting goods and hobby witnessed 1 4  sales rise 
Restaurants and bars exhibited 0 8  sales expansion   the highest since February  Online retailers too saw a 0 3  nudge up in sales  Barring spending at gas and autos  retail sales advanced a moderate 0 3   Among the losers  sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 0 9  
Accelerating wage growth can be credited for greater consumer confidence in September  Notably  average hourly pay was  25 79 in September  up  year over year 
Market Impact 
The market reaction to September retail data was mixed as it strengthened chances of a rate hike this year end  Almost all core retail ETFs including SPDR S P Retail ETF   VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   V RTH   and PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF   LON PMR   shed gains on October 14  following the release of the data  though at a measure of less than 1   Odds of gradual ending in easy money inflows probably restrained those ETFs from celebrating the sector s gain 
Since traders are now betting on a 66  chance of a rate hike by December  up from 59  at the end of September  the U S  dollar has gained strength  PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish ETF  NYSE UUP   was up over 0 5  on October 14  2016  read    
Can the Wining Trend Thrive Ahead 
Investors should note that though retail sales picked up pace in September  the momentum may melt down in October  This is because consumer confidence suddenly dropped to  low this month given the uncertainty over the presidential election  If this subdued sentiment reflects on retail sales  the upcoming reading may not be that reassuring 
ETF Impact
Below we highlight a few consumer discretionary ETFs that gained on October 14 and may lead the way ahead despite the overall somber sentiment over the sector  read    
First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund   Up 1 6  on October 14

After a brush with the rough tide caused by the sluggishness witnessed in emerging markets such as China and Brazil  and fears of challenging economic political conditions in Europe post Brexit  the U S  economy looks much steadier now  A clear answer to this was the GDP growth of 2 9   the  advance estimate  for the third quarter of 2016 that fared far better than a 1 4  and 0 8  increase recorded in the second and first quarters  respectively  Rebound in inventory and strong gains in exports provided a much needed boost to the economy

The latest  report as of Nov 9 also unveils an encouraging scenario  About 48 8  of the total number of S P 500 companies in the Retail Wholesale sector has reported results  wherein 52 4  beat earnings estimates  while 28 6  surpassed revenue expectations  While earnings climbed 14 3  year over year  revenues rose 9 4   The sector is displaying strength  with total earnings expected to advance 5 9  and revenues projected to increase 5 2  5 Prominent Picks

4 Retailers to Buy into Q3 Earnings Season

	The retail sector has not been the place to be in 2016  Earnings have been dismal for most companies  which has caused those stocks to lag and in some cases fall 10  plus after an earnings report  The SPDR Retail ETF  XRT  is just up over 2  on the year  while the S P 500 is up close to 8   Lack of consumer demand and competition from online giant Amazon are forcing retailers to get creative in order to get people in the door 

Amazon    NASDAQ         simply continues to eat the average retailer s lunch  putting a dent in earnings for a majority of stocks in the space  The good companies have adjusted to the Amazon threat and beat the odds  Loyalty programs and other incentives bring traffic to the store  which is the first step in competing against Amazon 

	Below I list four top ranked companies that have adjusted and look poised to outperform in the fourth quarter  The stocks all are Zacks Ranked  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  and have rising earnings estimates 

Tillys    NYSE         is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that is a specialty retailer in the action sports industry selling clothing  shoes and accessories  The company offers one of the largest assortments of brands and merchandise from the top players in the surf  skate  motocross and lifestyle apparel industries available both in stores and online at   The company was founded in Southern California in 1982 and has grown to 225 stores in 33 states 

	Tillys has a market cap of nearly  300 Million with a Forward PE of 20  The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of  A  in both Value 

	Q2 earnings were reported on August 24th  with the company seeing  0 05 versus the   0 03 expected  Revenue came above expectations at  136 4 Million verse  133 Million  The company also guided Q3  saying they expect to come within the range of  0 07 0 13 verse the  0 10 expected  Same store sales were up 0 9  and the company saw an improvement on margins  which ticked up to 28 5  verse the 28 1  seen last year  Investors rewarded the stock with a 17  up move in just a day 

	For fiscal year 2017 and 2018  analyst are all in agreement and revising estimates higher  For 2017  estimates have ticked 42  over the last month  from  0 19 to  0 27  For 2018  estimates have been revised 28  higher  from  0 25 to  0 32  This is the first uptick in estimates that the company has seen since early 2015  Look for the stock to reflect this uptick  just like it did in 2015 

Children s Place    NASDAQ         is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that is a growing specialty retailer of apparel and accessories for children from newborn to twelve years of age  The company is headquartered in Secaucus  NJ where it was founded in 1969 

	Children s Place has a market cap of  1 4 Billion and a Forward PE of 16  The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of  A  in Value and  A  in Growth 

	Estimates for the company have been revised higher over the last 60 days  The current fiscal year is seen at  4 69  up 11  from  4 22  For next year  estimates have been raised 8  as well  from  4 76 to  5 16 

Urban Outfitters    NASDAQ         is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that is a specialty retail company that engages in the retail and wholesale of general consumer products  The company was founded in 1970  employs over 9 000 and is headquartered in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania 

	Urban Outfitters has a market cap of  4 15 billion with a Forward PE of 17  The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of  A  in Value and  B  in both Growth and Momentum  It also has a VGM score of  A  

	Estimates for the company have been revised higher over the last 60 days  The current fiscal year is seen at  2 07  up 6 7  from  1 94  In addition  next year s estimates have been raised 3 7  as well  from  2 14 to  2 26 

	Urban reports on November 11th and if the company sees another beat  expect the stock to shoot higher  Last quarter the stock jumped over 10  after a 17 86  EPS beat 

American Eagle    NYSE         is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that isa specialty retailer of all American casual apparel  accessories  and footwear for men and women between the ages of 16 and 34  The Pittsburgh based company has 6 500 employees and was founded in 1977 

	AEO has a market cap of  3 billion and a Forward PE of 13  The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of  A  in Value  Growth  and Momentum  It also has a VGM score of  A  and pays a dividend of 2 95  

	Estimates for the company have been revised higher over the last 90 days  Fiscal year 2017 estimates have been revised 3  higher to  1 27 from  1 31  Fiscal year 2018 is seen at  1 43  up 5  from  1 36 

	The company will report earnings December 11th  where it will go for its ninth straight beat of EPS  The stock has seen a stretch of volatility  but the recent trend is up  Look for this trend to continue if the company continues to beat EPS 

In Summary

	Retail has seen some destruction  But the winners that come out of a shaky 2016 will have big rewards for investors  Sticking with stocks that are adjusting to the new world of retail  should pay off as we head into the holiday season

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Winning Stocks from the 5 Biggest Job Growth Industries 

Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy   from retail sales to housing  to international trade to consumer sentiment 

In fact  on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports 

And while the financial media does cover them  they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive 

This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading 

For example  in the Employment Situation report  it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion  and which ones contracted 

I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them 

In fact  I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible  But  after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report  I knew the housing market had turned  And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery   for those who knew where to look 

But the headline number and the obligatory one or two sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile  or paragraph  

Well here we are again  with more stock picking insight  straight from last week s Employment Situation report  Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these five industries 

1  Professional and Business Services  67 000
	 up 582 000 over the last 12 months 

2  Health Care  33 000
	 up 445 000 over the last 12 months 

3  Food Service and Drinking Places  30 000
	 up 300 000 over the last 12 months 

4  Construction  23 000

5  Retail  22 000
	 up 317 000 over the last 12 months 

Once these reports point you in the right direction  you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups 

This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis  But you can go to any screener  like the one on Zacks com or the Research Wizard  and locate the sector  then industry of interest 

Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock picking criteria to drill down to the best ones  such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s  Strong Buys or Buys   market beating growth rates  below industry valuations  upward earnings estimate revisions  etc 

Here are 5 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week s Employment report 

 NYSE     MasterCard
	 Professional and Business Services 

 NASDAQ     PRA Health Sciences
	 Health Care 

 NASDAQ     The Cheesecake Factory
	 Food Service and Drinking Places 

 NYSE    Owens Corning
	 Construction 

 NASDAQ     Urban Outfitters
	 Retail

118766,340281,URBN,5 Liquid Stocks To Improve Your Portfolio Returns,opinion,"Investing in liquid companies is considered to be profitable as liquidity is a measure of a company s financial health  A company s liquidity measures its ability to meet short term debt obligations  Companies with favorable liquidity levels are not only considered to be financially strong but are also believed to provide healthy returns   
However  one should be careful before investing in securities of highly liquid companies as this may also be an indication of the company s inefficiency to utilize its assets  This is the reason why a strategy that successfully identifies efficient companies with favorable liquidity positions is poised to provide impressive returns irrespective of market conditions 
Key Ratios to Indicate Liquidity
Current  quick and cash ratios are considered as the main indicators of the liquidity level of a company  The current ratio or working capital ratio indicates a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations by measuring current assets relative to current liabilities  Contrastingly  quick ratio or acid test ratio or quick assets ratio only seeks to measure a company s ability to pay short term obligations  Due to this  current assets excluding inventory are considered while calculating quick ratio 
Separately  the cash ratio   the most conservative of the three ratios   indicates a company s potential to convert its most liquid assets to pay current debt obligations  This is the reason why it only considers cash and cash equivalents relative to the company s current liabilities  Values of all these ratios above 1 may signal that the company is in good financial shape  However  high values of these ratios may also indicate that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  we consider liquidity ratios between 1 and 3 for healthy choices 
Screening Parameters
In addition to favorable liquidity ratios  we have included asset utilization in our screening parameters in order to avoid screening high liquid but inefficient companies  Asset utilization  which is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  A company with high asset utilization is considered to be efficient 
Also  we have added our proprietary  to the screen with an objective to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential too 
Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency     
Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  
Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see    
 Growth Style Score less than or equal to B
 Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 handily beat other stocks  
Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 15 
Here are five stocks from the list 
Five9  Inc    NASDAQ FIVN   offers software products such as workforce management  speech recognition  predictive dialer  and voice applications  FIVN has a Growth Score of  A  and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 29 1  
Vocera Communications  Inc    NYSE VCRA   provides mobile communication solutions focused on addressing critical communication challenges facing hospitals  VCRA has a Growth Score of  A  and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 28 1  
Urban Outfitters Inc    NASDAQ URBN   operates two business segments consisting of a lifestyle oriented general merchandise retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business  URBN has a Growth Score of  A  and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 6 7  
WellCare Health Plans  Inc    NYSE WCG   provides managed care services targeted exclusively to government sponsored healthcare programs  WCG has a Growth Score of  B  and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 29 6

118777,340292,URBN,Don t Fight A Losing Battle  Sell Fossil  FOSL  Before It s Late,opinion,"Despite continued momentum at the Fossil brand  product innovation in the watch portfolio and expansion in wearable technology  Fossil Group  Inc    NASDAQ FOSL   has been witnessing sluggish results over the past few quarters due to economic  competitive and consumer headwinds 
Also  the company s share price has declined nearly 18  year to date 
Let s delve deeper to find out what s happening at this Richardson  TX based designer and manufacturer of clothing and accessories FOSSIL GRP INC Price and Consensus
    Factors at Play
Fossil has surpassed earnings estimates in all the past four quarters  Solid watch portfolio and expansion in wearables have remained its strengths  However  softness in watch sales  weak comps in the U S   sluggish performance in key international markets and unfavorable currency have been weighing on this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock 
The company has been witnessing soft sales in licensed watches over the past few quarters  due to increased competition from new entrants in the market  Decline in its multi brand licensed watch portfolio and a challenging environment for the traditional watch category are major reasons for the slump 
The company noted two factors that have been impacting watch sales  First  tech enabled watches are significantly affecting the sales of traditional watches  Second  the success of the Michael Kors brand is overshadowing other brands  performance  Moreover  in Jan 2016  Burberry announced that it is exiting the watch business and does not intend to renew its license agreement upon its expiration at 2017 end  The company continues to expect weakness in this category 
Fossil expects several challenges in the near term  which would hamper its operations  The company anticipates intense competition from new players  while evolving consumer preference across the world will lead to a volatile sales pattern  Though this should not be a problem over the long term  as the company plans to upgrade its products technologically  the near term implications remain severe 
However  the traditional watchmakers like Swatch and LVMH s Tag Heuer are also developing smartwatches to cater to the rising demand  Thus  Fossil s connected wearables and smartwatches are likely to face tough competition 
Also  we note that this global consumer fashion accessories maker has been recording sluggish comps in the U S  over the past few quarters due to weak traffic  The company is witnessing a massive change in consumer shopping behavior  and has therefore adopted a cautious stance in the U S 
Fossil is also battling economic challenges in many key markets  including China  Europe  Russia and Greece  and thus does not expect much international growth this year  The company s performance in Europe and Asia are decelerating  which again is a concern 
Stocks to Consider
Some well positioned retailers include The Children s Place  Inc    NASDAQ PLCE    Urban Outfitters Inc    NASDAQ URBN   and Tilly s  Inc    NYSE TLYS    all sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 
The Children s Place has an average positive earnings surprise of 33 06  in the trailing four quarters  It also has a long term earnings growth rate of 10 33  
While Urban Outfitters has a long term earnings growth rate of 15 00   Tilly s has a growth rate of 15 50

Moreover  hhgregg is focused on innovations like 4K ultra high definition  curve TVs and OLED TVs to boost category sales of consumer electronics  The company will continue to utilize its financing options to drive sales in the consumer electronics business  Further  to revive the appliance business  it plans to refresh the assortment across channels while continuing to enhance its product selection by creating additional Fine Lines departments 
However  we note that hhgregg has been reporting losses and declining revenues for the past many quarters  primarily due to weak comparable store sales  Though the company s strategic initiatives have the potential to revive declining comps  we believe the improvement will take time as it is still under a lot of pressure and facing volatility  Sales from its consumer electronics business will likely remain in the red in the coming quarters

118840,340355,URBN,3 Retail ETFs   Stocks Can Defy Soft Data ,opinion,"Something surely went wrong in August  After the month witnessed muted manufacturing  service and job data  retail sales also came in weaker than expected  Retail sales in the U S  dropped 0 3  sequentially in August  following an upwardly revised 0 1  increase in the prior month  read    
The sales decline was wider than analyst s expectation of a  fall  It was the first fall in retail sales  this year  On a year over year basis  sales growth slackened to 1 9  from 2 4  in July 
Barring automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food services  retail sales dropped 0 1  in August after a similar drop in July  Excluding auto  sales slid 0 1   Among the many losers  sales at miscellaneous store retailers fell 2 4   hobby and book storesdeclined 1 4  and building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers slipped 0 7   However  sales spiked 0 9  for  outlets  0 7  for clothing and 0 3  for food beverages 
The prospect of rising rates  an around 4 6  rise in retail gasoline prices and still subtle wage growth in the U S  might have caused consumers to be wary of spending  After all  commodity prices and inflation are both on the risethis year 
Market Impact 
Quite expectedly  such downbeat retail sales data spread cheer among investors on diminishing possibilities of a rate hike  Also  in a second report  the Fed indicated that manufacturing production dropped  against July s gains  This further trimmed chances of a sooner than expected rate hike 
As a result  the confirmation of a few more months of easy money inflows boosted the broader market  Among the top ETFs  investors saw   AX SPY   and   V DIA   each gain about 1  and  advance about 1 6  on the day 
Since traders are now betting on an 18  chance of a rate hike next week  down from 30  last week  the U S  dollar lost strength  PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish ETF  NYSE UUP   was down about 0 04  on September 16  2016  read    
ETF Impact
Below we highlight a few ETFs that could be poised for gains despite soft retail sales  read    
Amplify Online Retail ETF    Up 0 2  on September 15
Investors should note that department store sales declined 0 6  in August  In any case  the wind has been in favor of online retailing over the last few months  So  IBUY could be a good long term pick if the Fed remains this accommodative for a few more days and energy prices remain low  The fund added 0 2  on September 15  the day retail sales were reported  read    
SPDR S P Retail ETF    Up 1 3  on September 15
The fund looks to track theS P Retail Select Industry Index  More cheap money inflows should do some good to this ETF too  The fund has 29 3  exposure to apparel retail followed by 16 5  focus on specialty retail and 15 1  focus in automotive retail 
PowerShares Dynamic Food   Beverage ETF    Up 1  on September 15
Since food and beverage were able to stay afloat amid an industry wide downslide  a pick on this segment would be interesting  The fund has 94 25  exposure to the consumer staples segment while 5 75  focus goes to consumer discretionary

5 Stocks to Buy on Significant Relative Price Strength

	Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine whether a stock has the ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is ahead of its peers or the industry average 

	If the stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite having impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong 

	It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning 

	At the same time  it is important that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy 

	Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains 

Screening Parameters

Relative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0

Relative   Price change   4 weeks greater than 0

Relative   Price change   1 week greater than 0

	 We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S P 500 over the last 12 weeks  4 weeks and 1 week  

  Change  Q1  Est  over 4 Weeks greater than 0  Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks 

Zacks Rank equal to 1  Only Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks   that have returned more than 26  annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years   can get through  You can see     

Current Price greater than or equal to  5 and Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000   A minimum price of  5 is a good standard to screen low priced stocks  while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity 

  less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2  Buy  offer the best upside potential 

	Here are five of the eight stocks that made it through the screen

Notably  the company is well on track to achieve its target of opening six full line stores in the country by the end of fiscal 2017  In this regard  Nordstrom opened its first full line store in Toronto  on Sep 16  which was a one off event that saw a Beauty Bash hosted right outside the store  This itself was a major attraction for customers 
Spanning over 220 000 square feet  the store is housed at CF Toronto Eaton Centre  which marked Nordstrom s second global flagship location  Prior to this  the company operated an international flagship store at Pacific Centre in Vancouver  British Columbia that was introduced last fall 
Coming back to the newly opened store in Toronto  this three storied outlet provides a wide assortment of merchandise from designers like Marchesa to renowned brands like Madewell  thus covering items from a lower to higher price point  Alongside  this store will offer special services like Concierge  Language Ambassadors   Personalize It  monogramming and engraving station  24 Hour Express Service  UnionPay  JWN Private Shopping Suite  Shoe Shine  Two Hour Delivery Service  Studio Services and three food offerings among others

5 Low PEG Stocks Ideal for Value Investors

	The Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha s secret of success is based on the theory that  The best thing that happens to us is when a great company gets into temporary trouble   Delving deeper into Warren Buffett s success story  we come across the term  intrinsic value  of a stock that mostly does the trick for investors 

	The process is apparently simple  Pick the stocks that are currently undervalued in the market  Yardsticks such as dividend yield  the ratio of price to earnings or to book value are most commonly used to calculate intrinsic value  which indicates whether a stock is trading at a discount 

	But will this alone ensure success  What if there is a dearth of catalysts to propel growth even though the stock is cheap  In such a case  if you buy a stock at less than its fair value  you might still end up paying more  To avoid such value traps  Buffett advises investors to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock  Here lies the importance of a not so popular value investing metric  the PEG ratio 

	The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth Rate

	A low PEG ratio is always better for value investors 

	While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock 

	Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock 

	There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term 

	Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration 

	Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy 

PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median

	 P E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose  

Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy    whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 and  2 have a proven history of success  

Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000   A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable  

Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5    Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness  

Value Score of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

	Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening 

US Foods Holding Corp       This renowned food company and foodservice distributor currently carries a Zacks Rank  1 and a Value Style Score  A   The company also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 18 6  

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation      This popular name in the field of mobile voice related services  IP packet communications services  telecommunication equipment  system integration  and other telecommunications related services currently holds a Zacks Rank  1 and has a Value Style score  A   The company also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 9 5  

Urban Outfitters Inc       Based in Philadelphia  PA  this is a lifestyle specialty retailer that offers fashion apparel and accessories  footwear  home d cor and gifts products in the U S   Canada and Europe  Urban Outfitters is currently making all possible efforts to enhance the performance of its brands through store refurbishment and creation of compelling assortments  This stock can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank  1 and Value Style Score  A   Apart from a discounted PEG and P E  the stock also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 15  

Sotheby s      This company is an auctioneer of authenticated fine art  decorative art  jewelry  wine  and collectibles across the globe  It became the first international auction house when it expanded from London to New York  This Zacks Rank  1 and Value Style Score  B  company also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 15   It delivered an earnings surprise of 43 8  in its last reported quarter 

China Petroleum   Chemical Corp       This is one of the largest petroleum and petrochemical companies in Asia  This stock can also be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank  1 and Value Style Score  B   The company has an expected five year growth rate of 12 3

118878,340393,URBN,Zumiez  ZUMZ  Q2 Loss Lower Than Expected  Q3 View Drab,opinion,Zumiez Inc    NASDAQ ZUMZ   came out with second quarter fiscal 2016 results  wherein both top and bottom lines fell year over year  However  backed by the company s solid expense management efforts  the bottom line surpassed expectations  thus marking its fourth straight positive surprise in a row Zumiez posted a loss of 3 cents per share for the second quarter  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 8 cents  However  in the year ago period  the company had recorded adjusted earnings of 11 cents per share ZUMIEZ INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Further  the tough retail environment continued to weigh upon net sales  which dipped 0 9  year over year to  178 3 million  but were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The year over year decline in the top line was attributable to soft comps  partly compensated by the addition of new stores Quarterly comps dropped 4 9   following a 4 5  decline registered in the year ago quarter  Second quarter comps bore the brunt of lower transaction volume  somewhat offset by a rise in dollars per transaction Concurrent with the second quarter results  Zumiez reported its sales data for August  which marked its 17th consecutive month of negative comps  Comps for the month fell 1 1   compared to a 10 7  plunge recorded in the same month a year ago  Nonetheless  net sales for the four week period ended Aug 27  2016  grew 2 6  year over year to  89 5 million  Further  the company stated that comps started improving as the second quarter progressed  largely fueled by Zumiez s men s category Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter  gross profit fell 5  to  54 8 million  with the gross margin contracting 130 basis points  bps  to 30 8   The contraction in gross margin was a result of occupancy cost deleverage  partly offset by higher product margins Zumiez s selling  general and administrative expenses escalated 6 7  to nearly  56 million and as a percentage of sales  the same increased 230 bps to 31 5  The company posted an operating loss of  1 1 million in the quarter  as against an operating income of  5 3 million recorded in the year ago period Financial UpdateAs of Jul 30  2016  Zumiez s cash and marketable securities were  52 3 million  down 35 3  year over year owing to share buybacks and capital expenditures  offset by cash flow from operations  Total shareholders  equity at the end of the quarter was  280 2 million Also  during the quarter  the company repurchased roughly 447 000 shares for  6 7 million  that took its year to date share buybacks to  18 3 million  As of the end of the second quarter  the company had shares worth  36 1 million remaining under its standing authorization  Further  it spent around  11 9 million as capital expenditure on a year to date basis Store UpdateDuring the second quarter  Zumiez introduced 9 North American and 1 European store  which took its total store count to 674 as of Aug 27  2016 In fiscal 2016  the company intends to introduce nearly 29 new stores  which include around 7 stores in Europe and up to 6 stores in Canada   Other DevelopmentsZumiez announced that on Aug 31  2016  it acquired all shares of the Australian specialty retailer   Fast Times Skateboarding   Fast Times    The deal  valued at  6 9 million was a combination of  5 5 million in cash and stock worth  1 4 million  Founded nearly 8 years back  this retailer of skateboards  hardware  apparel and footwear currently  operates 5 stores  apart from operating through its website  stated that Fast Times will form a significant part of Zumiez s retail channel  as it is now part of the latter s U S   Canadian and European operations  Further  this acquisition is likely to help Fast Times expand further in Australia  with the help of Zumiez s proficiency of enhancing brand and culture GuidanceWhile comps witnessed some improvement toward the end of the reported quarter  the overall retail environment remained challenging  mainly owing to weak consumer demand  In the face of such headwinds  Zumiez remains on track with its expense control and expansion strategies  which are aimed at placing it on the growth curve and generating profit in the near term Based on the current scenario  management issued a subdued outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2016  The company envisions net sales for the quarter in the  209  213 million range  while comps growth is expected in a range of negative 2  to flat  over the same period Finally  for the third quarter  the company envisions earnings in a band of 21 26 cents per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at earnings of 31 cents per share Stocks to ConsiderZumiez currently

118879,340394,URBN,Have You Offloaded Abercrombie   Fitch From Your Portfolio ,opinion,"Are you still holding shares of Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF   and awaiting a miracle to take the stock higher in the near term  If yes  then odds are you might lose more money as chances are very slim that the stock which lost its value by nearly 25  since Aug 30  2016  will take a U turn in the near term 
 A stitch in time saves nine   implying that timely action may prevent a serious loss later on  Let s delve deeper and try to find out what is taking this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company down the hill 
Ever since Abercrombie posted wider than estimated losses for the second consecutive quarter the company s shares are moving towards South Pole  Abercrombie   Fitch Co  s second quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted loss per share of 25 cents was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents and the prior year quarter loss of 12 cents 
Moreover  Net sales were also down nearly 4  year over year to  783 2 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  789 million  A soft sales performance due to traffic headwinds at its U S  flagship and tourist locations stores were primarily responsible for the quarter s weakness 
Following the dismal second quarter fiscal 2016  the company expects comps to remain challenging in second half fiscal 2016  due to uneven results from flagship and tourist locations  Further  it anticipates foreign currency headwinds to hurt sales by nearly  25 million and operating income by  20 million in the fiscal second half  with the largest impact expected in the fiscal third quarter ABERCROMBIE Price

   Let s look at Abercrombie s earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company  In the past 30 days  the company s earnings estimates for fiscal 2016 have declined by 40 2  to 49 cents  On the other hand  over the same time frame  its earnings estimates for third quarter fiscal 2016 have moved down to 21 cents from 44 cents

118891,340406,URBN,Zacks com Featured Highlights  Greif  Tilly s And Urban Outfitters,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   September 14  2016   Stocks in this week s article include  Greif    Tilly s    and Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN       

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Explosive Returns with the Filtered Zacks Rank  5 Strategy 

In good markets or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank of  1 continue to outperform 

But  since there are over 200 stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 at any time  it s important to know what other filters to apply to the Zacks Rank to generate a smaller  more tradable list of stocks 

Two filters in particular  when added to the Zacks Rank of  1  not only narrows down the number of qualified stocks to a more practical portfolio size  it often times increases its performance as well 

Parameters

There are only three items to this screen  But together  they make for a powerful combination 

  Zacks Rank equal to 1 
	With an average annual return of over 26  per year over the last 26 years  there s no better way to start off a screen 

    Change  Q1  Est  over 4 Weeks greater than 0
	Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks 

The Zacks Rank already looks at earnings estimate revisions for the current year  F1  and the next year  F2   But this added component looks at the more immediate future  which is the current quarter  Q1  

If a company s current quarter is seeing downward revisions  this is a potential warning sign that more downward revisions could follow  On the other hand  a company receiving upward earnings estimate revisions should see even more upward earnings estimate revisions  making it an attractive stock to buy  

    Broker Rating Change over 4 Week equal to Top   5 
	Top 5 stocks with the best average broker rating changes over the last four weeks 

We re looking for positive broker rating changes or upgrades over the last four weeks  And to limit the number of stocks that come through  we ve constructed the screen to select the top 5 stocks with the best broker rating upgrade 

Since broker ratings are typically skewed to the upside  this makes sure that the brokers are getting more bullish or  at the very least  not getting less bullish  or even bearish  on the stock 

And while I don t care so much for the actual broker rating per se   I do care about the change  And stocks with broker rating upgrades have proven to outperform those with no broker rating changes and downgrades 

These two items added to the Zacks  1 Rank produce powerful results 

Results

Over the last 16 years  2000 thru 2015  using a 1 week rebalance  it showed an average annual return of 54 7  vs  the S P s 3 8  

And so far this year  thru 9 9 16   it s already up 48 4  this year vs  the S P s 5 8  

You can also successfully trade this strategy using a 2 week or 4 week rebalance as well  Regardless of how often you trade it  once a week  every two weeks  or four weeks  etc    trading 5 stocks at a time is a lot easier than 200 stocks 

So for a great and reliable way to trade some of the best Zacks  1 Ranked stocks  try the Filtered Zacks Rank 5 strategy and trade fewer stocks for even bigger returns 

This strategy comes loaded with the Research Wizard and is called bt sow filtered zacks rank5  It can be found in the SoW  Screen of the Week  folder  

Here are three of the five stocks that qualified for the Filtered Zacks Rank5 strategy 

   Greif  Inc 
	   Tilly s
	   Urban Outfitters

118896,340411,URBN,5 Stocks To Buy On Significant Relative Price Strength,opinion,Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine whether a stock has the ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is ahead of its peers or the industry average If the stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite having impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning At the same time  it is important that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it

118897,340412,URBN,Retail Sales Dip In August  Another Blow To Fed Rate Hike,opinion,U S  retail sales in August declined more than expected  reflecting a scenario where the consumers are reigning in their spending and casting a doubt over the expected rebound in the economy during the second half of 2016  The dismal sales report came following the soft job addition and contraction in manufacturing and service sectors witnessed last month  Well the economic environment does not seem much conducive now and might leave the Fed officials in dilemma over the rate hike The Commerce Department unveiled that sales at retail stores  restaurants and online declined 0 3  to a seasonally adjusted  456 3 billion last month  as auto and gasoline purchases fell  The reading marked the first drop in retail sales since March  Retail sales data for July was also revised up to 0 1  from an initial flat reading Excluding automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food services  retail sales were down 0 1  last month  Auto sales declined 0 9   while receipts at gasoline stations decreased 0 8   Online retail sales dropped 0 3  in August  However  back to school demand did help restaurants and apparel stores to register a sales increase of 0 9  and 0 7   respectively The abovementioned data strongly suggests that consumer spending   accounting for over two thirds of U S  economic activity   lost momentum  which otherwise has been one of the pivotal factors driving the economy so far  The Fed will certainly consider the retail sales report while contemplating an interest rate hike in its meeting next week  The Fed raised the benchmark interest rate in December last year  for the first time in nearly a decade Undoubtedly  the tussle is still on among the Fed members  as the economic indicators are making things complicated for them to arrive at a decision  Industry experts believe that the Fed may go for an interest rate hike sometime in the year    if not in September  chances of which are slim   only after due consideration of the global as well as domestic economic climate Well nothing concrete can be said about the outcome of the next week s meeting  Instead of finding an answer to this  it will be better to shift your focus on retail stocks that still hold promise  These are stocks backed with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    The Children s Place  Inc    NASDAQ PLCE    Urban Outfitters Inc    NASDAQ URBN    U S  Auto Parts Network  Inc    NASDAQ PRTS   and Tilly s  Inc    NYSE TLYS    You can see  Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public  other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members  Would you like to peek behind the curtain and view them  Starting today  for the next month  you can follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time from value to momentum        from stocks under  10 to ETF and option moves       from insider trades to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  we ve called them with 80   accuracy   You can even look inside portfolios so exclusive that they are normally closed to new investors ,2016-09-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/retail-sales-dip-in-august:-another-blow-to-fed-rate-hike-200154011,200154011

118920,340435,URBN,Looking For Momentum  Ulta   4 Other Retail Stocks To Buy ,opinion,"The U S  stock market displayed a sluggish performance at the start of the year owing to fears of overseas turmoil and plunging oil prices  However  the market has recouped much of the lost steam since then  and consumers feel much better about the economy  The recent rebound in oil prices  increase in consumer spending and a gradual improvement in the housing market are signals that the economy is on a recovery mode  and undoubtedly the retail sector presents itself as a lucrative investment hub Amid these bullish sentiments  momentum investing should be a winning strategy for investors seeking higher returns in a short spell  This is because the strategy looks to capture profits by buying hot stocks that have been on an uptrend over the past few weeks or months  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than drift away from the trajectory ULTA Salon  Cosmetics   Fragrance  Inc    NASDAQ ULTA   is one such stock which is riding high given the tremendous growth prospects  The stock has gained 32 4  year to date and looks well poised to carry the momentum going forward based on the expected long term earnings growth rate of 19 5   Momentum  of  A  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   However  before looking at other momentum stocks  a glimpse into the economy is essential    How the Economy is UnfoldingAfter navigating brazenly through the rough tide due to the sluggishness witnessed in emerging markets such as China and Brazil and fears of challenging economic political conditions in Europe post Brexit  the U S  economy looks much steady now  A clear answer to this was the GDP growth of 1 1  registered in the second quarter of 2016  albeit a tad lower than the initial estimate of 1 2   but better than a 0 8  increase recorded in the first quarter Investors  enthusiasm is further compounded by increased consumer confidence  which improved significantly in August  According to the Conference Board data  the Consumer Confidence Index rose to 101 1 in August from the July reading of 96 7  and is at its 11 month high  Industry pundits believe that a rosy job picture  improvement in the housing market and higher income prospects may have acted as catalysts to consumer sentiment As per the Labor Department  the economy added 255 000 jobs in July and economists are expecting a gain of about 180 000 jobs in August  Additionally  we note that the unemployment rate is hovering around 4 9  Given an improving labor market and the gradual rise in wages  we expect consumer spending   which accounts for over two thirds of the U S  economic activity   to improve  Consumer spending increased 4 4  in the second quarter from the previous estimate of 4 2   This is the fastest pace of expansion the metric has experienced in nearly two years  The Commerce Department recently unveiled that consumer spending rose 0 3  in July  after advancing 0 5  in June With an expected rebound in the economy  declining unemployment rate and improving consumer spending  the retail space is bubbling with optimism  Industry analysts predict that the encouraging economic data will be reflected in an interest rate hike sometime in the year  only after due consideration of the global as well as domestic economic climate 4 Other Momentum Stocks to Grab Your AttentionThe Momentum Style Score theory basically states that what has been going up so far will possibly continue to do so in the near future

5 Liquid Stocks Poised to Provide Encouraging Returns

	Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as they are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns  However  one should be careful before investing in liquid stocks  While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently 

	Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength 

Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks

	Current  quick and cash ratios are considered as the main pointers of the liquidity level of a company  Current ratio or working capital ratio indicates a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations by measuring current assets relative to current liabilities  Contrastingly  the quick ratio or acid test ratio or quick assets ratio only seeks to measure a company s ability to pay short term obligations  Due to this  current assets excluding inventory are considered in calculating the quick ratio 

	Separately  the cash ratio   the most conservative of the three ratios   indicates a company s potential to convert its most liquid assets to pay current debt obligations  This is the reason why it only considers cash and cash equivalents relative to the company s current liabilities  Values of all these ratios above 1 may signal that the company is in good financial shape  However  high values of these ratios may also indicate that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  we consider liquidity ratios between 1 and 3 for healthy choices 

Screening Parameters

	In addition to favorable liquidity ratios  we considered asset utilization in order to avoid screening high liquid but inefficient companies  Asset utilization  which is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  A company with high asset utilization is considered to be efficient 

	Also  we have added our proprietary  to the screen with an objective to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential too 

Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3
	 While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency 

Asset utilization greater than industry average  
	 Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency

Top 5 Stocks with Stellar Earnings Growth

	Take a company s revenue over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and  there it is  you have earnings  In short  earnings serve as a major indicator of a company s profitability and thus securing earnings growth on a year over year basis is the highest priority among the top brass of any organization  be it a fledgling company or an established corporation 

	This metric is also considered to be the most significant variable in influencing the share price  Also  earnings expectations play a crucial role in share price movements 

How Do Earnings Estimates Determine Share Prices 

	On numerous occasions  companies have seen their share prices decline even after reporting earnings growth or for that matter a stock price surging following an earnings decline  This follows the missing or beating of estimates 

	But what exactly do earnings estimates represent  These are analysts  expectations of a company s quarterly or annual earnings  which represent their opinion on factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins  expenses and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates are a valuable tool for making investment choices 

	Thus  it is imperative for an investor to zero down to stocks with solid earnings growth and escalating earnings estimates  Moreover  earnings estimates help analysts to use cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of a firm 

	We have picked stocks that have displayed historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we added the following parameters 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2    Only Zacks   Buys  and  Strong Buys  are allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there  this is a great way to start things off  

5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry    Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history  

  Change EPS F 0  F  1  greater than or equal to 5    Companies that witnessed year over year earnings growth rate of 5  or more in the last reported fiscal  

  Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks  

  Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero    Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week  

  Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero    Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks  

	The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7 720 stocks to only 11  Here are the top 5 stocks 

ULTA Salon  Cosmetics   Fragrance  Inc     operates as a specialty retailer in the United States  Its stores provide cosmetics  fragrance  haircare  skincare  bath and body products  and salon styling tools  The company s estimated earnings growth rate for this year is 23 5

118965,340480,URBN,Abercrombie  ANF  An Outlier Among Strong Shopping Mall Stocks ,opinion,"Shares of Abercrombie   Fitch   NYSE ANF   fell over 20  on Tuesday after the specialty retailer reported lackluster second quarter financial results  Interestingly enough  Abercrombie s performance is in direct contrast to some of its biggest competitors throughout the shopping mall retail landscape  which has seen a resurgence this earnings season 
In the second quarter  Abercrombie s adjusted loss per share of 25 cents was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents  Revenues of  783 million were down nearly 4  year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  789 million  The company also saw comparable store stores decline by 4   also read    
In comparison  other retailers with a focus on young adults and storefronts primarily located in shopping walls performed well this quarter  One noteworthy competitor is American Eagle   NYSE AEO    which posted earnings of 23 cents per share on revenues of  823 million  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates of 21 cents per share and  819 million  respectively 
American Eagle saw comparable store sales growth of 3   marking its sixth consecutive quarter of comps growth  and the company now holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  after a wave of positive estimate adjustments rolled in following the release of its report 
Urban Outfitters   NASDAQ URBN   is another example of a mall based retailer that competes with Abercrombie  In its latest earnings report  Urban Outfitters posted earnings of 66 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents per share  The company also beat on revenues  with sales of  891 million edging out our consensus estimate of  889 million 
Urban Outfitters jumped to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  based on the estimate adjustments that followed its earnings announcement  and the stock has now gained over 20  over the last four weeks  Also in the urban clothing sphere is Tilly s   NYSE TLYS   which beat on both earnings and revenue and is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
It s also worth taking a look at Foot Locker   NYSE FL    which might appeal to a different demographic of shoppers than Abercrombie  but is still a retailer with storefronts mainly in malls  Foot Locker recently posted a double beat with comparable store sales growth of 4 7  
The overall point here is that much has been said about the death of the American shopping mall recently  Heck  even our own Dave Bartosiak made that proclamation after the sector s sluggish Q1 earnings season 

However  recent performance suggests that the retail sector has bounced back  especially with millennial focused  mall based stores  As for Abercrombie  the company is in the middle of an identity crisis caused by changing management and strategy  These things take time  and the company was careful to note that its disappointing sales were caused by slow acitivity in its flagship and tourism stores  not in mall locations ",2016-08-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abercrombie-(anf)-an-outlier-among-strong-shopping-mall-stocks-200150915,200150915

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 57 cents on  892 87 million in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  3 million on the top
Sales have been under pressure from the rising popularity of fast fashion trends and a shift towards online retailers
Urban Outfitters remains committed to improving online sales  optimizing inventory management and adding new brands
Specialty retailers are in the spotlight this week headlined by reports from Urban Outfitters  American Eagle Outfitters Inc  NYSE AEO  and Gap Inc  NYSE GPS   Urban Outfitters has benefitted from the broader surge amongst teen retailers this year  The stock is up 35  year to date after a less than desirable 2015  The retailer has remained committed to boosting sales by expanding its direct to consumer business  optimizing inventory levels and adding new brands  Earnings have been slow to follow but this report is expected to make considerable progress versus previous quarters 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 57 cents  8  higher than the same period last year  That estimate has been cut by 2  since Urban Outfitter s most recent report in May  Revenue is anticipated to grow by 4  to  892 87 million  marking a second straight quarter of positive sales comparisons  Investors should expect to see some favorable activity next week  Typically the stock increases 1 2  in the month following a report 

Universal themes impacting the broader retail sector have also hurt Urban Outfitters  A shift in consumer spending habits towards fast fashion and online retailers have been especially concerning for sales  The company has of course been putting forth the effort to boost its online revenues  However  holding on to merchandise that is not resonating with customers has resulted in a glut of excess inventory 
Fortunately  the company still has a mostly solid financial position with reasonable debt levels and valuation  A strong comparable sales number coupled with robust guidance could be enough to send this stock even higher

In particular  we get several companies in the   a space which has been in trouble thanks to rising online competition  but may have finally bottomed out in the near term  Still  with a bottom 50  industry rank  nothing is guaranteed and the stakes are likely to be high given how others have done lately  Let s take a closer look at the fundamentals for these companies heading into their reports 
Gap  GPS 
Gap is posting solid fundamentals with an  A  VGM score  but its rank is just a  3  heading into the report  The company does have a nice track record of beating earnings estimates  but its estimate trend line has been depressed for quite some time  It will be a test of guidance more than anything for this company  and if the recent surge in stock prices is backed up by impressive results GAP INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Tuesday  August 18

Wednesday  August 19

Friday  August 21


Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN 
Very rarely does the Estimize community have a corporate earnings or revenue consensus that is lower than Wall Street s  but this is the case for Urban Outfitters  Currently  the Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 48 vs  the Street s  0 49  meanwhile revenues are expected to come in at  877M vs   883M  The company continues to struggle with its flagship brand  Urban Outfitters  while their other brands Anthropologie and Free People have had an incredible run  although more recently Anthropologie sales have slowed as well  
A trend towards e commerce has hurt stores such as Urban Outfitters  who rely on in store sales for a bulk of their revenues  While they have ramped up improvements to their e commerce site  such sales come with thinner profit margins  Like many others in the apparel space  Urban Outfitters is likely losing marketshare to fast fashion retailers such as H M  ST HMb  and Zara  which service the same customer demographic  They ve had to offer deeper discounts to compete  Last quarter same store sales came in at 4  for the retailer  missing analyst expectations of 5 3  
Wal Mart Stores  NYSE WMT 
The world s largest retailer has an Estimize EPS consensus for  1 15 as compared to Wall Street s estimate for  1 12 and guidance of  1 16  The Estimize community is also expecting slightly higher revenues of  120 3B vs   1 20 2B  Retail sales over the last couple of months have shown increased consumer health in the U S   with the likes of Wal Mart benefitting from lower fuel prices and increased consumer confidence  However  retail results from this earnings season have been mixed thus far  with department stores such as Macy s  NYSE M  and Kohl s  NYSE KSS  missing results last week  while Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  and J C  Penney  NYSE JCP  surprised on the upside  
A few concerns for Wal Mart revolve around competition  with the likes of e commerce giant Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  stealing marketshare with its Prime subscription service  Wal Mart recently offered its own subscription shipping service  free shipping on most items for  50 a year  However  the service does not come with streaming video and cloud storage like Prime does  and also means lower profit margins due to increased shipping costs and price competition  Also  Wal Mart will continue to see the impact of increased costs  The retailer raised entry level wages to at least  9 hour in April  and will increase wages to at least  10 hour by February 2016  a feat that will cost at least  1B 
Home Depot  NYSE HD 
Next week we also get a few reads on the housing market when earnings for Home Depot and Lowe s  NYSE LOW  are released  The Estimize community is currently looking for EPS of  1 72  two cents higher than the Street  with sales roughly in line at  24 7B  After incredible results in the first quarter  the company increased guidance for fiscal 2015  The home improvement retailer has been benefitting from the continuing recovery in the U S  housing market  especially during the peak spring and summer season  When home prices appreciate as they have been  consumers typically invest in their properties 

Home Depot has been stealing some market share from Lowe s this year  as they deal with negative headlines from carrying Chinese laminate flooring that contained formaldehyde  a possible carcinogen  Home Depot also only has domestic locations  but their exposure to international markets still makes them vulnerable to currency fluctuations  The stock just traded at a new all time high of  119 74 on Friday 
American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO 
While many teen retailers have been losing market share to the fast fashion circuit  American Eagle Outfitters has been holding its own  For the second quarter  the specialty retailer is expected to post EPS of  0 16 as compared to the sell side expectations for  0 14  The Estimize community expects sales to come in at  770 5M vs  Wall Street s consensus of  762 5M  
American Eagle Outfitters put up superb results in Q1  beating on both the top and bottom line  and even growing EPS 650  from the year ago period due to improving sales  a decrease in promotional activity and progress in its omni channel business  That report caused the company to release positive guidance for the second quarter  issuing an EPS outlook of  0 11    0 14  higher than analysts were predicting at the time  The second quarter should prove to be even better in the second quarter without the impact of harsh winter weather and delays from the West Coast ports 
Foot Locker  NYSE FL 
The Estimize EPS consensus for FL currently stands at  0 75 as compared with the Street s  0 69  an indicated increase of 19  YoY  Revenues of  1 66B are in line  
Athletic wear has seen a surge in popularity in the past couple of years  and basketball shoes specifically are having a moment  Foot locker had the most profitable quarter in its history in Q1  with same store sales increasing 7 8   Predictions aren t quite as high for the current quarter  with comparable store sales expected to be in the mid single digits  and then shooting up to the high single digits in Q3 due to an expectedly strong back to school shopping season  Management should be able to give some clues this week as to how the back to school season is faring thus far  and investors will also be keen to hear about the company s plan for further expansion into Europe ",2015-08-18,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-8-17-261967,261967
119058,340573,URBN,Company Notes Digest ,opinion,"Each week we read dozens of transcripts from earnings calls and presentations as part of our investment process  Below is a weekly post which contains some of the most important quotes about the economy and industry trends from those transcripts  
The Macro Outlook 
The Fed is counting down to liftoff
 Most judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved  but they noted that conditions were approaching that point      Central Bank 
It s watching China
 While the recent Chinese stock market decline seemed to have had limited implications to date for the growth outlook in China  several participants noted that a material slowdown in Chinese economic activity could pose risks to the U S  economic outlook      Central Bank 
But it also has a growing list of financial market stability concerns on its radar screen
 Participants discussed a range of topics associated with financial market developments and financial stability  They commented on issues related to the deterioration in bond market liquidity reported by market participants  the potential migration of leveraged loan underwriting to the nonbank sector in light of current supervisory guidance  and the assessment of valuation risks when term premiums were narrow while most other risk premiums were not      Central Bank 
The Fed will be data dependent  but at least some people on the FOMC think that monetary policy shouldn t be set on a month to month basis
 Some participants advised that progress toward the Committee s objectives should be viewed in light of the cumulative gains made to date without overemphasizing month to month changes in incoming data      Central Bank 
One positive piece of longer term data is that household formation has picked back up
 1 6 million households were formed in the second quarter  This is something that we have been hoping for      Home Improvement 
Another positive data point is that consumers are seeing more value in their homes again
 We also continue to be encouraged by the results of our second quarter consumer sentiment survey  Roughly half of respondents indicated that they believe they re home values are increasing  double the number from 2012  And this positive sentiment around home values is rooting through to spending patterns  with plans to begin a home improvement project in the next six months  continuing its recent upward trend      Home Improvement 
It s also encouraging that back to school sales are starting off strong
 we have been pleased with comp performance so far this month  including back to school sales we re seeing a very positive start to back to school and back to college      Big Box Retail 
International 
The Chinese steel industry is in pretty bad shape
 The second quarter of 2015 has proven to be even tougher than the first quarter for the steel mills in China  China steel industry has entered into a new phase of retrenchment due to slowing infrastructure investment and a sluggish housing market  This is partially because the central government has shifted away from investment led growth to a consumption driven economy      Chinese Steel Company 
Chinese public sector spending has slowed down   The private sector is comparatively strong 
 the areas of strength particularly the Pharma area is a lot of private sector money  So traditionally this market has been heavily dominated by the direct investment by the government  We re seeing a move  I think it s still the majority but we are seeing a lot more business coming from private funded enterprises     Industrial Equipment 
Government spending was slowed by anti corruption measures and now that s led to longer sales cycles
 I think it s a new normal we re no longer pointing to longer deal cycles in China as a result of anti corruption  But I think the longer deal cycles are here to stay and now are now in this kind of this rhythm of really cautious approvals by the government authorities     Industrial Equipment 
Financials 
It s possible that the most important section of the Fed minutes was buried at the end   It was a discussion of  alternative implementation frameworks  for monetary policy
 At the conclusion of the meeting  the Chair noted that the staff would soon begin an extended effort to evaluate potential long run monetary policy implementation frameworks      Central Bank 
Given the expected pace of normalization  the committee judged that it would not have to make any decisions for several years
 In view of the likely time frames for normalization of the stance of monetary policy and the System s balance sheet  the Committee probably would not need to reach any final decisions regarding such a framework for several years      Central Bank 
The committee also noted that special consideration should be given to scenarios that could require a return to the zero lower bound
 in light of experience over recent years  policymakers agreed that a number of related issues warranted attention  including topics such as the effectiveness of alternative implementation frameworks in scenarios that could require a return to the zero lower bound     Central Bank

 I think one of the challenges we all face right now  we re still in relatively early stages  particularly in this e commerce space in terms of understanding how that model is evolving and the elements of that model that we need to find to be more productive      Department Store 
Nordstrom says retailers must create good experiences wherever the customers are
 We don t think the customer is loyal to channels  We don t hear customers talk about channels very much  Customers value experiences  and so the more successful we re at in creating a great shopping experience  no matter how they re choosing to shop  I think the better our business will be      Department Store 
But being able to create those experiences in E commerce requires building whole new companies within existing ones
 we have a built talent dense Internet technology company inside of Walt Mart  We are now able to create new experiences for customers across digital and physical      Big Box Retail 
 we have built a very strong team that s very new to the brand but showing really good drive and the whole idea of a larger format and  web as alpha  strategy is almost building new companies within there     Retail 
And it s tough to wear two hats at once  Invest in one area and another one suffers
 And frankly  as a result some retail fundamentals have started to suffer  Specifically in stocks in our stores have been unacceptable so far this year  And our guests deserve better      Big Box Retail 
Companies are struggling to figure out how to create online moats  Private brands are one way   It s extremely competitive to sell national brands 
 I can t minimize the importance of private brands as we strive to be a world class omnichannel retailer  again any retailer that is increasing their penetration on national brands while increasing their percent of online business will have to deal with some very capable  very capital intensive competitors of who are great at price analytics but as we continue to focus on making our sourcing and private brands more efficient  we believe we can become on omnichannel retailer and protect yourself of a profit and from a value standpoint unlike most retailers in our space      Department Store 
Even the supply chain needs to be fundamentally restructured for e commerce
 Retail is changing rapidly today than any time in my career and we need to ensure that core operations keep pace with the new ways we re serving the guests  Overtime Target has developed an incredibly complex supply chain  built to serve an outdated linear model in which product flows from vendors through distribution centers to stores  To serve guests today we are becoming much more flexible in a way we fulfill demand for products and services  And this is stretching our supply chain well beyond its core capabilities      Big Box Retail 
Retailers are touting their existing store base as flexible fulfillment centers
 In addition to the three direct fulfillment centers  we have 2 000 stores that are conveniently located  and we re working on delivery capability from the stores  So we look at the stores to really be the expedited capability to put product in the hands of customers      Home Improvement 
And pushing BOPUS and BOSS
 We had another quarter of strong growth in our digital assets with dotcom sales growing approximately 25   led by online orders picked up in the store through Buy Online  Pick Up In Store  BOPUS  and Buy Online  Ship to Store  BOSS     Home Improvement 
It s a brave new world in retail  but on the other hand there s nothing new under the sun
 From a CapEx stand point we have a tremendous advantage  many retailers that are ramping up into an omnichannel world  they have to make significant capital investments in constructing dot com distribution centers  Because we are former catalogue retailer we already have the supply chain infrastructure in place to leverage      Department Store 
Technology 
The tablet market is under even more pressure than the PC market
 In tech  what I d say about that particular quarter is that there was a more pronounced shift down in the tablet and reader business  that s shifting away at this point Tablets actually are on a pretty tough spiral bind  The trend that we are seeing is that PCs are making a little bit of a comeback and Windows 10 hopefully is helping that  But also the mobility with people going to bigger devices  that s also replacing some of the tablet businesses So looking ahead  we don t expect any help in tablets but we do expect PCs to improve      Office Supplies 
Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  saw weak order trends because customers are reusing their equipment and running at higher utilization rates
 Looking at the market as a whole  we now see 2015 wafer fab equipment spending being approximately flat relative to 2014  with potential downside risk  The most substantial revision to our outlook is foundry spending  where we have lowered our estimates for the remainder of the calendar year  This is primarily due to customers managing excess inventory  improving their yields  and reusing equipment      Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment

Hormel Foods  NYSE HRL  lost 20  of its Turkeys to avian flu
 Jennie O Turkey Store segment profit decreased 45  and sales decreased 12   Results were impacted by high pathogen avian influenza  as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales The bird loss  if you will  ended the system near 20       Meat Packer 
Hormel has re populated its barns  but there s a risk that the flu comes back in the fall
 We are filling up the barns but there clearly is at least a little bit of risk associated with that  We ve heard a similar theory as to perhaps birds go south faster than they come north and they may not linger as long in the areas  and so that might be a positive factor  But I mean  at this point  it s just such a wild card  I mean  this was an unprecedented incident already  We re trying to learn from it  the government s trying to learn from it  It could hit other parts of the country  it could hit another time of the year  it could go away  it could come back in a smaller manner  And so  we re trying to be ready for any contingency  And the best I can tell you right now is we haven t had a system outbreak since early June     Meat Packer 
In order to get product to market more quickly companies need to manufacture closer to home
 I think we have an opportunity to bring product to market much faster than we do today we are trying to accelerate the production by near sourcing  more production capabilities in the Americas     Retail 
Miscellaneous Nuggets of Wisdom 
Part of building trust with your customers is pricing products fairly
 If a product that we sell is available for less out there  then that s the price that the market is at  and we need to be there we think it s just good customer service and part of earning our customers  trust that we have market prices       Department Store 
Operating leverage works both ways
 When you re that short in volume in your plants  that creates all sorts of overhead issues  When you literally don t have products to sell  I mean  you re losing that margin and that volume      Meat Packer 
Listen to your customers
 we spend a lot of time since we brought on our new Chief Marketing Officer Mary Beth West asking customers what they think rather than the leaders of the company sitting around in a conference room deciding what we think the company should be      Department Store 
Study an opportunity carefully for a long time before committing capital
 We are one of the few major U S  retailers to have expanded successfully internationally we go into countries and we build brands and we are constantly increasing our number of vendors in every single country  I think what we have learned prior to going into Germany is to really investigate country for a long period of time before we go in  So  you tread lightly  you are camping  you really understand the mix of the customer  and every single country is very  very different  So  you have to take a long time to study each country before you go in  So  we have lots of learnings  And now we have obviously expanded into many new countries a little bit quicker  but we did a lot of homework before      Off price retail ",2015-08-21,Scott Krisiloff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/company-notes-digest-262462,262462

October was weakest comp and trend has worsened in first half of November
 As noted above  October was the weakest sales comp in the third quarter and this negative trend has worsened into the first half of November  As of quarter to date  this negative trend is consistent across each of our brands and most prevalent in source  
Consumers lack enthusiasm for apparel and accessories because of a lack of newness
 In general  sales of apparel and accessories have been slower  while home intimates  shoes  and beauty have been more robust  I believe our customers current lack of enthusiasm for the apparel and accessories categories  This is primarily due to a lack of fashion newness  We currently have a number of new fashion bright spots in our apparel offering  But whether or not these trends become more mainstream is uncertain  Having been in this situation before  my experience tells me the best course of action is to keep inventories lean  continue to expand and know that new trends will emerge soon 
Getting into the restaurant business 
 This morning we announced an agreement to acquire substantially all of the Vetri Family group of restaurants which includes its award winning Pizzeria Vetri  Most recently Food and Wine Magazine named Pizzeria Vetri the best pizza restaurant in America  
Our analysis is that the lower traffic is because of the lack of newness in fashion
 We have seen lower traffic as I said in my prepared remarks that you could hear them  We ve had lower traffic throughout the quarter and traffic got a little bit worse in October  I think that from our analysis the primary thing driving is a lack of newness in fashion  I think the current fashion look is getting a little long in the tooth and I wouldn t be surprised that we start to see some signs of it changing a little bit more radically than it have let s say over the last four or five years   
We don t think the lack of traffic is a precursor of a recession environment

119060,340575,URBN,Where Are Americans Spending Their Money ,opinion,"Last Friday  the U S  Department of Commerce released its October retail sales figures 
For brick and mortal retailers  the results weren t pretty  Sales grew a paltry 0 1   missing expectations of 0 3  
It seems the prevailing idea that cheap gas would fuel American consumer spending hasn t worked out as economists  and retailers  had hoped  Consequently  investors are selling off retail stocks like crazy 
But here s the thing  Consumers are spending  And with October s report in hand  we know exactly where 
The Biggest Loser
Friday s report confirmed fears that physical retailers are struggling against the Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  machine 
Non store retail sales  online  grew more than 7  from last year  On the other hand  brick and mortar retailers in the clothing  general merchandise  and electronics spaces were the biggest losers 
Urban Outfitters Inc  O URBN   for instance  missed on earnings and revenue for the third consecutive quarter  Already down 30  this year  shares fell another 10  after reporting 
Department stores Nordstrom Inc  N JWN  and Macy s Inc  N M  are also down 42  and 26  this year  respectively  and both companies slashed forecasts last week 
Not even electronics were spared this fall despite early 2015 strength  Best Buy Co  N BBY   which has handled Amazon s onslaught with ease over the last few years  fell in the wake of last week s retail report 
However  there are two clear cut winners in the retail space  and that s where we need to look 
Food for Thought
While Americans may not be shopping  they are eating out  and they re also putting money into their houses 
Darden Restaurants Inc  N DRI  offers a compelling restaurant investment opportunity heading in 2016  The company s brands include Olive Garden  LongHorn Steakhouse  and The Capital Grille 
Over the last four years  the company has grown revenue by 27   It has also doubled net income from last year  On the earnings front  Darden has beaten estimates for five straight quarters and now projects next year s earnings at 13  
Best of all  shares were sold off with the rest of the consumer discretionary sector  which means they re ripe for the picking 
Meanwhile  homebuilders have consistently outperformed this year as the housing market picked up 
In June  home starts hit a seven year high  Inventories are tight  and buyers have rushed into deals for homes this summer before interest rates rise  further fueling recovery  Best of all  the uptrend shows few signs of slowing down 
For investing purposes  the iShares US Home Construction  N ITB  provides broad exposure to the entire homebuilding sector 
Over the last five years  the fund has outperformed the S P 500 by 89   Some of the fund s top 10 holdings include DHI Group Inc  N DHX   Lennar Corp  N LEN   and Home Depot Inc  N HD  
D R  Horton and Home Depot  in particular  delivered stellar earnings reports this week 
From a technical point of view  relative strength is rising since bouncing off a four year support line  and shares have just taken the 50 day moving average 
Right now  shares trade at a discount to their net asset value  which means this is a good chance to get long homebuilders ahead of next year s spring housing rush

Consumer  Healthcare  Natural Resources  and Technology  Based on their choices  below are the 4 top stocks  one from each vertical to pay attention to in 2015  Urban Outfitters Inc  NASDAQ URBN Urban Outfitters is a specialty retailer that owns and operates over 400 locations around the world  across five retail brands  Urban Outfitters  Anthropologie  Free People  Terrain  and BHLDN  While Anthropologie and Free People have consistently performed well over the past year  the company s name brand  Urban Outfitters  has not seen the same positive results In addition  Urban outfitters was the topic of controversy earlier this year when it featured for sale on its website a Kent State University sweatshirt with what seemed to be fake bloodstains  This hurt its public reputation since for many customers the product elicited instant associations with the tragic Kent State shootings of 1970  Urban Outfitters denied it had intentionally referenced the shootings and immediately took the sweater off its site in response to the public backlash Since then  Urban Outfitters has been diligently working to improve its in store sales  with retail sales growing by 0 7  in November over the year ago period  Brean Capital s  sees the potential in Urban Outfitters  strategy  giving the stock a Buy rating with a  40 price target  She believes Urban Outfitters  is a quintessential example of a  Best of Breed  retailer given its diversified  omni channel platform  its ability to understand and connect with customers on an emotional level and its global growth potential   She says   Whilst merchandise execution issues at Urban Outfitters brand have adversely affected recent results  based on our recent channel checks  and considering this management team s track record of  righting the ship   we remain confident that a turn is underway  Pierce has rated Urban Outfitters 7 times since March 2009  earning a 71  success rate recommending the stock and a  38 5  average

renal disease  iron deficiency  and chronic kidney disease  Earlier this year  the FDA recommended that the Phase 3 Triferic  a treatment that replaces iron that is lost during every dialysis treatment for people with kidney disease  supports a positive benefit risk to treat iron loss Despite the positive vote  Brean Capital s  gave Rockwell Medican a Sell rating with a  4 price target  reasoning  Even if Triferic could eliminate the need for IV iron  we believe it would still fail to improve dialysis center economics  and dialysis centers have already shown that their choice of drugs under bundled reimbursement is in part driven by economics and Triferic has no clinical benefit over SOC  Aschoff has rated Rockwell Medical 5 since in the last year  earning a 100  success rate

subsidiaries  acquired Hardin County Water Company on December 1st of this year  a company that only serves 500 customers Brean Capital s  gave American Water Works a Buy rating with a  62 price target  explaining  American Water Works has executed well on earnings growth through acquisitions  improved efficiency  and expansion of market based services  all of which strengthen our investment thesis   He continued   Now that rate case activity has slowed  AWK can recoup investment through surcharge mechanisms  Gaugler has rated American Water Works 3 other times since 2013  earning a 100

the next few quarters Brean Capital s  gave Seagate a Buy rating with an  83 price target  noting  Our broader bullish framework is driven by  1  EV FCF valuation  and 2  potential for L T Industry Gross Margin expansion  at least 100 200 bps over the next few years from both favorable mix and Cap U increases  and perhaps 400 500 bps during the next 5 7 years    In addition  the analyst notes

119095,340610,URBN,2014 Holiday Season  Did Retailers Hear The Jingle Of Cash ,opinion,"The retail battle is at its peak during the holiday season with offers and promotions flooding the markets  This time  too  retailers swept buyers off their feet with early hour store openings  huge discounts  promotional strategies and free shipping on online purchases 

The cash registers jingled  with holiday sales increased 4 6   faring better than the expected 3 8   going by the ShopperTrak complied data  First Data also revealed that retail spending grew 3 2  this season compared with a 0 5  gain witnessed in 2013 

With a rebounding economy  falling unemployment rate and gasoline prices  higher consumer confidence and improving consumer spending  the retail space was charged up with optimism and sellers did their best to tap consumers  boosted buying power 

This prompted eye popping discounts for the season quite early  targeting consumers with exclusive deals both online and in stores  The move turned out to be bonanza for most retailers with November and December registering comparable store sales increase of 5 2  and 5   respectively  according to Retail Metrics 

Favorable economic numbers such as GDP growth rate of 5  and a 3 2  increase in consumer spending in the third quarter of 2014  plus the lowest unemployment rate of 5 6  in six years set the stage for a cheerful holiday season  The bullishness in the economy drove the consumer sentiment index higher that reached its pinnacle in December to 93 6  according to University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters 

Competition was cutthroat and pricing remained aggressive  Yet  retailers had all the support of consumers  and their higher disposable income  Retailers such as JC Penney Company Inc Holding  NYSE JCP   Macy s Inc  NYSE M   Gap Inc  NYSE GPS and Pacific Sunwear of California Inc  NASDAQ PSUN  all came up with decent results 

J  C  Penney delivered impressive comparable store sales  comps  of up 3 7  for the combined November and December period  Gap s comps increased 3   while net sales rose 4   Macy s reported that comps  on an owned plus licensed basis  grew 2 7  for the period  while Pacific Sunwear of California registered 9  growth in comps for December 

Urban Outfitters Inc stated that sales for the months of November and December surged 10  on the back of an impressive performance by the Free People and Anthropologie brands  Sports related teen apparel seller Zumiez Inc  NASDAQ ZUMZ  too had an outstanding holiday season with 6 3  comps growth in November  followed by an 8  increase in December 

However  there were some retailers for which there was no holiday mojo  Toys R Us saw its total comparable store sales declining 2 7  and domestic outlets falling 5  during the period  Tiffany   Co too lacked shine with sales down 1  against growth of 4  last holidays 

It is apparent that the holidays turned rewarding for most retailers going all out to lure buyers  Of course  markdowns and promotions reflected on sales but will retailers  margins now pay a price  We also wonder what impact these might even have on the bottom line 

Well  we ll have to wait for the quarterly numbers for a clearer picture ",2015-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2014-holiday-season:-did-retailers-hear-the-jingle-of-cash-238504,238504
119096,340611,URBN,Stock To Watch  Urban Outfitters Outperforms Q4 Amidst Controversy,opinion,"By Carly ForsterUrban Outfitters  NASDAQ    shares rose 7  in after hours trading on Monday  February 9th following the company s impressive revenue and same store sale results for the fourth quarter ending January 31st  This revenue was a direct result of strong holiday sales  However  the sales were mostly from the Anthropologie and Free People divisions which consistently performed well over the past year  while the Urban Outfitters brand and stores have not seen the same positive results Highlights from the report include  1 01 billion in revenue  marking a 12  increase on a year over year basis  For the full year ending January 31  2015  sales rose 8  to  3 32 billion  The company s Wholesale segment net sales also increased by 27  Richard A  Hayne  Chief Executive Officer said of the results 

I am pleased to announce record URBN sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 driven by positive comps at each of our brands with the direct to consumer channel continuing to outpace store sales Although promotional activity was higher than planned  we are entering the spring selling season in a clean inventory position  and we are encouraged by the steady progress the Urban Outfitters brand is making in re engaging its core customer 

However  Urban Outfitters once again become the subject of controversy on February 10th  offering gray striped tapestries with a pink triangle that many believe are reminiscent of uniforms gay male prisoners wore in Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust  This is not the first time Urban Outfitters has faced scrutiny for selling something consumers found offensive  In September of last year  the retailer featured a Kent State University sweatshirt with what seemed to be fake bloodstains for sale on its website  which for many elicited instant associations with the tragic Kent State massacre of 1970  In 2012  Urban Outfitters was scrutinized for selling a T shirt with what appeared to be a Star of David printed on the chest On February 10th  Brean Capital analyst  weighed in on Urban Outfitters following the company s Q4 results  reiterating a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of  42  The analyst noted 

In our opinion  Q4 comp sales results  which accelerated over the 2 month combined Holiday period  demonstrates the power of the URBN brands and that the Urban Outfitters  UO  brand has not lost its relevance with its target customer 

Elizabeth Pierce has rated Urban Outfitters 13 times since March 2009  earning a 73  success rate recommending the stock and a  38 7  average return per recommendation  Overall  Pierce has a 57  success rate recommending stocks and a  11 9  average return per recommendation Similarly on February 10th  Wunderlich analyst  reiterated a Buy rating on Urban Outfitters with a  42 price target  He reasoned   While somewhat discount driven  we view the  6  4Q same store sales  with all divisions comping positive  as a key positive  positioning Urban Outfitters to begin to regain momentum and move back to its rightful price as a premium multiple investment vehicle for specialty retail investors  Eric Beder has rated Urban Outfitters 15 times since December 2010  earning a 50  success rate recommending the company and a  6 3  average loss per recommendation  Overall  Beder has a 52  success rate recommending stocks and a  5 7  average return per recommendation On average  the top analyst consensus for Urban Outfitters on is Hold ",2015-02-11,Carly Forster,https://www.investing.com/analysis/urban-outfitters-outperforms-q4-amidst-offensive-tapestry-controversy-241628,241628

119099,340614,URBN,Is Urban Outfitters About To Turn The Corner On Its PR Nightmare ,opinion,"Six months ago Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN  missed the Estimize earnings consensus for the third quarter in a row  The retailer was marred by controversy after showing several highly distasteful products including a Kent State sweatshirt which appeared to be covered with a blood splatter 
Heading into last quarter s earnings report contributors on Estimize expected Urban Outfitters to miss the Wall Street revenue consensus  It s unusual for Estimize contributors to forecast sales below the Wall Street consensus but it does happen from time to time  Statistically speaking when the  consensus is lower than Wall Street s  Estimize tends to be the more accurate of the two at a higher rate than normal 

Urban Outfitters proved the crowd at Estimize wrong  putting its PR disasters behind it and reporting a pretty solid quarter  Earnings came in at   a 2  increase year over year  Revenue clocked in at  1 01 billion marking a 12  gain 
Last quarter Urban Outfitters finally showed signs of life  Sales in the flagship stores improved 10 1  compared to one year prior  But the bulk of the company s growth last year didn t come from its flagship stores 
In the 12 month period ending January 31  Urban Outfitters stores only increased sales 1 2   Meanwhile sales at the company s other brands Anthropologie Group and Free People were up 8 1  and 27 5  respectively  Revenues from Anthropologie Group and Free People combined made up 57 6  of Urban Outfitters s total sales last year 

Urban Outfitters stores may be turning the corner on their chain of PR mishaps  Even still investors  expectations for the current quarter remain muted  Urban Outfitters will report first quarter earnings Monday  May 18 after the closing bell  Contributing analysts on Estimize expect a report that s just in line with Wall Street s revenue consensus and  ",2015-05-15,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-urban-outfitters-about-to-turn-the-corner-on-its-pr-nightmare-251853,251853

Wal Mart also recently announced it is in the midst of testing an online service similar to Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Prime  With that said  investors will be looking to see how the company s online sales performed in the first quarter as they only rose 22  in the same quarter last year  compared to 30  the year before

Inuit has been putting all of its efforts into its transition into the cloud  which is expected to be a key growth driver in the company s near term  By 2019  the company s global cloud applications market is expected to reach  66 44 billion  compared to  30 43 billion in 2014

119102,340617,URBN,Company Notes Digest 5 22 15,opinion,"Each week I read dozens of transcripts from earnings calls and presentations as part of my investment process  Below is a weekly post which contains some of the most important quotes about the economy and industry trends from those transcripts  

The Macro Outlook 

All things considered  the consumer is still more optimistic than not

 We are encouraged by the results of our first quarter consumer sentiment survey where we continue to see homeowners  views around personal finances and home values improved  According to the survey  homeowners are shifting more of their spending to home improvement  As a result  their intentions to begin a home improvement project in the next six months were the highest in six years and these planned projects are now almost evenly split between discretionary and non discretionary      Retail 

People were geared up for holidays  which is usually a good sign for consumer sentiment

 Seasonal energy was high throughout the quarter  beginning with Valentine s Day  In addition to party essentials  our stores were well stocked with cards  gifts  gift bags  balloons and candy for that special purpose or that special person  Seasonal sell through was good and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned the St  Patrick s Day and Easter     Retail 

Home Depot  NYSE HD  saw strength in high ticket items

 I would say that we re seeing really strength across many departments  water heaters  appliances  our tools  riding mowers  walks  all of our outdoor garden categories  grills  et cetera had just a terrific quarter and those wouldn t be Pro focused items      Retail 

Dentists are feeling confident enough to invest in remodeling their offices

 I would say we re starting to see signs of life in terms of the new office construction  We ve always been very consistent talking about  as the dentists gets busier and is more confident about their book of business and their practice  is when they re more likely to start making more major investments in physical plans in terms of new office builds or remodels      Dental Supplies 

The early reads are that May is off to a strong start

 I will tell you that it s early on in the first quarter  So it s hard to declare a victory right now  but we feel like we started off where we needed to start      Retail 

 May is off to a very strong start  That being said  we believe   it s hard to tell whether that is going to be more a result of the shift in marketing or the acceptance of the product offer      Retail 

Retail sales in March April may have been affected by an Easter shift

 In particular  a calendar shift with Easter falling two weeks earlier this year  we estimate the impact of the holiday calendar shift was a negative  8 million to sales     Retail 

Despite optimism  retailers  results haven t been all that great

 we think the macroeconomic and retail outlook remains pretty uncertain  You see that and you get a sense of that in the recent results that have been announced by other retailers     Retail 

Red flag  off priced retailers noted that there is lots of unsold retail inventory  Some of that is because of the ports  some of it could be because the environment is weak

 the availability of goods in the market has been significant  Some of that could be a ramification of business around the environment not being as strong      Retail 

  Between the port dislocation and mixed sales results in Q1  there was a lot of availability  So  we feel very good about the packaway that we have  it s branded products at really great values that our customers expect     Retail 

PC OEMs have been selling down excess inventory for months already  They may be closer to the end than the beginning

 The PC OEMs themselves have become very conservative starting back in January  February  They ve been lowering inventory That channel probably had four to six weeks of inventory  today that s probably three to four that reduction of inventory will stop  And that will feel like it s been an immediate demand reversal it s sooner rather than later  I don t get paid as much as you did to predict the exact date  So I m going to let you kind of keep doing that but it is sooner than later      Tech components 

The good news is that the port issues are almost cleaned up

 The good news is that we are reasonably caught up in the DCs  the merchandised floor of our imports coming through the west coast is more normalized Best news about the port slowdown is we re pretty much past it      Retail 

Commodity markets are trying to deal with excesses of their own

The mining industry is still deteriorating

 When we take a look at mining and we take the inputs from our customer  it s clear across our customer base that mining is taking another step down after multiple years of decline  We had previously had and guided our first fit portion of that business to be down 10   We ve now taken that down to 15  to 20  within our model  So mining  globally  is really creating more headwind than we had originally predicted      Industrial Components 

Wal mart battled the headwind of deflation in food

 One key headwind we faced in grocery during the first quarter was moderating inflation in meat  and deflation in both dairy and produce      Retail 

Weakness in energy markets led to cautious buying by Precision Castparts  NYSE PCP   customers

 We had sharp declines in volume  price and mix  All three in the same quarter  and this was related to our customers  very cautious buying due to their uncertainties and their outlook and demand  As you would expect  in response to these dynamic we address not only today s tough market conditions  but a cautious future outlook     Metal Components Manufacturer 

There are examples of tight capacity too though

Freight costs are rising because trucking capacity was removed by the recession

 we do expect freight costs to be a headwind as we go through the year  And it s not only the driver piece of it  but it s also the fact that as we went through the economic down cycle  there are many less firms out there today  trucking firms and so the competition has gotten less in some respects      Retail 

Ross Stores is planning for wages to keep rising as labor markets have tightened

 As we ve said before  though  we expect wage rates are going to move up over the next few years  I think you re seeing that in the press almost every day  So it s certainly something that we expect that we re going to be talking more about as we get into our budget for 2016 and our longer term plans and certainly when we talk about our earnings guidance next February  my guess it will be part of that discussion too      Retail 

International 

Currency movements had a real impact on demand for HP s products

 the currency movements and the associated re pricing impacted demand      Enterprise Technology 

Trade agreements usually have unintended consequences  The Transpacific Partnership is unlikely to be an exception

 While global trade agreements have typically increased the interdependencies of global economies  they have also created their share of  unintended consequences   So  those unintended impacts  must also be factored into everyone s perceptions of what the TPP will mean  again assuming it s ever enacted and implemented      Freight forwarding 

Financials 

Fannie and Freddie are working directly with smaller lenders now

 they have democratized the way they do business with small lenders  so another reason for us losing shares that there are some correspondence who would have come to us we would have accumulated loans and then gone to the agencies and those smaller originators go straight to the agencies themselves      Bank 

Many companies have had difficulty closing M A transactions

 this is an extremely large and complex transaction  involving more than 13 000 retail store locations  It is the largest of any previous retail merger  Needless to say  this process has taken longer than any of us anticipated  We re continuing to work very hard to close the transaction as soon as possible and our current expectation is that we can have this transaction completed in early July      Retail 

Consumer 

Retailers are seeing enough success in e commerce that they are slowing the number of stores that they are opening

 we are accelerating our investments in virtual capabilities  we are slowing the number of new retail stores we open in the North American market      Retail 

Customers are browsing in store and shopping online

 we really believe in building that one on one connection in our stores and using our stores for that really high touch service often   they go to the store  they visit the store and then they go online and make a purchase     Retail 

The line is blurring between brand advertisers and direct response

 there has been this distinction and we ve made this distinction as we talk about our business between direct response and brand  The reality is those lines are blurring  If you think about Coca Cola  Proctor and Gamble  Unilever  LONDON ULVR   Nestle  any of the largest marketers that you would think of as brand  they of course care about their brand affinity and how consumers are going to have a preference for their product versus someone else s  but they also very much care about driving growth and driving sales      Internet Media 

We ve been living in the golden age of television  SK Note  Did Mad Men mark the start and finish  

 I think we re like in the golden age of TV  There is more high quality TV shows available now than at any other time in the history of the industry  I think last year alone  there were over 200 original scripted prime time series  I mean there s almost more TV than any human could ever watch      Media Conglomerate 

AT T  NYSE T  assumed that pay TV would decline when it purchased DirecTV

 as we were evaluating DIRECTV  NASDAQ DTV   and obviously we modeled it nine ways to Sunday and as we evaluated we made the basic assumption that over the top would continue to develop  And that you would see not only cord cutters but cord nevers     Telecom 

AT T is fairly confident that the FCC s decision to regulate broadband as a utility will not stand

 As we have evaluated the FCC s order on Title II  we actually are   we actually have a certain degree of conviction that these will not be the rules of the land in the long term      Telecom 

Technology 

The markets for tech hardware have been quite weak

 Business technology  computers and mobility drove the entire 5  same store sales decline in North America  clearly tech was the big drag for the quarter  and primarily within tech  it was PCs and tablets      Office Supplies 

PC demand has been even worse than expected

 I think  we have gone through a little bit worse than expected PC demand period that has reset I believe everybody s expectations as the industry for the year to where the unit growth in PCs     Office supplies 

There is a school of thought that the computer scientists  software  have won out over electrical engineers  hardware 

 what we have discovered is there was a bit of an oscillation where people believed that the whole world would be driven by purely software and they   this was the computer scientists winning as opposed to the electrical engineers      Storage hardware 

Hardware is still important though  Even commodities have value 

 But then people started to realize that in order to deliver performance  capacity  et cetera  hardware would still be important there is commoditization of hardware but commoditization does not mean no value  it just means that it is now a commodity and a commodity is something that s fungible      Storage hardware 

The tech community has so much respect for Uber that  uberize  is now a verb meaning  to disrupt 

 we ve seen is people start to challenge business models through the use of software and innovation some people call it the uberization of pretty much every industry      Storage hardware 

 I think people have this notion in their head that there is an uberizing application that they potentially can hunt out for their business that gives them distinct client value and therefore growth opportunities      Storage hardware 

Materials  Industrials  Energy 

There are still no signs that energy weakness is affecting the Texas economy

 We have 178 stores in the State of Texas  We ve seen no visible impact whatsoever in that State at this point     Retail 

 we didn t see any correlation between what you just referred to  changes in the oil and gas industry  and an influence on our comps      Retail 

The airfreight industry was a relatively un noticed loser as technology shifted to smaller and more integrated devices

 The airfreight markets in particular and the freight markets in general became a very visible example of what ripple on effects subsidiary industries can experience when the dominant industry they support fall victim to Harvard Business professor Clayton Christensen s disruption theories  While the size of the computers started to shrink  other products  enabled by the intense R D the tech market was driving  began to show up in alternative devices such as the smartphones and smaller and thinner tablets     Freight Forwarding 

Miscellaneous Nuggets of Wisdom 

There are more stakeholders in a business than just shareholders

 we will manage this business with a focus on what is best for our stakeholders  including our customers  our vendor partners  our associates and importantly  our long term shareholders      Retail 

One of Silicon Valley s great advantages is that they have shareholders who don t seem to care about quarterly returns on capital

 revenue is one of the easiest things to find in the tech industry and profit is one of the hardest if you are one of those companies that is given extraordinary market valuations without necessarily having to deliver profit I am sure I would be sitting there smiling  going this is a great Some of us have to deliver return on invested capital every quarter      Enterprise Technology 

People tend to believe that new technologies will completely supplant old ones  but technology infrastructure is no different than any city s infrastructure  The old exists beside the new 

 I think that there is a certain infatuation with every wave that comes long  For those that have been around long enough  they can think of the dialog  the rhetoric and the discussions that occurred with every perceived technology wave that somehow rather the new would eliminate the old  And  yet  that hasn t really been the case  Infrastructure is like a city  whether it s Boston or New York or whatever your favorite city is  You see change and change to the skyline  You see improvement  But you also see a lot of things that are as they were  They haven t changed  Maybe they have gotten a little new coat of paint and some renovation  Certainly the subway cars in New York City today are air conditioned  I remember when they were not air conditioned  And so those kinds of things happen  So the old doesn t entirely disappear      Enterprise Technology

119126,340641,URBN,Urban Outfitters  What to Expect in its Q3,opinion,Urban Outfitters Inc  NASDAQ URBN   is a Philadelphia  Pennsylvania based American specialty retail company that owns and operates over 400 locations around the world across five retail brands  Urban Outfitters  Anthropologie  Free People  Terrain  and BHLDN  The retailer is scheduled to release its fiscal third quarter earnings report on Monday  November 17th after market close The company is expected to post  0 42 earnings per share  During the same quarter last year  Urban s EPS was  0 47  a decrease of 11  year over year Urban Outfitters has said that its same store sales have continued to decrease from September into October  As a result of lower than expected sales  management anticipates gross profit margin to remain under pressure in the quarter  possibly deleveraging at a higher rate than the first half of the fiscal year  Management indicated that this will ultimately have a negative impact on the company s third quarter earnings per share Foot traffic in the U S has consistently been declining over the past couple of years due to consumers  preference to online shopping  This has had a negative impact on stores like Urban Outfitters who rely on same store sales for the majority of their revenue  Despite a major increase in online sales  Urban Outfitters most likely will see a decrease in revenue due to lower foot traffic  As Urban Outfitters  plans to give an update on its third quarter results  it seems that the instability in its mainline brand has progressed despite its plans to offer fewer discounts in the third quarter  Although strong growth in Anthropologie and Free People have outweighed the significant fall at Urban Outfitters during the past few quarters  the decline may be too strong this time around Urban outfitters was the topic of controversy last month that hurt its public reputation when it featured a Kent State University sweatshirt with what seemed to be fake bloodstains for sale on its website  which for many elicited instant associations with the tragic Kent State massacre of 1970  Urban Outfitters denied it had intentionally referenced the shootings and immediately took the sweater off its website after the public backlash Will Urban Outfitters have another disappointing quarter  or will it surprise investors with a positive outcome On average  the top analyst consensus for Urban Outfitters is,2014-11-16,Uri Gruenbaum,https://www.investing.com/analysis/urban-outfitters:-what-to-expect-in-its-q3-232639,232639
119127,340642,URBN,Retail Pulse  Hackers  USD Strength And Offensive Merchandise,opinion,"After Monday s closing bell  Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN  showed they are still struggling to attract shoppers at its namesake stores  Earnings per share for the third quarter came in at a lousy  0 35   0 10 lower than the Estimize consensus  showing a decline of 26  YoY  Record revenues for the quarter also slightly missed the consensus  reporting  814 5M vs  expectations for  823 3M  Growth at two of the retailer s brands helped to offset some of the weakness  with same store sales increasing 15  at Free People and 2  at Anthropologie  but falling 7  at Urban Outfitters  The poor showing came as a result of lower initial merchandise markup followed by higher markdowns  recent criticism regarding offensive merchandise could partially be to blame  Despite the disappointing results  CEO is Richard Hayne is encouraged by  positive signs as shown by strong results at the brand s direct to consumer channel   The direct to consumer business typically includes internet and catalog sales

Despite a large data breach experienced during the third quarter  Home Depot was still able to put up decent results due to strength across all geographies   The home improvement retailer reported Q3 EPS of  1 15 meeting the Estimize consensus and showing YoY profit growth of 21   Revenues of  20 52B beat expectations of  20 47B and grew 5  from the year ago quarter  while same store sales increased 5 2   With that said  the company is still trying to determine the total cost of the consumer data breach  Pre tax expenses for the quarter totaled  28M  and the company estimates that total breach related costs could be as high as  34M and will negatively impact fourth quarter results  Home Depot reaffirmed its 2014 EPS guidance of approximately  4 54 a share  with sales expected to grow about 4 8 for the year

119154,340669,URBN,What The Buy Side Expects From Urban Outfitters,opinion,"Urban Outfitters Inc   NASDAQ URBN   is set to report FQ1 2015 earnings after the market closes on Monday  May 19th   Urban Outfitters owns and operates a chain of retail clothing stores  This quarter Wall Street is expecting the clothing company to post earnings 5c per share lower than FQ1 of last year and for year over revenue to grow by 6   Urban Outfitters has posted growing earnings and revenue in each quarter over the previous 2 years but is expected to buck that trend Monday afternoon  Here s what investors are expecting from Urban Outfitters 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Urban Outfitters to report 27c EPS and  688 27M revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 14 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 30c EPS and  697 87M in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Urban Outfitters to edge past the Wall Street consensus by a comfortable margin 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Urban Outfitters s EPS and revenue 3 and 4 times respectively  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing a larger than usual differential between the earnings expectations from Wall Street and Estimize 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 26c to 34c per share and from  672 00M to  715 00M in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a moderate range of estimates on Urban Outfitters 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Throughout the quarter the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from a high of 34c to 27c while the Estimize consensus started and ended the period at 30c  Meanwhile Wall Street reduced its revenue consensus from  713 32M to  688 27M while the Estimize consensus rose late in the period from a low of  694 34M to  697 87M   Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and the directionality of analyst revisions going into an earnings report is often a leading indicator  Here we see diverging revenue expectations between Wall Street and the Estimize community 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects 28c EPS and  696 09B in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked 2nd overall among over 4 450 contributing analysts  This season turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 60  and 51  of the time respectively throughout a staggering 1 063 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity expects Urban Outfitters to beat Wall Street s expectations but fail to live up to the consensus from the Estimize community 
On Monday Urban Outfitters is expected to report its first year over year decline in earnings in the past 2 years  With that being said  contributing analysts on the Estimize community are looking for the clothing retailer s earnings to come in 3c per share higher than the Wall Street consensus and for revenue to exceed the Street s forecast by nearly  10 million
