122623,344138,PDCO,U S  pet doctors steel themselves for online pharmacy challenge,news,"By Manas Mishra and Tamara Mathias  Reuters    A David and Goliath battle is brewing in the business of selling prescription medicines for pets  pitching veterinarians against online giants moving into this lucrative corner of the growing market for animal supplies  Americans spent  72 56 billion last year on their pets  according to American Pet Products Association  Prescription drugs were expected to account for over  10 billion  according to an estimate  from the Federal Trade Commission  and overall pet product sales are expected to keep growing by 4  a year   Graphic   With deep discounts and online convenience  Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc  soon to be listed Chewy com and Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  Inc s Wag brand have effectively conquered the market for pet food  care products and other supplies  but until now veterinary practices  which both prescribe and sell drugs  have been a major source of prescription medication  While Amazon so far has shown no interest in that market  Chewy s and Walmart s forays into the online pet pharmacy business threaten to change that  prompting veterinary clinics to seek help in defending their turf  Enter Covetrus Inc  Vet Source  which partners with  Patterson Companies Inc   NASDAQ PDCO   and others that offer tools to help vets manage their practices and give customers the convenience they have come to expect from online shopping    We started to realize this is what our clients want   said Stephanie Foster  practice manager at Kings Veterinary Hospital in Loveland  Ohio   They want to be able to order things at 11 o  clock at night  They re used to the Amazon mentality    Foster says she began using Covetrus to order drugs and supplies for the practice after it began losing sales of pet food and other products to online retailers  Now  her hospital has a website run by Covetrus under the practice s name that effectively acts as its online pharmacy  With that comes software that helps the clinic manage its inventory and track prescriptions  so Foster knows when clients need a refill and for those Covetrus collects a service fee that is a percentage of sales  Foster said partnering with Covetrus has helped boost overall sales by half over the past three years because it gives clients online convenience  timely reminders and  despite the fees  competitive prices    Covetrus now has more leverage with the manufacturers than I will ever have as a small business   she said   They re able to get the manufacturers to agree to instant rebates and they can do flash sales on products and things that we just can t compete with    The company  formed by the combination of medical supply firm Henry Schein s animal health unit and Vet s First Choice and listed in February  represents some 100 000 veterinary practices globally  In the United States  27 000 use some form of its services with over 8 000   about a quarter of the market   signed up for prescription management  Covetrus says  HOME TURF ADVANTAGE  PetSmart Inc backed Chewy com  whose sales soared from  26 million to  3 5 billion between 2012 and 2018  said in a filing ahead of its New York Stock Exchange debut this month it planned to expand its online pharmacy business launched last year  The company has yet to update on the pharmacy s performance and it would not comment for this article  citing the silent period ahead of its stock exchange debut  Walmart joined the fray last month when it launched its online pet pharmacy WalmartPetRx com and said it aimed to operate 100 in store animal clinics by the end of the year   Analysts say  however  the prescription pet medicine business could prove more challenging than other pet products  Those who want to buy medication online still need a prescription from a vet and must either email or upload a copy or have the online retailer contact the practice first  That  analysts say  offers the practices a chance to sell the first batch on site and then direct customers to their own online service   Kristen Cook  a practice manager at the Belton Veterinary Clinic in Belton  Texas  says their doctors have no obligation to write a prescription for those shopping elsewhere and the clinic s policy is to handle prescriptions internally   It s not something like I am handing them a piece of paper to take it wherever they want to take it   Cook said  The stakes are high  Cook said that at least half of the clinic s revenue comes from prescription drug sales  Nationally  pharmacy sales on average make up about a third of a practice s revenue  according to Gary Glassman  partner at accounting and financial services firm Burzenski   Company  which serves veterinary practices across the country  The American Veterinary Medical Association  AVMA  says  however  that 40 states have already adopted laws  regulations or guidelines that specifically or implicitly require veterinarians to provide a written prescription upon request in some circumstances   To see the summary report from AVMA  please click here   This means pet owners could fill those prescriptions with Chewy or other online providers  and the market is just too attractive to e commerce players for the vets and their partners to get complacent  analysts say   According to a 2018 TD Ameritrade online survey of U S  millennial pet owners  they were willing to spend up to  2 000 on average if their pet got sick  with dog owners prepared to spend more on their pets than what they expected to spend on their own healthcare  
 People are treating their pets more like people   William Blair analyst John Kreger said   Historically     you d frankly euthanize the pet when they started to have some of these chronic conditions  That s just not happening now  ",2019-06-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-pet-doctors-steel-themselves-for-online-pharmacy-challenge-1895995,1895995

122626,344141,PDCO,PDCO Or WST  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical   Dental Supplies stocks have likely encountered both Patterson Cos   PDCO  and West Pharmaceutical Services  WST   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Both Patterson Cos  and West Pharmaceutical Services have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
PDCO currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 26  while WST has a forward P E of 43 84  We also note that PDCO has a PEG ratio of 2 40  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  WST currently has a PEG ratio of 3 13

122627,344142,PDCO,Can Value Investors Consider Patterson Companies  PDCO  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Patterson Companies  Inc    NASDAQ PDCO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Patterson Companies has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 56  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 62  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Patterson Companies  current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint of 17 15 over the past five years The stock s PE however compares quite favorably with the Medical Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 05  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile Patterson Companies has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 44  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  so it is fair to say that a more value oriented path is ahead of the stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Patterson Companies has a P S ratio of just 0 39  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 56x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Patterson Companies currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Patterson Companies a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Patterson Companies might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives PDCO a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  While the current quarter estimate has seen one upward and two downward movements  the current year estimate has seen eight upward and no downward movements over the past two months This has had a positive effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus has decreased 2 6  over the past two months  the current year estimate has climbed 2 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Patterson Companies  Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite such mixed analyst sentiments  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and it is the reason why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePatterson Companies is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Besides a strong industry rank  among Top 44  of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  2 instils investors  optimism in the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unfavorable past industry performance and mixed analyst sentiments  a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Patterson Companies Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Patterson Cos 
For Patterson Cos The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Patterson Cos  Will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Patterson Cos  Would post earnings of  0 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 39  delivering a surprise of  8 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

122792,344307,PDCO,Earnings Preview  Patterson Cos   PDCO  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Patterson Cos   PDCO  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 29  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical supplies maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 36 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  29 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 41 billion  up 1 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 6  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Patterson Cos 
For Patterson Cos The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Patterson Cos  Will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Patterson Cos  Would post earnings of  0 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 26  delivering a surprise of  25 71  
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

122794,344309,PDCO,Should Value Investors Pick Patterson Companies  PDCO  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Patterson Companies  Inc    NASDAQ PDCO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Patterson Companies has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 9  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Patterson Companies  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that Patterson Companies has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 17 4  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Patterson Companies has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  PDCO is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Patterson Companies currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Patterson Companies a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 7  which is far better than the industry average of 18 8  Clearly  PDCO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Patterson Companies might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A  This gives PDCO a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending lower  The current fiscal quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen zero upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has inched lower by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Patterson Companies  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePatterson Companies is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 37  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past three years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Medical Stocks to Buy NowThe greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating revenue  and cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in the pipeline So are big potential profits for early investors

122912,344427,PDCO,Opening Bell  Cyber Monday  Oil  NFP To Drive Markets This Week,opinion,"by Eli Wright
Global equity markets continue to rally and have been remarkably upbeat recently  with U S markets particularly buoyant since the US election  US markets closed the holiday shortened week last week on thin volume but at all time highs 
The S P 500 Consumer Staples in particular helped boost the market  it gained 0 8  on Black Friday  Bricks and mortar sales declined 10 4  from last year  However  online sales boomed  increasing by a whopping 21 6   It s likely that as Cyber Monday kicks off  e tail could see another big jump  The National Retail Federation expects total holiday season sales to grow by 3 6  this year  to  655 8 billion 
This coming week also features a variety of market moving economic announcements that will surely affect US markets  Tuesday s US Q3 GDP update  Wednesday s monthly Pending Home Sales report and Friday s big event  monthly Nonfarm Payrolls 
Perhaps most important  all eyes will be on Vienna this Wednesday in anticipation of OPEC s ability or lack thereof to finally come to some consensus on an oil production freeze deal between member and non OPEC producers 
There might also be an additional  market moving wild card  will the push for vote recounts in several swing states orchestrated by Jill Stein  but aided by the Clinton campaign team  upset the equilibrium  As of this writing  only Wisconsin has opened recount proceedings  but there have been requests for additional recounts this week in Michigan and Pennsylvania 
In Asia overnight  the Nikkei edged 0 13  lower  closing at 18 356 89  The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0 43   closing at 3 275 94  It s headed towards a   the largest such rally for the beleaguered index this year  The Hang Seng rose 0 45   to 22 826  Fears that an OPEC output deal might not materialize at this week s Vienna meeting weighed on markets 
In Europe markets opened lower  the DAX is currently down 1 03  to 10 592  the FTSE is down 0 93  to 6 776 90 and the Stoxx 50 is down 0 86  at 3 020 50 
Though trading was thin last Friday in the United States  Wall Street still finished the week at record highs once again  The Dow gained  0 36   to close at 19 152 14  the NASDAQ increased 0 34  to 5 398 92  the S P 500 moved up by 0 39   to 2 213 35  For the week  all three majors gained approximately 1 5   Small caps also gained  as the Russell 2000 added 0 37  to hit a new record close of 1 348 47  The VIX is currently at 12 34 
Wall Street is set to open a tad lower today  as the S P  NASDAQ  and Dow are all down in pre market trading  0 42   0 34   and 0 4   respectively 
The U S  bond sell off seems to have paused  with yields down across the board  the 2 year Treasury yield is now 1 111   the 10 year yield is 2 329   and the 30 year yield is down to 2 988  
Additional economic events that could have an impact on markets this week include 
On Tuesday  CB Consumer Confidence is forecast at 101 2 
On Wednesday  the ADP National Employment Report is expecting to show 165K new jobs 
On Thursday  the ISM Manufacturing PMI has an expected reading of 52 2 
Forex
After a three week rally  the US dollar encountered some resistance on Friday  falling 0 28   to 101  but it doesn t look like it s time to sell just yet  If the dollar does drop  the retracement is likely to be brief and shallow  and may provide a good entry point for additional gains 
ECB President Mario Draghi will speak later today and his pro QE stance  combined with Italy s uncertainty in the face of the December 4 referendum on the country s Senate reform  could push the EUR USD yet lower  Eurozone CPI  German Manufacturing PMI and German employment numbers are all scheduled for release this week which could also drive the euro s trajectory 
Sterling  meanwhile  appears to be on course for its strongest month in over seven years  While trading relatively flat against the USD  the Pound Sterling Index has gained more than 5  in the past 30 days  However  if Theresa May triggers Article 50 during March 2017  in order to begin the Brexit  the cable could plummet  Some Deutsche Bank analysts see sterling  by the end of next year 
The Aussie  kiwi  and loonie all moved higher versus the greenback  as investors pulled out of their dollar positions following the recent USD surge 
Commodities
Oil prices haven t waited for the close of this week s OPEC meeting in Vienna before falling  Two of the largest oil producers  Iran and Iraq  want deal exemptions  while Russia has agreed to freeze production  at current levels    which is approximately half of what OPEC wants  A production cap at current levels would mean Russia is pumping 200 000 300 000 bpd less than planned in 2017  However  OPEC wants to curb output by 500 000 bpd  Saudi Arabia has  with Russia ahead of the Vienna meetings  Predictably  oil prices were dragged down as a result  Crude fell 4 11  on Friday  and is now trading at  46 17  Brent dropped 3 9  to end the week  and is currently at  48 38 
It would not be inconceivable for oil to fall further  There are strong decision points at  43 21 and  43 59 for Crude and Brent  respectively 

Gold continues to slump  falling a further 2 51  last week  to close at  1 183  close to its 10 month low  Sellers may try hard to break even at the  1 200 swap line  However  they are under heavy pressure  and the current downtrend could drag gold down to  1 160 fairly quickly  The precious metal is currently trading at  1 190 
Silver  currently at  16 75  is still hovering near critical  16 support  At the same time  base metal copper jumped almost nine percent last week  It rose 2 5  just on Friday  when it reached a 17 month high of  2 682  Although the upward trend is being boosted by the improving demand outlook  some of Friday s gains could be attributed to the weaker dollar  Therefore  there could be a small retracement should the dollar reverse  Iron ore also ended the week up 0 83   at  71 81 
Stocks
Four sectors have outperformed the overall S P 500 during the past five days  Energy  Industrials  Financials and Consumer Discretionary 

Energy stocks had the best week  up 2 71   boosted by higher oil prices  However  with chances for an OPEC production freeze deal rapidly fading  the energy sector might head back down as the week progresses 
Consumer Discretionary stocks rose 1 91   on the wave of encouraging Thanksgiving and Black Friday online sales  As long as shoppers still have some cash left in their wallets for Cyber Monday  this could potentially be one of the best performing sectors over the next few days 
Industrials and Financials have been the biggest beneficiaries of the Trump rally  Industrials rose 2 27   on the continuing belief that Trump will invest heavily in infrastructure  At the same time financial institutions gained 1 3   They ve been boosted by the hope that Trump will repeal Dodd Frank banking regulations  The nearly 100  chance of a Fed interest rate hike in December is also positive for banks  According to one measure  super low interest rates may have  over the past six years  so the prospect of potential change for the better should be pleasing to investors 
IT stocks lagged the overall S P  gaining just 0 81   The Health Care sector brought up the rear  losing 1 45   in part due to a poor earnings report from Medtronic PLC  NYSE MDT  which tumbled nearly eight percent lower after the call  Patterson Companies  NASDAQ PDCO  fell 16  on poor earnings results  Disappointment of a another sort pushed Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  shares lower as well  when its experimental Alzheimer s Disease drug failed its clinical trial  Shares fell 11  on the news and are now trading lower by 10  
Overall  it s been a tough year for the Pharma sector  as pricing scandals  the collapse of companies such as Valeant  NYSE VRX  and Theranos and uncertainty about the future of Obamacare leave markets jittery ",2016-11-28,Investing.com,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/opening-bell:-will-cyber-monday,-nfp-drive-markets-this-week-200166787",200166787

Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Home Depot  NYSE HD  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today  You can see 
A brief comment about today s market action is in order before we discuss the featured analyst reports  Stocks appeared immune to the Washington drama for a while  but have started taking note of the issue in today s issue  This isn t helping stocks or the dollar  though safe haven trades into treasuries and gold are doing better  The key question that market participants are grappling with is the future of the Trump Agenda in the current backdrop of a never ending cycle of crises  If the administration is unable to lead Congress into enacting tax reforms and other pro growth measures  then we probably need to get ready for the market to retrace its steps to the pre election level 
As a reference  the S P 500 index is up  12  in the post election period while the Russell 2000 index is up  15 7  
Today s Featured Stock Research Reports 
Pfizershares have underperformed the peer group as well as the broader market over the past year  the stock is down  1 7  over the last one year vs  a  4 6  increase for the Zacks Large Cap Pharma industry   15 8  gain for the S P 500  index  on continued drug pricing uncertainty that have refused to go away even after the election  These headwinds notwithstanding  the Zacks analyst is pointing out that Pfizer is strengthening its product portfolio as well as pipeline through acquisitions and licensing deals  Also  cost savings and share buybacks should help Pfizer achieve its earnings guidance  While the Hospira acquisition has significantly expanded Pfizer s sterile injectable and biosimilar capabilities  the Medivation deal has strengthened its cancer franchise by adding Xtandi to its portfolio   You can      
Home Depot sharesare up  16 3  in the year to date period  outperforming the Zacks Retail sector  up  13 2   and the broader market  S P 500 up  7 5   in that same time period  Improving customer experience  solid execution and consistent housing market recovery helped the company post an earnings surprise in first quarter fiscal 2017  retaining the four year long trend of beating earnings estimates  The company s relentless focus on offering innovative products  boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity seems to be paying off  Moreover  the company raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 while retaining its sales view  On the flip side  market participants can justifiably raise valuation concerns  particularly following the stock s stellar recent performance   You can     
ConocoPhillips shares are down  5 9  in the year to date period  roughly in line with the Zacks Energy sector s performance in the same time period  on weakness in oil prices  During the first quarter of this year  the company s loss per share narrowed considerably while its top line beat estimates  This was owing to improved commodity price realizations and increased production  But the quarterly loss compared unfavorably with estimates for the January March quarter  Higher expenses  along with normal field declines and dispositions  led to the underperformance  However  the company s plan to reposition its asset base by divesting low margin assets and using the sale proceeds to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders is proceeding nicely  The company decided to divest its interest in the San Juan Basin   rich in natural gas   for a consideration of almost  3 billion  The accord reflects ConocoPhillips  intention to lower its exposure to the U S  natural gas business  which has been less profitable in recent years   You can
