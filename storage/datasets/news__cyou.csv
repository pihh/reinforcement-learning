Stocks in this week s article are Quanta Services  Inc    NYSE PWR    Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN    Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc   NASDAQ JAZZ   and Changyou com Ltd    NASDAQ CYOU   Create a Standout Portfolio with These Low P CF StocksInvesting in stocks based on value analysis is generally considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are usually cheap but fundamentally sound  Certainly  chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to reap profits when the market trends are favorable  The strategy is very simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth Warren Buffett once said   It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price    There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking  if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Why Price to Cash Flow You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Then again  cash flow is quite reliable  Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves  Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which  in turn  lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap For the rest of this Screen of the

107524,329039,CYOU,6 Low Price to Book Value Stocks To Buy In December,opinion,The price to book  P B  ratio is widely favored by value investors for identifying low priced stocks with exceptional returns  The ratio is used to compare a stock s market value price to its book value The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market price per share book value of equity per shareP B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share  So  if the share price is  10 and book value of equity is  5  investors are ready to pay two times the book value  Ideally  a P B value under 1 0 is considered good  indicating a potentially undervalued stock  However  value investors often consider stocks with a P B value under 3 0 Now let us understand the concept of book value What is Book Value Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  equal to A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space Here are six of the seven stocks that qualified the screening

107529,329044,CYOU,5 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy For 2020,opinion,The term emerging market was coined in 1981 to denote lower and middle income countries  Since then  these economies have vaulted from obscurity to become an attractive asset class of their own  The stock markets in countries like China  India  Brazil and other emerging markets attracted foreign equity capital worth an estimated  50 billion annually over the past 38 years However  shareholders have had it tough as emerging market equities endured a weaker 2019  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index  with a year to date gain of around 13   as of Dec 24  2019   have underperformed the broader S P 500 market s return of more than 28  by a wide margin  But things are looking up in 2020 as pundits predict a promising outlook for this category  which makes up around 80  of the world s economy     As a proof of this bullish sentiment  BlackRock  NYSE BLK    the world s largest asset manager   is overweight on emerging market equities heading into the next year  The largest U S  bank  JP Morgan  is  modestly overweight  on the asset class  Meanwhile  Europe s HSBC Asset Management also favors the emerging markets that include some of the largest countries in the world like China  India and Russia      Let s discuss the 2019 performance of emerging markets in more depth  plus what to expect in 2020 Emerging Markets in 2019  A Difficult Year for InvestorsCertain reasons stand out First and foremost  protracted trade headwinds between Beijing and Washington unsettled investors and stalled global economic growth  As the conflict intensified  the world s two largest economies issued a flurry of duties and counter duties and threats of further duties on each other s imports worth billions of dollars  Market watchers were increasingly concerned about the prospects of the world s slide into recession  eventually biting into corporate profits  In particular  such tensions tend to have an oversized impact on the emerging markets as tightness in trade affect their export driven economies Second  the uncertainty regarding global growth together with concerns over Britain s exit from the European Union lend support to the U S  dollar  offsetting capital into the emerging markets  After all  a strong greenback makes commodities more expensive for those holding other currencies  Since many emerging countries sell dollar denominated commodities  they stand to lose Finally  slowing economic growth in countries like Brazil  Mexico  India  Russia  Saudi Arabia  and particularly in China  plus financial strife in Turkey and Argentina  made investors flee the emerging markets Emerging Markets in 2020  An Excellent Investment OpportunityLooking forward  things seem to be looking up for the emerging markets in 2020 The recent agreement on a phase one trade deal between U S  and China  plus easing Brexit uncertainty  boosted the market sentiment  The developments   coming after months of wrangling   is seen to prop up the demand outlook and revive global economic growth Recognized as having high growth prospects and rapid pace of industrialization  emerging markets have long

107530,329045,CYOU,Create A Value Based Portfolio With These 4 Low P CF Stocks,opinion,Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that make P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  However  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and also consider price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential   Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening Quanta Services  Inc    NYSE PWR    which provides specialty contracting services  has an expected EPS growth

highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 5 Best Emerging Market Stocks to Buy for 2020The term emerging market was coined in 1981 to denote lower and middle income countries  Since then  these economies have vaulted from obscurity to become an attractive asset class of their own  The stock markets in countries like China  India  Brazil and other emerging markets attracted foreign equity capital worth an estimated  50 billion annually over the past 38 years However  shareholders have had it tough as emerging market equities endured a weaker 2019  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index  with a year to date gain of around 13   as of Dec 24  2019   have underperformed the broader S P 500 market s return of more than 28  by a wide margin  But things are looking up in 2020 as pundits predict a promising outlook for this category  which makes up around 80  of the world s economy     As a proof of this bullish sentiment  BlackRock  NYSE BLK    the world s largest asset manager   is overweight on emerging market equities heading into the next year  The largest U S  bank  JP Morgan  is  modestly overweight  on the asset class  Meanwhile  Europe s HSBC Asset Management also favors the emerging markets that include some of the largest countries in the world like China  India and Russia      Let s discuss the 2019 performance of emerging markets in more depth  plus what to expect in 2020 Emerging Markets in 2019  A Difficult Year for InvestorsCertain reasons stand out First and foremost  protracted trade headwinds between Beijing and Washington unsettled investors and stalled global economic growth  As the conflict intensified  the world s two largest economies issued a flurry of duties and counter duties and threats of further duties on each other s imports worth billions of dollars  Market watchers were increasingly concerned about the prospects of the world s slide into recession  eventually biting into corporate profits  In particular  such tensions tend to have an oversized impact on the emerging markets as tightness in trade affect their export driven economies Second  the uncertainty regarding global growth together with concerns over Britain s exit from the European Union lend support to the U S  dollar  offsetting capital into the emerging markets  After all  a strong greenback makes commodities more expensive for those holding other currencies  Since many emerging countries sell dollar denominated commodities  they stand to lose Finally  slowing economic growth in countries like Brazil  Mexico  India  Russia  Saudi Arabia  and particularly in China  plus financial strife in Turkey and Argentina  made investors flee the emerging markets Emerging Markets in 2020  An Excellent Investment OpportunityLooking forward  things seem to be looking up for the emerging markets in 2020 The recent agreement on a phase one trade deal between U S  and China  plus easing Brexit uncertainty  boosted the market sentiment  The developments   coming after months of wrangling   is seen to prop up the demand outlook and revive global economic growth Recognized as having high growth prospects and rapid pace of industrialization  emerging markets have long been investors  go to destinations  Per IMF projections  growth in advanced economies will slow to 1 7  in 2019 and 2020  while emerging market and developing economies will experience growth of 3 9

107554,329069,CYOU,Why Weibo Corp   WB  Could Be Positioned For A Slump,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio  One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Weibo Corporation   NASDAQ WB    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  4  Sell  further confirms weakness in WB  A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen three estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from  3 12 a share a month ago to its current level of  2 82 Also  for the current quarter  Weibo Corp  has seen three downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to 65 cents a share from 73 cents over the past 30 days  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 28 1  in the past month Weibo Corporation Price and Consensus   So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait  If you are still interested in the Internet   Content industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Changyou com Limited   NASDAQ CYOU    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and may be a better selection at this time  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here Will you retire a millionaire  One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire  Get smart tips you can do today to become one of them in a new Special Report   7 Things You Can Do Now to Retire a Multimillionaire  ,2019-06-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-weibo-corp-wb-could-be-positioned-for-a-slump-200431773,200431773
107555,329070,CYOU,Is Changyou  CYOU  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Changyou com Limited   NASDAQ CYOU   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Changyou has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 4 15  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 43  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Changyou s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 10 15 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Computer and Technology Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 48  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Changyou has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 5 04  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Changyou has a P S ratio of about 1 03 This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 25 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Changyou currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Changyou a solid choice for value investors For example  the P CF ratio for Changyou  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 77  which is better than the industry average of 12 33  Clearly  CYOU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Changyou might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and Momentum Score of D  This gives CYOU a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  As a result  the current year consensus estimate declined 7 6  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate fell 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Changyou com Limited Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineChangyou is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  asyou can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2019-09-22,Zacks Investment

107557,329072,CYOU,Pick These 5 Bargain Stocks With Alluring EV EBITDA Ratios,opinion,Value investors are generally fixated on the price to earnings  P E  multiple while seeking stocks that are trading at a bargain  P E  without a shadow of doubt  is the most popular multiple used by investors to evaluate the fair market value of a stock  But even this widely popular valuation metric is not without its  is a Better Approach  Here s WhyWhile P E is preferred by many investors while uncovering value stocks  another valuation metric called EV EBITDA does a better job  The ratio is sometimes viewed as a superior substitute as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential  EV EBITDA has a more comprehensive approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  In contrast  P E just considers the equity portion of a firm Also dubbed as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Essentially  it is the total value of a company EBITDA  the other constituent  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued    However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another shortcoming of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Meanwhile  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are loss making but  is also a useful yardstick in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt But EV EBITDA has its downsides too  It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Therefore  instead of just relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more

107561,329076,CYOU,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Hilltop  Mr  Cooper  Universal Forest Products  Newell Brands And Changyou com,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 3  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Hilltop Holdings Inc    NYSE HTH    Mr  Cooper Group Inc    NASDAQ COOP    Universal Forest Products  Inc    NASDAQ UFPI    Newell Brands Inc    NASDAQ NWL   and Changyou com Ltd    NASDAQ CYOU   Pick These 5 Bargain Stocks with Alluring EV EBITDA RatiosValue investors are generally fixated on the price to earnings  P E  multiple while seeking stocks that are trading at a bargain  P E  without a shadow of doubt  is the most popular multiple used by investors to evaluate the fair market value of a stock  But even this widely popular valuation metric is not without its  is a Better Approach  Here s WhyWhile P E is preferred by many investors while uncovering value stocks  another valuation metric called EV EBITDA does a better job  The ratio is sometimes viewed as a superior substitute as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential  EV EBITDA has a more comprehensive approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  In contrast  P E just considers the equity portion of a firm Also dubbed as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Essentially  it is the total value of a company EBITDA  the other constituent  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued    However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another shortcoming of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Meanwhile  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are loss making but  is also a useful yardstick in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt But EV EBITDA has its downsides too  It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Therefore  instead of just relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure

107600,329115,CYOU,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Shutterfly  SFLY  Stock,opinion,On Apr 11  we issued an updated research report on the Internet based social expression and personal publishing service provider  Shutterfly  Inc    NASDAQ SFLY   In the last reported quarter  the company posted weaker than expected results  wherein both earnings and sales lagged the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Nevertheless  the company surpassed expectations in the three quarters before that  bringing the average positive surprise in the trailing four quarters to 11 6  Improving Operational EfficiencyAs announced in the fourth quarter of 2016  Shutterfly has undertaken various structural changes  In order to focus more on profitable and cost effective brands  the company plans to retire many of its other brands  Thus  going forward  Shutterfly will invest in a single Consumer platform  with all customers gaining from investment in the Shutterfly com site  This is likely to reduce complexities of usage to a large extent  and should thereby increasing customer satisfaction Also  one of the largest structural changes made by the company is to reduce workforce by approximately 13  or 260 employees  This is expected to result in an annualized cost decrease of roughly  25 million Meanwhile  the quality and scale of Shutterfly s manufacturing operations  combining its world class in house manufacturing capabilities  make it one of the largest four color printers in the world  with its broad network of outsourced partners  The company also intends to improve operational efficiency and open new manufacturing facilities or consolidate the existing ones for future expansion Other Growth InitiativesShutterfly is well focused on product innovation to drive growth  Last quarter  the company announced its plans of re investing in Tiny Prints as its premium cards   stationery brand and creating a Tiny Prints boutique on a dedicated tab on Shutterfly com  Moving ahead  the company also plans to focus on the new Shutterfly Wedding Store as a part of its wedding strategy  which includes a premium Wedding Paper Divas branded stationery collection In the third quarter of 2016  besides enhancing home d cor category as well as cards and stationery category  it added more products to its newly launched statement gifts category  Such innovative offerings are expected to add to the company s top line Meanwhile  the company is making progress with its Shutterfly 3 0 initiative  which encompasses a new integrated photo management solution  also called the All New Shutterfly  This photo management service is anticipated to deepen the company s relationships with its customers and drive sales over time Further  Shutterfly s focus on improving technology related offerings seems to bode well  It has been continuously enhancing its mobile experience and optimized navigation  and also working on the look and functionality of its websites  In Sep 2016  the company launched an improved Shutterfly mobile app on iOS and Android to offer a broader product catalogue  which is expected to expand its mobile customer base  In fact  in the fourth quarter of 2016  the number of app customers and the amount of revenues from the app doubled year over year ConcernsShutterfly generally incurs loss in the first three quarters and makes profit in the final quarter of every year because of the seasonal nature of its business  Additionally  it is affected by vacation and other travel trends as these drive digital camera sales  Therefore  weaknesses in the travel industry owing to macro economic slowdown or political instability can hurt the company s business Furthermore  the company has been incurring higher costs over the past few quarters  which is putting pressure on its margins  These costs primarily pertain to the company s accelerated development of new production facilities along with a rise in the manufacturing  labor and training costs  Additionally  with the announcement of major restructuring goals  the company expects to incur restructuring charges over the first few months of 2017 ranging from  15 million to  20 million Meanwhile  it is to be noted that Shutterfly s revenue growth has been slowing down over the past couple of years  This is because the company had spread its resources thin across many businesses  brands and platforms  making it impossible to dedicate the right level of resource to each one Although the company has undertaken huge structural changes to this end  2017 is expected to be a transition year for it  with different brands transitioning at different times over the course of the first three quarters  Thus  the company projects net revenues in 2017 to grow a meager 1  over last year Bottom LineShares of Shutterfly increased 8 4  in the last six months against the Zacks categorized  industry s fall of 1 7   Meanwhile  estimates have mostly been stable ahead of the company s first quarter earnings release  Nevertheless  after faring through the transitioning year of 2017  we expect the company to get its groove back  given how all initiatives are in place Currently  Shutterfly carries

107601,329116,CYOU,5 Top Ranked China Stocks To Buy As Growth Surges In Q1,opinion,"In what comes as welcome news to an economy in transition  China s GDP has increased for a second consecutive quarter  The pickup in growth experienced during the first quarter of the year was largely attributable to an increase in industrial production  credit growth and a booming real estate sector 
With consumption contributing more strongly toward growth  there are indications that China s economic transformation is progressing well  At the same time  there is enough momentum behind investment to ensure a fast pace of growth in the second quarter of 2017  With good times ahead for the economy  picking up Chinese stocks like a smart option for investors 
GDP Rises  Indicators Pick Up
In the first quarter  China s GDP increased by 6 9  on an annual basis  This was the strongest pace of growth witnessed in 18 months and has exceeded most estimates  Further  it remains well above the 6 5  pace for 2017 predicted by Premier Li Keqiang  Growth picked up pace toward the end of the first quarter  indicating that this momentum is likely to be carried forward into the second quarter of the year 
A series of bullish economic indicators was released along with the GDP reading  all of which depicted a robust economy  During the first quarter  industrial production increased by 6 8  even as year over year growth for March came in at 7 6   Retail sales increased at an annual rate of 10 9  last month 
Additionally  fixed asset investment increased by 9 2  during the first quarter  significantly higher than the pace of 8 1  experienced last year  Meanwhile  real estate investment increased by 9 1  during the same period  In March  new home sales surged by 18  on a yearly basis  illustrating frenzied activity in China s housing sector 
Consumption Strengthens  Investment Momentum Intact
Currently  China seems to be progressing steadily towards its goal of becoming a consumption driven economy  This was borne out by the fact that consumption s contribution to growth in the first quarter has increased from last year s level of 64 6  to 77 2  
A substantial increase in retail sales is further evidence of the growing importance of consumer spending in an economy traditionally driven by industrial production  A fall in the unemployment rate and a concurrent increase in the number of job additions during the first quarter indicate that such trends are likely to be sustained in the months to come 
Meanwhile  investment momentum is likely to remain strong in the near future  further brightening the economic outlook  On Apr 1  the government announced plans to set up the Xiongan New Area  a new special economic zone which would entail an investment of around  290 billion 
This is a clear sign that China will continue to depend of high levels of investment in real estate to power growth  The only downside to this trend is the spate of restrictions on property purchases which have recently come into effect across several major cities  However  this may serve to cool down the overheated property market to more sustainable levels  a major positive for the economy over the long run 
Our Choices
Strong GDP data in the first quarter indicates that Chinas  economy is on a firm footing at present  Such a view is backed up data on all the other major economic indicators released last month 
Additionally  there is enough evidence to suggest that this momentum will be carried forward into the second quarter  Adding stocks from China to your portfolios looks like a prudent option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score

But as they say all that glitters is not gold   If we look closely  Nintendo hasn t fared that well on the value front  The recent price increase and meteoric boost in market cap raise a lot of questions regarding the valuation of the company 
If we look at the numbers  the company has a PE ratio of 88 45   which compares unfavorably with the industry standard of 28 4   Moreover  in the last reported quarter  it delivered dismal results with both the top and the bottom lines missing the estimates by a wide margin  Yes  revenues from Pokemon were not included in this quarter s financials but even then Nintendo would have got only a portion of the revenues  Further  questions regarding Pok mon s sustainability are already cropping up 
Nintendo continues to see weakness in its core business especially as it struggles to solidify its presence in the mobile gaming space
