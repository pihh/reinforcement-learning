7402,228917,ADES,Emissions Solutions  AutoNation  Xilinx  Cisco Systems And Qorvo Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   April 22  2019    Advanced Emissions Solutions   NASDAQ ADES   as the Bull of the Day  AutoNation   NYSE AN   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Xilinx  Inc    NASDAQ XLNX    Cisco Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CSCO   and Qorvo  Inc    NASDAQ QRVO   
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 
 
Advanced Emissions Solutions is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and it broke out the other day  Normally  I am all about growth stocks and topline is where I focus my attention  but this stock has some tremendous bottomline growth and I thought this would be a great chance to review it as a Bull of the Day 
Description
Advanced Emissions Solutions  Inc  develops  offers and implements environmental technologies  equipment and specialty chemicals that enable coal fueled power plants to meet emissions regulations  It operates in three principal business segments  Refined Coal  Emissions Control and CO2 capture  The company also offers dry sorbent injection systems to control SO2 and acid gases  It operates primarily in the United States along with its subsidiaries  Advanced Emissions Solutions  Inc  formerly known as ADA ES  Inc   is based in Highlands Ranch  Colorado 
Estimates
This quarter is looking at  0 64 when 60 days ago  the estimate was calling for  0 39  That is huge  But wait there is more 
Next quarter has  0 87 when 60 days ago  the estimate was calling for  0 54  That is huge  But wait there is more 
2019 is slated to come in at  3 39 when 60 days ago  the estimate was calling for  2 50  That is huge  But wait there is more 
2020 has a  5 90 number when 60 days ago  the estimate was calling for  4 15  That is huge 
The projected earnings growth for this stock is 74  
For these moves alone  you can see why this is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Valuation
Looking ahead  the 1 5 year forward multiple is less than 3 times earnings  Right now the forward PE is 3 7x with the trailing number at 7 2x  The revenue growth is 1853     so a jump from almost nothing a year ago  I see a 3 7x price to book and a 10x sales multiple  All of that is fine with me 
This is an earnings growth play  The dividend isn t what I am used to getting  but it is just the icing on the top of the cake 
 
AutoNationis a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and it fell to that Rank last week and that is a bad sign as the company is set to report earnings at the end of the week   Let s review how this stock fell to the lowest Zacks Rank in this Bear of the Day article 
Description
AutoNation is the America s Largest Automotive Retailer  AutoNation is constantly innovating and striving to change the way America buys   services their vehicles  AutoNation offer a diversified range of automotive products and services  including new vehicles  used vehicles  parts and service  which includes automotive repair and maintenance services as well as wholesale parts and collision businesses  and automotive finance and insurance products  which include vehicle service and other protection products  as well as the arranging of financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources 
Earnings Estimates
The Zacks Rank is primarily driven by the movement in earnings estimates   If estimates are moving up the Rank moves in a similar direction   When estimates slide  the Rank tends to follow suit
For AN the estimates for the current quarter have been falling   90 days ago  the Zacks Consensus Estimate was at  1 09  that fell to  0 94 as of 30 days ago and that has slipped to the current level of  0 92 
There is a similar story for the next quarter  as numbers fell from  1 10 to  1 05 to  1 03 over the same time period 
The full year estiamte carries more weight than the quarterly numbers on the Zacks Rank   Those numbers are moving lower as well   90 Days ago the 2019 estimate was at  4 56 and now it is down to  4 14 
Earnings History
AN does not have the worst earnings history I have ever seen  but it is not the best   Of the last four reports  there have been two beats and two misses   That isn t a big problem  as 3 of the 4 reports were a beat or a miss of a single penny 
That said  the last two reports were misses so there is a recent trend 
Valuation
As a growth investor  I look at the topline   I see contraction of 4 78  on an annual basis  so I am not thrilled   Then I see the price to sales of 0 16x and I see the market does not really value their sales   
A 9x forward earnings multiple is low  but so is the price to book multiple of 1 26x 
The valuation is low  but depressed earnings tell you that we could see a lower valuation still

5G Chipset Market Humming  3 Solid Buys
Fifth generation  5G  chipset market is set to gain immensely  especially  in the United States as the country is impatiently awaiting its arrival  Increase in demand for high speed Internet  advancement in IoT and the recent spike in government initiatives for better rural connectivity are helping the 5G chipset market gather steam 
5G Chipset Market s Impressive Outlook 
According to Markets and Markets report  the 5G chipset market is estimated to be worth  22 41 billion by 2026 and is valued at  2 03 billion for 2020  Thus  the 5G chipset market is expected to witness a compounded annual rate of 49 2  during the forecast period 
The market has been projected till 2026  given that the commercialization of the 5G technology takes place in 2020 
5G Networks Offer High Speed  Wider Connectivity
To begin with  the 5G chipset market and 5G networks go hand in hand  Therefore  technological advancement and growth in commercialization of 5G networks will allow the 5G chipset space to gain immensely 
5G chips will be an essential component of the upcoming 5G enabled devices such as smart phones  laptops and routers  and that s the primary reason for this market s remarkable growth projection  At present  customers are patiently awaiting 5G technology s rollout  Once that is through  a surge in demand for 5G enabled devices will be inevitable 
After all  the selling point of 5G networks is its ability to offer high speed Internet and wider connectivity  5G networks are expected to be 10 20 times faster than 4G with near impossible latency detection  Simply put  a user can t notice the lag time a webpage video game takes to load 
Since smart phones have become the most preferred medium of online services such as audio and video streaming  running business applications and file sharing  demand for 5G enabled smart phones will be higher and in turn boost 5G chipset as well 
Noting this  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and 5G chipmaker Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  have teamed up to launch iPhone 5 next year  While 5G networks aren t expected to replace 4G networks in a major way before 2020  the 5G enabled smart phone and 5G chipset markets will gain traction from the very beginning 
Advancement in AI  IoT to Push 5G Chipset Market
5G is expected to enhance the spectrum  allowing it to support everything from broadband services to IoT  which will drive the widespread use of new mobile driven applications  These applications may consist of industrial automation as well 
This is how 5G will raise the establishment of smart phone applications across verticals such as transport  automation  retail  manufacturing  finance and healthcare  5G s faster wireless connectivity will be a boon for new technologies such as driverless cars and augmented reality  As IoT products improve with enhanced AI  5G will enable its smooth application  ultimately boosting the 5G chipset market 
Trump Administration s 5G Initiatives
Thanks to United States and China s race to win the 5G race  the U S  government has been taking various initiatives to secure the crown 
First  the Trump administration intervened in Singapore chipmaker Broadcom s takeover of Qualcomm last year  The acquisition could have caused a significant reduction in Qualcomm s 5G research and development  allowing China to have an upper hand in developing 5G networks  
Secondly  President Donald Trump and Federal Communications Commission  FCC  Chairman Ajit Pai announced a plan earlier this week to enhance 5G by auctioning more spectrum  The FCC also created a  20 4 billion fund called Rural Digital Opportunity Fund  aimed at assisting telecom companies to expand into rural America 
Finally  the Trump administration will also decrease barriers created by regulations  This will allow private companies to take more charge in the 5G domain  equally boosting the 5G chipset market 
Our Choices
The impressively broader market for 5G chipsets has created new opportunities for several key players in the industry  We have chosen three stocks that are poised to benefit from the emergence and implementation of these chipsets  All the stocks mentioned below carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Xilinx  Inc  manufactures 5G radio frequency chips  orders for which are expected to rise 50  year over year in 2019  according to a report by Mizuho

Cisco Systems s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 17 7  compared with the Zacks Computer   Networking industry s projected decline of 0 4   The company s stock price has outperformed the Computer   Networking Market over the past one year period   26 3  vs  23 8

 In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck 
No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies 
One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified 
So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further 
Sounds good  Here s how to execute it 
One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward 
If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational 
However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy 
Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material  An affiliated investment advisory firm may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material About Screen of the WeekZacks com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the   1 site for screening stocks  by Money Magazine  But powerful screening tools is just the start  That is why Zacks created the Screen of the Week to highlight profitable stock picking strategies that investors can actively use   Strong Stocks that Should Be in the NewsMany are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has more than doubled the market from 1988 through 2016  Its average gain has been a stellar  25  per year    Follow us on Twitter   Join us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB    Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities  including a broker dealer and an investment adviser   which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates  Contact  Jim GiaquintoCompany  Zacks comPhone  312 265 9268Email  Visit   Zacks com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources  which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions  Zacks is providing information on this resource to you subject to the Zacks  Terms and Conditions of Service  disclaimer    Past performance is no guarantee of future results  Inherent in any investment is the potential for loss  This material is being provided for informational purposes only and nothing herein constitutes investment  legal  accounting or tax advice  or a recommendation to buy  sell or hold a security  No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor  It should not be assumed that any investments in securities  companies  sectors or markets identified and described were or will be profitable  All information is current as of the date of herein and is subject to change without notice  Any views or opinions expressed may not reflect those of the firm as a whole  Zacks Investment Research does not engage in investment banking  market making or asset management activities of any securities  These returns are from hypothetical portfolios consisting of stocks with Zacks Rank   1 that were rebalanced monthly with zero transaction costs  These are not the returns of actual portfolios of stocks  The S P 500 is an unmanaged index  Visit  for information about the performance numbers displayed in this press release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zackscom-featured-expert-kevin-matras-highlights-advanced-emissions-solutions-verint-systems-great-lakes-dredge--dock-ani-pharmaceuticals-and-aci-worldwide-200409672,200409672
