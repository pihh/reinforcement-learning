26182,247697,CAJ,Should Value Investors Pick Canon Inc   CAJ  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Canon Inc    NYSE CAJ   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Canon Inc  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 9  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Canon Inc  s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 17 6  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Canon Inc  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Canon Inc  s stock in the near term too    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Canon Inc  has a P S ratio of about 1 01  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Canon Inc  currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CAJ a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Canon Inc  is just 1 9  a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 4 4  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  CAJ is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Canon Inc  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B  This gives CAJ a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year consensus estimate has risen about 1 3  in the past two months  while the full year 2019 estimate has inched up 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Canon  Inc  Price and Consensus    Even though Western Union has a somewhat better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCanon Inc  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 16  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors and industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty

26183,247698,CAJ,Japan s Economy Posts Record Growth Stretch  5 Terrific Picks,opinion,Japan s latest GDP report has delivered a well timed boost to prime minister Shinzo Abe s reforms push  The country s economy has now expanded for the longest period since the 1980s  powered by an increase in domestic spending Despite a decline in the annualized pace of growth  the latest report is a bullish signal for the Bank of Japan  BoJ   A spurt in consumer spending indicates that the economy may be gearing up to push consumer prices toward the central bank s 2  target for inflation Meanwhile  the BoJ is unlikely to roll back its stimulus measures as long as the country s inflation target remains elusive  Also  Abe continues to pursue fiscal and structural reforms  which make this a good time to invest in Japan s stocks  Longest Growth Streak in 28 YearsIn December  Japan s economy expanded for the eighth consecutive quarter  marking the longest period of growth since 1989  The longest stretch of expansion on record prior to this was the 12 quarter period between April June 1986 and January March 1989  This period coincides with the time when Japan suffered from an infamous economic bubble During the period between October and December  Japan s real GDP increased at a monthly rate of 0 1  or at an annualized pace of 0 5   This was however lower than most estimates which put annual and monthly increases at 0 2  and 0 9   respectively  It is also lower than the 2 2  annualized pace recorded during the July September period Domestic Demand Drives ExpansionHowever  Japan s real GDP still increased by 1 6  during 2017  the sharpest rate of growth recorded since the 2  expansion recorded in 2013  Moreover  the latest quarter of growth was powered by an increase in domestic demand  Private consumption increased by 0 5  over the last quarter  the first expansion experienced in six months Further  this increase comes after a 0 6  decline in consumption during the July September period  Additionally  capital expenditure increased by 0 7   recording its fifth straight quarter of growth  External demand remained more or less unchanged with imports and exports increasing by 2 9  and 2 4   respectively BoJ s Stimulus to Remain Firmly in PlaceJapan s current stretch of growth has been largely powered by the raft of stimulus measures undertaken by Abe s government and the BoJ  And despite such an extended phase of expansion  monetary stimulus is unlikely to be discontinued in the near future  A rising yen and current sluggishness in consumer prices will likely force the BoJ to keep such measures firmly in place However  the expansion in consumer spending is an exceedingly positive development  This indicates that consumer prices are likely to pick up in the near future  Additionally  several economists believe that Japan s economy is currently in a strong position  A pickup in wages and improving quality of jobs is resulting in higher consumption levels  which in turn is fueling economic growth Our ChoicesJapan s current expansionary phase is a product of Abe s fiscal and structural reforms and the BoJ s long running monetary stimulus program  These measures have delivered tangible results on the ground and are likely to fuel growth over an extended period in the future Adding stocks from Japan to your portfolios looks like a smart option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE   designs

26184,247699,CAJ,Japan s Economy Remains Resilient  5 Great Picks,opinion,Japan s economy grew faster in the last quarter of 2017 than initially estimated  according to a revised estimate  The world s third largest economy has now expanded for eight straight quarters  This marks the longest run of growth in 28 years  since a 12 quarter expansion ended in 1989  a period which coincided with Japan s economic bubble The economy of Japan primarily grew on solid global demand for technological products that created an investment boom in Japan s auto  semiconductors and machinery sectors  Meanwhile  analysts believe that it s quite unlikely that the Bank of Japan  BoJ  will consider doing away with its monetary stimulus measures  as low wage growth is preventing people from spending more and hindering an acceleration in inflation  Moreover  economists believe that Japan is on track for stable growth and remain positive about the longer term outlook  Given this scenario  this is a good time to invest in Japan s stocks Japan s GDP Increases for Eight Consecutive Quarters Japan s economy grew at an annualized 1 6  in the fourth quarter compared with the preliminary estimate of 0 5  and came in above economists  expectations of 0 9   The growth was primarily driven an upward revision in key business areas  This also reflects a 0 4  quarter over quarter increase  up from the initial reading of 0 1  and above of the 0 3  pace registered in the third quarter    The upward revision was primarily due to faster than expected gains in capital expenditure  driven by robust investment in technology  and information and communications like smartphones and production machinery such as robots and labor saving technology Capital expenditure increased 0 7   marking the fifth straight quarter of growth  Another key factor that contributed to upward GDP revision was a buildup in private inventory  caused by rising stock of crude oil and natural gas  steel products  electronics parts and devices Moreover  private consumption  which accounts for almost one third of GDP  grew 0 5  against a contraction of 0 6  in the previous quarter and in line with preliminary estimates  Given this scenario  policymakers are keen on creating a virtuous growth cycle  wherein higher wages can act as a stimulus to increased consumer spending  which will help in giving a boost to business investment and accelerate inflation Bank of Japan to Continue With Monetary Stimulus Japan s current expansionary phase is a brainchild of Abe s fiscal and structural reforms and the BoJ s long running monetary stimulus program  In fact  BoJ s governor  Haruhiko Kuroda  on Mar 2 raised investor concerns when he  for the first time  flagged chances of an exit from monetary stimulus if the 2  inflation target was met in fiscal 2019  a remark he later backtracked from  It seems unlikely that the BoJ will roll back stimulus measures anytime soon  as achieving the 2  target is likely to take longer  And inflation won t accelerate so long wages and private consumption remain sluggish  However  the expansion in consumer spending is an exceptionally positive development  This indicates that consumer prices are likely to pick up in the near future  Moreover  economists believe that Japan s growth is on solid ground and pickup in wages and improving quality of jobs are resulting in higher consumption levels  which in turn is fueling economic growth Our ChoicesJapan s economic Zen is a result of the stimulus measures taken by Abe s government and the BoJ  These measures are bearing fruit and the economy is likely to continue expending over an extended period of time  Moreover  given that it will still take some time to achieve the 2  inflation target  BoJ is unlikely to roll back the stimulus measures  marking a likely indication of continued growth Adding stocks from Japan to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows

growth since 2001  Additionally  the country s markets have been mopping up impressive gains with the benchmark Nikkei 225 up 15 3  year to date  This is largely a product of strong corporate earnings

successive quarter in succession  This marks the longest unbroken phase of growth since the eight quarters between April to June 1999 and January to March 2001 Powering the third quarter increase in GDP was a positive trade balance  which represents the difference between exports and imports  This factor alone added 0 5  to overall growth numbers The only cause for concern was a 0 5  dip in private consumption  which makes up the lion s share of Japan s GDP  However  such weakness could only be temporary  This is because as Japan nears full employment  a pickup in consumption becomes inevitable in the near future Strong Earnings Boost Nikkei to Record Level On Nov 7  the Nikkei jumped to its highest level in 26 years on the back of strong earnings results  According to Daiwa

26319,247834,CAJ,Fujifilm Poised For Growth In Booming Digital Camera Market ,opinion,"Premium photography and imaging company  FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation   OTC FUJIY   has lately proclaimed that it foresees year over year revenue growth of nearly 10  for fiscal 2018  ending March 2018   Share price of the company moved north to  40 00  post the newsflash on Nov 16  2017 
Over the last six months  shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock have returned 8 7  against the  13 8  decline 

Also  the stock currently has a  of A 
You can see  
The company perceives that its revenues and profitability will improve in the upcoming quarters on the back of stronger sales of high end digital cameras 
The Camera   Imaging Products Association recently  that global camera shipments climbed nearly 13 6  to 18 9 million units in September from January  This has raised camera makers  hopes of a surge in demand for high value added models 
Since 2010  the worldwide camera market has been witnessing a downward trend as end users are defecting to smartphones  However  this year s shipment data discloses that the markets are rebounding  One major stimulus behind the rally is the     This widely used photo sharing application has largely driven sales of premium compact digital cameras  offering much better image than smartphones 
Industry View 
Robust growth prospects have triggered business rivalry in the digital camera market  Fujifilm Holdings Corporation  Panasonic Corporation  Canon  Inc    NYSE CAJ    Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE    Leica Camera AG  Nikon Corporation  Olympus Corporation and HP Inc    NYSE HPQ   are the major players in this space 
In order to grab a larger portion of market demand  these camera makers are launching high end models and have raised near term top line forecasts  For instance  Canon  Inc  anticipates year over year sales growth of 8  for 2017  The company noted that its compact digital cameras and interchangeable lenses are currently witnessing better than expected sales  Sony Corporation has raised its sales view by nearly 10 5  for fiscal 2018  ending March 2018   Sony claims that demand for its Alpha mirrorless cameras has been improving in recent quarters  Nikon and Panasonic have also elevated their near term sales guidance 
Fujifilm Riding High 
In August  Fujifilm rolled out the VISION2019 program through which it intends to boost near term profitability on the back of increased cash flow generation  propel growth in prime business domains and develop new high margin businesses  On the back of these  the company aims to generate revenues worth  2 600 billion  operating income of  230 billion and net income of  150 billion in fiscal 2020 
We believe that strategic business acquisitions  like the Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd  buyout in April 2017  and new operational efficacy improving programs  such as the Work Style Innovation program  will boost the company s top and bottom line performance  
Notably  Fujifilm predicts that the future of the digital camera industry is highly dependent on demand of major emerging countries such as China and India  In sync with this  the company intends to tap greater share of the Indian mirrorless camera demand by promoting its Fuji GFX system and premium range of X Series cameras  going forward  In addition  the company s 4K broadcast lenses are likely to secure sturdy response in the county in the near future 
In the VISION2019 program  the company stated that its Imaging Solutions segment will generate roughly  380 billion revenues and  45 billion operating income by the end of fiscal 2020 
We believe that the aforementioned moves will largely help Fujifilm withstand competition in the high end digital camera market  However  the photomask industry is highly dynamic in nature  The possibility of a rival outpacing competency with a new product or marketing strategy remains a concern

26321,247836,CAJ,Why Canon  CAJ  Is A Stellar Growth Stock ,opinion,"A select group of tech stocks  including Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    have become increasingly popular in the growth investing world over the past few years 
But growth investors are always looking for the next pick  and as Q3 report season winds down  we have some time to think about what the next stocks with the potential for major top and bottom line expansion might be 
Some investors will spend their time looking for the next up and coming company  like a Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX    but growth stocks can also come in the form of a well established company that has dominated an industry for years 
With this in mind  one firm investors might want to consider is Canon   NYSE CAJ   
Growth Fundamentals 
This Japanese company manufactures and sells everything from cameras to computer printers and medical equipment  Canon is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system 
In terms of growth potential  our Zacks Consensus Estimates help to show that Canon is poised to see its sales and earnings skyrocket 
Canon revenues are projected to soar over 90  in the fourth quarter to reach as high as  9 89 billion  On top of that  the company s full year revenues are expected to surge over 15  to  36 64 billion 
The camera maker s earnings are also expected to climb based on our current consensus estimates  Canon s Q4 earnings are projected to shoot up over 115   For its full fiscal year  Canon s earnings are set to hit  1 97 per share  which would mark an impressive 65 55  year over year climb 
On top of these growth estimates  Canon also rocks  B  grades for both Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system  to help it earn an overall  A  VGM grade Canon  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Investors might also be happy to know that after experiencing a bit of a rough patch  Canon has topped earnings estimates in the trailing three quarters 
What s more  shares of Canon have climbed over 36  since the start of 2017  which crushes the S P 500 s 12 70  movement  as well as the  Office Automation and Equipment  industry s average 
Canon stock does currently sit near its 52 week high of  39 15 per share  but if the company can match our outsized growth estimates  shares of Canon should be able to easily storm into a new range

26370,247885,CAJ,Brexit  shock more bad news for Japan PM s stumbling  Abenomics ,news,"By Linda Sieg TOKYO  Reuters    Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s limping  Abenomics  revival program suffered a fresh blow on Friday when Britain s vote to leave the European Union sent the yen soaring and threatened to make companies and consumers even more cautious  The  Vote Leave  campaign claimed unexpected victory over its  Britain Stronger in Europe  rival  after 52 percent of Britons voted to support their plan to leave the 28 nation club  Abe took office in December 2012 pledging to end decades of deflation in Japan and generate growth in an economy plagued by a shrinking  fast ageing population with a mix of hyper easy monetary policy  fiscal spending and reforms  But the formula has largely failed  The central bank s aggressive money printing has failed to accelerate inflation  and anemic economic growth has discouraged firms from raising wages and households from spending    In terms of Abenomics  it was already dead in the water  This will certainly sink it a bit further   said Jeffrey Kingston  director of Asia studies at Temple University s Japan campus  The yen  seen as a safe haven currency  soared briefly above 100 to the dollar  prompting Finance Minister Taro Aso to signal a readiness to intervene to stem excessive strength  Japan s policymakers worry the unwelcome rise in the Japanese currency will hurt exports and drive the economy back toward recession  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters after meeting of relevant cabinet ministers that Britain s decision to leave the EU would have real effects on Japan s economy  The Nikkei share average ended down 7 9 percent at 14 952 02 points  and has lost 21 percent since the start of the year   In Japan  while we can expect to see a temporary surge in the value of the yen  the U K  s decision could also bring a halt to the economic recovery that had been underway   Fujio Mitarai  chairman of camera and printer maker Canon Inc  T 7751  said in a statement    We look to the Japanese government to implement strong monetary measures   Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the BOJ stands ready to provide ample liquidity to financial markets  Market players fear policy makers have few options left to stem the rise in the yen or to rev up the faltering economy  The yen had already risen around 15 percent against the dollar this year  threatening corporate profits  INTERVENTION  THEN     Short term  Japan can intervene to try to soften the currency s gains    If the yen strengthens too far below 100  the Finance Ministry is likely to look for the possibility of currency intervention in close connection with the U S  Treasury   said JP Morgan economist Masaaki Kanno  The Bank of Japan can also expand its already hyper easy monetary policy  if not at an emergency meeting  then at a scheduled policy board meeting on July 28 29  Kanno said    The BOJ will try to convince markets that there is still something in its toolbox  It could increase QE  quantitative easing  as well as cut negative rates   he said  Doubts over how Britain will interact with the EU leave Japanese companies with U K  headquarters and production facilities wondering how to proceed   What companies have to do is redraw their investment strategies     with a negative effect overall on the Japanese economy and on globalization  which is the trademark policy of Abenomics   said Martin Schulz  economist at Fujitsu Research Institute   Jesper Koll  CEO at WisdomTree Japan  said  however  corporate profits from Europe  including Britain  account for just 6 percent of all Japanese corporate profits  The bigger impact  he said  was uncertainty for Japanese banks and insurers  which rely on London markets for 25 35 percent of their funding   The impact of Brexit on Japan s commercial and industrial outlook is relatively marginal   Koll said in an emailed report  Economists estimated that  Brexit  fallout could cut 0 1 0 3 percentage points off Japan s gross domestic product  compared with a potential growth rate of 0 2 0 3 percent   Brexit  shock could further dampen corporate and consumer sentiment and spending  already weak spots in the Abenomics mix    Risk off  is not just a market issue  but companies looking at taking risk on the investment side   the result may be more savings   JP Morgan s Kanno said  Abe s government has already put off until October 2019 a planned sales tax rise to avoid a hit to consumption  It is also preparing a fiscal package for later this year  though how much it could top up that package is unclear  The  Brexit  blow comes as Abe campaigns for a July 10 upper house election that he is casting as a referendum on the sales tax rise delay and on  Abenomics  generally  Despite already growing doubts about the success of the formula  media surveys on Friday forecast Abe s ruling bloc was headed for a hefty win  The hit from  Brexit  was unlikely to change those forecasts  several political analysts said  but still  a surprise could not be ruled out

TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s anti monopoly regulator has approved Canon Inc s  T 7751  acquisition of Toshiba Corp s  T 6502  medical equipment unit  but issued a warning over the way they carried out the deal  which antitrust experts have called questionable 
Toshiba  hurt by an accounting scandal and in a hurry to raise cash before closing its books for the business year that ended in March  structured the 665 5 billion yen   6 5 billion  sale in an unorthodox way so that it could book proceeds before securing approval from regulators 
Some antitrust and accounting experts at the time said the method  involving the issuance of warrants to allow Toshiba to receive cash from Canon before regulatory approval  was problematic though not illegal 
The Fair Trade Commission  FTC  said on Thursday the method may be in violation of antitrust laws  However it did not issue any fine and approved the deal anyway 
 Canon thought the deal would be approved without problem if they used this method  They didn t consult with us in advance   FTC official Takeshi Shinagawa told reporters   If others use this method in the future they could get the red light  
Earlier  a person with direct knowledge of the matter said the commission had been investigating Canon for possible breach of disclosure rules related to the deal  The person was not authorized to speak to media and so declined to be identified 
Canon declined to comment  A Toshiba spokesman said the company had consulted with experts on the deal and that it saw no problem in the sale process from a legal perspective ",2016-06-30,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/japan-regulator-approves-canon-deal-to-buy-toshiba-unit,-warns-on-method-411497",411497

26396,247911,CAJ,Asian shares  dollar tread cautiously ahead of Fed meeting,news,"By Lisa Twaronite
TOKYO  Reuters    Asian shares were modestly higher while the dollar held steady on Tuesday  as investors awaited the outcome of the U S  Federal Reserve s two day meeting that begins later in the session for clues to the direction of U S  interest rates 
MSCI s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan  MIAPJ0000PUS  shrugged off early losses and a lackluster performance on Wall Street to rise about 0 3 percent 
But Japan s Nikkei stock average  N225  extended losses  shedding 0 8 percent on concerns over corporate earnings after disappointing results from Canon Inc  T 7751   despite upbeat economic data released before the market open 
Japanese retail sales in September rose 2 3 percent from a year earlier  government data showed  suggesting consumer spending is gradually picking up 
 Positive retail data is helping some retail stocks  but not strong enough to affect the whole market as investors are focused on the big overseas event now   said Takuya Takahashi  a strategist at Daiwa Securities 
The Fed is expected to announce the completion of its quantitative easing program and will likely reinforce its stated willingness to wait a long while before hiking interest rates after a volatile month in financial markets   With the end of the asset purchase program a foregone conclusion  speculation is once again mounting about the movement of interest rates   said Evan Lucas  market strategist at IG 
Data on Monday showed U S  services sector activity slowed in October to a six month low  while manufacturing output in Texas decreased  providing more evidence that the Fed has reason to wait before raising U S  interest rates 
The U S  dollar steadied after slipping overnight on expectations of more dovish comments from the Fed 
The dollar index   which tracks the U S  unit against six major rivals  was steady at 85 502 
The dollar was flat on the day against its Japanese counterpart at 107 81 yen   but remained below Monday s nearly three week high of 108 38 
The greenback inched up about 0 1 percent against the euro to  1 2711  
Germany s closely watched Ifo report of business sentiment on Monday showed the index hit its lowest level in almost two years in October  indicating that Europe s largest economy faces challenges 
U S  crude for December was down about 0 5 percent at  80 59 per barrel after dropping as low as  79 44 on Monday  its lowest level since June 2012  after Goldman Sachs cut its price forecasts  Concerns about weak global demand and booming supply continued to loom over the market 

Spot gold  recouped earlier losses to rise 0 2 percent to  1 228 60  pulling away from two week lows

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Live by the Sword  Die by the Sword  Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead  traders need their split screens  There are three big official government gatherings going on  Then  there is the start of major companies reporting on their latest third quarter earnings performances The tone has been good on earnings and terrible with governments   The Chinese meet    to mostly re elect their leaders  The Europeans meet    to stick it to the U K  on Brexit  Prosperous Catalans want to stick it to Spain  And the U S  government meets with Mexico and Canada    to stick it to them One of the major puzzles for economists like me  Why is all of the radically tough political posturing going on Consider this  The U K  will mark a 4 3  unemployment rate  Yet  that nation is furious  or stupid  enough to want to leave the Eurozone  Over in the USA  the harsh tone is no better understood  The U S  economy just marked a 4 2  unemployment rate  In Mexico  it is 3 4   Yet  the 25 year old North American Free Trade Agreement is on its way to the gallows Go figure This contempt for joint stability and prosperity starts where On Tuesday evening in the USA  the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China starts This huge meeting occurs every five years  The main purpose is to elect leaders and reaffirm leadership roles including through multiple powerful committees  The other order of business is to assign policy priorities over the coming five years One issue stands apart from the rest this time  President Xi Jinping s grip on power will be solidified  He is entering the second of the two permitted five year terms as leader Normally  this Congress would partly focus on anointing Xi s successor a half decade ahead of time  The fact that no successor is being groomed indicates to some Xi could be setting himself up for a longer term than tradition allows Next Thursday and Friday  there is a hard edged EU Leaders  Summit The EU s Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier recently said  we have reached a state of deadlock   This remark refers to negotiations on the UK s exit penalty EU leaders won t engage the U K  in talks over Brexit transition issues and a follow on trade agreement before a stiff penalty is paid up front  Therefore  this Summit has a  hard Brexit  tone  The next Summit is scheduled for December 14 15 In the USA  keep a close eye on NAFTA talks The U S  dramatically increased tensions in the talks by proposing a  sunset clause   This would force re negotiations of the  1 trillion pact every five years  Sources told Reuters the atmosphere at the talks is  horrible  Expect Mexico to suffer the most damage if NAFTA talks break down  Most of its exports go to the USA  Analysts expect growth to slow and the peso to weaken Mexico s finance minister  Jose Antonio Meade  said this on record  His country is analyzing tariffs and import substitution plans    in case NAFTA is scrapped The peso is near a five month low  Mexican stocks have lost almost  4  since mid August  And dollar bond prices have slipped across the curve  the 2026 issue trading at three month

26402,247917,CAJ,Bet On 5 Low Beta Stocks  Don t Panic About Market Volatility,opinion,In depth research and a thorough understanding of the capital market holds the key to success when it comes to the field of investment  Simply following the crowd and investing in stocks will not always generate healthy returns  Only a bull market will favor the strategy but a bearish market could take returns from risky assets to a rock bottom We have framed a strategy that clearly shows that investors could earn healthy returns from less risky stocks also Beta UnderstandingBeta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of a security s price movement relative to the market  In this article  we are considering the S P 500 as the market If a stock has beta of 1 then the price of the stock will move with the market  So  the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1  In the same way  the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1 For example  if the market offers a return of 20   a stock with beta of 3 will return 60   which is overwhelming  Similarly  when the market slips 20  the stock will sink 60   which is devastating Building a Low Risk PortfolioWe have taken beta between 0 and 0 6 as our prime criterion for screening stocks that are less volatile than the market  But this should not be the only factor to be considered while selecting a winning strategy  We need to take into account other parameters that can add value to the portfolio Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero  This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank equal to 1  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening Headquartered in Manhattan Beach  CA  SKECHERS USA  Inc    NYSE SKX   is the manufacturer and distributer of varieties of lifestyle footwear  Over the last 30 days  the 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised upward  Also  we are expecting the company to report year over year earnings growth of 7 4  for 2017 The Boston Beer Company  Inc    NYSE SAM    based in Boston  MA  is among the leading craft brewers

period while the STOXX 600 has increased nearly 20  in U S  dollar terms Further  the recovery in developed economies has benefited the export oriented countries of Asia  According to Bloomberg  companies listed on the MSCI Asia Pacific index are projected to post average earnings growth of 13  during the current quarter  This is nearly twice as much as projections for the S P 500  despite the fact that the index has breached several milestones this year Hang Seng  Kospi  Nikkei Among Region s Big WinnersThe Nikkei 225 briefly moved above the 23 000 mark for the first time in 25 years before ending the day 0 2  lower  Encouraging earnings results and a resilient economy have helped Japan s benchmark index breach multiple records over this year  The softening of the Yen and prime minister Abe s resounding victory in the recently held snap poll have added to the factors powering the index consistently higher  Meanwhile  other benchmarks across the region  ranging from India to South Korea are also lingering close to record levels On Tuesday  the S P ASX 200  Australia s benchmark index  moved above 6 000 for the first time since the beginning of the 2008 crisis

26428,247943,CAJ,Asian business sentiment rebounds in fourth quarter with India most optimistic,news,"By Tommy Wilkes
NEW DELHI  Reuters    Business sentiment among Asia s top companies rebounded in the fourth quarter to the second highest level in almost three years  a Thomson Reuters INSEAD survey showed  helped by a stronger U S  economy and a plunge in oil prices 
The Thomson Reuters INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index increased to 72 in the fourth quarter from 66 in the previous three months  The result was only slightly below the 74 reading of the second quarter which was the highest since early 2012  A reading above 50 indicates an overall positive outlook 
Indian businesses provided the biggest boost to the index  with companies reporting a maximum score of 100 for the third consecutive quarter as they look to new Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speed up economic recovery 
Corporations in China  where worries about a slowdown in economic growth persist  were among the least positive with a reading of 50  coming in below Japan  which is stuck in recession  at 56 
U S  unemployment fell to a six year low in November  a signal that the world s biggest economy and a key export destination for Asian companies is healthier and its consumers are growing in confidence 
 The U S  s economic leadership is influencing expectations across the world  and the U S  is really becoming stronger   said Antonio Fatas  a Singapore based economics professor at INSEAD 
 Asia is a region where there is not massive uncertainty related to political risk  This is a region that grows with the world  
The rosier picture in the United States coincided with oil prices falling to five year lows  boosting Asian economies dependent on imports of crude 
Fatas cautioned that uncertainty remained  not least in China where investors and companies are  sitting and waiting for data  to indicate how dramatically growth in Asia s largest economy is slowing 
Global economic uncertainty remained the biggest concern for Asian businesses during the quarter  the survey showed  as well as rising costs and other risks such as regulatory change 
 I am surprised that the U S  and oil prices seem to have outweighed concerns about China and Europe  The downside risks to China s growth are significant  especially related to real estate and shadow banking   said Dariusz Kowalczyk  a senior economist at Credit Agricole 
Companies participating in the survey included Japanese drugs maker Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd  T 4568   South Korea s Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd  KS 009540  and Indian real estate developer DLF Ltd  NS DLF  
The poll  by Thomson Reuters in association with INSEAD  a global management and business school  was conducted from Dec  1 13 
Of the 116 companies that responded  51 percent gave a positive outlook  while 42 percent reported a neutral outlook and 7 percent were negative 
AUSTRALIA  TAIWAN UP  JAPAN STAYS WEAK
Oil prices plunged during the quarter as supplies flooded the market while economic growth and energy demand were limited 
Frederic Neumann  co head of Asian economic research at HSBC  said the fall was a  big relief for many Asian manufacturing exporters  and probably helped outweigh continued worries about the global economy 
 There are still lingering risks but the risks are probably manageable  Even though global growth is disappointing  businesses are more optimistic because they see moves toward structural reforms   he said  referring to policy changes in India  Indonesia and China 
In Australia   this year s chair of the Group of 20 major economies   companies were more positive  The country scored 85  up from 75 in the last quarter  while sentiment in Taiwan turned positive  jumping to 71 from 33 
The Philippines suffered the steepest decline in optimism  with a drop to 67 from 83  while Japanese sentiment remained poor as respondents worried about the domestic economy 
Positive sentiment among building firms was highest  doubling from last quarter to a one year high of 100  This was followed by property developers with a score of 87 versus 63  and retail  which jumped to 84 from 63 to its best level since the survey began in 2009 
Shipping and financial companies were the least positive 
INSEAD s Fatas said the oil price fall was likely still being digested by individual Asian companies and would filter through to more positive outlooks across sectors in coming months 

 My expectation is that the next quarter will be better than this one

The Nikkei 225 rose to 16 957 86  but investors cast an eye on China  where the benchmark Shanghai Composite index plunged almost 6  after regulators cracked down on rule violations for margin trading  which has helped fuel an extended rally

26432,247947,CAJ,Nikkei s  pink  un  buy highlights need to escape greying Japan,news,"By Denny Thomas
HONG KONG  Reuters    In splashing  1 3 billion for Britain s Financial Times  media group Nikkei is just the latest in a string of Japanese companies driven to look overseas to escape poor growth prospects from a rapidly aging domestic population 
Flush with abundant bank funds available at near zero interest rates  and bolstered by stock markets at multi year highs  Japan Inc is not short of capital to plough into overseas bids in search of profits that remain stubbornly hard to generate at home 
Japanese corporations have in the past faced criticism for moving too slowly on the acquisition trail  but Thursday s last minute bid by Nikkei to snatch the famous pink hued newspaper from under the nose of Germany s  Axel Springer   DE SPRGn  suggests they are getting better at it 
 Japan corporates are definitely wanting to acquire more  Corporate profits have risen a lot and with that has come increased confidence for CEOs to make quick decisions   said Mark Williams  head of investment banking for Asia ex Japan at Nomura   They are far more receptive to international ideas and we definitely see more deals coming  
Nikkei s coup was followed on Friday by a bigger deal from life insurer Meiji Yasudas Life Insurance Co  MEIJY UL   which agreed to buy StanCorp Financial Group  N SFG  for  5 billion 
That deal nudged Japan past China to become Asia s biggest acquiring nation this year  according to Thomson Reuters data 
After hitting an annual record of  83 billion in 2012  Japanese outbound activity has slowed  but companies are making a renewed pushed this year  partly under pressure to improve efficiency 
In 2015  Japanese companies have launched  53 5 billion worth of deals and are on track for the country s second best M A year on record  In comparison  Chinese companies have announced  50 billion deals in the same period 
Deals earlier this year have included Japan Post s  5 billion acquisition of Australia s Toll Holdings  AX TOL  and Canon Inc s  T 7751  purchase of Swedish video surveillance firm  Axis  AB  ST AXIS  
BLEAK DEMOGRAPHICS
A major driver is that  over the longer term  Japan s demographics give a bleak prognosis for domestic demand 
The population has been falling for a decade and is projected to drop from 127 million to 87 million by 2060  40 percent of whom will be over 65 
 It highlights the relentless desire to basically spread their wings  recognizing that the Japanese economy is a greying one and the capital that they have has to be put to work elsewhere   one person familiar with the FT deal said 
Meanwhile  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s so called  Abenomics  policies  including a program of unprecedented monetary stimulus  is giving the country s companies easy access to cheap cash 
Japan s new corporate governance code that came into force last month is putting greater focus on profitability and capital efficiency  and a successful acquisition is the best way to achieve it  bankers say 
That is also putting pressure on Japanese companies to deploy their cash balances  which Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  estimated reached 87 trillion yen   702 billion  in fiscal year 2014 
Bankers are expecting deal flows to pick up as  despite the recent flurry of activity  still only 7 percent of Japanese corporates cash deployment was for M A between 2005 and 2013  while a chunky 57 percent went on capital expenditure  Goldman Sachs said 

 They certainly have a lot of money in the system now  The cost of funding is very  very low too  but there s not much that you can do to deploy in Japan   the person who worked on the FT deal added ",2015-07-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nikkei's-'pink-'un'-buy-highlights-need-to-escape-greying-japan-352758,352758

26559,248074,CAJ,Japan Stocks Up Amid Weaker Asian Trade,opinion,"Asian equities were mostly down on Wednesday with the exception of Japan  where shares edged higher after a stronger greenback pressed the yen lower 
The Nikkei Stock Average rose 0 8 percent in the previous session  while Australia s S P ASX 200 lost 1 1 percent and Korea s KOSPI declined 0 3 percent 
 Overall  the market is more cautious than bearish   a market analyst stated 
The US dollar soared on expectations that the Federal Reserve was hanging closer to increasing interest rates  The greenback jumped 1 1 percent against the Japanese currency in US trade  while the US dollar index   which measures the strength of the currency against a basket of major currencies   reached a one month high 
This boosted shares of Japanese exporters  which gain from a weaker yen  Toyota Motor Corp Ltd Ord  NYSE TM  climbed 2 1 percent and Nissan Motor Co   Ltd   T 7201  was up 1 4 percent  On the other hand  leading camera maker Canon Inc   NYSE CAJ  added 1 7 percent 
The hike in Japanese stocks came even as the most recent data suggests that the country s industrial output remained unchanged in July  underperforming economists estimates for an increase of 0 8 percent  following a 2 3 percent jump in June 
While the country s stocks have pulled back on concerns of higher US interest rates  market experts claim that fears of capital outflows are excessive  That is due to strong growth and high yields in Japan s markets would sustain capital in emerging markets 
 The result of U S  payrolls data will drive market speculation over the upcoming rate hike   an investment analyst said  The data will possibly determine whether the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates as early as September 
Elsewhere in Asia  the Shanghai Composite Index inched 0 1 percent higher  Hong Kong s Hang Seng was roughly lower  as Chinese lenders got a lift from their first half earnings reports 
Hong Kong traded equities of the Bank of China soared 1 2 percent after it announced late Tuesday a 2 5 percent on year hike in the first half net profit  boosted by strong growth in fee income 
In Korea  shares of shipping company Hyundai Merchant Marine  KS 011200  rose 21 percent after the government motivated the company to acquire the healthy assets of Hanjin Shipping Co   KS 117930   which is wavering on the verge of bankruptcy after a move by its creditors to slash financial support 
 The government will actively look for ways for Hyundai to take over ships  business networks and its workforce if Hanjin files for receivership   explained Jeong Eun bo  vice chairman of South Korea s Financial Services Commission 
Meanwhile  shares of Singapore Airlines Ltd   OTC SINGY  traded lower for the fourth consecutive session  and was previously down 0 2 percent on the escalation of the Zika virus in the city state 
The company claims almost half of the market share of passenger traffic through Singapore s Changi Airport

Crude Oil traded at  46 33 per barrel on the New York ahead the release of government data on Wednesday  which is a forecast to show US stockpiles added 1 3 million barrels in the previous week  The price soared 11 percent this month amid theory that informal talks among OPEC members in Algeria next month will lead to a production freeze 
On the other hand  gold was on track for a monthly loss of nearly 3 percent as the potential of a Fed rate increase dims the appeal of assets that don t bear interest

26561,248076,CAJ,HP Inks Deal With Samsung  Launches Multifunction Printers,opinion,"Leading personal computer manufacturer  HP Inc    NYSE HPQ   recently signed a deal to acquire Samsung  KS 005930  Electronics  printer business for a purchase price of  1 05 billion  This acquisition is expected to close within twelve months and is subject to regulatory approvals The acquisition is a strategic move by HP  as it will expand the company s printing business as Samsung s printer business has more than 6 500 printing patents  All these will support development and manufacturing of HP printers  going forward Rationale Behind the DealHP is one of the two publicly traded entities that were formed after the Nov 2015 split of Hewlett Packard Company  The split also led to the formation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company   NYSE HPE    HP focuses on PC and printing products and services Over the past few quarters  HP has been losing market share to its Japanese rivals   Canon Inc    NYSE CAJ   and Espon   due to intense price competition  These Japanese manufacturers have been able to slash prices due to a weaker yen compared to the U S  dollar Although HP is still the biggest printer manufacturer in the world as per IDC  the company s market shrunk 420 basis points  bps  year over year to 36 6  in second quarter 2016  In the same quarter  however  Canon and Espon s market share expanded 100 bps and 220 bps  respectively Furthermore  HP s recently released third quarter fiscal 2016 results showed a 14  year over year decline in printing revenues to  4 432 billion  primarily due to an 18  plunge in supplies revenues and weak performance at the hardware segment  HP s total hardware unit sales were down 10  primarily due to a decline of 2  and 14  in Commercial hardware units and Consumer hardware units  respectively Thus  we believe that the acquisition of Samsung s printing operations could help HP turn around the printer business  The transaction will not only eliminate a major competitor but also help to control prices  Apart from this  the acquisition will also give HP access to Samsung s partners and strengthen the former s position across various geographies On the other hand  the spin off is considered to be part of a broader restructuring process at Samsung as part of which the company is trimming its business through the divestiture of non core assets  Hence  we believe that the divestment of its printer business will unlock investments for the company and help it to focus better on its core segments Product LaunchSeparately  the company also unveiled the all new A3 multifunction printers  MFPs  designed to disrupt the traditional  55 billion A3 copier category According to the company   The complexity of traditional copiers makes repair and maintenance too inefficient for our partners and customers   It also added  By leveraging our superior printing technology  we can change the status quo with next generation A3 multifunction printers that improve the overall customer and partner experience while also serving as a springboard for growth in managed print and document services  This is what we mean by reinventing printing  ConclusionThe persistent decline in PC shipments is a substantial headwind for HP  As the PC business generates over 60  of its total revenue  the reduction in business volume at the segment is a concern  The company is also witnessing a secular decline in this segment due to the ongoing shift toward tablets and smartphones  a space in which it is yet to gain a foothold We believe that with the strategic partnership with Samsung s printing business and the continuous product launches  the company will generate higher revenues in the upcoming quarters  Also  the move will help the company to focus better on the PC and printing businesses However  macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near term concerns  Competition from International Business Machines   NYSE IBM   and Accenture adds to its woes  HP INC Price

In April this year   led by Apex Technology Co   Ltd   Apex  and PAG Asia Capital  PAG   Legend Capital Management Co   Ltd   Legend Capital  was also one of the buyers  Per the agreement  the consortium will acquire Lexmark for  3 6 billion or  40 50 per share in cash 
The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    NYSE GS   served as the exclusive financial advisor to Lexmark  while Wachtell  Lipton  Rosen   Katz constituted its legal counsel 
The transaction  which all the parties expect to close by the end of this year  is now required to be cleared by China s State Administration of Foreign Exchange 
Potential Integration
According to Lexmark  the integration is fully aligned with the company s mission of alleviating pain  restoring growth and opportunity  and addressing customers  need while providing new prospects for employees  The transaction is expected to meaningfully accelerate growth strategies for Lexmark s hardware  software and managed print services solution  by expanding the business in the Asia Pacific region 
According to Paul Rooke  Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer   This is an exciting transaction that Lexmark s Board of Directors believes is in the best interests of our shareholders following an exhaustive strategic alternatives review process to maximize value  
Bottom Line
Lexmark s second quarter results were not very encouraging given the earnings miss  Also  both earnings and revenues decreased on a year over year basis primarily due to a strong U S  dollar  a decline in non MPS revenues  and the company s exit from the Inkjet business 
In our opinion  the deal will be beneficial for Lexmark as it has been struggling amid changing industry dynamics 
Competition from players like Canon Inc    NYSE CAJ    Xerox Corp  NYSE XRX   and HP Inc    NYSE HPQ   are additional concerns 
Currently  Lexmark has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   You can see

26883,248398,CAJ,4 Stocks That Will Benefit From A Weaker Yen,opinion,"Fears of the fallout from a surprise Brexit vote had sent investors scurrying toward a range of safe haven investment like gold  the dollar and the yen  However  the dollar surged to a two week high on Tuesday as investors displayed a renewed propensity for risk taking 
This was primarily a result of the victory of Japan s ruling coalition over the weekend  The win set off speculation that fresh stimulus measures would be initiated in order to boost the country s economy 
Fresh Stimulus Expected
Early last month  prime minister Shinzo Abe had promised to take strong measures in order to stimulate economic growth  On June 1  he said that this would primarily come about in the form of a large fiscal stimulus package  Estimates about the size of the package vary from 10 to 20 trillion yen  Meanwhile  Abe announced that a proposed hike in sales tax rates would be deferred 
Earlier this week  Abe said that he would provide instructions to the Economy Minister so that he could begin work on the specifics of such a package  A meeting between Abe and former Fed chief Ben Bernanke heightened speculation about such stimulus measures 
One step which was widely expected to be taken was providing  helicopter money  or direct cash transfers to citizens  However  a senior cabinet official denied that such a measure was being considered  helping the yen curb its two day losses 
But expectations of further monetary easing continue to linger  The Bank of Japan has set negative interest rates earlier in the year while its asset purchase program continues  However  it is still far from achieving its inflation target and continues to battle a stronger yen 
Exporters to Gain from Weaker Yen
Despite the lack of clarity on the exact nature of the stimulus package  it is likely that steps will be taken to control the surging yen  For an export oriented economy  it is crucial that such steps are taken  According to estimates from Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS   and JP Morgan   NYSE JPM    Japan s auto companies are likely to experience a 17 18  reduction of their operating profit for the entire year due to the impact of the yen s increase 
Technology exporters are among those companies which will also be hit  Many of them are already worried about the potential fallout of Brexit on Europe  The region does not represent significant opportunities for growth  However  as an important consumer of cutting edge technology  it remains a crucial revenue source for manufacturers of technological products  This is equally true for companies providing technological services 
4 Japanese Stocks Likely to Benefit
An increase in the yen s value hurts exporters since it reduces the worth of earnings abroad  This in turn forces them to reduce cuts  which in turn stops wage increases  In such an event it would be difficult for the Japanese central bank to meet its inflation target 
On the other hand a fall in the value of the yen  as a result of stimulus measures will make these companies more profitable  This is because their products would become more competitive because prices would fall and profits repatriated would be higher 
Honda Motor Co   Ltd    NYSE HMC   is a major developer  manufacturer and distributor of automobiles  motorcycles and related products across the world  The stock is in the red year to date  but has gained 0 5  over the last one month 
Toyota Motor Corp    NYSE TM   is another Japanese automobile major  According to one estimate  a one yen increase against the dollar reduces the company s profit by 40 billion yen  The stock has gained 2 2  and 4 8  over the last three months and one month  respectively 
Canon Inc    NYSE CAJ   produces  cameras  printers  copiers  multifunction devices and related equipment  According to its own estimates a one yen rise versus the dollar reduces annual operating profit by 3 9 billion yen  The stock has gained 1 9  over the last one month 
Olympus Corp    OTC OCPNY   manufactures and sells instruments and precision machinery on a global basis  The company has already fortified itself against forex risks via hedging  but is likely to gain from a weaker yen ",2016-07-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-stocks-that-will-benefit-from-a-weaker-yen-200141647,200141647

26903,248418,CAJ,Recession Won t Be Fun  But Should Be Better Than Last Time,opinion,"Monday  I mentioned the likelihood that a recession is coming  The indicators for this are mostly from the manufacturing side of the economic ledger  and they are at this point merely suggestive  For example  the ISM Manufacturing Index is at 50 2  below which level we often see deeper downdrafts  see chart  source Bloomberg  

Capacity Utilization  which never got back to the level over 80  that historically worries the Fed about inflation  has been slipping back again  see chart  source Bloomberg  

We have to be a bit careful of these  classic  indicators because of the increased weight of mining and exploration in GDP compared with the last few cycles  A good part of the downturn in Capacity Utilization  I suspect  could be traced to weakness in the oil patch  But at the same time  we cannot blithely dismiss the manufacturing weakness as being  all about oil  in the same way that Clinton supporters once dismissed Oval Office shenanigans as being  all about sex  
Oil matters  in this economy  In fact  I would go so far as to say that while historically a declining oil price was a boon to the nation as a whole  which is why we never suffered much from the Asian Contagion  the plunge in commodity prices tended to support the U S   which is generally a net consumer of resources   in this cycle low oil prices are probably neutral at best  and may even be contractionary for the country as a whole 
Whether we have a recession in the near term  meaning beginning in the next six months or so  or further in the future  here is one point that is important to make  It will not be a  garden variety  recession  in all likelihood  That is not because we have boomed so much  but because we are levered so much  There are no more  garden variety  recessions 
Financial leverage in an economy  just as in individual businesses  increases economic volatility  So does operational leverage  which means  deploying fixed capital rather than variable inputs such as labor   technology  typically   And our economy has both in spades  The chart below  source  Bloomberg  shows the debt of domestic businesses as a percentage of GDP  Businesses are currently more levered than they were in 2007  both in raw debt figures and as a percentage of GDP 

Investors fearing recession should shift equity allocations  to the extent some equity allocation is retained  to less levered businesses  But be careful  some investors think of growth companies as being low leverage but tech companies  for example  in fact have very high operating leverage even if financial leverage is low  Both are bad when earnings decline   and growth firms typically have less of a margin of safety on price  I tried to do a screen on low debt  low PE  high dividend non tech companies with decent market caps and didn t find very much  Canon  NYSE CAJ   Guess  Inc  NYSE GES  to name a couple of examples and neither of those have low P E ratios   I don t like to invest in individual stocks in any event but I mention these for readers who do   these aren t recommendations and I neither own them nor plan to  but may be worth some further research if you are looking for names  
On the plus side  economically speaking  relatively heavy personal income taxation also acts as an automatic stabilizer  On the minus side  this is less true if the tax system is heavily progressive  since it isn t the higher paid employees who tend to be the ones who are laid off  except on Wall Street  where it is currently de rigueur to cut experienced  expensive staff and retain less experienced  cheaper staff   Back on the plus side  a large welfare system tends to be an automatic stabilizer as well  On the minus side  all of these fiscal stabilizers merely move growth from the future to the present  so the deeper the recession the slower the future growth 
And  of course   there is nothing that central banks can really do about this  unless it is to make policy rates negative to spur additional extension of negative NPV loans  that is  loans to less creditworthy borrowers   I am not sure that even our central bank  with its unhealthy fear of the cleansing power of recession  thinks that s a good idea 
There is some good news  as we brace for this next recession  while overall levels of debt are higher for businesses  financials  and households  the debt burden compared to GDP is lower for households and especially for domestic financial institutions  see chart  source Bloomberg  

Our banks are in relatively good health  compared with their condition headed into the last downturn  So this will not be a calamity  as in 2008  But I don t expect it to only be a  mild  recession  either   as if any recession ever feels mild to individuals ",2015-10-07,Michael Ashton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/recession-won’t-be-fun…but-better-than-last-time-267306,267306

26979,248494,CAJ,Trading Asia  Beware Of Parabolic Moves ,opinion,Many of you may know the old saying   what goes up must come down   Well  the Nikkei 225 Index  Japanese stock index  has been soaring higher as of late  The catalyst for the recent rally in the Nikkei 225 Index has once again been caused by money printing and the promise of more of it by the Japanese government  The Japanese yen  Japan s currency  has been plummeting against most other major currencies including the U S  dollar  and the euro  A falling yen will usually help to increase exports  At this time  it seems that most central banks around the world are taking a page out the Federal Reserve s  U S  central bank  book  They are all trying to inflate there way out of the deflationary pressures that have been plaguing most major economies in 2008 This time around  the Japanese government is printing money like never before  inflating the Nikkei 225 Index from a low 8619 45 made on November 13  2012 to a high of 10 952 31 made on January 15  2012  Please understand  the Nikkei 225 Index has gained more than 2300 0 points in roughly two months This type of stock market move is unsustainable for any stock or index  A good rule of thumb is to simply look at a stock chart from the last pivot low to the high  If the the move on the chart is steeper than 60 0 degrees from low to high than it is usually unsustainable and will will pullback sharply  Monday night  the Nikkei 225 Index sold off by more than 1 50 percent  While this is a large one day decline  the market can certainly decline much further  A pullback in the Nikkei 225 Index down to toward the 9600 00 level would be a natural correction from its recent surge Many of the leading Japanese ADR s such as Toyota Motor Corporation  ADR   TM   Canon Inc   ADR   CAJ   Honda Motor Co Ltd  ADR   HMC   and Sony Corporation  ADR   SNE  have recently soared higher along Nikkei 225 Index  This tells us that if the Japan stock market pulls back  the Japanese ADR s could pullback as well  So traders should now prepare for a pullback in many of the Japanese stocks that are traded here in the United States  Traders can also follow and trade the Nikkei 225 Index by using the iShares MSCI Japan Index  ETF   EWJ  ,2013-01-23,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trading-asia:-beware-of-parabolic-moves-151794,151794

27099,248614,CAJ,Nikkei drops  pressured by JPMorgan  Olympus,news,"  Benchmark remains above 25 day moving average
   Olympus plunges as much as 17 pct after president steps
down

 By Lisa Twaronite	
 TOKYO  Oct 14  Reuters    The Nikkei stock average dropped
on Friday  pressured by news that the president of Olympus Corp
stepped down after management differences  and by weak results
overnight from JPMorgan Chase   Co  	
 Olympus shares plunged as much as 17 3 percent and
was the heaviest traded share by turnover  after the camera and
endoscope maker said on Friday that its president Michael
Woodford would step down after major differences over the
direction of management  	
  The Nikkei shed 0 8 percent to 8 757 60  but
remains well above its 25 day moving average of 8 645  which is
considered a bullish sign  The broader Topix index 
declined 1 percent to 751 62 	
  Investors appear to have sold futures after the Olympus
news  although it s clearly specific to one company and should
not have a big long term impact on the overall market   said
Koichi Ogawa  a chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments 	
 Instead  he said  investors were taking cues from U S 
earnings  and had also been awaiting Chinese inflation data for
any hint on whether that country might widen its scope for
policy easing to support growth  September CPI was in line with
forecasts  	
 Europe s debt problems remain a concern  strategists said 
even though many investors now expect a worst case scenario will
be avoided 	
 Ratings agency Standard and Poor s reminded investors that
the region s problems are far from over  downgrading the
long term credit rating of Spain late Thursday by one notch to
AA  from AA with a negative outlook  due to weak growth 
tightening fiscal conditions and high private sector debt 
 	
 U S earnings so far have offered mixed signals 	
 Google said on Thursday that its revenue exceeded
Wall Street s expectations   	
 But before the bell  JPMorgan Chase   Co was the
biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average after
the second largest U S  lender reporting a drop in its
third quarter net profit  	
 Olympus shares were down 13 6 percent  and had already
traded at nearly 8 times their 30 day average of full day
volume 	
 Canon Inc shed 2 6 percent to 3 445 yen and was the
fifth most heavily traded share by turnover  as Thailand s worst
floods in five decades forced it and other manufacturers to halt
production

   Unilateral intervention effect may be short lived fund
manager

 By Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  Aug 22  Reuters    The Nikkei stock average inched
higher on Monday after Japanese authorities threatened to
intervene to stem further rises in the yen and protect the
profits of key exporters such as Canon Inc  	
 Investors were wary of buying actively  however  and the
Nikkei spent the morning session bobbing in and out of negative
territory  reflecting persistent worries over the health of the
U S  economy and of European banks      	
  Investors are scared to sell significantly as they expect
the government to take action  Even if it intervenes in the
currency market the effect may be short lived   said Mitsushige
Akino  a fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management 	
  If the government unilaterally intervenes in the currency
market the Nikkei may regain some 100 points  but Japan s
efforts alone will not change fundamentals  	
 The benchmark Nikkei closed the morning session up
0 2 percent at 8 735 57  The broader Topix index was
down 0 1 percent at 750 78 	
 Market players are increasingly on edge about the
possibility that Japan may intervene in the wake of the dollar s
slide to a record low around 75 95 yen late last week 	
 After the close of the morning stock session  the dollar
briefly surged above 77 yen amid talk of bids by a U S  bank 
But it quickly paired those gains and was currently trading
around 76 8 yen  	
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Monday that
authorities would take decisive action against speculative moves
in the currency markets  signalling Tokyo s readiness to
intervene to check yen strength  	
 Shares of camera and office equipment maker Canon rose 1 3
percent to 3 510 yen while rival Nikon Inc gained 1 7
percent to 1 637 yen  Other exporters fell  however  with Toyota
Motor Corp dropping 1 6 percent to 2 725 yen 	
 
 U S  RECESSION FEARS	
 On Friday  U S  stocks fell after Hewlett Packard s 
weaker outlook and corporate shakeup added to uncertainty for
investors  It was the latest discouraging event in a month full
of bad surprises ranging from a U S  credit rating downgrade to
a sharp slowdown in world growth  	
 Analysts said investors are awaiting a speech by Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Aug  26 in Jackson Hole 
Wyoming  for hints on how policymakers plan to handle the
turmoil in financial markets 	
  Investors want to see if U S  markets will have a technical
rebound tonight as they fell sharply at the end of last week  
said Yutaka Miura  a senior technical analyst at Mizuho
Securities   It they slide again  repercussions in the Japanese
market will likely be serious  	
 He said the market is closely watching the Nikkei to see if
it sets a new five month low beyond 8 656 hit on Aug  9 	
 Shares of Inaba Seisakusho gained 6 3 percent to
863 yen after the producer of steel storage units raised its
operating profit estimate on Friday for the year ended July 31
to 470 million yen from 60 million yen  as cost cutting measures
offset the impact of higher steel prices   	
 Shares of Resort Trust were up 3 4 percent at 1 254
yen after Daiwa Capital Markets raised its rating on the
membership hotel operator to  outperform  from  hold   citing
better than  expected business at its hotel restaurants  which
rose to record high rates in July 	
 Volume was thin with 803 million shares changing hands on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange s main board  Daily volume is likely to
be slightly lower than last week s average of 1 7 billion
shares 	
  1   76 245 Japanese Yen

   Technical rebound eyed as RSI below 30 longest since Oct
2008

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO  Aug 12  Reuters    Tokyo stocks dipped further below
the 9 000 line on Friday  extending hefty losses sustained
during the most volatile week since the March 11 earthquake as
the yen s strength prompted foreigners to sell carmakers 
pulling Toyota Motor to its lowest level this year 	
 The Nikkei s loss took it 12 percent below its post quake
closing high  hit on July 8  after a spike in volatility across
markets on rumours about the health of European banks  mounting
questions about the stability of funding markets and authorities
struggling to solve a crisis of confidence in Europe 	
  It s a great shame  but during this week I had to
completely overhaul my strategy for this year   said Takashi
Aoki  a senior fund manager at Mizuho Asset Management  adding
that Friday s losses were exacerbated by a fall in U S  stock
futures and position tweaking ahead of the weekend 	
  We were ready to take more risk on  betting on a rebound in
corporate earnings and the post quake recovery  but now I m
taking a much more cautious stance  	
 Other institutional investors took a similar approach 
piling into domestic demand related and defensive sectors such
as pharmaceuticals and retailers  while dumping the likes of
Honda Motor Corp   which was down 12 percent on the
week  and Hitachi   which ended the week 7 percent
lower 	
 The Nikkei lost 0 2 percent on Friday to end at
8 963 72  while the broader Topix fell 0 4 to 768 19 
The Nikkei was down 3 6 percent on the week 	
 The move away from yen sensitive and globally exposed
large cap blue chip exporters bolstered the most outstanding
rally of the week  that of social networking service operator
Gree Inc  	
 Gree rocketed up nearly 30 percent for the week in heavy
turnover  hitting all time highs time and again  after punchy
earnings and a solid outlook at the beginning of the week
prompted JPMorgan to hike the stock s rating to  buy   On Friday
it rose 4 5 percent to 2 283 yen  	
 Gree s startling ascent contrasted with the fall of gaming
giant Nintendo   which hit its lowest intra day level
since May 2004  closing down 4 6 percent at 10 900 yen a day
after it started selling the Nintendo 3DS handheld game device
with a much reduced price tag in Japan 	
 Some of the selling in exporters was offset by dip buyers
who chased the battered stocks of financials higher  reflecting
a rebound in the sector on Wall Street  Dai ichi Life Insurance
 added 2 2 percent to 93 000 yen  boosted by a hike in
April June core profit  and T D Holdings advanced 0 3
percent to 1 624 yen 	
 Volumes ahead of the weekend eased from this week s highs 
with 2 0 billion shares changing hands on the main board  in
line with the last week s daily average	
 A mild uptick in sentiment was apparent as players scooped
up stocks of some energy related companies such as Japan s
largest oil and gas developer Inpex Corp   which gained
2 4 percent despite falls in prices of oil 	
 Market players said Friday s falls were limited as investor
confidence was boosted after purchases of exchange traded funds
to the tune of 25 6 billion yen   333 million  carried out by
the Bank of Japan the day before and by hopes for a technical
rebound next week 	
 The Nikkei s 14 day RSI  a measure of momentum that is used
to indicate overbought or oversold conditions  was below 30 for
the whole week    the oversold threshold  That is the longest
string of days below 30 since the depths of the financial crisis
in late 2008 	
  Investors confirmed that the bottom  even in these
circumstances  lurks around 8 600 and we can probably say we
touched the second post quake low there   said Takashi Hiroki 
chief strategist at Monex Securities  adding that further rises
on the Tokyo market hinge on developments in Europe and the U S 	
 Shares of Canon Inc jumped 5 6 percent to 3 590 yen
after it said on Thursday it plans to buy back up to 1 2 percent
of its outstanding shares  while Toyota Motor slipped 1 1
percent to 2 819 yen  its lowest level since Nov 1 	
 Decliners outpaced advancing shares by a ratio of 5 to 4 	
   1   76 780 Japanese Yen

   Nikkei may see more gains if dollar rises vs yen  fund
manager
   Canon  Kao bought after robust earning reports
   U S  debt impasse may slow market s steady gains  analysts
   Utilities lower on report of rising fuel costs

 By Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  July 26  Reuters    The Nikkei stock average rose on
Tuesday  helped by companies such as Canon and Kao Corp
 that reported robust quarterly earnings and gave strong
profit forecasts  offsetting the dampening impact of the
strengthening yen 	
 Market players said sporadic buying by Asian investors was
detected on Tuesday but concerns about a deadlock in U S  talks
to raise the debt ceiling left investors wary  although most
expect lawmakers to clinch a deal before the Aug  2 deadline 	
 U S  debt worries are also driving the Japanese yen towards
a record high against the dollar  denting optimism that Japanese
manufacturers  whose exports are undermined by a strong Japanese
currency  will continue to recover steadily from the damage
caused by the March 11 earthquake 	
 In the morning  the dollar hit a four month low of 77 883
yen on trading platform EBS  edging closer to a record
low of 76 25 yen hit in March 	
 Despite such ominous external factors  however  strong
earnings from the Japanese corporate sector are lifting investor
sentiment 	
  Investors are confident that Japanese companies can
generate profits even with current foreign exchange rates   said
a portfolio manager at a U S  asset management firm  who
declined to be quoted by name 	
  If the dollar stays near 80 yen  there probably won t be a
big sell off  and if it rises towards 82 yen  the Nikkei may
head towards 10 500  	
 Camera and office equipment maker Canon rose 3 0
percent to 3 900 yen and was the second most actively traded
stock by turnover  after it posted better than expected
quarterly profits and raised its annual forecast following a
rapid recovery from supply chain woes triggered by the March 11
earthquake  	
 The world s biggest camera maker set assumed rates of 80 yen
to the dollar and 115 yen to the euro for
July December  compared with current rates around 78 yen per
dollar and 112 98 yen per euro 	
 
 EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS	
 The benchmark Nikkei was up 0 7 percent at 10 124 79
in early afternoon trade  The broader Topix index gained
0 8 percent to 869 01 	
 But market participants said that  while further gains could
be expected depending on corporate earnings results  the uptrend
may not be a smooth one 	
  It s difficult to bid stocks up further from here unless we
see a conclusion on the U S  debt ceiling   said Yutaka Miura 
senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities 	
 Some market players who had sold Nikkei futures on Monday on
worries about the U S  debt ceiling deadlock were covering their
short positions after Wall Street shares posted smaller losses
than they had expected  Miura said 	
 Traders said the Nikkei was likely to be supported above its
200 day moving average  now around 9 915  as Japan s earnings
season kicks into high gear next week  with expectations high
for results to show more evidence of a recovery from the quake 	
 The Nikkei is still not far from a four month intraday high
of 10 207 91 hit this month  a break of which could open the way
for a return to pre quake levels a bit above 10 250 	
 But some analysts said further improvements in earnings
outlooks were necessary for the Nikkei to recover to pre quake
levels 	
  The Nikkei s P E is already above 15  so for the Nikkei to
rise further  we ll need to see more upward revisions in annual
earnings outlooks   said Mizuho Securities  Miura 	
 Kao Corp surged 4 7 percent to 2 262 yen after the household
goods maker raised its full year outlook and posted a 12 percent
rise in April June operating profit on brisk sales of its
chemical products overseas and an earlier than expected recovery
in domestic sales after the quake 	
 Utilities underperformed the market  with Chubu Electric
 dropping 0 4 percent to 1 429 yen and Tokyo Electric
Power shedding 2 8 percent to 520 yen  after the Nikkei
business newspaper reported that fuel costs at Japan s five
largest electric power companies are expected to surge a
combined 2 trillion yen   25 5 billion  this fiscal year as they
rely on fossil fuel fired plants to make up for capacity lost
from offline nuclear reactors 	
 Tohoku Electric Power dropped 0 7 percent to 1 076
yen and Kyushu Electric Power was down 0 4 percent at
1 323 yen

   Dollar hits record low against safe haven Swiss franc
   Gold steady near record high  SE Asia extends winning
streak

 By Eric Burroughs	
 HONG KONG  July 26  Reuters    Asian shares rebounded on
Tuesday as upbeat earnings lured buyers  but the dollar slid to
a record low against the Swiss franc after a speech by U S 
President Barack Obama gave no sign that a deadlock in
Washington over raising the debt limit was easing 	
 European and U S  stocks were primed for gains  with futures
on the Dow Jones Eurostoxxe 50  flat in early trade and
S P e mini futures  rising 0 2 percent 	
 Short term speculators took aim at the dollar after Obama
delivered a prime time address to Americans  warning that a
default on U S  bond obligations would be a  reckless and
irresponsible outcome   But he gave no indication a compromise
was imminent  	
 So far investors have shown few signs of panic even as
Republicans and Democrats have failed to bridge their
differences with just a week to go to the Aug  2 deadline that
the U S  Treasury has set for when it may fail to pay out on
Treasuries 	
 The market reaction to a sudden breakdown in talks over the
weekend was limited given the threat of a technical default and
a potential cut in the United States  top notch AAA credit
rating 	
 But some market players were taking no chances  shifting
funds into safe haven gold and the Swiss franc  driving both to
record highs in U S  dollar terms  Gold was steady in early
trade at  1 614 60 an ounce 	
 Portfolio managers and traders have said they believe an
agreement will be reached in Washington at the last minute  and
that even a technical default or rating downgrade may only cause
short term market volatility rather than a full fledged crisis 	
  There s obviously political points to be made  who is going
to blink first  but in the final analysis we re confident that
there will be a compromise and that they will raise the debt
ceiling   said Malcom Wood  head of Asia Pacific strategy at
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Hong Kong 	
 Asian bonds  currencies and even shares have been one of the
beneficiaries from all the debt trouble in Europe and the
political gridlock in the United States  with investors viewing
the region s stronger growth and fundamentals as a relative
safe haven 	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
 was up 1 percent and has squeezed out a 1 6
percent gain on the month and year  withstanding the occasional
bouts of volatility from the U S  deficit debate and euro zone
debt crisis 	
 Southeast Asian markets have fared the best  Indonesia s
Jakarta Composite extended its winning streak  vaulting
to an all time high and taking this year s rise to 11 3 percent 
Currencies have also been on a tear  with the Singapore dollar
 hitting a record high 	
 Gains were fairly broad but on very light trade as summer
holidays took a toll on trading activity  By sector  energy 
financial  resource and technology shares were the main drivers 	
 The improved appetite for risk spread to commodities  U S 
crude oil prices  were up 40 cents a barrel at  99 60 	
 
 JAPAN RECOVERS	
 Japanese shares also rose as its big automakers and
manufacturers have recovered more quickly than expected from the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami 	
 Japan s Nikkei average climbed 0 6 percent  thanks
in part to solid earnings from blue chip companies such as Canon
 despite the yen s persistent strength 	
 In currencies  the dollar erased gains scored against the
euro the previous day on widening Spanish and Italian bond yield
spreads and hit a six week low against a basket of currencies 	
 The euro rose 0 7 percent to  1 4485   bursting
through chart resistance  The dollar hit an all time low of
0 8005 Swiss francs   The dollar hovered near 78 00 yen
 after briefly falling below that level 	
 High yielding currencies were among the biggest winners  The
New Zealand dollar jumped 0 7 percent and hit a high of
 0 8708    the highest since being allowed to trade freely in
the early 1980s 	
 Option markets    where investors typically hedge themselves
against potential risks    were also showing no signs of panic
across the dollar  S P futures and Treasury futures 	
 While the closely watched VIX index of S P implied
volatility ticked up on Monday to 19 35  it remains well off
peaks earlier this year 	
 Implied volatility on Treasury futures was also
higher this month but historically subdued  For a chart see  	
 Analysts said that macro hedge funds and others were
reluctant to trade  having struggled with choppy markets all
years and cut back on positions heading into the European summit
on Greece last week 	
  It has been a tough year for macro funds  and many do not
want to trade Washington headlines   said Alan Ruskin  macro
strategist at Deustche Bank in New York 	
 U S  Treasuries slipped for a second day  with long term
Treasuries under the most pressure from the worries about a
rating downgrade 	
 Ten year notes were down 6 32 in price to yield
3 017 percent  up one basis point  Thirty year bonds 
fell 5 32 to yield 4 328 percent  also up a basis point

27232,248747,CAJ,Nikkei falls for 3rd day on US debt mess  Nintendo plunges ,news,"  Yen hits new 4 month low vs dollar
   Nintendo nosedives after earnings  Sony falls
   U S  debt woes keep buying in check
   Other corporate results provide support
   Property shares shine after Mitsui Fudosan results

 By Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  July 29  Reuters    Tokyo stocks fell on Friday 
losing ground for a third straight day as the deadlock over
raising the U S  debt ceiling pushed the yen higher while
Nintendo plunged as much as 20 percent on a crumbling
earnings outlook 	
 Shares in Nintendo  a non Nikkei component but around 40
percent held by foreign shareholders  hit their lowest level
since May 2004 	
 But overall the market was underpinned by hopes that the
focus will shift back to the post earthquake earnings recoveries
being staged by many Japanese companies as long as U S 
lawmakers reach some sort of compromise by early next week 	
  The market is somewhat optimisitic that the U S  will have
a good answer next week   said Kenji Shiomura  an analyst at
Daiwa Securities 	
   As long as this optimism is dictating the tone in the
market  the market is more likely to gain than fall from the
current level after August 2  	
 The benchmark Nikkei extended losses in the
afternoon after the yen edged higher  falling 0 6 percent to 
9 843 75  below its 25 day moving average around 9 938 and
200 day average around 9 924 	
 The broader Topix index fell 0 7 percent to 842 65 	
 The yen climbed to a 4 month high against the dollar to
below 77 50 yen after US stock index futures dropped on news
that US House of Representatives will not vote tonight on a plan
to raise the US debt limit  	
 Mitsui Fudosan rose 2 2 percent to 1 470 yen after
Japan s biggest property developer said on Thursday it may raise
its full year forecast after a recovery in apartment sales
helped boost quarterly profit by 20 percent 	
 Traders said earnings from many companies including camera
and copier maker Canon and steelmakers pointed to a
faster than expected recovery after the massive earthquake and
tsunami in March 	
 Japanese industrial production data also showed
manufacturers plan to boost output further in coming months as
supply chain disruptions ease 	
 But the electronics sector underperformed  with Sony also
joining Nintendo in disappointing investors 	
 Sony Corp fell 2 9 percent to 1 954 yen after the
company cut its annual net profit forecast and slashed its
outlook for TV sales  while keeping its operating profit
forecast unchanged  	
 Nintendo was trading down some 13 percent at 12 240 yen
after hitting a low of 11 010 yen in the morning  The videogame
maker slashed its full year profit forecast far below market
expectations to the lowest level in 27 years after it was forced
to cut the price of its 3DS handheld games device to try to
jumpstart weak sales  just six months after launching the
gadget  	
 The tech sector is also being hurt by the yen s strength 
with the yen not too far from a record high of 76 25 yen

27252,248767,CAJ,GLOBAL MARKETS Asia shares rise on value buys  havens may still be attractive,news,"  Japan s Nikkei up 0 2 pct  Asia ex Japan  1 3 pct
   Euro Swiss franc slips after record jump
   Intraday volatility across markets high
   Europe s crisis still the medium term focus

  Updates prices  adds valuations  quotes 	
 By Kevin Plumberg and Swati Bhat	
 SINGAPORE  Aug 12  Reuters    Asian stocks edged up on
Friday  as investors chased value picks after recent sharp
volatility  though concerns over the European crisis may
continue to fuel buying into safe havens like gold and
government bonds 	
 Wall Street rose 4 percent overnight on high trading volume 
with relatively low valuations and short term oversold
conditions attracting buyers  though a slide in U S  stock
futures in early Asian trade kept the region s climb modest 	
 Intraday volatility across financial markets has spiked over
the past few weeks  with rumours flying about the health of
European banks  questions mounting about the stability of
funding markets and authorities struggling to solve a crisis of
confidence in Europe 	
 A European regulator ban on short selling in four countries 
financial stocks would take effect on Friday  a coordinated
attempt to ease panic whose effectiveness was immediately called
into question by market participants  	
 Japan s Nikkei share average rose 0 2 percent  boosted by a
4 7 percent jump in Canon Inc shares  which were propelled by a
stock buyback plan  	
  The rebound is a little lukewarm as investors want to
lighten their positions and take profits ahead of the weekend
after a very turbulent week   said Mitsuo Shimizu  deputy
general manager at Cosmo Securities in Tokyo 	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up
1 3 percent on the day but still looking at a
decline of around 3 percent on the week  in line
with the MSCI world stock index   	
 The benchmark s 14 day RSI  a measure of momentum that is
used to indicate overbought or oversold conditions  was at 30 6 
poised to snap a six session string of readings below 30    the
oversold threshold  That is the longest string of days below 30
since May 2010 	
 Even as equity prices dropped in the past few weeks  some
fund managers in Asia with long term horizons have been slowly
shifting their portfolios by buying more cyclical stocks  which
are more sensitive to changes in business cycles  and reducing
exposure to so called defensive sectors 	
 
 VALUE PICKS	
 The strategy may have more to do with valuations and
positioning than a call on global economic prospects 	
 For example  in some Asian markets  stocks in a defensive
sector such as consumer staples are running a bit expensive
relative to growth prospects compared with a cyclical sector
such as industrials  	
 A look at the ratio of price to earnings over estimated
earnings growth next year shows Indonesia s consumer staples are
trading at 1 3 times versus 0 5 times among industrials  Thomson
Reuters Starmine showed  In Korea  staples are trading at 1 0
time versus the 0 3 times of industrials 	
 That investors in U S  stocks focused more on value
overnight despite the clear and present risks to economic growth
is not so surprising considering the S P 500 index is trading
around 11 7 times forecast earnings in 12 months  well below the
10 year average of 16 2 times 	
  We remain optimistic that risk assets  including
emerging markets  will continue to bounce back after the current
period of turmoil ebbs  For now  we believe that picking the EM
equity markets with solid fundamentals remains a good strategy
for global equity managers in this current environment   Win
Thin  Global Head of Emerging Markets Strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman  wrote in a note  	
 In currency markets  the euro was down 0 3 percent
to  1 4201   though global focus would likely be on how
the single currency fares against the Swiss franc 	
 The euro surged a record 5 percent against the franc
overnight on speculation the Swiss central bank may be
considering other measures to curb currency strength  including
a peg to the euro  The euro was down 0 4 percent at 1 0801
francs in Asian trading  	
  Market reaction was probably a reflection of how long
participants are of the Swiss franc   said Richard Grace  chief
currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank  	
 Gold prices were down 0 34 percent to  1 759 65 an ounce
   some 3 4 percent below a record high of  1 813 79 hit on
Thursday  Still the metal was up 5 9 percent this week  on
course for the biggest weekly gain since February 2009 	
 Oil  also snapped a two day rising streak 
falling 0 6 percent  after having gained 6 4 percent over the
last two days

27256,248771,CAJ,Asian Markets Lower  Subdued Sentiment Into Weekend ,opinion,Asian markets are mostly lower as sentiment remains subdued ahead of the weekend  Today s weakness came despite US data continuing to print a positive surprise with durable goods growing 9 9  in September  while the weekly claims came out bang in line at 369 000 claims  Traders seem to be exerting caution  probably not willing to take any major directional views on the market  particularly with the heavily divided opinion over the outcome of some key events ahead  As a result  equity markets have been relatively sidelined this week with some profit taking resulting in modest losses  There have been some significant moves in the currency space this week  particularly in USD JPY and GBP USD  ahead of some key central bank meetings  USD JPY has held above 80 after printing a high of 80 39 and remains steady  helped by the huge political pressure being put on the BoJ to drag Japan out of deflation  However  we feel there could be a clear case for a  buy the rumour  sell the fact  event to play out next week  with the market fully pricing in a  10 trillion expansion to the asset purchase programme  There is a good chance that if this amount is revealed we may even see the pair come under pressure  therefore profit taking before the event and potentially buying back at lower levels might turn out to be the better strategy as opposed to chasing it higher  Yen weakness has seen the Nikkei outperform the region this week but some disappointing earnings reports from the like of Canon have capped gains  Elsewhere in the region  the ASX 200 is down 0 5   while the Hang Seng   0 7   and Shanghai Composite   1 7   are also lower  Looking ahead to the European session  we are calling the major bourses modestly weaker  Following the better than expected UK GDP print  we are likely to hear some analysts revise calls for an expansion of gilt purchases at the BOE meeting on November 8  This could also underpin the pound further after GBP USD rallied to 1 614 yesterday  US futures have come off quite a bit and focus will likely be on how Apple shares trade on the back of its earnings report  Ahead today we have Spanish unemployment and third quarter GDP releases on the calendar  The ASX 200 has finally slipped below 4500 and is now down 1 9  for the week  Macquarie Group s  MQG  result has been the main story of the day in the local market  Early comments suggested the stock might trade lower after the headline profit   361 million  was largely considered a miss  However  the stock has surged over 4  after the company declared an interim dividend of 75 cents  way ahead of estimates  and showed good operating expenses momentum in the face of declining operating income  MQG said it achieved this through continued operating efficiencies which probably relates to a restructure  The investment group also reiterated FY13 outlook of earnings being at least  730 million subject to conditions  According to Credit Suisse  FY13 earnings consensus for MQG is  860 million  17  above bottom end of MQG s guidance   Resmed has also been a highlight today after reporting a 41  jump in Q1 profit to US 71 million  9  above guidance  The stock traded at a record high today but has since succumbed to profit taking and is now a touch weaker  RMD had rallied all week in anticipation of a strong result with its shares up around 60  for the year  As a result  its valuation was starting to look a bit stretched compared to its peers,2012-10-26,IG,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/asian-markets-lower,-subdued-sentiment-into-weekend‏-141227",141227

27283,248798,CAJ,Finding The Next Tenbagger In Peru  Maria Belen Vega And Ricardo Carri n,opinion,In a tough market for junior gold shares over the past three years  Peruvian mining stocks have outperformed the mining indexes  Peru is a booming economy with well defined mining laws and a vocal mining protest movement that could be playing a constructive role in future development  In this exclusive interview with   Maria Belen Vega and Ricardo Carri n of Kallpa Securities in Lima  Peru  analyze the protest situation and clarify the role of mining as one of the leading sectors of the economy  Junior companies they follow include mine developers  producers and a  pure Peru play  explorer  some of these companies could repeat the outsized performance of the last few years and become tenbaggers  The Gold Report  Before we talk about specific companies  let s talk about mining in Peru  Mining is big business in Peru  but recently there have been a lot of protests  Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM  Conga project gets the most attention from the U S  media  Can you give us an update  Maria Belen Vega  Regarding the importance of mining in our economy  it s important to highlight that mining is in the interest of government  society and Peru as a whole  Peru is a mining country  To give you some numbers  approximately 5 5  of gross domestic product comes from the mining industry without accounting for the supporting industry  Approximately 30  and 60  of total income tax collection and exports  respectively  come from mining  Also  mining accounts for around 60  of the Lima Stock Exchange s  LSE  main indexes  Lima Stock Exchange Composition By Sector The protests started because activists understand that mining is a lucrative industry in Peru  Protestors feel that the communities are not getting their fair share of the profits  To give you an idea  the canon minero regulation establishes that 50  of the funds from income tax collection derived from the mining industry is required to return to the region in which the mine operates  If you take a look  most protests originated in the regions that should have received funds from the canon minero  While some local administrators live very well off these incomes  the investment made from these funds was either not yet executed or not profitable  So it makes sense that the communities want to receive some benefit from mining  Gold Production in Peru Another important issue regarding mining in Peru is water  This is one of the main issues at Conga as well as Southern Copper Corp  s  NYSE SCCO  Tia Maria project  TGR  So that s freshwater supply  MBV  Yes  water supply is an important issue  Most mining projects in Peru are located in the upper part of the Cordillera de Los Andes  which has a shortage of water  Mines can consume large amounts of water  which often comes from rivers or underground aquifers  The communities are concerned that mining could use too much of a scarce resource because their main activities are livestock and agriculture  It is interesting to note that the mining protestors don t discuss pollution  Big mines in Peru are strongly regulated and some of them are listed on at least one international exchange  Companies like Southern Copper  Barrick Gold Corp   NYSE ABX  or Compa  a de Minas Buenaventura  NYSE BVN  BVL BUE  have strong corporate governance policies  Artisanal miners are mine polluters  There is even a contagion effect where big projects become surrounded by informal miners who create serious pollution problems  TGR  It sounds as if the opposition to mining is more about political issues and wealth sharing and not so much because of environmental issues  MBV  Exactly  In Peru  the mining industry has done some of the work in infrastructure and healthcare that should have been done by the government  roads  hospitals  bridges  etc   in the first place  Therefore  communities are not against the mining industry as a whole  they just want to have a bigger piece of the pie  Ricardo Carri n  A good example of Peruvian mining politics is what just happened to Xstrata Plc s  AIM XTA  Antapaccay project in southern Peru  Communities have a long list of requirements in order to reach mining agreements  The most important change to the Xstrata agreement was in the project ownership  The negotiated share was 3   but the community wanted its share upped to 50   That gives you an example of the political environment the miners face  Geographic Distribution of Main Mining Projects in PeruTGR  It sounds as if the central government is pro mining  So are the local citizens  but they want more of the benefits  Where do the foreign investors fit into the picture  Investors need to get a fair return for the risk of investing in a mining project  RC  Taxes paid by mining companies are one of the largest sources of income for the government  As stated before  30  of income tax collection derives from mining  The government can t afford to lose that income and it s fully committed to supporting investment in mining  Peru has approximately  50 billion  B  of investments in the mining sector  which is one of the drivers for the country s growth  The  4 8B Conga project is an example  The government has supported Newmont while working to improve the project from a social point of view  That is a win win situation  The result is a better project overall  The government is mediating between companies and communities in a way that supports investment  growth and sustainability  TGR  That was an example of a large company  Does the government also support smaller mining companies  RC  Yes  the government understands that without junior explorers  there won t be big mines  It s not that they are pushing exploration companies to make a discovery  We have clear exploration regulations that are friendly for foreign investors  Last year  Peru implemented new regulations aimed at junior companies  The new regulation is called  Prior Consultation   The regulation requires having an agreement with the community before starting exploration  This is not a big change because that is the way most companies have been doing business for the last decade  but now it is formally part of the Peruvian regulation  As before  without a  Prior Consultation  you can t do anything on the ground  TGR  Let s discuss some specific companies that you cover  Candente Copper Corp   DNT TSX  DNT BVL  has a potentially large project with approximately  1 5B in capital expenditures  capex   How is a junior going to finance a project that big  MBV  Candente s main goal is to develop a world class deposit in order to be saleable while evaluating going into production  Currently  the Ca ariaco project is in the prefeasibility stage and Candente has just received approval by the government and communities  surface rights agreements  to start drilling  It has been working on those permits since 2010 and has  20 million  M  in cash to start the next drilling campaign to get the project into feasibility  Copper Production in PeruOne of the main questions is how a  70M market cap company can finance a  1 5B capex  If the feasibility study is positive and Candente proceeds to IAS approval  I believe that the share price will likely go up  That scenario should increase the market cap to at least  100M  From there  financing options include a joint venture with a major copper company or offtake agreements because the resource is approximately 70  copper  20  gold and 10  silver  The company is evaluating corporate sources of financing that might include banks  TGR  Candente faces several challenges including infrastructure  What does it look like onsite  MBV  I visited the project late last year  Most projects in Peru are at high altitude  but at 3 000 meters  m   Candente is relatively low  The project is literally a greenfield there is a lot of vegetation there  It takes six hours to get to the project from Chiclayo  which is the capital of the Lambayeque region  Half the distance is on paved roads  Besides access  metallurgy may be a challenge  The ore at Ca ariaco has a moderate arsenic content  which may result in smelting penalties  The prefeasibility study included a roasting processing unit to reduce the arsenic content yet achieve high recoveries of the metal  Based on what is known today  the problem has been solved and investors are not punishing the stock price for that reason but mainly for the delay in getting the permits to start drilling  Currently  Candente is valued at less than  0 01 lb copper  it has 10 billion pounds  Blb  copper in equivalent resources  This valuation is much less than other companies like Panoro Minerals Ltd   PML TSX V  PZN FSE  PML BVL   which has a 4 Blb copper project valued at  0 03 lb  which is still less than latest copper acquisitions in Peru in the range of  0 05 0 07 lb  Based on that metric  it is one of the most undervalued companies listed on the LSE s Venture Exchange  TGR  Another small miner you cover is Rio Alto Mining Ltd   RIO TSX V  RIO BVL   Compared to Candente  Rio Alto has a different and much smaller deposit  It is a gold oxide deposit  which lends itself to much lower capex and quicker startup  Since you have covered it  it has done really well  It is more than a tenbagger from your first research report  Do you have an update and where you think it s going  MBV  Rio Alto is one of the biggest success stories on the Lima Stock Exchange  It listed in November 2009 at  0 33 share and now  quotes at  4 20 share  Rio Alto has a two stage project  The first is the gold oxide deposit  which is now in production  The second one is the copper gold sulphide project  which is moving toward development  Originally  management bought a deposit that was undervalued  in prefeasibility  but that was able to start production rapidly  It took the company less than two years very fast  Now Rio Alto ranks 8th among Peruvian gold producers  It is a success story in both Peru and Canada  Production started in May of last year and met management s target of 50 000 ounces  500 Koz  year  The target for 2012 is producing between 150 160 Koz gold    550 600 ounce cash cost  As of H1 12  they have produced more than 100 Koz  Currently  mine capacity is being increased from 24 000 tons  24Kt  day to 36 Kt day  financed by a prepayment facility with Red Kite Explorer Trust  One of the management s goals is to finance all expansion without shareholder dilution  This expansion will allow it to produce above 200 Koz year by 2014  Rio Alto s next step will be the completion of the feasibility study for the sulfide project  The size of the resource is over 4 Blb copper plus 5 6 million ounces  Moz  gold and there is ongoing drilling  The target is to begin production by 2016  TGR  How can an investor find the next company like Rio Alto  Which companies on the Lima Stock Exchange resemble the Rio Alto of three years ago  MBV  There are many companies on the Lima Stock Exchange with potential  One of the more advanced juniors is Sulliden Gold Corp   SUE TSX  SDDDF OTCQX  SUE BVL   Sulliden is a Canadian company whose main project is Shahuindo  a gold project located in the Cajamarca region  Shahuindo could become a world class gold deposit because of its medium to high grade and potential to build a low cost deposit with a potential increasing resource  Currently  it has 2 Moz in Indicated resource and an additional 2 Moz Inferred  In 2011  Sulliden developed a 70 000m drilling campaign to increase the resource size and improve its classification in order to achieve feasibility  TGR  That 4 Moz was from the June resource that was just released  MBV  Yes  The 4 Moz is information from 2011 s resource estimation prepared according to Canadian NI 43 101 requirements  Because all of the companies listed at LSE s Venture are dual listed in Toronto  everything reported must meet Canadian standards  Pending is the new resource estimation from the latest 70 000m campaign that should increase the actual resource significantly  TGR  Sulliden s Shahuindo project is located in Cajamarca  Isn t that home to Peru s mining protest movement  MBV  Yes  Cajamarca is a region located in northern Peru  But besides being known for mining protests  the region is home to many world class mines including Newmont s Yanacocha   Conga  Barrrick Gold s Lagunas Norte and Rio Alto s La Arena  the last two are located 30km south from Shahuindo   TGR  So there should be lots of good mining infrastructure and good technical support  MBV  I visited Shahuindo three months ago and it has some of the best infrastructure in Peru  It is not located at high altitude  2 800 3 000m above sea level  It s a three hour drive from Cajamarca city with half on a paved road  It has a 3km power line on the project  Additional infrastructure for the transmission line is being built up to supply energy to the community  One important consideration is that Sulliden deals directly with landowners at the property  Currently  Sulliden owns 85  of the surface rights for constructing the open pit mine  This situation is different from many juniors that still need to negotiate and purchase surface rights  Besides  dealing with landowners tends to be much easier than with communities  The most interesting feature of Shahuindo is the deposit  Sulliden has identified three main mineralized zones  only one has been strongly drilled and included in the current resource estimation  And that s from the oxides only  The sulphides are another potential deposit that has not yet been drilled  As mentioned before  a resource estimate is planned for this month  Another catalyst for share price growth would be the IAS approval after achieving feasibility  Located in Cajamarca  the same region of Newmont s Conga project  there is some risk attached such as delay in the environmental impact study approval startup of the project  Despite Shahuindo being located 80km from Conga in Cajamarca and subject to the same regional authorities as Conga  Sulliden is following the process and will submit the IAS study to the ministry this year to advance and construct the mine  TGR  What other challenges will Sulliden need to address  MBV  The management is confident that it will have no problems developing a mine  but the project has risks due to the social and political situation in Cajamarca  I believe that s one of the main reasons why the company is undervalued right now  Even though there are high expectations with the new resource estimation  the stock is undervalued because of the junior mining market and the social risk tied to Shahuindo being located in Cajamarca  TGR  Maybe it can benefit from Newmont investing in social capital there  MBV  Yes  One of the other advantages of Sulliden compared to other juniors is that Sulliden has  50M in cash  It doesn t have a cash requirement for at least one and a half years  That is a big plus  TGR  What other companies do you follow that the readers might not know about  MBV  Minera IRL Ltd   IRL TSX  MIRL LSE  MIRL BVL  is one of them  Minera IRL has three main assets  It owns the producing Corihuarmi gold mine near Lima and the soon to start up project Don Nicolas in Patagonia in Argentina  The third asset is the Ollachea gold project located in the Puno region of southern Peru  Minera IRL was a company listed first on the Alternative Investment Market  AIM  in London  Initially  it was listed on the Venture segment in Peru and after Corihuarmi started production  it migrated to the main board  It was a success case for the Lima Stock Exchange  Corihuarmi is a small mine with a remaining three year life of mine at approximately 30 Koz gold year  After closure  in 2015  Don Nicolas will start production  As of today  Don Nicolas is a small project of about a 360 Koz gold resource that now is subject to higher costs due to Argentina s economic outlook and risks  mainly exchange rate policies  Start up at Don Nicolas will give Minera IRL continuity in the gold production  Don Nicolas will run for three years  in time for Ollachea to start production  The Ollachea gold deposit is Minera IRL s main project with 2 6 Moz in resources  Ollachea accounts for more than half of Minera IRL s value  The Ollachea project is in the feasibility stage and is planned to be an underground mine with a nine year life of mine producing approximately 120 Koz year  Compared to its first projects  Ollachea is big  The strategy of Minera IRL is continuity in production and demonstration of growth  TGR  Panoro Minerals is another one that you cover  Could you briefly give us an overview  MBV  Panoro Minerals is a copper pure play  Panoro s portfolio is composed of 14 projects located in the well known Andahuaylas Yauri copper district  home of Xtrata s Las Bambas  Hudbay Minerals Inc  s  HBM TSX  HBM NYSE  Constancia and First Quantum Minerals Ltd  s  FM TSX  Haquira  Bottom line  it s a well known copper district in Peru  Within its portfolio  Panoro has two development properties  one of which is the Cotabambas project with 2 4 Blb copper  The project has a lot of geological potential having defined a resource with copper grades above 0 7  and gold content above 1 gram ton  Also  the deposit has no major contaminants  In 2011  Panoro drilled 30 000 additional meters to increase the resource  the estimate is expected by mid August  HudBay Minerals has a 6  stake on Panoro and there is a lot of speculation in what HudBay s interest is in Panoro s project  Panoro s strategy is to use its expertise in Peruvian regional copper exploration and development to find saleable deposits that can be bought by major copper players  TGR  Are most or all of those projects in Peru  MBV  Panoro s assets are all in Peru  TGR  So that s an exploration pure play in Peru  MBV  Exactly  Panoro is a strategically located copper exploration and development company  It has a quality and well known board and a lot of potential to bring its assets into world class copper deposits  Panoro and the other companies mentioned should be on an investor s watch list  TGR  To wrap things up  can you summarize the mining investment situation in Peru  There are protests  but also positive developments that aren t widely reported in the North American investment markets  Maybe investors need to look past the sensational news  as there may be opportunities  MBV  Mining is an important industry for Peru the government and the people understand this  However  of the  53B in mining investments in Peru  only 3  is local  The other 97  comes mainly from China  U S   Canada  Australia and Switzerland  Peru has a capital deficit for mining investment  That s why the Peruvian government is committed to mining and foreign investment  In time  the protests will be resolved between the companies  government and communities so that everybody will benefit from the industry  Everyone is aware that we need this capital  investment  jobs and development  Of course  foreign investors will also benefit from playing a part in the mining industry in Peru  TGR  Thank you for your time   currently serves as an investment analyst of corporate finance for Kallpa Securities in Lima  Peru  Through

27286,248801,CAJ,Top 10 Asia Pacific Regional ETFs,opinion,There is currently an expanding list of 35 ETFs oriented to the Asia Pacific market whether in single country funds or with regional issues  The following analysis features a fair representation of regional ETFs available  We believe from these investors may choose an appropriate ETF to satisfy the best index based offerings individuals and financial advisors may utilize It s important investors understand index weightings here more than perhaps in other sectors  Some are heavily weighted toward a single country like Australia or Japan  We prefer a better blend generally despite perhaps better trading and trending characteristics  For example  where an ETF is weighted heavily toward just one or two countries  it might be better to deal with a single country fund rather than an undiversified regional issue  These might include EWA  Australia  or EWJ  Japan  when dealing with popular EPP or VPL ETFs are based on indexes tied to well known index providers including Russell  S P  Barclays  MSCI  Dow Jones and so forth  Also included are some so called  enhanced  indexes that attempt to achieve better performance through more active management of the index Where competitive issues exist and or repetitive issues available at a fee cost saving we mention those as other choices  New issues are coming to market consistently  especially globally  and sometimes these issues will need to become more seasoned before they may be included  at least in our listings We feature a technical view of conditions from monthly chart views  Simplistically  we recommend longer term investors stay on the right side of the 12 month simple moving average  When prices are above the moving average  stay long  and when below remain in cash or short  Some more interested in a fundamental approach may not care so much about technical issues preferring instead to buy when prices are perceived as low and sell for other reasons when high  but  this is not our approach  Members to the ETF Digest receive added signals when markets become extended such as DeMark triggers to exit overbought oversold conditions For traders and investors wishing to hedge  leveraged and inverse issues are available to utilize from ProShares and Direxion and where available these are noted FNI follows the ISE Chindia Index which

27313,248828,CAJ,GLOBAL MARKETS Euro  stocks slip with caution key on Greece,news,"  Euro hangs around  1 42 but may retest low from Thursday
   Greece cabinet shuffle coming up
   Nikkei steady  Brent oil edges down
   Investors are cautious about any Greece headlines

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE  Jun 17  Reuters    The euro slipped on Friday 
with markets still largely unconvinced that Greece can dodge a
default without political stability in Athens  keeping equity
and commodity prices in a near term downtrend 	
 Greece  whose prime minister is struggling to form a
coalition government to push through unpopular austerity
reforms  has become a focal point for investors looking for
signals on whether to shed more risky assets and take defensive
positions over the next few months  	
 Efforts by Olli Rehn  the European Union s top economic
official to soothe markets overnight with expectations that the
EU and International Monetary Fund will disburse a 12 billion
euro loan in early July to Greece faded by the Asian session 
The euro slipped fell back under  1 42  Japan s Nikkei stock
index was flat and oil prices slid back to red 	
 After a steady feed of negative headlines on Greece 
investors were cautious ahead of a cabinet reshuffle in Athens
later on Friday 	
  The wild card actually becomes the Greek political
situation  The Greek government has stood out from the other
troubled peripheral countries by surviving   Marc Chandler 
global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman 
said in a note 	
  A new cabinet will seek to push through the new austerity
measures as a vote of confidence  This will take place in the
coming days and before the IMF EU have to write a check to
Greece    	
 The Nikkei was steady in thin trading  with weakness
in blue chip stocks such as Honda Motor Co and Sekisui
House   Japan s largest homebuilder  offset by bargain
hunting of some retailer and technology shares 	
   Bargain hunting may support the market to some extent  but
volume may be low before the weekend   said Hiroichi Nishi 
general manager at SMBC Nikko Securities   	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan edged up
0 2 percent   though was not far from the
three month low hit on Thursday 	
 Helping support Asian stock markets  U S  equity futures
edged up  on Friday  and it appeared for now that the U S 
S P 500 index would stay above the low for the year hit in
March 	
 U S  stock investors have been consolidating their exposure
through ETFs  Inflows into the SPDR S P 500 ETF  a popular
exchange traded fund that tracks the benchmark U S  stock index 
soared to a three year high in the week ending June 15  but 
excluding ETFs  U S  equity funds had weekly outflows of  2 03
billion during the week  	
 The euro fell 0 2 percent to around  1 4175   Traders
will look for the euro to retest Thursday s low around  1 4070
later in the day and will probably add to short positions if the
currency gets near the lows 	
 Brent oil futures edged down 0 2 percent to  113 85 a barrel
  well off the six week high reached on Wednesday of
 121 47

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO  July 22  Reuters    Tokyo stocks climbed to a
two week high on Friday  led by banks that leapt after Morgan
Stanley s strong results and euro sensitive issues such
as Canon   up on the euro s gains after officials agreed
on steps to solve Greece s debt woes 	
 While buying by foreigners has somewhat eased  individual
investors as well as domestic institutional players dominated
the market  with the Nikkei s gains capped slightly above 10 100
as traders cited concerns about the yen s renewed strength
against the dollar 	
  Watch volumes on banks  This is still mostly long term
investors who previously owned the stock re establishing
positions  but we re also seeing some new buyers piling into
these shares   said Takashi Ohba  a senior strategist at Okasan
Securities 	
 The Nikkei rose 1 3 percent to 10 136 77 by midafternoon and
was on track for its biggest daily gain in more than three
weeks  The broader Topix rose 1 1 percent to 869 637 	
 The benchmark on Friday jumped above near term resistance at
10 005  marked by a tenkan line on its daily Ichimoku cloud 	
  More firms posted earnings above expectations yesterday 
defying worries over supply chains  That s why firms posting
results next week are charging higher today   said a trader at a
foreign brokerage who did not want to be quoted by name 	
 Canon Marketing jumped 7 2 percent after hiking its
profit forecast  while Tamron Co soared 7 3 percent to
1 976 yen  at one point hitting a three week high at 2 032 yen
after the company lifted its net profit outlook and Nomura
Securities upgraded the stock to  buy   	
  After these hikes and stronger than expected results from
Wall Street  everyone is looking at firms reporting next week
such as Toshiba and Komatsu    on fire today on hopes for
forecast hikes   the trader said 	
 Construction machinery maker Komatsu Ltd added 2
percent to 2 553 yen  while electrical machinery maker Toshiba
Corp   boosted earlier this week by Apple Corp s
 strong earnings  gained 2 4 percent to 421 yen 	
   Most investors are long in the market  suggesting
sentiment towards Japanese stocks is overwhelmingly positive 	
  The Japanese equities long short ratio reached an annual
high of 12 28 on July 14  This denotes that there are over 12
times more longs than shorts in the market as institutional
ownership in the region is close to annual highs   research firm
Data Explorers said in a note to clients   	
 
 BANKS ADVANCE	
 Banks continued their relief rally into a fourth
straight day  rising to a two week high  They were led by
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group   Japan s largest bank by
assets  charging up 3 6 percent to 409 yen in very active trade 
within shouting distance of its post quake high of 419 yen
reached on July 8 	
 An emergency summit of leaders of the 17 nation euro zone
pledged on Thursday to conduct a second bailout of Greece with
an extra 109 billion euros   157 billion  of government money 
plus a contribution by private sector bondholders estimated to
total as much as 50 billion euros by mid 2014  	
 Goldman Sachs said on Thursday that Japanese lenders were
likely to report earnings consensus for the first quarter of
this fiscal year in line or above the market s consensus  adding
to banks  rally  The brokerage also said Mitsubishi UFJ is its
top pick 	
  People are turning a bit more bullish  because you need
financials to really push the whole market higher  Forget about
any decent rally when that sector lags others   said Okasan s
Ohba  adding that banks  advance may help the Nikkei pop above
its post quake high of 10 207 91 heading into the earnings
season next week 	
 Banking shares were one of the worst hit sectors after the
March 11 disaster because of speculation that they may have to
forgive some of their loans to Tokyo Electric Power Co  
which is still struggling with a radiation crisis at its
Fukushima nuclear plant that was triggered by the disaster 	
 MUFG s shares are still down 7 2 percent from where they
were before the earthquake  The bank shares subindex 
has fallen 10 1 percent since then  compared with a 3 2 percent
fall in the Nikkei 	
 Morgan Stanley wowed Wall Street on Thursday with 
results that far surpassed expectations  just days after rival
Goldman Sachs disappointed investors     	
 Canon  which obtains about one third of its sales in Europe 
rose 1 6 percent to 3 795 yen and Nikon  another euro sensitive
stock  gained 1 5 percent to 1 859 yen after the euro rose to a
two week high against the Japanese currency on Thursday
  	
 Volumes picked up with 1 3 billion shares changing hands on
the main board by late afternoon  suggesting Friday s volumes
may come in above this week s daily volumes around 1 5 billion
shares and suggesting there is more upside potential to the
market

 But some market players who had sold Nikkei futures on

 HONG KONG  July 26  Reuters    Asian shares edged higher on
Tuesday  bouncing back from a slide the previous day  after U S 
stocks posted only modest losses in reaction to the worsening
deadlock in Washington over raising the debt limit and avoiding
a technical bond default 	
 The dollar fell to a record low against the safe haven Swiss
franc in early trade as President Barack Obama delivered a
prime time address to Americans  warning that a default on U S 
bond obligations would be a  reckless and irresponsible
outcome   	
 Investors have showed few signs of panic even as Republicans
and Democrats have failed to bridge their differences with just
a week to go to the Aug  2 deadline the U S  Treasury has set
for when it may fail to pay out on Treasuries

27345,248860,CAJ,The Series That Launched A Thousand Funds  HFMW Review  ,opinion,JS Comment  The following is a book review of      If you would like to see more Mercenary Trader reviews of excellent trading books   including many not featured in our books and articles section   visit the MT    And be sure to upvote the ones you like     I owe Jack Schwager  It was the original  Market Wizards   stumbled across in the mid 1990s  that really opened my eyes to trading    I had previously discovered  the Investment Biker   by Jim Rogers  and knew I wanted to forego a life in academia and pursue markets  William J  O Neil s  How to Make Money in Stocks  then convinced me to intern at a stock brokerage  Raymond James  my last two college summers    But it was  Market Wizards   and after that  Methods of a Wall St Master  and  Soros on Soros   that really crystallized the vision    Unquestionably   Reminiscences of a Stock Operator  stands alone as the far and away greatest trading book of all time  But the Market Wizards series sits  like a leather bound canon  just a notch or two below    Until Steven Drobny s relatively recent  Inside the House of Money  and  Invisible Hands    sort of the grad school version of Market Wizards  both mind blowing in their own right   no one had challenged Schwager s run of brilliance and consistency when it came to trader interviews    Like many others I am sure  I can quote passages from the first three   Market Wizards  New Market Wizards  and Stock Market Wizards   chapter and verse  like a constitutional lawyer referencing supreme court briefings  The books have been absorbed by the trading community so fully that  if you put  MW  NMW or SMW  next to a quote  most serious traders will know exactly what it means    The series has made its mark not because the traders in Schwager s books are infallible  superhuman  or otherwise worthy of hero worship   no one deserves a pedestal   but because the books are so densely packed with wisdom  ideas and insights that the total net value is mind boggling  Time and again a market situation  an element of theoretical debate  or an aspect of methodology comes up where one of the Wizards had something clear and sharp to say on the matter    There were a number of such  a ha   insights in HFMW  as I shall abbreviate   though the book felt a little bit lighter than its predecessors   I will write up my impressions and key takeaways for each HFMW interview separately  as such would take up too much room here     The surprising thing  for yours truly at least  was that the most intriguing ideas in HFMW centered around value investing    One wonders how many trading funds the Market Wizards series is intellectually responsible for seeding   Hundreds  Thousands if one counts the failures    and now I can say HFMW has given rise to another  Here is the gist    It struck me  in reading about the value investors in HFMW  that the active and versatile trader could actually have a powerful and hard to replicate edge  as a value investor on the side  This would come about through the traders  ability to leave the value investing portion of his funds in cash  or cash equivalents  for significant periods of time    Let me expound a little    Kevin Daly  one of the value investors interviewed in HFMW  made an 872 percent return over a 12 year period of time  when the S P returned negative 9 percent  So Daly must have been good at shorting  right  Nope  Daly did it with very little trading  in terms of managing around positions  and virtually no shorting    How  By going to cash for extended periods  of long duration  when conditions were unattractive    This concept   delivering far superior returns by going to cash in adverse periods   dovetails with an interesting theory proposed by Marc Faber in his June 2012 Gloom Boom Doom Report  the notion that long term investors would do better staying out of markets most of the time  and only investing after a crisis    From an anecdotal perspective it makes sense too  Imagine if a long only fund manager had had the good sense to sit in cash all through the 2004 2008 madness  then really loaded the boat at the firesale liquidation values of early 2009  when forced portfolio disgorgement put excellent businesses on sale  lock  stock and barrel  for less than cash in the bank    The concept also aligns with the methodology of Tom Claugus  another HFMW interviewee  who is only maximum long invested in times of extreme market dislocation  as defined by outlier standard deviations in the S P   and with the observation of Joel Greenblatt  the final interview in the book  who wryly observes that  value investing works because it doesn t work  for extended periods of time  thus causing the impatient to abandon it    Sitting in cash   for long term investors  not active traders    also seems a natural given the environment we are in  where uncertainty is high and valuations are mediocre attractive at best  No wonder highly respected value practitioners like Jim Tisch of Loews have been sitting on their hands for years  which they can do as stewards of their own capital     But of course  it would not be logistically feasible for a standard issue value fund to go dormant  sitting in cash  for months or years at a time  Investors would demand their money back  saying they aren t paying the manager to be idle  And the manager himself would have long stretches of nothing to do    A sufficiently versatile trading shop COULD implement such a process  however  assuming the shop was 1  skilled and knowledgeable enough to demonstrate deep value capabilities  with a research team devoted to such   and 2  patient enough to leave the long term investment cash untouched in mediocre to poor allocation conditions  The ability to actively trade in a SEPARATE fund   where the main activities existed anyway   is what creates this opportunity    In other words  In conjunction with a trading fund  a deep value fund could be treated as a sort of side pocket  with its own standalone track record   During low to no activity periods  the cash balance in the fund could be kept at a minimum    During periods of excellent opportunity from a long term perspective  cash could be swept into the value fund  and investors in the more active trading fund could be alerted to the situationally conditional value investing opportunities at hand    For the first stretch of years  such a fund would likely have to be internal capital only  as telling prospective investors  we might only do something once a year  or sit in cash for 20 months  would not be a great sell  Once an excellent track record developed over time  however   with the power of excellent returns during invested periods overcoming the all cash periods   investors would see the light and show more willingness to support such a wise and logical approach    I expand on the concept to give example of the thought processes Schwager has so generously brought forth with this most excellent series  We are almost certainly going to do this when the time is right  so I guess I owe Schwager once again

credit downgrade
   WSJ article on Greece debt helps mood in morning
   Solar power stocks gain on German plan to shut nuclear
reactors
   Tepco down on S P cut in its rating to junk status

 By Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  May 31  Reuters    The Nikkei average rose on Tuesday
with buying in futures encouraged by predictions of strong
industrial output in the coming months  while solar energy
shares gained on news that Germany will shut all its nuclear
reactors by 2022 	
 Credit rating agency Moody s during the midday break placed
Japan s sovereign ratings on review for possible downgrade 
citing concerns about a weak policy response to faltering
economic growth prospects   ID nT9E7GH024 	
 The announcement followed a similar move last week by
ratings agency Fitch which had only a minimal impact on stocks 
 ID nL3E7GR1A6   	
 Japan s industrial output rose 1 0 percent for April  below
analysts  median forecast of 2 8 percent  but manufacturers
sharply increased their forecasts for May  predicting output
will rise 8 0 percent compared with the previous 2 7 percent
forecast  data from the Ministry of Economy  Trade and Industry
showed   ID nL3E7GU0JC  	
  Companies expect the recovery to continue in June with
production seen rising 7 7 percent  in a sign they are making
headway in restoring supply chains and bringing back production
lines idled by the disaster and power blackouts  	
  Investors got past the weak data in April and cheered the
strong outlook by buying futures   said Tsuyoshi Segawa  an
equity strategist at Mizuho Securities 	
 
 HELPING SENTIMENT	
 Also helping sentiment was a Wall Street Journal report
saying that Germany is considering dropping its push for an
early rescheduling of Greek bonds in order to facilitate a new
package of aid loans for Greece  citing people familiar with the
matter 	
 The report triggered a rise in the euro  with the currency
trading above 116 yen on Monday  Euro sensitive stocks
outperformed  with Mazda Motor rising 2 0 percent to
206 yen and Canon Inc gaining 1 6 percent to 3 885 yen 	
  Meanwhile  solar energy stocks outperformed on news that
Germany plans to shut all its nuclear reactors by 2022  a
decision announced on Monday by Chancellor Angela Merkel s
ruling coalition in a policy reversal prompted by the Fukushima
radiation scare in Japan   ID nLDE74T0GY 	
  Most of these stocks are relatively small by market cap  so
they may not impact the index significantly  but if such buying
by domestic investors draws foreign buying there may be further
rises in the index   Mizuho s Segawa said 	
  Panel maker Sharp Corp rose 3 0 percent to 762 yen
while panel equipment manufacturer Ulvac surged 2 9
percent to 2 073 yen 	
  The benchmark Nikkei rose 1 2 percent to 9 615 54
at the midday break  The broader Topix index gained 1 0
percent to 831 60 	
 The Nikkei has traded narrowly between 9 400 and 9 600 for 	
the past two weeks  Worries about a slowdown in the 	
U S  economy and European debt problems have prevented sharp 	
gains  while attractive valuations have lent support  	
  Until this Friday  dip buying may help the market somewhat
as 64 percent of shares listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange s
main board are trading at or below their book value   said
Hiroichi Nishi  general manager at SMBC Nikko Securities       	
 Shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange s main board are trading

 Tokyo Electric Power Co dropped 3 4 percent to 315

 TOKYO  June 7  Reuters    Tokyo shares on Tuesday snapped a
three day losing streak in which the market slid 3 percent  as
hedge funds covered short positions and as foreigners bought
back on cheap valuations  a factor that  some say  may support
the market in coming weeks 	
 Hedge funds such as commodities trading advisors were
detected piling back into the market after offloading
substantial ammounts of shares on Monday  a move triggered by a
tumble in shares of troubled Tokyo Electric Corporation
   traders said 	
 Long term foreign investors placed large lot orders for a
combined 10 billion yen for 20 25 blue chip companies and 4
billion yen in mid  and small caps  two market sources said 
boosting overall confidence in the market and further bolstering
its afternoon rebound 	
 Toshiba Corp climbed after industry sources told
Reuters that it and Sony Corp are in talks to combine
their small and mid size liquid crystal display  LCD  panel
units into a new entity to boost their
competitiveness  ID nT9E7GR050 	
  The market lost 340 yen in three days and hedge funds are
now covering their short positions   said Takashi Ohba  a senior
strategist at Okasan Securities 	
  Both foreigners placing large lot orders and margin traders
scooping up small caps are attracted by cheap valuations  and
buying by those players may give some support to the Nikkei in
the next few weeks   he said 	
 Market participants said shares look attractive with about 	
65 percent of stocks listed on the Tokyo exchange s main board 	
trading at or below book value  By contrast stocks in the
benchmark S P 500 are at about 2 1 times book value 
according to ThomsonReuters Starmine  	
 This makes Tokyo equities the second cheapest market in the
G20  with Italy being the only cheaper market  ThomsonReuters
Starmine showed 	
  When the Nikkei trades below 9 400 institutional investors
buy global cyclical shares as a long term investment and retail
investors tend to buy defensive shares with high dividend
yields  such as drugmakers   said Fujio Ando  a senior managing
director at Chibagin Asset Management 	
 The Nikkei reversed most of its Monday s losses 
gaining 0 4 percent to 9 419 74 by midafternoon  while the
broader Topix was up 0 5 percent at 812 98  	
 Short covering in utilities and buying on dips of defensive
shares helped the market stay above a key support of 9 317    a
March 29 intraday low    although fears of a slowdown in the
U S  economy sparked by a string of weak data are likely to
prevent immediate big gains  	
 The next solid resistance looms around 9 573 26  at the
bottom of the Ichimoku cloud on the Nikkei s daily chart 	
 Utilities rose after underperforming on Monday on
speculation that Tokyo Electric Power Co could enter
court led restructuring 	
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said on Monday that a
court led restructuring of Tokyo Electric  the operator of the
crisis hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant  must be avoided 
 ID nT9E7GG020 	
 Tokyo Electric  known as Tepco  gained 2 98 percent to 213
yen  while Kansai Electric Power added 2 2 percent to
1 228 yen     	
 The pharmaceutical sector outperformed  with Astellas Pharma
 adding 2 1 percent to 3 125 yen and Eisai 
rising 0 8 percent to 3 050 yen 	
 Shares of Sony fell 1 7 percent to 2 028 yen after
hackers calling themselves Lulz Security said they had broken
into its computer systems again and posted the results on the
Internet   ID nN06152902 	
 Toshiba gained 2 8 percent to 408 yen on the news about the
LCD partnership with Sony 	
  This should be a good move for both companies as while they
need to invest in their core businesses  such as NAND and
nuclear businesses for Toshiba and new product development for
Sony   they are expected to enjoy synergy through the merger of
their small LCD panel operations   said Nobuo Kurahashi  an
analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities 	
 Shares of Canon Inc fell 3 4 percent at 3 715 yen
after the office equipment and camera maker announced on Monday
that it had completed its planned buyback of 50 billion yen
worth of its own shares between May 26 and June 3 	
 The stock  poised for its largest daily percentage fall
since mid March  had risen nearly 6 percent since its
announcement of the buyback programme on May 25 through Monday s
close

 HONG KONG  June 16  Reuters    Asian stocks slid to their
lowest level in nearly three months on Thursday and the euro
wobbled as Greece s debt troubles deepened and fresh U S  data
indicated its economic  soft patch  could drag on longer than
expected 	
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said he will form a
new cabinet on Thursday and seek a vote of confidence from his
fractious Socialist party to push through a harsh austerity
bill  as riot police battled tens of thousands of protesters in
the heart of Athens  	
 Greece must pass the new campaign of tax rises and spending
cuts to receive a new EU IMF bailout and a 12 billion euro aid
tranche that Athens needs to pay back debt that matures in
August 	
 Euro zone officials  meanwhile  said a new three year
financing programme for Greece may be delayed until next month
due to differences over how to involve private investors 
 	
 The euro fell to  1 4154   lows not seen since May 27 
before recovering a bit of ground to  1 4190  little changed
from late Thursday levels  and finding support around its
100 day moving average 	
 A further test of the euro zone will come later in the day
by way of a government bond auction in Spain  another country
struggling with budget deficits  unemployment and social unrest 
 	
 Escalating tensions in the euro zone and data showing the
U S  economy is facing a troubling mix of weaker growth and
higher prices triggered heavy selling on Wall Street  adding to
pressure on Asian equity markets and other riskier assets on
Thursday  	
  We have got used to fairly disappointing data from the
U S   so I think today s fall is mostly prompted mostly by euro
zone problems   said Takashi Ohba  a senior strategist at Okasan
Securities  	
 In Japan  the Nikkei fell 1 1 0 9 percent  with
growth sensitive shares such Canon and Mazda Motor
 underperforming 	
 Other Asian markets also retreated  with the MSCI Asia
ex Japan index down 1 7 percent  Shares of
materials and technology companies were among the weakest
performers on fears of faltering global growth 	
 Hong Kong s Hang Seng Index fell through a key chart
support at its March low  slumping 1 5 percent to its lowest
level this year  	
 Foreign bearishness about Chinese equities  partly over
corporate governance issues  have made investors increasingly
cagey about the outlook for the Hang Seng with short selling
seeing a pick up to levels last seen eight months ago 	
 In commodities markets  oil prices   recovered
in Asian trade after a more than 4 percent slide in the U S 
session as the rising dollar and signs of further economic
weakness fed demand worries  	
 August Brent crude futures jumped  1 56  topping
 114 a barrel  in the wake of a slightly recovering euro and a
larger than expected draw in U S  crude stocks  	
 Gold lost its footing on dollar strength 	
 Spot gold fell  3 32 an ounce to  1 526 5 an ounce 	
after rising for a second straight session to around  1 533 on

27410,248925,CAJ,FX news and analysis 25th Apr,opinion,USDThe dollar fell in most pairs on Tuesday although only by small amounts  The main event was the FOMC which maintained a similar policy stance to previous meetings  The rate was left unchanged and the expectation of low rates until 2014 continued to be a theme  The Fed reiterated a moderate growth outlook with downside risks still present  The housing sector was still considered depressed  Inflation rose but this was mainly due to rising fuel prices  Operation twist was to continue   whereby the Fed exchanges shorter for longer date securities  Jeffrey Lacker was the lone dissenter in not agreeing with rates remaining low till 2014  The dollar rose overall as a result of the FOMC but not by much as  low rates till 2014   weighed  Durable Goods data had undermined the dollar earlier on and increased chances of more quantitative easing  QE   after it was shown to have fallen by  4 2  compared to the previous month  However  on closer scrutiny the sudden fall was mainly due to Boeing orders falling to only 53 aircraft in March compared to 237 in February  Orders for non defence  excluding aircraft  slipped by only  0 8  whilst February s gain rose by 2 8  vs 1 7  previous  therefore overall  excluding aircraft  Durable Goods data was not overly negative  Despite lacklustre data  the outlook for the dollar remains to the upside fundamentally as a result of continued heightened risks of another crisis in the euro zone EUR The euro traded on the whole higher   rising versus the yen  dollar and British pound on Tuesday  There was some speculation that this may have been as a result of a rise in global risk appetite after the exceptional profits recorded by Apple Corp but this alone ought not to account for such a strong day for the euro  Commentary from the head of the ECB  Mario Draghi  speaking to the European Commission weighed on the euro earlier on  after he said   Uncertainty for the present situation remains very  very high   He added that the region was in   the most difficult phases   of a process   where austerity  where fiscal consolidation  has been  or is being undertaken and is now starting to  in a sense reverberate its contractionary effects   Meanwhile Draghi also mentioned that the Security Markets Programme is   neither infinite or eternal   His emphasis on all non standard measures being  temporary in nature  may also have added to concerns  The euro may have been bouyed by the calling of an election in the Netherlands but the period before leaves a 4 month vacuum  News from the bond markets showed that Spanish yields eased somewhat and an auction of German debt saw lower yields although demand diminished to half of what it had been previously GBP The pound fell after the news that GDP figures showed a contraction in growth which was lower than forecast in the 1st quarter of 2012  GDP fell  0 2  QoQ compared to the 0 1  rise expected  YoY it showed growth flat lining at 0 0  when a 0 3  rise had been expected and 0 5  rise recorded in the previous year  The shock result meant that the U K economy was officially in a recession and it was the first time the country had entered a double dip recession since the 1970s  Although the figures raised concerns about the government s austerity polices the chancellor of the exchequer rebuffed talk of diluting the hitherto concentrated effort to reduce the public debt  However  there is a concern that falling incomes and higher fuel prices are leading a pincer movement on growth and the government s austerity could be too much too quickly and lead to a crippling of the engines of growth  Despite renewed speculation the BOE might introduce more QE in response to the contraction in growth such policies are not expected to be introduced yet JPY The yen fluctuated in most pairs and ended the day where it started  Against the dollar it strengthened initially after Durable Goods Orders in the U S showed a larger than expected  4 2  fall but then weakened after the FOMC was mildly optimistic in its forecasts for the economy  Overall the outlook was for a weaker yen going forward as it is widely expected that the BOJ will initiate further QE at its next meeting next week  A pick up in stocks and higher profit forecasts from Canon on Wednesday also encouraged a weaker outlook for the yen as much of the profits calculated by Canon were based on a weaker yen forecast  Concern about ongoing risks in Europe which has suffered from increased economic and political instability  however  offset some of the bearishness and optimism for a weaker yen as the currency could still appreciate from safe haven demand in a crisis situation  On the data front Wednesday saw the release of Machine Tool Orders which rose by 1 6  in March   less than the 2 4  rise in the previous month  and Small Business Confidence fell in April to 47 6 from 48 7 in the previous month

 SINGAPORE  June 16  Reuters    The euro fell sharply on
Thursday after a European central banker said the bail out fund
for the region s debt crisis should be doubled to 1 5 trillion
euros  accelerating a pullback from riskier assets that knocked
Asian stocks to near three month lows 	
 Nout Wellink  governing council director of the European
Central Bank  told Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad that
a new Greek aid package would carry so many uncertainties and
risks that a doubling in the bail out fund would be necessary to
take into account the contagion risk for both Ireland and
Portugal  	
 The comments knocked the euro below  1 4100 and cut to the
heart of fears that problems Greece faces with its black hole of
debt could spread to other countries at a time when the U S 
economy may be slowing  the Federal Reserve s  600 billion bond
purchase programme is ending and some investors are second
guessing emerging market assets in countries such as China 	
 The euro was down 0 5 percent to  1 4094 by early
afternoon in Asia  having fallen almost 3 cents so far this
week 	
 The U S  dollar index   which tracks its performance
against six other major currencies  rose 0 5 percent to the
highest since May 26 	
 Oil prices staged a weak rebound after dropping sharply
overnight  though volatile markets suggested crude could resume

 Investors have been re positioning their portfolios with an
eye on the litany of risks ahead of U S  data later in the day
that included May housing starts  weekly jobless claims and the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia business outlook survey 
  	
  There is very clearly an environment now in which risk is
off and to that investors shy away from obvious risk on assets
such as equities and high beta currencies   said John Woods 
managing director and chief investment strategist with Citi
Private Bank 	
 Woods told Reuters Television that he has been advising that
his clients look at local currency bond markets in Asia that
have been resilient to pressures coming from the euro zone and
still offer relatively high yield 	
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said he will form a
new cabinet on Thursday and seek a vote of confidence from his
fractious Socialist party to push through a harsh austerity
bill  as riot police battled tens of thousands of protesters in

 UNCERTAINTY MAGNIFIED	
 Greece must pass a new campaign of tax rises and spending
cuts to receive a new EU IMF bailout and a 12 billion euro aid
tranche that Athens needs to pay back debt that matures in
August  But many analysts and economists believe it is bound to
default on its debt sooner or later 	
  Greece is like a Lehman Brothers situation  except a
country version   said Tanrich Securities  Vice President
Jackson Wong in Hong Kong   It s magnifying uncertainty right
now  even though most banks don t have much exposure to the euro
debt situation    	
 In Japan  the Nikkei fell 1 7 percent  with

 Samsonite International SA   the world s biggest
luggage maker  dropped 11 percent in its Hong Kong trading debut
on Thursday  reflecting weak investor appetite for initial

 Foreign bearishness about Chinese equities  partly over
corporate governance issues  have made investors increasingly
cagey about the outlook for the Hang Seng with short selling
seeing a pick up to levels last seen eight months ago 	
 In commodities markets  oil prices   recovered

 By James Topham	
 TOKYO  April 26  Reuters    Japan s Canon Inc 
slashed its annual outlook to below market expectations as it
tries to deal with a quake hit supply chain that it said was
months away from being fixed 	
 Canon  which competes with Sony Corp and Nikon Corp
 in cameras and Xerox Corp and Ricoh Co Ltd
 in copiers  also reported a 5 percent fall in quarterly
operating profit 	
 The company said a recovery of the supply chain to levels
before last month s earthquake was not expected until June or
July 	
 The world s largest maker of digital cameras on Tuesday
lowered its operating profit forecast for the business year to
end December to 335 billion yen   4 1 billion   29 percent lower
than its earlier estimate 	
 That is below the average estimate of 396 5 billion yen in a
poll of six analysts taken by Thomson Reuters I B E S after the
quake 	
  The company s revised forecast suggests a tough year for
the firm   said Naoki Fujiwara  a fund manager at Tokyo based
Shinkin Asset Management  but added that Canon s issuance of a
forecast was a positive sign with many manufacturers not
expected to give any guidance 	
  I think  the disaster  will have a temporary impact on
supply but we have to wait more to see its impact on demand   he
said 	
 Canon slashed its sales target for digital compact cameras
for this year to 20 million from 23 million  but kept its sales
projections for single lens reflex cameras    high end models
with interchangeable lenses    at 7 million 	
  Even though we are working on plans to get back in the game
in the second half  I think this year will be marked by the
harsh conditions that have arisen   Canon CFO Toshizo Tanaka
said at a news briefing 	


 SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION	
 The disruption of parts supply in Japan has also affected a
wide range of electronics makers  including many overseas  such
as Apple Inc and Texas Instruments  	
 Last week  Xerox posted a rise in quarterly profit  but said
it sees some  product constraints  in the middle of the second
quarter due to the disaster and does not expect a full product
recovery until later this year 	
 The maker of EOS and IXY digital cameras  like many Japanese
manufacturers  had to deal with component supply shortages and
rolling blackouts following the massive earthquake and tsunami
on March 11 and the subsequent nuclear crisis 	
 Canon was forced to halt operations at its main camera
factory on the southern island of Kyushu in March due to a
shortage of parts following the quake  but Tanaka told reporters
after the briefing its is now running around 70 percent of
capacity 	
 For January March  the optical equipment maker s operating
profit came to 82 5 billion yen   1 0 billion   compared with
86 84 billion yen in the same quarter a year earlier  falling to
its lowest level in six quarters 	
 However  that figure was above the average estimate of 77 1
billion yen in a poll of three analysts taken after the quake 	
 Ricoh is slated to report earnings on Wednesday  while Sony
and Nikon are scheduled to post results next month 	
 Shares of Canon  which takes its name from the Buddhist
goddess of mercy  have fallen 8 percent since the quake versus a
decline of about 7 percent in the benchmark Nikkei average
  	
 The company s shares closed 0 9 percent lower at 3 495 yen
on Tuesday before the results announcement  tracking a 1 2 fall
in the Nikkei 	
   1   81 845 Japanese Yen

look set to be resolved in a few months 	
 Some of the first earnings reports from manufacturers which
have had to curtail production after last month s quake and

Japan s sovereign rating but the move had little impact on the

 But with many quake hit firms not giving forecasts for this
financial year and still many reports to come  investors were
reluctant to build large positions  particularly ahead of the
outcome of the U S  Federal Open Market Committee s policy
meeting and first ever post meeting news conference by Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke 	
 Bernanke will be closely watched for hints on how the Fed
plans to exit from its ultra loose monetary policy 	
  Usually market activity picks during the middle of the
earnings season  but it s not like that this time   said Toru

  Investors still cannot be active as uncertainties remain
for many companies as they are not providing forecasts  The
Japanese market will seek direction from the overseas market  so
today s move after the FOMC could be important

133 15 points at 9 691 84  It s 1 4 percent climb was the

   Outlook on Japan s output helps sentiment

 By Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  April 28  Reuters    Tokyo stocks climbed 1 6 percent
on Thursday to their highest level since last s month
earthquake  helped by better than expected domestic earnings and
strength in U S  shares after the Federal Reserve pledged to
hold short term rates near zero 	
 Strong earnings reports this week from Japanese
manufacturers  such as the world s No 2 construction machinery
maker Komatsu   prompted active short covering 
especially after the Nikkei broke through its 200 day moving
average of 9 814 	
 Volume picked up to the highest level in two weeks  with
2 18 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo Stock Exchange s
first section 	
 Market turnover rose for the third straight session after
slumping to this year s lowest level of 1 46 billion shares on
Monday 	
  Earnings and a rise in overseas shares are key factors that
boosted shares prices today  The market especially may have
factored in the worst for manufacturers from their earnings
reports   said Hideyuki Ishiguro  a supervisor at Okasan
Securities 	
  Better than expected earnings have prompted short covering
after convincing gains seen over the past two days   he said 	
 Ishiguro said a recovery in shares such as Canon  
the world s top digital camera maker  encouraged views that
parts procurement woes were set to be resolved in a few months 	
 The benchmark Nikkei average closed the day up
157 90 points at 9 849 74    the highest since March 11 	
 The broader Topix rose 11 98 points or 1 4 percent
to 851 85 	
 Bright signs in Japanese output data also encouraged to
induce solid short covering  fund managers said 	
  Sentiment is turning positive  Today s industrial output
data may have helped the market as it showed bright signs in the
outlook   said Ryosuke Okazaki  chief investment officer at ITC
Investment Partners 	
  The situation doesn t look as bad as after the Lehman
shock  when production fell steadily  Many auto makers and other
manufacturers are giving their production schedule  We are
seeing problems in supplies  but demand is there  	
 Okazaki said the Japanese market also benefited as Wall
Street shares advanced strongly on relief that Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke s comment did nothing to short circuit
investors  optimistic outlook on the economy 	
 Industrial output fell 15 3 percent in March  more than a
median market forecast of an 11 percent drop and exceeding the
previous record decline marked during the Lehman crisis in 2009 
data from the Ministry of Economy  Trade and Industry showed
earlier   	
 But manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to
rise 3 9 percent in April and 2 7 percent in May  ID nL3E7FR5E4 	
 With the Nikkei having broken through the 200 day moving
average  investors may test it above another important chart
level of 10 000 in the near term    	
  The strength in New York prices helped the Nikkei 
Technical sentiment for the Nikkei is improving  but we ll face
a tough psychological barrier at 10 000   said Yutaka Miura  a
senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities 	
 Miura said the market turned nervous about taking additional
positions as Japanese markets enter the Golden Week holiday
period on Friday 	
 Komatsu Ltd rose 2 8 percent to 2 840 yen after it
doubled its quarterly operating profit and forecast further
gains this year as it taps fast growing demand in China and sees
a continued recovery in the United States and Europe

   U S  jobs data to determine direction for Nikkei
   Exporters suffer as yen advanced to 79 yen level overnight

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  May 6  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average fell 1 5
percent on Friday as a rout in oil and commodity prices
pummelled resource stocks and sent the yen higher  hurting
shares of exporters  while caution ahead of U S  jobs data
prompted profit taking   	
The Nikkei suffered its biggest daily percentage loss since
April 12 after gaining 4 6 percent over the previous three
trading sessions   	
 A surge in weekly claims for U S  jobless benefits helped
trigger selling after the benchmark index closed on Monday above
the 10 000 mark for the first time since the March 11
earthquake  Japanese financial markets were closed between
Tuesday to Thursday for public holidays 	
  Sharp falls in commodities prices and the yen s firmness
prompted selling  Investors saw today as a good opportunity to
square off some positions ahead of more corporate earnings next
week   Nagayuki Yamagishi  a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities 	
  The Nikkei s rise above 10 000 may have been too rapid 
with sentiment in overseas markets deteriorating as prospects
for a rate hike in Europe fade and some concerns about the
outlook for the U S  economy are growing   he said 	
 The benchmark Nikkei ended the day down 145 00
points at 9 859 20 and analysts said support is seen at its
5 day moving average of 9 755  	
 The broader Topix fell 1 1 percent or 9 05 points to
856 50   	
  Worries about the U S  economy are growing after a series
of weak economic indicators  which are undermining Japanese
stocks  Tonight s U S  payroll data will be very important  
said Ryosuke Okazaki  chief investment officer at ITC Investment
Partners 	
 The U S  Labor Department on Thursday said first time
filings for jobless benefits soared to 474 000 last week  the
highest level since mid August 2010 	
 The surprise jump was attributed to factors ranging from
spring break layoffs to the introduction of an emergency
benefits program   ID nN05259672   	
 This week s jobs data have caused some economists to pare
predictions for April payrolls growth  The median forecast among
analysts polled by Reuters is now a 186 000 increase from an
earlier 198 000 rise  Payrolls grew by 216 000 in March 	
 The dollar fell below 80 yen for the first time since March
18  the day central banks intervened to weaken the Japanese
currency after it hit a record high   The pair fell to a
7 week low of 79 57 yen Thursday  but later traded around 80 44
on Friday 	
 Investors were also nervous about taking large positions
ahead of a slew of corporate earnings announcement scheduled for
next week  including companies such as Toyota Motor and
Toshiba  	
 Sony Corp fell 2 3 percent to 2 262 yen after the
company revealed hackers had stolen data on another 25 million
user accounts of its PC games system in a second massive
security breach for the consumer electronics giant 
 ID nN02249883   	
 Among exporters hurt by a stronger yen  Toyota Motor
 fell 2 4 percent to 3 210 yen and Canon 
dropped 2 3 percent 	
 Honda Motor fell 4 7 percent to 3 075 yen after
Japan s No 3 automaker expanded an earlier recall of Honda and
Acura vehicles over airbags that could use with too much
pressure by another 833 000 vehicles   ID nN03127142   	
 Shares of resource related companies such as Inpex 
and JX Holdings fell sharply reflecting plunges in oil and other
commodities 	
 Brent crude oil  dived a record  12 a barrel and
silver slumped by nearly  5  its biggest one day decline
since 1980  though they stabilised on Friday   	
 Shares of Inpex  Japan s top oil and gas developer  fell 6 2
 percent to 563 000 yen  while JX Holdings   which owns
Japan s top copper smelter Pan Pacific Copper and Japan s top
oil refiner JX Nippon Oil   Energy  fell 3 4 percent to 542 yen

 SINGAPORE  May 26  Reuters    Asian stocks were on course
for their biggest gain in a month on Thursday  led by resources
and consumer sectors  with recovering commodity prices and the
euro s rebound toward  1 42 bringing investors back into the
markets in search of bargains 	
 The risks surrounding the euro have not eased much  with
Greece fighting to avoid a debt restructuring that could have a
big ripple effect across other high risk European countries
struggling with gaping fiscal deficits   ID nLDE74O1MZ 	
 For now though  the pendulum was swinging back to risk
taking on Thursday  with volatility in precious metals and crude
prices having faded  allowing investors to scamper back to scoop
up previously sold shares  albeit in reduced trading volumes 	
 Japan s Nikkei share average climbed 1 2 percent in
early trade  with camera maker Canon Inc leading the
charge  The stock was up 5 5 percent after it said on Wednesday
that would buy back 50 billion yen   610 million  of its own

 The Nikkei has been in a fairly narrow downtrend in May 
though this week has bounced off of the April low 	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up
1 1 percent after closing at a two month low on
Wednesday  	
 Investors kept their buying focused mostly in the materials
and consumer discretionary sectors  areas of the market that
have been among the highest returning segments so far this year 	
  The two key themes for those with a longer term view remain
demographics and consumption   said Sarah Lien  senior research
analyst with Russell Investments 	
  We re seeing managers still add to consumption related
stories  The thing to remember in Asia  though  is that sectors
such as property  insurance and wealth management are also a
play on consumption as disposable income rises   she said 	
 A survey by Russell Investments of 40 institutional managers
globally found 63 percent still rate Asia as the most attractive
investment destination  with the United States the next
most favoured at 14 percent 	
 A sustained equity rally in Asia with a pickup in trading
volumes before the summer lull may be enough to attract some
investors back to the region  The Asia Pacific ex Japan index

this year  slipping 0 3 percent compared with a 2 7 percent rise
in global shares 	
 U S  S P 500 futures  rose 0 3 percent  suggesting a

 The euro was up 0 6 percent at  1 4160   after bears
were unable to push the currency below the 100 day moving
average this week 	
 Hedge funds eager to trim their bets against the euro helped
to push it back up in Asia trading above  1 4150    A Financial

industry  said on Friday it would resume operation of a factory
in Ibaraki prefecture on June 15  ahead of the previously

 This news was a positive surprise  Investors have

triggered buying in automakers   said Makoto Kikuchi  chief

 TOKYO  April 22  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average
erased earlier losses to end flat on the day and posted small
weekly gains on Friday after news that Renesas Electronics
 would resume operations at a key auto chip factory
triggered short covering in a holiday thinned market 	
 The fate of the market is seen hinging on upcoming earnings
reports from next week  which will give investors their first
hard evidence of the extent of the damage from a devastating
earthquake and other disasters in March 	
  The mood is generally pessimistic in the market  so
investors are clinging on to any possible good news that comes
out  That s why the market turned positive in the afternoon 
even though it  the news on Renesas  didn t seem so important to
me   said Yuuki Sakurai  CEO of Fukoku Capital Management 	
 While there was sporadic buying from Asian investors  there
were fewer market participants on Friday with the United States
and many other overseas markets closed for holidays 
exaggerating price moves 	
 The benchmark Nikkei average ended almost flat at
9 682 21  while the broader Topix was also steady at
842 18  Both were in negative territory during morning trade 	
 For the week  the Nikkei was up 0 9 percent  while the Topix
climbed 0 1 percent 	
 The Nikkei has hugged a tight range between 9 400 and 9 800
since early this month as market players wait for earnings
reports next week that are expected to show the impact of last
month s devastating earthquake on profits 	
  I think there are still investors out there who haven t
sold after the March earthquake because the timing was the end
of book closing  If those who had a wait and see stance sell
when companies give negative surprises  the market may see a
sharp decline   said Hiroyuki Fukunaga  chief executive of
Investrust 	
 Some investors worry that disruptions in supply chains could
hobble manufacturers for a long time  boding ill for Japanese
shares  which have been underperforming most other countries
since the earthquake 	
 I m hearing from many companies that there are suppliers
that will not recover  no matter what  and some of them are very
hard to replace  so companies are scrambling for parts and also
looking abroad   said Sakurai of Fukoku Asset 	
 On Friday  however  investors were cheered by the
announcement from Renesas   a major supplier of chips to
the auto industry  that it would resume operations at a factory
in Ibaraki prefecture on June 15  ahead of the previously

   Volume may stay thin as market awaits major earnings this
week

 By Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  April 25  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei edged up on
Monday  helped by gains in shipping stocks on hopes for robust
earnings  although volume may remain light as investors
cautiously await corporate earnings reports due this week 	
  Analysts said the market s direction will hinge in
large part on upcoming earnings reports  which will provide the
first hard evidence of the extent of damage from last month s
devastating earthquake 	
 Trading may be subdued as investors are reluctant to make
big bets before Canon Inc   Sony Corp and
construction machinery maker Komatsu Ltd report
results  analysts added 	
  Major earnings will start coming out after the market
close  so investors will probably stay on the sidelines today  
said Yumi Nishimura  a senior market analyst at Daiwa
Securities  Support is expected at the Nikkei s 25 day moving
average  now at 9 590  she added 	
 But shipping stocks outperformed the market after the Nikkei
business daily on the weekend reported that earnings sharply
rebounded at three major marine transport companies in the year
ended on March 31 	
 Mitsui OSK Lines rose 2 7 percent to 464 yen 
Nippon Yusen gained 2 3 percent to 307 yen and Kawasaki
Kisen added 1 1 percent to 279 yen 	
  The shippers  gains are straightforward  The expectations
for good results reflect strong demand in the global economy and
they suffered relatively little damage from the March
earthquake   said Naoki Fujiwara  a fund manager at Shinkin
Asset Management 
 The benchmark Nikkei average was up 0 6 percent at
9737 41  while the broader Topix gained 0 5 percent to

 Analysts said the Nikkei was expected to trade between 9 600

200 day moving average at 9 805 	
 Komatsu Ltd rose 1 6 percent to 2 818 yen after the

 TOKYO  April 25  Reuters    Japan s largest companies are
likely to paint a bleak picture for this year s profits when
they start announcing earnings this week  if they offer any
guidance at all 	
 More than a month after Japan s devastating earthquake and
tsunami on March 11  firms are still struggling with unraveled
supply chains and sluggish consumer demand  making predicting
future profits difficult if not impossible 	
 Investors in Japan  used to companies providing guidance for
a full year ahead  will be forced to rely increasingly on the
number crunching of equity analysts  who themselves are
struggling to form a clear picture of future demand 	
  Earnings season is here and we want to focus on outlooks
for the current year  but it may be only a minority of companies
that can provide one   Daiwa Securities Group chief
executive Takashi Hibino told Reuters in a recent interview 
predicting the uncertainty would last through the summer 	
 Among blue chip firms announcing earnings this week for the
business year ended in March are video game giant Nintendo
 on Monday and Honda Motor on Thursday 
  	
 Office equipment and camera maker Canon Inc   which
has a business year running from January to December  reports
its earnings on Tuesday  	
 	


 Barclays Capital projects that the average net profit at all
firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange s first section  which
includes Japan s biggest firms  will fall 12 percent this
financial year  with the slide led by export related industries
such as auto and electronics firms 	
 Data from Thomson Reuters Starmine shows that analysts have
on average revised down their profit estimates across all
sectors by 6 percent in the past 30 days 	
 The biggest drop was for utilities at 37 percent due mainly
to sharp downward revisions for crisis hit Tokyo Electric Power
   That was followed by automobiles and components at
minus 24 6 percent and the semiconductor sector down 11 percent 	
 Much of that gloom may already be factored in to share
prices  Tokyo s transportation equipment and
electrical machinery subindexes are both down about 6
percent since March 11  although that outperforms the TOPIX s
 8 percent decline 	
  The auto and electronics sectors are expected to either
announce conservative outlooks for this fiscal year or postpone
the release of outlooks   said Yoshinori Nagano  a senior
strategist at Daiwa Asset Management   But negative sentiment on
these sectors is somewhat priced in  	
 
 TOYOTA S WOES	
 Some firms have already declined to estimate profits this
year  Yaskawa Electric Corp   the world s largest maker
of industrial robots used by automakers and chip producers did
not give a forecast when it released results on April 20  citing
worries about whether it can get enough parts 	
 Nowhere has the disruption to supply chains been more severe
than in the auto sector 	
 Toyota  Nissan Motor Co and Honda all suspended
production for a good part of the first month following the
earthquake  and have slashed production by half of their
intended output since then  	
 The impact has even spread to factories in North America 
Europe and Asia as they too run out of parts 	
 For Toyota  which said on Friday that it could take until
December for output to return to pre quake levels  projections
from 11 analysts who revised their forecasts after the
earthquake yielded an average operating profit of 281 9 billion
yen for the year to March 2012  	
 That is down 65 percent from the consensus of 804 billion
yen from 21 analysts before the quake  according to Thomson
Reuters I B E S  When the world s No  1 carmaker announces its
results on May 11  the company may opt not to provide its own
forecast 	
 Assessing the outlook for Japan s electronic conglomerates
may also tax the divining skills of analysts this earnings
season  The consensus for Sony Corp s profit has fallen
only 14 5 percent to 270 1 billion yen in the past 30 days 
despite plant stoppages 	
  One source of concern is that analysts have not cut their
estimates for the current year by very much   said Koji Toda 
chief fund manager at Resona Bank in Tokyo   I think many are
leaving their figures unchanged because they don t have enough
information to decide how far to cut them  	
 Overseas investors who do not follow Japanese equities
closely may get a shock when forecasts finally emerge  possibly
about the time of first quarter earnings in June  Toda said  	
 The effect of that  he added  could weigh on share prices
for some time 	
 Japan s Nikkei stock index is down about 5 percent
since March 11 and is one of the worst performing developed 
major equity markets so far this year 	
 Not all the uncertainty may result in negative surprises 
Some investors are encouraged by the speed at which power
generation capacity has recovered since the quake  and initial
plans to force large users to cut back by a quarter may be
eased   ID nL3E7FL0M0 	
 Some investors and business executives see supply woes
fading in the second half of the financial year  while
consumption is likely to rise as spending kicks in to revive the
stricken northeast

on average revised down their profit estimates across all
sectors by 6 percent in the past 30 days 	
 The biggest drop was for utilities at 37 percent due mainly
to sharp downward revisions for crisis hit Tokyo Electric Power
   That was followed by automobiles and components at
minus 24 6 percent and the semiconductor sector down 11 percent 	
 Much of that gloom may already be factored in to share
prices  Tokyo s transportation equipment and
electrical machinery subindexes are both down about 6
percent since March 11  although that outperforms the TOPIX s
 8 percent decline 	
  The auto and electronics sectors are expected to either
announce conservative outlooks for this fiscal year or postpone
the release of outlooks   said Yoshinori Nagano  a senior
strategist at Daiwa Asset Management   But negative sentiment on
these sectors is somewhat priced in  	
 
 TOYOTA S WOES	
 Some firms have already declined to estimate profits this
year  Yaskawa Electric Corp   the world s largest maker
of industrial robots used by automakers and chip producers did
not give a forecast when it released results on April 20  citing
worries about whether it can get enough parts 	
 Nowhere has the disruption to supply chains been more severe
than in the auto sector 	
 Toyota  Nissan Motor Co and Honda all suspended
production for a good part of the first month following the
earthquake  and have slashed production by half of their
intended output since then  	
 The impact has even spread to factories in North America 
Europe and Asia as they too run out of parts 	
 For Toyota  which said on Friday that it could take until
December for output to return to pre quake levels  projections
from 11 analysts who revised their forecasts after the
earthquake yielded an average operating profit of 281 9 billion
yen for the year to March 2012  	
 That is down 65 percent from the consensus of 804 billion
yen from 21 analysts before the quake  according to Thomson
Reuters I B E S  When the world s No  1 carmaker announces its
results on May 11  the company may opt not to provide its own
forecast 	
 Assessing the outlook for Japan s electronic conglomerates
may also tax the divining skills of analysts this earnings
season  The consensus for Sony Corp s profit has fallen
only 14 5 percent to 270 1 billion yen in the past 30 days 
despite plant stoppages 	
  One source of concern is that analysts have not cut their
estimates for the current year by very much   said Koji Toda 
chief fund manager at Resona Bank in Tokyo   I think many are
leaving their figures unchanged because they don t have enough
information to decide how far to cut them  	
 Overseas investors who do not follow Japanese equities
closely may get a shock when forecasts finally emerge  possibly
about the time of first quarter earnings in June  Toda said  	
 The effect of that  he added  could weigh on share prices
for some time 	
 Japan s Nikkei stock index is down about 5 percent
since March 11 and is one of the worst performing developed 
major equity markets so far this year 	
 Not all the uncertainty may result in negative surprises 
Some investors are encouraged by the speed at which power
generation capacity has recovered since the quake  and initial
plans to force large users to cut back by a quarter may be
eased   ID nL3E7FL0M0 	
 Some investors and business executives see supply woes
fading in the second half of the financial year  while
consumption is likely to rise as spending kicks in to revive the
stricken northeast

27537,249052,CAJ,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,Iran  This was an historic week on the U S  Israel front President Barack Obama to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  March 4  Let s begin with a basic truth that you all understand  No Israeli government can tolerate a nuclear weapon in the hands of a regime that denies the Holocaust  threatens to wipe Israel off the map  and sponsors terrorist groups committed to Israel s destruction  And so I understand the profound historical obligation that weighs on the shoulders of Bibi Netanyahu and Ehud Barak  and all of Israel s leaders  A nuclear armed Iran is completely counter to Israel s security interests  But it is also counter to the national security interests of the United States   And that is why  four years ago  I made a commitment to the American people  and said that we would use all elements of American power to pressure Iran and prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapons  And that is what we have done   Iran is isolated  its leadership divided and under pressure  And by the way  the Arab Spring has only increased these trends  as the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime is exposed  and its ally   the Assad regime   is crumbling   The United States and Israel both assess that Iran does not yet have a nuclear weapon  and we are exceedingly vigilant in monitoring their program    Given  their history  there are  of course  no guarantees that the Iranian regime will make the right choice  But both Israel and the United States have an interest in seeing the challenges resolved diplomatically   Moreover  as President and Commander in Chief  I have a deeply held preference for peace over war  We all prefer to resolve this issue diplomatically  Having said that  Iran s leaders should have no doubt about the resolve of the United States   just as they should not doubt Israel s sovereign right to make its own decisions about what is required to meet its security needs  I have said that when it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon  I will take no options off the table  and I mean what I say   Iran s leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of containment  I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon  And as I have made clear time and again during the course of my presidency  I will not hesitate to use force when it is necessary to defend the United States and its interests  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to AIPAC  March 5  President Obama has reiterated all options are on the table  and that American policy is not containment  Well  Israel has exactly the same policy   We are determined to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons  we leave all options on the table  and containment is definitely not an option  The Jewish state will not allow those who seek our destruction to possess the means to achieve that goal   A nuclear armed Iran must be stopped   Fortunately  President Obama and most world leaders understand that the claim that Iran s goal is not to develop nuclear weapons is simply ridiculous  Yet incredibly  some are prepared to accept an idea only slightly less preposterous  that we should accept a world in which the Ayatollahs have atomic bombs  Sure  they say  Iran is cruel  but it s not crazy  It s detestable but it s deterrable  My friends  responsible leaders should not bet the security of their countries on the belief that the world s most dangerous regimes won t use the world s most dangerous weapons  And I promise you that as Prime Minister  I will never gamble with the security of the State of Israel   For the last decade  the international community has tried diplomacy  It hasn t worked  For six years  the international community has applied sanctions  That hasn t worked either  I appreciate President Obama s recent efforts to impose even tougher sanctions against Iran  These sanctions are hurting Iran s economy  but unfortunately  Iran s nuclear program continues to march forward  Israel has waited patiently for the international community to resolve this issue  We ve waited for diplomacy to work  We ve waited for sanctions to work  None of us can afford to wait much longer  As Prime Minister of Israel  I will never let my people live in the shadow of annihilation   We deeply appreciate the great alliance between our two countries  But when it comes to Israel s survival  we must always remain the masters of our fate   Note  I have more extensive excerpts of both speeches on my  Hot Spots  link  And so the two leaders met at the White House on Monday  Obama having spoken to AIPAC the night before  Netanyahu addressing the key lobby group hours later I have long said in this space that Benjamin Netanyahu is the smartest man on the planet and it s not even close   He s also a corrupt sonuvagun  President Obama  on the other hand  thinks he is the smartest man on the planet  And so you have this dynamic between the two  It s largely why they don t get along Well it would behoove the Free World that the two cooperate now  but here s the bottom line Israel s  red line  is when it can no longer take out Iran s capacity to build a nuclear weapon  with Israel also not wanting Iran to pass into a  zone of immunity  in which key facilities may be invulnerable to attack  In both instances  Israel could build a case that given its Air Force s existing capabilities  Iran has basically already reached the zone  For the United States  the red line is when the U S  is convinced Iran is about to  break out  and go for the bomb  acknowledging Iran could already have the capacity to build one  with the U S  having far greater military capabilities for inflicting the kind of devastating damage necessary to disrupt Iran s increasingly underground program at that point So  goes Israeli thinking  if Netanyahu doesn t act  will Obama before it s too late Obama is relying on the intelligence community to be able to tell him when Iran is within a year of having a bomb  But Iran can have a bomb within months of breaking out  meaning the enrichment of uranium from harmless 20  to bomb grade 90   Today  the West doesn t have the inspectors on the ground to know when this is occurring  We just have some cameras at places like Natanz  while you saw how Iran prevented the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency from checking out the military site at Parchin  which the IAEA now says Iran is attempting to clean up after possible tests of a nuclear weapon trigger  On Tuesday  British Prime Minister David Cameron said Iran is seeking to build  some sort of intercontinental missile capability   adding in a speech to British lawmakers  he does not  believe that an Iranian nuclear weapon is just a threat to Israel  But now the United States and the other members of the Group of Six  China  France  Germany  Russia and Britain  will commence a new round of talks with Iran  The timing is to be determined  even as the sands of the hourglass are running out  Charles Krauthammer   Washington Post It s Lucy and the football  Iran style  After ostensibly tough talk about preventing Iran from going nuclear  the Obama administration acquiesced this week to yet another round of talks with the mullahs  This  14 months after the last group of six negotiations collapsed in Istanbul because of blatant Iranian stalling and unseriousness  Nonetheless  the new negotiations will be both without precondition and preceded by yet more talks to decide such trivialities as venue  These negotiations don t just gain time for a nuclear program about whose military intent the International Atomic Energy Agency is issuing alarming warnings  They make it extremely difficult for Israel to do anything about it  while it still can   lest Israel be universally condemned for having aborted a diplomatic solution  If the administration were serious about achievement rather than appearance  it would have warned that this was the last chance for Iran to come clean and would have demanded a shorter timeline  After all  President Obama insisted on deadlines for the Iraq withdrawal  the Afghan surge and Israeli Palestinian negotiations  Why leave these crucial talks open ended when the nuclear clock is ticking      So what is Obama s real objective   We re trying to make the decision to attack as hard as possible for Israel   an administration official told The Post in the most revealing White House admission since  leading from behind   Revealing and shocking  The world s greatest exporter of terror  according to the State Department   the systematic killer of Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan  the self declared enemy that invented  Death to America Day  is approaching nuclear capability   and the focus of U S  policy is to prevent a democratic ally threatened with annihilation from preempting the threat      A fair minded observer might judge that Israel s desire to not go gently into the darkness carries higher moral urgency than the political future of one man  even if he is president of the United States  Bret Stephens   Wall Street Journal Should Israelis and pro Israel Americans take President Obama at his word when he says   as he did at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee   I have Israel s back   No  Here is a president who fought tooth and nail against the very sanctions on Iran for which he now seeks to reap political credit  He inherited from the Bush administration the security assistance to Israel he now advertises as proof of his  unprecedented  commitment to the Jewish state  His defense secretary has repeatedly cast doubt on the efficacy of a U S  military option against Iran even as the president insists it remains  on the table   His top national security advisers keep warning Israel not to attack Iran even as he claims not to  presume to tell  Israeli leaders  what is best for them   Oh  and his secretary of state answers a question from a Tunisian student about U S  politicians courting the  Zionist lobbies  by saying that  a lot of things are said in political campaigns that should not bear a lot of attention   It seems it didn t occur to her to challenge the premise of the question  On Thursday  Netanyahu gave an interview to Israel s three television networks  I don t have a stop watch in hand  This is not a matter of days or weeks  It is also not a matter of years  The result has to be that the threat of a nuclear weapon in Iran s hands is removed  Netanyahu made clear that Israel and the U S  had different time references  The U S  is big and distant  Israel is smaller and closer to Iran  and   of course   we have different capabilities  So the American clock regarding preventing nuclearization of Iran is not the Israeli one  The Israeli clock works  obviously  according to a different schedule   One note on Israel and the Palestinian situation  which is getting buried in all the Iran talk  An Israeli airstrike took out a top Hamas military commander  while action is heating up in Gaza with heavy exchanges of rocket fire between Palestinians and Israelis  Syria  I first brought up the issue of Syria s chemical and biological weapons stockpiles a few weeks ago and Friday s Wall Street Journal has a story that American and Jordanian militaries are jointly developing plans to secure it  For this story to be presented the way it has been  you know it is of utmost concern and no doubt in my mind that Assad will use them on his own people  U S  officials say there is no sign of this but frankly my track record is better than theirs   let alone the danger the WMD fall into the hands of terrorists  Significant quantities are believed to have been weaponized by the Syrian government in artillery shells  bombs and possibly Scud and SS 21 missiles  Russia  North Korea  Egypt and Iran are among the countries that have assisted Damascus in developing these weapons  according to current and former U S  officials  The main concern  as expressed by Adm  William McRaven  head of the U S  Special Operations Command  is the weapons falling into the hands of Hizbullah in particular Any joint U S  Jordanian effort  however  can t occur until Assad falls  but were a headline to flash that he has been assassinated or flown out of the country  you can just imagine the incredible amount of immediate activity that will take place in Syria  including tribal bloodletting  The other news of the week from here was the same  Dreadful  including talk of a fresh massacre in Homs  where 44 members of several families were reportedly executed the day after the UN s humanitarian chief visited the place Syria s deputy oil minister defected  condemning his family to death  by his own admission as he left them behind  the bastard  At least four generals also reportedly defected  but it s too easy to then reach the conclusion that Assad s fall is imminent  You can only pray this is so  Just remember  if and when he does go  it s chaos and there is no united opposition it s worse than Libya And you also have Syria s ability to light the entire region on fire  Just last Sunday  2 000 Syrian refugees fled into Lebanon  according to the UN  A Lebanese security source told the Daily Star that the Lebanese Army arrested 30 armed Syrian rebels trying to sneak into the country as well  How many have already done so  Remember  I first went to Beirut in 2005 in the weeks after the Syrian Army was forced to exit following the assassination of Rafik Hariri  They had been there a long time  Assad could easily attempt to create a diversion in Lebanon today  Otherwise  Assad is trying to pound and cleanse one town  one city after another  As my friend Michael Young of the Daily Star adds  How the Syrian president intends to govern his sullen citizens after that is an open question  But if the principal American motive is a responsibility to protect citizens  then issuing statements of condemnation and piling up sanctions are unlikely to change Assad s behavior  and a new Security Council resolution will either be vetoed by Russia or so watered down as to be irrelevant  Speaking on the Senate floor  Sen  John McCain said there was a  clear strategic interest in forcing the regime  from Damascus  seeing as the Assad government serves as the  main forward operating base  for Iran in the Middle East  McCain is calling for air strikes  President Obama said  Ultimately this dictator will fall  but that U S  military action would be a big mistake For its part  fresh off his election victory  returning President Vladimir Putin said don t expect any change in Russia s policy Editorial   Washington Post Testimony by senior U S  officials to Congress this week about Syria has made one thing clear  The Obama administration has yet to face up to its own assessment of what is happening in that strategic Arab country  For months President Obama has been declaring that the fall of dictator Bashar al Assad is  inevitable  or  a question of when   as he put it Tuesday  But Marine Gen James Mattis  the head of U S  Central Command  told the Senate Armed Services Committee the same day that Mr  Assad is  gaining physical momentum  in his assault on his rebellious population   He s going to be there for some time because I think he will continue to employ heavier and heavier weapons  It will get worse before it gets better   Mr  Obama also derided suggestions that the United States should intervene militarily  Among other things  he said  we ve got to think through what s critical for U S  security interests   But Gen  Mattis said that if the Assad regime were to collapse   it ll be the biggest strategic setback for Iran in 20 years    As for building an international coalition for more forceful action  that historically has been the responsibility of the United States and its president  If Mr  Obama does not lead on Syria  there will be no international consensus   and an outcome that meets U S  interests will be anything but inevitable  Russia  Vladimir Putin is officially back  having captured 64  of the vote in Russia s presidential election on Sunday  Vlad  knowing his days are now numbered  shed a few tears as he accepted the cheers of his supporters outside the Kremlin Sunday evening  Err  rather  it was the cold wind that caused his eyes to water  he later said  Western observers said the vote was deeply flawed as Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov took second with 18   while billionaire New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov came in third with 8   The vote was a joke as you had situations like in Chechnya where  according to the Moscow Times  one precinct reported 99 7  for Putin with a turnout of 99 6   Another precinct in Chechnya  as reported by the New York Times  saw Putin capture 1 482 votes  though only 1 389 were registered to cast ballots  a neat trick if you can pull it off and they did The independent watchdog  Golos  said Putin got at least 50 7   so he would have avoided a run off anyway  and it s a fact the opposition slate of candidates was pathetic But the world knows the vote was still far from clean  this after the disastrous Dec  4 Duma election that spawned the mass protests leading up to the presidential ballot The discontent that spells Putin s eventual demise  I m on record as saying it s this year  goes back to last September when Putin and soon to be former President Dmitry Medvedev agreed to swap positions  It was said to be a tense meeting  with Medvedev reluctantly agreeing to the move  He had wanted to run again and instead Putin subjected him to this humiliation  confirmation that Medvedev was nothing more than Putin s puppet The thing is  the job swap  when announced at the United Russia party congress on Sept  24  could not have gone worse as Putin blurted out   We agreed to this years ago  Mark Franchetti writes of this period in the Sunday Times of London    Putin  had overreached himself  If Russians thought they were the victims of a hatchet job  here was its architect rubbing their noses in it  And so the rumblings started  with the growing middle class having had enough  it being as much about Putin himself as the stupendous level of corruption that dominates all facets of life I ve long said Putin will be done in by a shadowy third force  and of course it will be in essence an old style KGB coup  I said way back it would be Igor Sechin and his people who take control  Regardless  Vlad is gone because he is no longer an asset The only thing that could potentially save Putin is a massive reform effort  including the release of one time Yukos oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky  but this is not in the cards  especially the former  Just more stagecraft  designed to make the people believe Putin is reforming when he isn t  only this time the people won t allow the charade to continue The post election protests fizzled out last week  but they ll return  they might be today   and if Vlad tries to repress them it won t work   The Great Repression will come with the next guy  Meanwhile  one question for President Barack Obama   How s that reset workin  out for ya  Afghanistan   The tide has turned   The insurgency in southwestern Afghanistan  is no longer able to intimidate the local nationals to the point where they re fearful of siding with the government of Afghanistan   Marine Maj  Gen  John Toolan told USA TODAY in a phone interview Two things  Afghans hate the U S   and the Taliban is of course just biding its time  knowing 10 000 troops are leaving the region by October  Sorry to be such a cynic  but I ve been following this theater too closely not to feel otherwise  I do not doubt the surge in Helmand and Kandahar has had its successes  it s just not going to stick once we re gone All you have to do is look at the deepening suspicion between Afghan security forces and NATO  especially after the recent incidents in which six Americans were killed in three separate attacks by their Afghan counterparts  Afghan soldiers and police  or Taliban dressed in Afghan uniforms  have now killed 75 U S  and other coalition forces since 2007 Maj  Gen  James Mattis  head of U S  Central Command  tried to put it into context in testimony before Congress this week  Treachery has existed as long as there s been warfare No force is perfect  Mattis said that recruitment and training of Afghan security forces is progressing and that the goal of 352 000 will  be reached in 60 days   ahead of schedule Separately  the Brits lost six soldiers in the worst single attack on their troops of the war  bringing the British death toll to 404 since 2001  The attack was blamed on the Taliban  General David Richards  Chief of Defence Staff  said  truly impressive  progress has been made in Afghanistan  adding   We will hold our nerve  I know I speak for every man and woman in uniform when I say that we understand the importance of the mission with which we are charged  Wendy Rayner  the wife of a soldier killed in Helmand province in 2010  said that the lives of British and other NATO troops had been thrown away   My husband and our friends who died  and everybody else s throughout the whole of England and other countries  died for nothing   she said  Rayner added  It makes me very angry they have gone into this country to try to make peace and yet they will pull out of there and the poor people who are left will go back to the same crappy lifestyle that they had before our lot went in    The Times of London The UK still has 9 500 troops in Afghanistan  Prime Minister David Cameron is to address the mission in a meeting with President Obama in Washington next week Lastly  an estimated 200  were killed when their village was buried in an avalanche near the border with Pakistan Pakistan  Al Qaeda confirmed one of its top commanders  Badr Mansoor  was killed in an American drone attack last month  Mansoor  whose picture many of you would recognize  was said to be behind some of the worst attacks on Pakistani civilians in recent years  Al Qaeda accused the Pakistani government of collaborating on the drone strikes  which is a nice change in sentiment when looking at it from the Washington Islamabad standpoint Meanwhile  Pakistan charged Osama bin Laden s three widows with illegally entering the country  The two Saudis and a Yemeni were taken into custody last May in the bin Laden raid  Why the Pakistanis would make this announcement this week is probably just to send a message that the government is not as protective of the bin Laden family as some believe  The 10 children are free to leave the country  Run along now  Make sure you find an official cab or you could get gouged  Iraq  Way back  former U S  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld famously said al Qaeda had been reduced to a few  dead enders   Those dead enders killed at least 27 Iraqi police in the western part of the country the other day  disguising themselves as police with false warrants Yemen  Speaking of  ahem  dead enders  al Qaeda ambushed a Yemeni military post in the southern part of the country  killing at least 90  while 30 or so militants are said to have died in the operation  Al Qaeda made off with the heavy weaponry  it was reported  in an attack clearly meant to send a signal to new president  Abed Hadi  who has proclaimed he would go after the terrorists  The United States helped install Hadi so I wouldn t be in the least bit surprised to learn of an American airstrike or two on al Qaeda bases in the not too distant future Egypt  Many in the new parliament are seething over the release of pro democracy American activists before they could stand trial on charges they received illegal funds  The speaker of the lower house said those involved in the decision to lift the travel ban on 43 non governmental organization workers  including the 16 Americans  would be held accountable China  The government announced it was raising the defense budget to  100 billion this year  an increase of 11 2   Spending rose 12 7  the previous year  Li Zhaoxing  a spokesman for the national parliament  said the amount was aimed at  safeguarding sovereignty  national security and territorial integrity   Needless to say  many in the region find this a bit disconcerting At the National People s Congress  Premier Wen Jaibao said government seizures of land must stop  Farmers  rights to the land they contract to work on  to the land on which their houses sit  and to proceeds from collective undertakings  are property rights conferred by law  and these rights must not be violated by anyone    South China Morning Post Such land grabs have been a big cause of mass protests On the issue of the size of China s economy  economist Robert Samuelson wrote the following in the Washington Post  Let s look at the numbers  In 2010  according to the World Bank figures  China s economy was about 70  the size of America s  Its GDP totaled  10 2 trillion  compared with U S  GDP of  14 6 trillion  The trouble  contends  Arvind  Subramanian  of the Peterson Institute for International Economies   is that the United States  lead is a statistical illusion and that China s GDP is about 47  larger than the official estimates  This would bring the 2010 figure to  15 trillion  slightly ahead of the U S  GDP  Indeed  says Subramanian  a new study suggests the underestimate could be more than 70   This implies China s 2010 GDP exceeded  17 trillion  Kind of funny  considering all the talk on China is usually about their numbers being a total illusion  far less than reported As Samuelson points out  China s production and income is spread over 1 34 billion while U S  GDP is divided among 309 million  so using the World Bank figures   U S  per capita income totaled  47 153 in 2010  compared with China s  7 599  Assuming a Chinese GDP of  17 trillion raises per capita income to about  12 700  Whether or not you believe China is bigger today  the point at which it passes the U S  based on today s widely accepted data is far sooner than once believed North Korea  The United States is seeking the return of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors  soon  before granting any food assistance under the recent agreement that calls for the North to freeze long range missile and nuclear tests and cease enriching uranium and other  nuclear activities  at the Yongbyon atomic complex  Assuming the monitors are granted full access  instead of the limited access they had at Yongbyon before they were evicted in 2009  then the first 20 000 tons of Drakes Cakes can be delivered  Personally  if I were a North Korean  I d go with the Funny Bones because peanut butter travels better John Bolton   Wall Street Journal  IAEA  inspectors will be limited to the Yongbyon facility  which is like looking at North Korea through a straw   and at the wrong place no less  The overwhelming mass of the North s important nuclear weapons activities have long been deeply buried in hidden locations  unknown even to U S  intelligence  let alone IAEA inspectors   Most objectionable morally  despite U S  denials of a quid pro quo  We are providing 240 000 tons of food aid that will almost certainly be diverted to the DPRK military and other favored recipients  It is a strict canon of U S  humanitarian assistance that such aid be closely monitored  but there is no reason to believe that monitoring will be any more effective than in the past  Make no mistake  we are simply feeding young Kim s dictatorship  This agreement is a sham  pure and simple   which the North s separate communiqu  highlights  Pyongyang emphasizes that the deal with Washington is a prelude to resuming the six party talks  including South Korea  China  Russia and Japan   which will focus on  the lifting of sanctions on the DPRK and provision of light water reactors   Those are hallmarks of the failed 1994 Agreed Framework that the North never honored   Undoubtedly  a campaigning President Obama  fearing that his much touted foreign policy successes are less than meet the eye  is looking for quick diplomatic triumphs  He certainly does not want inconvenient crises in Iran and North Korea erupting simultaneously later this year  But whatever the electoral impact of the North Korea deal may be  its national security consequences are all too painful  Let s hope a new president can reverse them  Japan  The first anniversary of the tsunami   Fukushima disaster is Sunday  According to a survey of those most impacted  72  said they could see little or no progress in reconstruction efforts Turkey  An official of the government said Turkey was prepared to annex northern Cyprus if talks on reunification of the island between Greek and Turkish Cypriots did not reach a conclusion  Many Turkish Cypriots oppose the idea of annexation  Cyprus is governed by a Greek Cypriot administration and is part of the European Union  Turkey has stationed troops in the north since invading in 1974  Northern Cyprus is only recognized by Turkey and its only air link is to there France  The race for president is heating up  This week President Nicolas Sarkozy said there were too many foreigners in France and the system for integrating them is  working more and more badly   a shameless ploy aimed at picking off Marine Le Pen s National Front supporters As for Le Pen  as of March 1  she only had 452 of 500 signatures needed to qualify for the ballot and needs to get the remainder by March 16  These are signatures of elected officials  mayors  deputies  regional councilors and such  We ll see if my spoiler is just jerking everyone around and playing for PR  miraculously coming up with the rest just in time Meanwhile  the frontrunner  Socialist Party candidate Francois Hollande  has proposed a 75  income tax rate on France s super wealthy  to be applied on income over 1 million euros   1 32 million   Which means that this could spell the death of French football  The reason  The stars are among the few in the country making that kind of money and of course they ll opt to play elsewhere Hollande himself is miffed because Europe s leaders won t meet with him  Angela Merkel  Mario Monti and Spain s Mariano Rajoy have agreed not to see Hollande because of his demand that the recently signed fiscal compact be renegotiated upon his election  The Germans in particular worry that any changes a President Hollande may demand would open a Pandora s Box of demands from other states and delay the ratification process  Recall  12 Euro nations still must have their parliaments approve the compact and Ireland is having a referendum Britain  Aside from losing six soldiers in a single attack in Afghanistan  it was a bad week for Britain on another front as British Special Forces failed to rescue two taken hostage in Nigeria last May  one Brit  one Italian  and the hostages were then murdered by their captors before the Special Boat Service and elite Nigerian forces were able to seize them What makes this worse is that Italian authorities were not informed of the operation until it was underway and the Italians are pissed  rightfully so  We aren t talking not informing Pakistan before taking out bin Laden  after all  You re talking about an ally on a hostage mission The captors  at least two of whom were also killed  were affiliated with the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram  The victims worked for an Italian construction firm Venezuela  President Hugo Chavez said a tumor removed from his pelvic region was malignant  indicating the cancer had returned  Chavez told his people his prognosis was good and that he looked to return from Cuba in a month or so to resume campaigning for re election in October Congo  Unreal three days after a fire inside an arms depot set off a series of massive explosions  at least 250 were dead in Brazzaville  yet there was no relief effort  as reported by the AP  nor was the Red Cross let in because of the risk of more unexploded shells going off Uganda  Finally  just a note on the video sweeping the world   Kony 2012   about the leader of Africa s notorious Lord s Resistance Army  Joseph Kony  Back on 10 15 11 in this space  I wrote  Kill Kony   after learning President Obama sent 100 troops to the Central African Republic to help forces there track him down But now this video has been produced  it s had well over 60 million hits as of Friday evening  and the producer did the documentary as a way of raising awareness of the horrors inflicted by the LRA  with Kony being accused of using thousands of child soldiers in his reign of terror The thing is  the video is apparently  to some experts in the region  loose with the facts and hardly helpful in existing efforts to bring Kony to justice  including the Obama administration effort  which I applauded last fall I mean who is this latest social activist hero  filmmaker Jason Russell  More importantly  there are serious questions about his fundraising  The accounting for his San Diego organization   Invisible Children   is murky at best But you have celebrities ranging from Justin Bieber to Oprah to J K  Rowling offering their support  What the heck do they know about the topic If you aren t concerned about this display of mass manipulation  then you should be  To me  it s a Sign of the Apocalypse ,2012-03-14,Brian

27555,249070,CAJ,Britain s FTSE edges higher in thin holiday trade,news,"  FTSE 100 up 0 2 percent in early trade
   Techs  oils lead gainers  miners hit by metals price slide
   Volume thin at start of three session week
 
 By Simon Jessop
 LONDON  April 26  Reuters    Britain s leading shares edged
higher on Tuesday  led by technology stocks and integrated oils 
although trade was thin and is expected to remain so at the
start of a second holiday shortened trading week 
 ARM Holdings and Autonomy were among the top gainers  up 2 2
percent and 1 6 percent respectively  buoyed by upbeat broker
comment and after bumper results from Autonomy and global peers
last week 
 Integrated oils was the biggest sector gainer  adding around
8 points to the index  with Royal Dutch Shell up 1 2 percent on
a positive note from investment bank UBS  which named it as a
top pick on valuation grounds 
 BP also rose strongly  up 0 8 percent ahead of its quarterly
earnings report  due out on Wednesday 
 The blue chip FTSE 100 was up 0 2 percent at 6 030 80 points
at 0908 GMT  with volumes thin after the four day Easter weekend
and ahead of another four day holiday weekend for the Royal
Wedding  starting on Friday 
  A lot of people are still on holiday  so I think volumes
will remain quite light   said a London based sales trader at a
European investment bank  Volumes were just 9 percent of their
30 day average after the first hour of trade 
 Chris Purdy  trader at Spreadex  added   UK equities beyond
the natural resources sectors look range bound for the time
being though as there is little macroeconomic data of
significance and only three days of trading this week  
 The market had opened lower  tracking Asian and U S  market
falls  as miners were weighed by a broad based slide in base and
other metals ahead of a two day U S  Federal Reserve meeting 
and on concerns over monetary policy tightening in China 
 Randgold Resources  Kazakhmys and Antofagasta led the
blue chip fallers  down 1 1 percent to 1 7 percent 
 The U S  Fed s quantitative easing programme has fuelled
bumper gains for a range of commodities  but  with inflation
concerns rising  this week s meeting will be closely watched for
hints it could tighten policy quicker than expected 
  China was a bit weaker overnight as well   the London based
sales trader at a European investment bank said   Given that
they re a big buyer of commodities  that s a big potential
negative out there  
 Chinese stocks ended at a four week low overnight 
 With little fresh UK earnings news out on Tuesday  traders
will instead look ahead to the next two sessions  with results
due from index heavyweights including Barclays  AstraZeneca and
Shire 
 Of the 17 FTSE 100 companies due to report in the current
quarterly earnings season  18 percent have already done so with
67 percent missing estimates  with an average negative surprise
of 1 1 percent  according to Thomson Reuters data 
 Those still to report  however  are expected to post an
average positive surprise of 0 6 percent  the data showed 
 In spite of some negative numbers overnight from Japanese
firms including Canon  U S  firms have so far outperformed 
Chris Weston  institutional dealer at IG Markets  said he
remained bullish on equities in the medium term 
  Corporate earnings are at record levels in a number of
countries  balance sheets are undergeared and the Fed will keep
rates low this year and most of 2012   he said 
 In the absence of any fresh macroeconomic shocks  he added 
 meaningful pullbacks will be used as a buying opportunity for
equities traders

27560,249075,CAJ,UPDATE 2 Canon Q1 oper profit to fall  forecast to be cut Nikkei,news,"  Quake impact on production  strong yen hitting Canon
profits
   Company likely to revise down full year forecast   Nikkei
   Factory operating rates likely low through June   Nikkei
   Canon shares fall 2 3 pct  vs Nikkei s 0 5 pct drop

  Adds company comment  analyst report 	
 TOKYO  April 22  Reuters    Canon will likely
report an 8 percent fall in first quarter operating profit and
lower its full year forecast  reflecting the impact from Japan s
devastating earthquake  the Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday 	
 Canon  which competes with Sony and Nikon 
in cameras  was forced to suspend operations at its main camera
factory on the southern island of Kyushu in March  due to a
shortage of parts following the quake and tsunami 	
 Low operating rates at the firm s factories will likely
continue through June  given low domestic demand and continuing
supply woes  and profits are also being pressured by the strong
yen  the Nikkei said 	
 Canon s January March operating profit will likely come to
about 80 billion yen   977 million   down from 86 8 billion yen
in the same period a year earlier  the newspaper said  without
saying where it got the information 	
 Canon declined to comment on the report 	
 The company  which is scheduled to announce its earnings
results on Tuesday  is also expected to lower its full year
forecast  which is for operating profit to rise 21 percent to

27566,249081,CAJ,ANALYSIS Weaker yen may be burden in disguise for Japan Inc,news,"  Yen weakness may not help rebuilding after disaster
   Currency weakness adds to cost of importing fuel
   Could speed up deterioration in terms of trade
   Yen down 9 pct from record high  further weakness seen
   Yen fall already raising official alarm

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO  April 5  Reuters    Japanese companies will face more
pain than relief from a weaker yen  which may have started a
long term downtrend after a four year ascent just when currency
strength would help the country pay for the reconstruction of
the quake hit economy 	
 A weaker yen enhances export competitiveness for the likes
of Toyota Motor Inc and Canon Inc and is
therefore usually considered a boon for the world s
third largest economy 	
 However  manufacturers are unlikely to benefit near term
from the yen s fall after the triple disaster of earthquake 
tsunami and nuclear crisis combined to idle production and so
reduce their chances of taking advantage of currency weakness 	
  Of course for companies which import raw material  fuel and
resources  a weaker yen makes things difficult and it is in a
way a one two punch   said Kazutaka Oshima  president at Rakuten
Investment Management  a fund manager 	
 The yen   trading on Tuesday at 84 25 per
dollar  has dropped 9 percent since hitting a record high of
76 25 shortly after the earthquake  The descent was helped by
rare coordinated intervention by Group of Seven central banks 	
 Markets are betting the yen will stay weak longer term
because Japan s central bank is likely to keep interest rates
low to aid recovery just as the euro zone and U S  central banks
are poised to tighten monetary policy 	
 The prospect of rising interest rates tends to attract
capital for the higher returns  Indeed  the European Central
Bank is widely expected to raise interest rates on Thursday for
the first time since the global financial crisis 	
 The longer term risk is that investors will think Japan s
already weak recovery from the global financial crisis will be
made even more difficult by the natural disaster and the battle
it unleashed to bring a nuclear power station under control 	
  After moving above 83 yen the trend seems to have changed 
Yen weakness may be reflecting a re appraisal of the Japanese
economy and  Sell Japan  mentality  There is a question mark
over the prospect for Japan s recovery    partly because few
people realise how deep the impact from the nuclear crisis and
blackouts would be   Oshima said 	
 
 The fall in the yen has not gone unnoticed in Tokyo  Economy
Minister Kaoru Yosano warned the yen s weakness means rising
crude oil prices may directly hurt the economy   ID nLHE7EO01J 	
 The combination of crisis  high commodity prices and a
weaker yen could  for a time  speed up the decline in Japan s
terms of trade as import prices rise faster than export prices 
The terms of trade index is now below 80 from a high in 1994 of
145 6 	
 Manufacturing activity posted its steepest monthly decline
on record in March  a purchasing managers  survey showed  while
big manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen in the
next three months  another report said   ID nL3E7F4006 
 ID nL3E7EU3P4 	
 Illustrating the plight of automakers  lost car production
in Japan in the two weeks since the quake has topped a third of
a million vehicles 	
 Nomura estimates Japanese firms on its 400 companies index
which include bluechips such as Sony Corp to chalk up
 17 billion in lost profits in the current fiscal year ending
next March 	
 
 DETERIORATING TRADE	
 Some firms  facing rising import bills  want to pass on
those costs to customers but that is proving difficult when
production lines are suspended and demand is falling 	
 Nippon Steel   for example  is seeking a roughly 25
percent price hike from domestic contract manufacturers to cover
surging input costs 	
 Ratings Agency Moody s  which is reviewing Nippon Steel and
rival JFE Holdings for a possible downgrade  said their
profits are likely to deteriorate as they face higher cost for
steel and coking coal  and falling demand 	
  We don t like steel  It is oversupplied in the region with
rising input cost and limited pricing power   said Arnout van
Rijn  Asia chief investment officer of Robeco  an asset
management firm 	
  In the near term we have to quantify the amount of earnings
downgrades that will result from this dramatic sequence of
events  	
 A likely rise in imports and decline in exports as
production lines struggle to return to normal operations will
weigh on Japan s trade balance   	
 The balance in February was in deficit for first
time in 22 months 	
 Rising energy prices and Japan s increasing
oil and gas demand will be the biggest factors driving the rise
in imports 	
 International oil prices   are already hovering
near their highest levels since 2008 off the back of political
turmoil in the Middle East 	
 Japan s oil demand is set to rise sharply in coming months
after the natural disaster put nuclear power plants out of
operation 	
 Credit Suisse estimates higher imports from a shift to
thermal power generation would shave 2 8 trillion yen   33
billion  off Japan s trade surplus in 2011 	
 That would be a sizeable hit when measures against Japan s
2010 trade surplus of 6 6 trillion yen 	
  Power outages may also keep companies from producing at
full capacity for quite a long time  It will take several months
to fix disruptions in supply chains   Eiji Hirano  former
executive director of the Bank of Japan  told Reuters 	
  While exports will slump mainly for manufacturers  imports
will rise as reconstruction demand picks up  That will affect
Japan s current account balance   said Hirano  who is now
executive vice president of Toyota Financial Services 	
 While a gradual yen decline would certainly boost exporters
once they get their production facilities back on track  they
will find it hard to adjust if currency swings were as wild as
they were in the past fortnight 	
 The yen rose to its record high of 76 25 per dollar from 82
per dollar in just two days  a massive rise for a currency  The
G7 intervention pushed it back to around 82 per dollar a day
later 	
  In our experience  if the yen weakens about 5 yen  we can
absorb it in six months  for about 10 yen  it takes a year  
said Akio Nitori  president of Nitori Holdings Co  
which operates a chain of furniture and interior goods stories 	
  As long as there isn t a sudden swing   a weak yen  can be
dealt with   Nitori said at a results briefing  	
 The company  which imports more than 70 percent of the goods
in its Japan stores from overseas  has forecast its first annual
decline in profits in 25 years  citing the disaster and higher
raw materials prices 	
 Lower volatility would also suggest yen weakness over a
long term horizon  UBS s calculations show that the yen s
nominal effective exchange rate falls 0 4 percent for every 1
percent decline in one month dollar yen volatility 	
 Naomi Fink  Japan strategist at Jefferies  says rising
import costs would accelerate the trend for firms to move their
production base offshore 	
  Yen weakness only compounds the rising cost of imports  If
you don t have to convert to yen in the first place you don t
need to worry about it   she said

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO  April 18   Tokyo stocks dipped in light trade on
Monday but held above a key support level  with more and more
market players saying the prevailing view that the Nikkei was
heading for another sharp decline now looked like it might be
wrong 	
 Trading volume hit its second lowest level for 2011 as
market players took to the sidelines ahead of corporate earnings
next week when key exporters like Canon Inc and
Panasonic Corp are due to report 	
 The Nikkei benchmark has recouped around two thirds of the
losses incurred after the devastating March 11 earthquake 
tsunami and ensuing nuclear crisis 	
 But while analysts warn of downside risks in the next few
weeks as the first post quake earnings results hit the market
and as excess liquidity provided by the U S  s quantitative
easing policy peters out in June  some also think these worries
are overdone 	
  Everyone is looking at the recovery of Japanese stocks in
the long term and extremely cheap valuations after the
post quake sell off   said Hideo Arimura  a senior fund manager
at Mizuho Asset Management 	
  That s why the market is holding up really well despite so
many uncertainties and probably won t fall too much  ignoring
all the talk about the possible downside risk   he said 	
 The benchmark Nikkei average ended down 0 4 percent
at 9 556 65  with declines led by telecoms stocks after Goldman
Sachs cut its rating on Softbank Corp  	
 It finished above its 25 day moving average  now at
9 504 95  marking the fourth straight session it has closed
above the closely watched line 	
 The broader Topix shed 0 6 percent to 836 34 	
 Barring further deterioration at the Tokyo Electric s
 Fukushima nuclear plant  the market will likely hover
around recent levels and begin a slow recovery in the second
half of the business year  some fund managers said 	
  The consensus is that domestic demand stocks will get hit
hard  but I think we will see some real positive surprises there
too   said Yuuki Sakurai  CEO of Fukoku Capital Management 	
 But some are still betting on another sharp decline 	
  We forecast that the index will fall below 8 500 In
June July   equity strategist Masatoshi Kikuchi of Bank Of
America Merrill Lynch wrote in a research note 	
  However  we forecast a recovery in the Nikkei 225 to about
11 000 at end 2011  as the market starts to price in an
improving economy and earnings in 2012 once the worst of the
summer power shortages has passed  	
 
 TELECOMS WEAK	
 Softbank Corp   a company with a more than 4 percent
weighting in the Nikkei index according to Thomson Reuters data 
slipped 2 4 percent leading declines in telecom stocks after
Goldman Sachs cut its rating to  sell  from  neutral   saying
that heavy capital investment was pushing down profitability 	
 KDDI Corp slipped 0 4 percent at 499 000 yen after
hitting an intraday low of 483 000 yen  depressed by a Nikkei
business daily report that Tokyo Electric planned to sell its
shares in the telecoms company to help pay for costs stemming
from the crisis at its nuclear power plant 	
 Asia s largest utility holds about 360 000 shares in KDDI 
or an 8 percent stake  which is worth about 180 billion yen
  2 2 billion  at current market prices  the daily said 
 ID nL3E7FH002 	
 JFE Holdings fell 1 8 percent to 2 178 yen after
the Nikkei business daily reported that the world s No  5 steel
producer looks set to book a net profit of 50 60 billion yen for
the year to end March  below its estimate of 70 billion yen due

27600,249115,CAJ,Chip stocks lift Nikkei after Intel  Japan earnings eyed,news,"  Nikkei s gains merely due to short covering  analyst
   Nikkei may fall below 9 000 in mid May  fund manager
   Toshiba jumps on report Apple to invest in its panels

 By Antoni Slodkowski and Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  April 20  Reuters    Tokyo stocks snapped a three day
losing streak on Wednesday after Intel s earnings guidance
sparked short covering in chip related stocks  but trade is
expected to stay thin ahead of forecasts from Japanese firms 	
 Market sentiment was also bolstered by Johnson   Johnson
   which raised its profit outlook and was one of the
first major names to rally following results this season  while
commodities related issues gained on higher gold and oil prices 	
 This helped the Nikkei end above the 9 600 line  on both
sides of which it has traded in a 350 point range after 
recovering from a sell off sparked by the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami and ensuing nuclear crisis 	
 But the benchmark s moves were mostly futures led and
volumes remained depressed as investors were reluctant to make
big bets while waiting for camera maker Canon Inc and
construction machinery maker Komatsu Ltd to kick off
the first post quake corporate earnings season next week 	
   The market is rebounding  but it s nothing more
than short covering  Investors will not go long until they see
Japanese corporate earnings later this month   said Kenichi
Hirano  a strategist at Tachibana Securities 	
 The benchmark Nikkei average closed up 1 8 percent 
or 165 79 points  at 9 606 82 on Wednesday  The Nikkei broke
above its 25 day moving average at 9 537 83  which now becomes
its immediate support 	
 The broader Topix gained 1 2 percent to 837 17 	
 Tokyo stocks have lost 8 percent since the disaster  with
chip and auto makers among big underperfomers on worries over
the quake s impact on global supply chains and factory output 
By comparison  Asian stocks outside Japan have
risen 8 percent over the same period 	
 Trading volume remained thin  with 1 8 billion shares
changing hands on the Tokyo exchange s main board  below last
week s average of 2 1 billion shares 	
 
 CHIP STOCKS BOUNCE BACK  TOSHIBA JUMPS	
 Hit by a weak outlook from Texas Instruments on Tuesday 
Japanese chip related stocks bounced back after the world s
biggest chipmaker  Intel Corp   forecast quarterly
revenues well above Wall Street s estimates  saying Japan s
disaster was not affecting production and the global PC supply
chain was able to meet demand 	
 Up to 10 percent of Intel s revenue comes from manufacturers
in Japan 	
 Advantest gained 3 4 percent to 1 452 yen  Ibiden
 surged 6 percent to 2 562 yen and Tokyo Electron
 added 4 1 percent to 4 475 yen 	
 After the sell off Japanese IT shares look attractive on
valuations  traders said  with the price to book ratio for the
sector at 1 3  compared with 2 1 for Taiwan and 3 4 for the
United States  according to Thomson Reuters Starmine 	
 But some fund managers were sceptical about the outlook for
tech shares and the broader market 	
  I have doubts if there really is no impact on  Intel s 
production after the quake  And even if there isn t  global
demand for PCs is on the decline with tablets becoming
increasingly popular  so I wouldn t go overweight on
chipmakers   said Makoto Kikuchi  chief executive officer of
Myojo Asset Management 	
 Revenue from cellphone maker Sony Ericsson  missed
forecasts on Tuesday because of difficulties with displays 
batteries and other parts due to the March 11 quake  adding the
problem was stabilising but would definitely have a bigger
impact in the second quarter  ID nLDE73I082 	
  Companies will likely be late this year with their
outlooks  but once they publish them  probably around mid May  I
expect brokerages to come out with very negative mid term
forecasts for the market and we can see the Nikkei go below
9 000 temporarily   said Kikuchi 	
 Commodity shares were higher  with gold futures hitting an
all time high above  1 500 an ounce and U S  oil prices rising
on a weaker dollar 	
 Sumitomo Metal Mining gained 2 5 percent to 1 418
yen and Inpex Corp added 3 1 percent to 601 000 yen 	
 Toshiba Corp jumped 3 7 percent to 416 yen after
the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported that Apple Inc has
chosen Toshiba over Sharp as the U S  company s investment
destination for development of liquid crystal displays for
smartphones  Sharp denied the report 	
 Advancing shares outpaced decliners by 1 034 to 493

27604,249119,CAJ,Markets Surge As World Engages In Global Bailout,opinion,There was a time in recent history where Ben Bernanke once said that he would     drop dollars from a helicopter  if necessary to keep the economy from going into a depression   Well  today  the remaining survivors of the global financial rout have coordinated an  all in  gamble to save the world from the next impending crisis  We had discussed in the past that our recessionary call on the economy in the first half of 2012 was contingent upon whether or not further rounds of government stimulus were injected into the system   We also stated that we expected those to occur by the end of this year   Alas  we are not disappointed    This morning s announcement that the U S  Federal Reserve  European Central Bank  Bank of Japan  Bank of England  Swiss National Bank and Bank of Canada will lower the rates on currency swaps as well as lower pricing on existing US Dollar swaps provides a massive liquidity canon for global financial system From the announcement     The Banks  are today announcing coordinated actions to enhance their capacity to provide liquidity support to the global financial system  The purpose of these actions is to ease strains in financial markets and thereby mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses and so help foster economic activity  The Federal Reserve also made the following comments in relation to the U S   U S  financial institutions currently do not face difficulty obtaining liquidity in short term funding markets  However  were conditions to deteriorate  the Federal Reserve has a range of tools available to provide an effective liquidity backstop for such institutions and is prepared to use these tools as needed to support financial stability and to promote the extension of credit to U S  households and businesses  A Dire SituationWhile the markets are surging from the direct injections into the financial system  more on that in a moment  the important take away here is that the world is in FAR WORSE shape than has previously been discussed    These are emergency funding measures and are done in order to hopefully prevent the next liquidity crisis   With the banks in Europe already on the edge of failure a suspicion that a major bank on the brink of collapse spurred this action may not be too far from the truth   The fact that a globally coordinated intervention is occurring is no small matter It is unlikely that these short term efforts to boost liquidity to financial institutions will solve the longer term fiscal instability of the Euro region  however  it does potentially prevent a near term freeze in the liquidity markets as witnessed in 2008 with the collapse of Lehman    We have seen this exact same thing play out before with the last time that we had coordinated efforts by the central banks back in early September    While it provides a short term boost to the market for a few days ultimately the more dire global landscape took the markets down What To ExpectToday s announcement caught the markets completely flat footed this morning  which is exactly what was desired  and is now promulgating a short covering squeeze in all major asset classes from stocks to commodities   Whether or not the short covering rally can continue will be important to watch  While the actions are supportive it is very difficult to say for how long because the world is still very much engaged in a deleveraging process that will  and must  continue    The drag from deleveraging on the economic system is something that liquidity injections can t cure but rather postpones    The deep funding problems due to the sovereign debt crisis will still have to be addressed but the issue to dollar liquidity has at least been temporarily resolved Very likely the European Central Bank will announce more actions at their next meeting on December 8th to address the collateral side of the equation in order to continue to try and stabilize the Eurozone  The bottom line as of today is that the risk to the downside in the U S  stock market has been reduced to further governmental intervention    Whether or not these interventions solve the longer term problems that face the economy and the markets both domestically and internationally remains to be seen   but as we know from past experience   when the market is flooded with liquidity the banks will flood it into the financial markets driving risk assets higher However  with that said  the market has broken above the resistance levels of the previous trading range that existed from July   September between 1120 and 1220 on the index   With the liquidity push into the market it is very likely that the markets will make another attempt at the  neck line  resistance level from the topping process that began in 2011  We stated in this past weekend s newsletter that investors should look at raising cash at the 1200 level should the markets get there   However  with this global intervention our advice is to now   wait and see  what happens over the next few days    Sometimes inaction tends to be the best course of action when volatile events occur   We definitely do not advise chasing the rally until the squeeze on managers is complete   Today is also the end of the month so mutual funds need to window dress their portfolios which is providing additional buying impetus today One thing we want to watch closely is oil   With oil prices surging past  100 a barrel today the negative implications to the consumer driven economy through rises in inflationary pressures may be felt sooner rather than later Therefore  it will remain important  at least from a risk management perspective  that in the near term the  risk on  bet may work   However  for longer term investors it will be important to keep a watch on the global and domestic economies as the negative implications of massive liquidity boosts are generally felt in the pockets of consumers ,2011-12-01,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-surge-as-world-engages-in-global-bailout-107314,107314

 TOKYO  Oct 30  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average rose
1 3 percent on Friday after Wall Street climbed on data showing
the U S  economy had returned to growth  while Japan Airlines
gained after it turned to the government for a bailout 
 But Nintendo Co Ltd fell 3 percent after the company reported
a 52 percent slide in quarterly profit on Thursday and slashed
its full year forecast as the Wii console loses its title as the
videogame platform to beat 
 Exporters such as Canon Inc climbed after the U S 
government s first estimate of U S  gross domestic product showed
the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 5 percent in the
third quarter  the first quarter of growth after more than a year
of contraction 
Analysts cheered the gains  but warned the market was ripe
for profit taking ahead of the weekend and that uncertainties
remained about the global economy after U S  data earlier this
week had hinted at a slowdown

results 
 Nintendo fell to 23 440 yen after the earnings results  which
reflected the fact that demand for its family friendly games has
cooled as rivals Sony and Microsoft Corp bolster their catalogue
of games that appeal to die hard players 
 But Olympus Corp climbed 7 5 percent to 2 855 yen after the
Nikkei business daily said the company is expected to post a
group operating profit of 28 billion yen for the April September
first half  beating the company s own forecast of 19 billion yen 
 JAL rose 1 7 percent to 117 yen after it said on Thursday it

 JAL GAINS  EARNINGS IMPACT
 JAL rose 1 7 percent to 117 yen after it said on Thursday it
would apply for assistance from a state backed corporate
turnaround body  setting the stage for a large injection of
public funds into the troubled airline 
 The government has been scrambling to secure financing and
map out a restructuring plan for JAL  which is headed for its
fourth loss in five years  weighed down by  15 billion in debt
and crippling pension costs 
 Transport Minister Seiji Maehara said on Friday that the
government will set up a new team of ministry officials to work
on a JAL bailout  including bridging loans 
 Earnings were also a big factor for individual shares 
 Nintendo fell to 22 970 yen after it announced that its
second quarter profit was 64 billion yen compared to a consensus
forecast for 90 billion yen  reflecting cooling demand for its
family friendly games as rivals Sony and Microsoft Corp bolster
their catalogue of games that appeal to die hard players 
 But Olympus Corp surged 8 7 percent to 2 885 yen after the
Nikkei business daily said the company is expected to post a
operating profit of 28 billion yen for the April September first
half  beating the company s own forecast of 19 billion yen 
 Sharp Corp climbed 3 1 percent to 995 yen after posting its
first quarterly profit in a year as TV and screen panel demand
recovered  though a 15 percent fall in overall sales and a
cautious company outlook means strong earnings growth is still
elusive    a problem that analysts said could plague other firms
as well 
  We re seeing gains in profits  but without a rise in sales
even these good results lack long term power as incentives   said

28090,249605,CAJ,Nikkei falls most in 3 wks  oil and Astellas weigh,news,"  Resource shares slide after oil s fall
   Eyes on earnings  Honda and Canon in spotlight
   Economic uncertainty remains despite good earnings analysts
 By Elaine Lies
 TOKYO  Oct 27  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average lost 1 5
percent on Tuesday  its biggest one day percentage fall in three
weeks  as trading houses fell after oil slid and Astellas Pharma
was hurt by a brokerage downgrade 
Blue chip exporters such as Honda Motor Co also dragged on
the market after U S  stocks fell on chances that lawmakers may
let a federal home buyer tax credit expire  raising fears the
U S  housing industry may lose a crucial incentive that has
spurred hopes of stabilisation in recent months 
 Both Chuo Mitsui Trust and rival Sumitomo Trust climbed after
the Nikkei business daily said the two planned to merge in early
2011  Trading in their shares was subsequently suspended by the
Tokyo Stock Exchange 
 As Japan s earnings season moves into high gear  with both
Honda and Canon Inc reporting after the bell  analysts said that
while generally solid results were supporting the market concerns
about the global economy lingered 
 Even though the actual earnings we ve seen have not been too
bad  there s a lot of uncertainty about the second half of the
year  with pretty conservative forecasts   said Hiroaki Osakabe 
a fund manager at Chibagin Asset Management 
 In addition  I think there s a worry that economic growth
may be slowing a bit in the shorter term  leading to selling  
The benchmark Nikkei lost 150 16 points to 10 212 46 and
marked its biggest one day percentage drop since Oct  2  The
broader Topix lost 1 7 percent to 895 48 
 U S  stocks fell for a second straight session on Monday as
investors sold shares in home builders and financials  while
commodity shares succumbed to pressure from a higher dollar 
  There s a bit of worry that global shares may be headed for
a simultaneous correction  given that they ve all been rising
together for a while   said Takashi Ushio  head of the investment
strategy division at Marusan Securities 
  After all  the U S  earnings and indicators that have
recently come out haven t seemed to be bad enough to cause the
slide of the last few days  It appears to have been more caused
by concern that stocks have risen too far  
 Along with corporate earnings  economic indicators are a big
focus this week  market players said  On Thursday  Japan will
announce its industrial output data for September and the U S 
government will report its first estimate of third quarter gross
domestic product 
  The market will likely be a tug of war for a while between
macro data overseas and micro data at home  with the earnings
season continuing in Japan   said Mitsuo Shimizu  deputy general
manager at Cosmo Securities 
 ASTELLAS FALLS  OIL WEIGHS
 Shipping firms  including Japan s No 1 Nippon Yusen KK 
dropped after they cut their income forecasts for the year to
March  citing a sluggish recovery in key freight rates for dry
bulk ships and rising fuel costs 
 Nippon Yusen KK fell 2 5 percent to 347 yen  Mitsui O S K 
Lines Ltd lost 2 5 percent to 551 yen and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha
Ltd sank 6 4 percent to 353 
 Astellas dropped 6 7 percent to 3 340 yen after Barclays
Capital cut its rating on the No 2 Japanese drugmaker to
 underweight  from  equal weight   citing tougher than expected
competition with generic drug makers 
 Barclays reduced its target price for Astellas shares to
3 100 yen for the next 12 months from 3 500 yen  saying a generic
version of Astellas  transplant drug prograf was taking market
share from the company faster than expected 
 Oil and gas developer Inpex Corp fell 1 6 percent to 778 000
yen after oil prices declined for a fourth day to stand below  79
a barrel on Tuesday  hurt by a stronger dollar and concerns that
a sluggish economic recovery would keep fuel demand low 
 Trading houses  which are major dealers in energy and have
stakes in oil and gas projects  also slid 
 Mitsubishi Corp  Japan s largest trading house  lost 5 5
percent to 1 962 yen  while fellow trading house Mitsui   Co
tumbled 4 9 percent to 1 243 yen and Marubeni Corp skidded 3 9
percent to 465 yen 
 But Fujifilm Holdings bucked the trend  rising 6 6 percent to
2 600 yen after Nomura Holdings raised its rating on the maker of
digital cameras and high tech film used in LCD panels  citing
progress with structural reforms and hopes for better than
expected earnings for the second quarter 
 Trade was moderate  with 1 92 billion shares changing hands
on the Tokyo exchange s first section  roughly in line with last
week s daily average 
 Declining shares outpaced advancing ones by more than 5 to 1

 TOKYO  Oct 28  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average edged
down 0 7 percent as Advantest and other tech shares slipped after
weaker than expected U S  consumer confidence data prompted
investors to take profits in U S  equities 
 But Honda Motor Co climbed nearly 4 percent after it
surprised with a near tripling of its annual profit forecasts
that some said may yet be conservative  bumping it further ahead
of rivals thanks to a dominant motorcycle business and line up
heavy in small cars 
 Other auto shares were strong as well  providing support for
the market  analysts said 
  The falls in New York indexes  in some cases for the third
day in the row  raise the possibility of a true correction  with
concern growing that it means a correction for share markets
around the world   said Yutaka Miura  senior technical analyst at
Mizuho Securities 
  Trade today is likely to be a tug of war between this
concern on the one hand and good factors for individual shares 
such as the Honda results  
 The benchmark Nikkei shed 67 91 points to 10 144 55  and
appeared to be heading for its lowest close in two weeks 
The broader Topix lost 0 3 percent to 893 24 
 Analysts said support for the Nikkei was likely to hold solid
around 10 120  which is where its 25 day moving average currently
comes in  It has gained roughly 45 percent since Oct  28 last
year  when it hit a 26 year intraday low of 6994 90 
 They added that movements had been exaggerated by thin volume
as investors wait to see results later this week and next week 
with big name stocks such as Sony Corp and Toyota Motor Corp yet
to announce 
 Nomura Holdings  Japan s biggest brokerage  and electronics
conglomerate Fujitsu Ltd both announce after the bell on
Wednesday 
  Given the poor sentiment overseas  the Nikkei is actually
not falling as much as might be expected  with support coming
from expectations for earnings yet to come   said Hideyuki
Ishiguro  a supervisor at Okasan Securities 
 The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a slim gain on
Tuesday  but the S P 500 and Nasdaq posted their third straight
day of losses 
 The Conference Board s index of consumer confidence fell to
47 7 in October  weaker than forecast and showing that consumers
were increasingly concerned about job market conditions 
 TECHS FALL  AUTOS POWER HIGHER
 Tech shares fell after the Nasdaq marked its third day of
losses  with chip related shares particularly vulnerable after
the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost 2 5 percent 
 Analysts said that while there was likely to have been some
impact from the consumer confidence survey  expectations for
Christmas sales were fair and U S  shares had mainly been poised
for profit taking after recent rises 
 Advantest  which makes chip testing equipment  lost 3 9
percent to 2 240 yen and Tokyo Electron  the world s
second largest semiconductor equipment maker  shed 3 6 percent to
5 400 yen  Nikon  a key maker of steppers  lost 3 percent to
1 694 yen 
 But auto shares powered higher  boosted by Honda 
 Honda gained 3 7 percent to 2 950 yen  while Toyota Motor
Corp rose 1 1 percent to 3 640 yen and Nissan Motor Co rose 1 2
percent to 671 yen 
 Shares of Canon and Ricoh dropped after they reported sharp
falls in quarterly profit on sluggish copier demand as companies
reined in spending 
 Canon slid 3 6 percent to 3 450 yen  while Ricoh lost 1 7
percent to 1 235 yen 
 Both Canon and Ricoh stood by their annual operating income
forecasts  which call for 62 percent and 46 percent slides in
profit respectively  as they see no clear end to the current
slump in office equipment demand 
 Although other defensive stocks gained ground  household
goods maker Kao Corp fell 4 4 percent to 2 055 yen after it
slashed its annual earnings projections  citing a
deeper than expected slump in cosmetics sales 
 Trade was thin  with 817 million shares changing hands on the
Tokyo exchange s first section compared with last week s morning
average of 884 million

 TOKYO  Oct 28  Reuters    Fujitsu Ltd  Japan s biggest IT
services firm  reported a smaller than expected fall in
quarterly profit as it cut costs  while NEC Electronics 
results disappointed  signalling more pain for chip firms 
 Fujitsu  the world s No 4 IT services provider  is hurrying

shake ups  including Oracle s purchase of Sun Microsystems 
amid increasing competition 
 Chasing bigger rivals IBM and Hewlett Packard  Fujitsu is
restructuring its semiconductor operations  which are grappling
with weak demand and fierce competition 
  System integration businesses tend to lag the economy
cycle  so I m not as optimistic about Fujitsu s H2 outlook  
said Shigeo Sugawara  senior investment manager at Sompo Japan

 Fujitsu  which trails IBM  HP and Dell in IT services 
stuck to its forecast for a 90 billion yen annual operating
profit  above the 70 8 billion yen average estimate from 14
analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I B E S and up 30 percent
from the previous year 
 Fujitsu reported an operating profit of 18 9 billion yen

   Taiwan s UMC sees weaker Q4 wafer shipments
 Recasts lead  adds UMC results  fund manager comment 
 By Mayumi Negishi and Mariko Katsumura
 TOKYO  Oct 28  Reuters    Results from Japanese technology
groups such as Fujitsu and NEC Electronics indicated the worst
is not yet over for the struggling sector as the sector
grapples with sluggish demand 
 NEC Electronics  Fujitsu s rival in high end chips  expects
a slowdown in chip output  while Taiwan s UMC  the world s No 2
contract chip maker  forecast weaker wafer shipments in the
fourth quarter 
 Fujitsu  Japan s biggest IT services firm  posted a
smaller than expected quarterly fall in profit as cost cuts
outweighed the impact of sluggish sales of PCs  hard drives and
chips  It however stood by its annual target  which analysts
said hinged on a recovery in IT demand

   Digital camera demand strong  copiers weak
   Rival Ricoh posts 69 pct fall in quarterly operating profit
  Adds Ricoh results  fund manager comments 
 By Kiyoshi Takenaka
 TOKYO  Oct 27  Reuters    Japanese office equipment makers
Canon Inc and Ricoh Co posted sharp falls in quarterly profit on
sluggish copier demand as firms rein in spending  boding ill for
rivals such as Xerox Corp and Konica Minolta Holdings 
 Since the global downturn last year  companies worldwide have
been cutting costs by curbing fresh purchases and replacements of
printers and copiers as well as printing less  battering the
profitability of office gear suppliers 
 Both Canon and Ricoh stood by their annual operating profit
forecasts  which are down 62 percent and 46 percent 
respectively  as they see no clear end to the current slump in
office equipment demand 
  There s a lot of pent up IT upgrade demand among companies 
But copiers and printers lag other things like PCs among their
priorities   said Mitsushige Akino  chief fund manager at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management 
  Office equipment makers cannot be top picks for investors
unless the overall economy and corporate earnings make a further
and sharper recovery  
 Canon turned an operating profit of 60 billion yen   652
million  in July September  down 54 percent from a year earlier 
and in line with the market consensus of a 58 4 billion yen
profit in a poll of six analysts by Thomson Reuters I B E S 
 For a graphic of Canon s quarterly operating profit and share
price moves  click 
 
 Canon  the world s No 1 digital camera maker ahead of Sony
Corp  enjoyed strong demand for its single lens reflex  SLR 
cameras  which are high end models with interchangeable lenses 
 But brisk sales of SLR cameras failed to offset sluggish
printer and copier demand 
 Canon and Nikon Corp together control nearly 80 percent of
the lucrative digital SLR camera market 
 For the full year to December  Canon stood by its operating
profit forecast of 190 billion yen  which is slightly below the
market consensus of 197 9 billion yen 
  There s some bright signs on the consumer side of our
products such as SLR cameras   Canon Managing Director Masahiro
Osawa told a news conference 
  But when it comes to office equipment  we expect the market
to remain sluggish for some time  
 Ricoh said its operating profit fell 69 percent from a year
earlier to 7 92 billion yen in July September  which beat the
market consensus of a 5 1 billion yen profit 
 The company stuck to its operating profit forecast of 40
billion yen for the year to March  down from a 74 54 billion yen
profit the previous year and meeting the market consensus 
 Ricoh last year bought U S  office equipment distributor Ikon
Office Solutions for  1 6 billion  delivering a heavy blow to
Canon in the key U S  market  Before the acquisition  Canon
machines accounted for 60 percent of the products Ikon handled 
 But in a potential counter attack  Canon said last month it
would start providing its multi functional printers  MFPs  to
Hewlett Packard  in a move to broaden HP s product lineup and
boost Canon s hardware sales 
 MFPs typically combine copier  printer  scanner and fax
functions 
 Before the announcements  Canon shares closed down 1 9
percent at 3 580 yen and Ricoh ended 1 3 percent lower at 1 256
yen  while the benchmark Nikkei average fell 1 5 percent

28240,249755,CAJ,Nikkei up 1 pct on Fed comments  JAL tumbles,news,"  Nikkei jumps over 1 pct on optimism for U S  economy
  JAL dives after news of potential split  public fund report
   Tokyo market reopens after five day weekend
 TOKYO  Sept 24  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average rose
1 4 percent on Thursday  with exporters such as Honda Motor Co
rising after Federal Reserve statements that U S  economic
activity was picking up outweighed fears about a stimulus
withdrawal by the Fed 
 But Japan Airlines tumbled 11 percent after sources said the
company might be broken up and after public broadcaster NHK
reported it is planning to seek a taxpayer funded bailout to
overhaul its operations 
 Though U S  shares had originally risen sharply on Fed
comments that economic activity was picking up  they reversed
course in the last hour of trade on worries about the timing of
the removal of some of the Fed s stimulus 
 But analysts said Tokyo was taking the more optimistic
stance 
  More than worries about the removal of any stimulus  I think
the market is really starting to get a sense that things are
improving    this is why certain manufacturers that had fallen
behind a bit are strong today   said Nagayuki Yamagishi  a
strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities 
  Basically  though  the Fed s comments do seem to be pointing
the way to the exit  
 The Fed s policy setters met and kept interest rates
unchanged  as expected  but they also said the U S  central bank
would slow purchases of mortgage debt to extend the program s
life until the end of March    a move seen as a step towards a
measured withdrawal of its extraordinary support for the economy
during the downturn 
 Yamagishi noted while purchases of mortgage debt might be
slowing  they would still continue until March 
 Other market players agreed the Fed statement was being taken
more positively than otherwise  with Wall Street s Wednesday fall
likely being little more than profit taking 
  U S  stocks are simply moving a bit lower after recent
highs  We need to wait and see whether this is anything more than
a bit of natural consolidation   said Yutaka Miura  senior
technical analyst at Mizuho Securities 
 The benchmark Nikkei rose 148 05 points to 10 518 59  while
the broader Topix rose 1 percent to 949 05 
 JAL fell to 151 yen  Earlier this week  two sources familiar
with the matter said lenders to JAL may seek to split the carrier
between its profitable and loss making parts 
 Consumer lender Aiful Corp plunged 28 percent to 96 yen after
it said it plans to halve the group s workforce and slash the
number of its branches as the struggling Japanese consumer lender
hopes to rebuild its business through restructuring 
 Aiful  which last week asked creditors to let it to push back
repayments on  3 billion in debt  said it plans to cut about
2 000 jobs  or about 49 percent of the group s total workforce 
by February 
 Honda rose 1 4 percent to 2 870 yen and Canon Inc edged up
0 3 percent 
 Sony Corp climbed 2 7 percent to 2 660 yen  A Sony executive
said on Wednesday that sales of the PlayStation 3 video game
console jumped in the weeks after a  100 price cut last month 
and strong demand could lead to empty shelves at retail

 To help boost liquidity  the bourse hopes to attract more
retail investors to make options a regular investment choice 
  Our hope is that it would become normal for individual
investors to buy options and cash on stocks as a pair  so that
even if a cash price goes down  they don t have to rush to sell  
Sekizawa said 
  Once there s liquidity  options trading could work to make
overall market moves less bumpy  
 Retail investors accounted for 42 percent of trading volume
in options on stocks in the first half of this year  according to
TSE data  That compares with 49 1 percent for brokerages 
  We are actively talking to online brokerages so that
individual investors could eventually trade TSE s options
online   said Masanori Onda  a senior manager of derivatives at
the TSE 
 Traders said retail investors were likely to be the main
players in the options market as institutional investors often
use derivatives known as contracts for difference  CFDs  
  It s unclear how much institutional investors will use this
options trading on individual stocks on the bourse as many
overseas brokers use CFDs   said one derivatives trader at a
European brokerage  who could not be named as he is not
authorised to speak to the press 
  Highly skilled individual investors will likely
participate

 TOKYO  Sept 14  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average fell 2 5
percent on Monday  pushed lower by Canon Inc and other exporters
after the dollar hit a fresh seven month low against the yen in
early trade 
But Japan Airlines  JAL  climbed nearly 7 percent following
news that the struggling airline was in talks on investment by
American Airlines and Delta Airlines 
 The dollar fell to a seven month low below 90 21 yen in early
Asian trade  helped by talk of Japanese fund repatriation and the
view that it is replacing the yen as the funding currency for
carry trades  It later pared some of its losses to be 0 3 percent
lower at 90 40 yen 
 These dollar levels are making things very tough for the
stock market    not so much in the short term necessarily  but in
the negative impact it could have on earnings estimates for later
in the year   said Noritsugu Hirakawa  a strategist at Okasan
Securities 
 This raises the possibility that widely anticipated upward
revisions in a number of estimates for the second half could end
up being fairly small scale at best  
 Though there is likely to be a fair amount of variation 
Hirakawa said he thought a lot of major manufacturers had a
break even level of around 95 yen 
Market players fret that the yen s rise against the dollar
could hurt the outlook for corporate earnings  as as stronger yen
cuts into the value of exporters  overseas profits when they are
repatriated 
  The fact that the Euro is still holding its ground will help
support the market a bit  but the dollar certainly does not seem
to be heading in a good direction   said Hiroaki Osakabe  a fund
manager at Chibagin Asset Management 
 The benchmark Nikkei fell 257 70 points to 10 186 63  while
the broader Topix lost 2 percent to 931 53 
 Support for the Nikkei is seen at 10 100  around where its
50 day moving average comes in  and then at 10 000    the level
of its 75 day moving average as well as being an important
psychological support level 
 Should it break below this  the next support is at 9 800 
where the 100 day moving average lies 
  If the Nikkei were to break below 10 000  the mood in the
market would change quite a lot   said Osakabe 
 Uncertainty about the policies of Japan s new government  to
take office on Wednesday  appeared to be keeping some players
sidelined  though the impact was unlikely to be strong 
 Victory in an Aug  30 election handed the novice Democratic
Party of Japan the reins of government and the job of reviving a
struggling economy  ending half a century of almost unbroken rule
by the Liberal Democratic Party 
 JAL FLIES

gainer among the subindexes 
 JAL  Asia s largest airline by revenues  lost about  1
billion last quarter and has been seeking investors to prop up
its finances for a state supervised overhaul expected to include
job cuts  a reduction in routes and asset sales 
  There s a bit of concern about various issues involved with
these possibilities  but at least JAL now looks unlikely to fail 
and that s being taken positively by the market   Yamagishi
added

 This raises the possibility that widely anticipated upward

 Japanese exporters are likely to feel the pain of a stronger
yen at levels below 95 to the dollar  That s roughly the average
rate seen by large exporters in the Bank of Japan s last
quarterly tankan survey for the current business year to March 
 Honda Motor Co said in July that it was assuming a dollar yen
rate of 91 yen for the current financial year 
Market players fret that the yen s rise against the dollar

thought it was unlikely the Nikkei would fall that far 
  The dollar has fallen pretty sharply in the last month  and
until it comes to a halt the Nikkei may stay under pressure as
well   said Masayoshi Okamoto  head of dealing at Jujiya
Securities 
  At worst  though  its fall is likely to stop around 10 000 
But the energy to recover will be limited  
JAL FLIES

Kazuhiro Takahashi  manager of equities at Daiwa Securities SMBC 
  However  whether JAL can turn around its business is another
story  Focus is on details of the possible deals and how JAL
capitalises on them to reform its management  
 Astellas Pharma Inc was also one of a scant handful of shares

   Dollar steadies  yen slips as Japan FX policy eyed
 By Eric Burroughs
 HONG KONG  Sept 15  Reuters    Asian stocks drifted back
near one year highs on Tuesday as investors looked past a trade
spat between the United States and China  with exporter shares
in Japan getting a lift as the yen s surge relented 
 The Nikkei average  edged up 0 1 percent as
companies such as Canon Inc  7751 T  bounced back from a slide
sparked by the yen s jump to a seven month high against the
dollar  which took the Japanese currency into territory seen as
damaging to exporter earnings 
 The yen  slipped back to more than 91 per dollar 
providing some relief to investors worried that sustained gains
would prove a serious obstacle to Japan Inc s gradual recovery
this year 
 While officials in the outgoing Japanese government voiced
concern about the yen s rise  the former finance minister
tipped to again take the helm of the ministry    Hirohisa Fujii
   has said Japan should not intervene in markets 
 ID nT311225 
  Market participants speculate Fujii may be more tolerant
of a stronger yen and reluctant about intervening in the forex
market   said Makoto Yamashita  chief Japan interest rate
strategist at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo 
 Japan has racked up foreign reserves totalling more than  1
trillion  second only to China s  from its previous bouts of
yen selling intervention  But Japan has stayed out of the
market since 2004  even during last year s violent yen surge as
leveraged carry trades were unwound

 TOKYO  Sept 9  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average edged
0 3 percent lower on Wednesday  with exporters such as Canon hurt
by the yen s recent rise against the dollar  while energy linked
shares gained following a surge in oil prices 
 Apparel maker Renown Inc soared nearly 15 percent on news
that it was selling Aquascutum  a loss making 158 year old
raincoat maker  to another British luxury fashion brand  Jaeger 
for an undisclosed sum 
 The yen s recent strength has been a major trading factor for
the Nikkei this week  after the Japanese currency hit a
seven week high last week  The yen has been above levels expected
by major manufacturers for the current financial year since late
August 
  The yen is showing signs of strengthening again    If the
dollar falls below 92 yen the impact may be big and such concerns
are weighing on stocks   said Yutaka Miura  senior technical
analyst for Mizuho Securities 
 The dollar was steady against the yen at 92 36 yen  near a
seven week low of 91 94 yen hit last week 
 The average exchange rate for the dollar versus the yen
expected by major manufacturers for the year to March 2010 was
94 85 yen  with 94 77 yen expected for the second half  data from
the Bank of Japan shows 
 Market players fret that the yen s rise against the dollar
could hurt the outlook for corporate earnings  as as stronger yen
cuts into the value of exporters  overseas profits when they are
repatriated 
 The Nikkei dipped to 10 358 48  hovering below resistance at
the 25 day moving average  which lies above 10 400 
 Miura at Mizuho Securities said the Nikkei was likely to
trade between 10 000 to 10 700 for the rest of the week 
 The broader Topix index slipped 0 3 percent to 943 86 
 Trade fell off slightly on the Tokyo exchange s first section
with some 913 million shares changing hands  down from last   
week s morning average of 943 million 
 Despite the falls in the Nikkei and Topix  advancing shares
outnumbered declining ones 792 to 679 
  For a while  there probably will not be many factors out of
Japan that prompt market players to chase share prices higher  
said Mitsushige Akino  chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management  adding that short term moves in Tokyo shares are
likely to take their cues from overseas equities markets 
 Market players say attention has begun shifting to the
outlook for corporate earnings  with the next quarterly reporting
season set to begin next month 
 Shares in information services company CSK Holdings Corp
retreated 4 1 percent to 402 yen after it said it would bolster
its capital by 52 billion yen   563 million  and cut its annual
earnings forecast to a loss instead of a profit 
 Among exporters  Canon fell 2 5 percent to 3 500 yen and
Toyota Motor Corp slipped 1 3 percent to 3 820 yen 
 But energy linked shares gained  with oil and gas field
developer Inpex rising 3 1 percent to 764 000 yen   
 Trading house Mitsubishi Corp rose 1 2 percent to 1 899 yen
and rival Mitsui   Co Ltd rose 1 3 percent to 1 216 yen  also
helped by firmer prices for commodities 
 Oil prices had risen 4 5 percent on Tuesday  their biggest
gain in nearly three weeks  as weakness in the U S  dollar fired
up inflation fears and triggered a rush of buying across
commodities markets

 TOKYO  Sept 7  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average
climbed 1 3 percent on Monday as exporters such as Canon Inc
rose  with investors focusing on the bright side of mixed U S 
jobs data and as the yen retreated against the dollar 
 Advantest Corp and other chip related shares gained  buoyed
by broad buying of their U S  peers after Intel Corp s chief
executive said ageing personal computers and Microsoft s launch
of Windows 7 will prompt companies to start spending on PCs next
year 
 But the benchmark Nikkei was trapped in a narrow 52 point
range with investors reluctant to trade as U S  markets will be
closed on Monday for a holiday and ahead of the settlement of
Nikkei futures and options on Friday 
  Investors welcomed a rise in U S  shares following monthly
employment data and the yen s weakness   said Toshiyuki Kanayama 
market analyst at Monex Inc 
  Gains were limited  however  as people don t want to chase
prices higher due to a U S  holiday today  
 The benchmark Nikkei rose 133 83 points to 10 320 94 after
hitting a five week closing low on Friday 
 The Nikkei lost 3 3 percent last week  and market players
said recovering to where its 25 day moving average comes in 
currently around 10 400  will be crucial for any further
recovery  It hit a high of 10 676 on August 31 
 The broader Topix advanced 1 percent to 944 60 
 The Nikkei was also helped by gains in Shanghai shares  which
investors had been eyeing after China eased inbound investment
rules on Friday 
 There are expectations of a lot more investment in China 
and if Asian markets recover  so does the Nikkei   said Noritsugu
Hirakawa  a strategist at Okasan Securities 
China announced new draft rules on Friday on inbound
portfolio investments  increasing the amount some institutions
can invest in the country s stock markets 
 U S  job losses were the smallest in a year last month 
coming in below forecasts at 216 000  But the unemployment rate
rose to 9 7 percent from 9 4 percent the month before  the
highest in 26 years and above expectations 
 LIKELY FINANCE MINISTER SEEN SAFE CHOICE
 Media reports that Hirohisa Fujii  a former finance minister 
is likely to be picked for the same post in the new Japanese
government led by Prime minister elect Yukio Hatoyama also helped
provide some comfort for investors  Monex s Kanayama said 
 Fujii  a veteran lawmaker with conservative roots  served as
finance minister briefly in the early 1990s

  This selling of financial shares is at least one impediment
to the Nikkei breaking above 10 500  
 The benchmark Nikkei lost 81 09 points to 10 312 14  with
resistance seen at 10 400    about the level of its 25 day moving
average  The broader Topix slid 0 7 percent to 939 84 
 The yen s strength has been a major trading factor for the
Nikkei this week  after the Japanese currency hit a seven week
high last week  Since late August  the yen has been above levels
expected by major manufacturers for the current financial year  
giving rise to worries about corporate earnings 
 The dollar was steady against the yen at 92 31 yen  near a
seven week low of 91 94 yen hit last week 
  One of the big uncertainties for Japan at this point is the
dollar yen level  but the lack of buying by foreign investors has
also meant it s hard to get much energy going    domestic
investors just aren t in the market   said Koichi Ogawa  chief
fund manager at Daiwa SB Investments 
 Orders placed through foreign securities houses ahead of the
start of trade have shown foreign investors  long a key driver
and setter of direction for the Nikkei  to be net sellers
virtually every day since August 30  when the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party lost to the Democratic Party 
 The Democratic Party is set to form a new government to take
power next week 
  It s hard to say what s putting foreign investors off but I
don t think it s the political uncertainty    after all  everyone
knew the Democratic Party would win  It s really more about
prospects for the Nikkei s short term performance   Ogawa added

   Disappointing U S  jobs data stokes economy worries

 TOKYO  Sept 3  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average lost
0 4 percent on Thursday as exporters fell on worries about the
U S  economy after dismal jobs data  while Dainippon Sumitomo
Pharma  4506 T  rose on news it would bid for a U S  drug firm 
 Dainippon Sumitomo opened up by nearly 8 percent after a
source with knowledge of the situation said the firm plans to
offer about  2 7 billion to acquire U S  drugmaker Sepracor
   ID nN02545273 
 The dollar briefly dropped below 92 00 yen for the first time
since mid July as investors continued to trim dollar holdings
after the jobs report  putting additional pressure on exporters 
but recovered slightly and was flat at 92 16 yen

 The benchmark Nikkei  lost 41 78 points to 10 238 68
yen by midday  while the broader Topix  fell 0 6 percent
to 944 23 yen 
 A U S  labour market report showing more private sector job
losses in August than forecast made investors nervous ahead of
Friday s highly anticipated monthly jobs data from the U S  Labor
Department  sending Wall Street shares lower   ID nN02321193 
 But market players were unfazed by the Nikkei s drop 
  Basically  there s no real reason for the market to fall
substantially  Prices were high and people are simply selling to
take profits  especially ahead of the U S  Labor Day holiday on
Monday   said Nagayuki Yamagishi  a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities 
 The Nikkei fell below its 25 day moving average  which
currently comes in at around 10 400  on Wednesday  But most
market players see this as simply signalling a short term
adjustment and nothing major to worry about 
  As long as the line of the 25 day moving average on charts
still points upwards  falling below it is actually a sign you
should buy on dips   Nikko Cordial s Nishi added 
 Others see support for the Nikkei ranging from around 10 000
to 10 200 over the next month  with none expecting steep falls 
 GAINS AFTER DEAL
 Dainippon Sumitomo trimmed its gains but was still up 3
percent at 1 043 yen 
 Dainippon  Japan s No 7 drugmaker in terms of revenue  would
under the takeover gain a sales force of about 1 000 that is
familiar with central nervous disorders to promote its
experimental schizophrenia drug  which has performed well in
late stage trials 
 It would also gain Sepracor s insomnia drug Lunesta  asthma
drug Xopenex  and an experimental epilepsy drug 
 The purchase would be the latest in a series of acquisitions
by Japanese drugmakers of U S  rivals as they seek to beef up
their drug pipelines and their presence in the world s largest
pharmaceuticals market 
 Exporters slid on the yen s strength  Investors fret about a
stronger yen as it eats into exporter profits when repatriated

 HONG KONG  Aug 31  Reuters    Chinese stocks sank 6 percent
to a three month low on Monday  weighing on Asian shares 
sapping investor willingness to take risks and giving the yen
an added boost after Japanese voters swept the opposition into
power 
 The election results  while widely anticipated  sparked
some short term buying of yen on hopes that new policies will
support consumer spending in an economy trapped in deflation
and haunted by a weak growth outlook  though domestic stocks
slipped on exporter weakness 
 Major European stock futures fell 0 9 percent  following
commodity prices lower  in trade thinned by a holiday in
London  U S  stock futures fell 0 6 percent and U S  Treasury
futures were up 0 2 percent 
 Outside of Japan  volatility in Shanghai  a market largely
closed to foreigners  has curbed risk taking and has been
weighing on the Australian dollar  which is a common target for
investors searching for bigger returns because of its
relatively high yields 
 Shanghai listed shares dropped 6 2 percent on the day  on
track to post losses of 21 percent in August  only the second
month that the composite index has fallen more than 20 percent
in the last 15 years 
 The index also crucially dropped below the 125 day moving
average  what is viewed by many domestic investors as the
threshold for bear and bull markets 
 Fears that banks will rein in their lending after a torrid
first six months of the year and an abundant supply of expected
new shares have been knocking Chinese shares lower for the last
month  often weighing on global investor sentiment about
holding riskier assets 
 Shares of Bank of China  the country s biggest foreign
exchange lender  were down 3 9 percent in Shanghai and the top
drag on the market  Hong Kong s Hang Seng dropped 1 8 percent
to a one month low in sympathy with Shanghai 
 Tokyo s Nikkei share average fell 0 4 percent  Large
exporters Canon Inc and Honda Motor Corp were among the biggest
drags on the Nikkei  losing around 3 3 percent and 1 8 percent 
respectively  on the stronger yen 
 Australian stocks also performed relatively well  falling
only 0 2 percent  Shares of Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd jumped 4 1 percent after the country s fourth largest
lender said it was starting to see bad debt provisions bottom
out 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks traded outside Japan
slid 1 3 percent  The selling was widespread  hitting the
consumer discretionary  energy  telecommunications and
materials sectors 
 ASIA STOCK S VALUATIONS QUESTIONED
 Asian stocks are trading at a price to book valuation of
1 1 times  above the 30 year average of 0 7 times and around
the same level at the peak of the last bull market 
 Investors since March had been justifying the premium based
on the region s growth prospects and its expected speedy
recovery from the global downturn  Yet in August developed
markets  such as the United States and Europe  have attracted
investors away from emerging markets thanks to better economic
data 
 The Asian stock rally sputtered in July and August for two
reasons  according to Mark Matthews  Asia Pacific strategist
with Fox Pitt Kelton ini Hong Kong 
  The first is that the U S  in particular and the developed
world in general are experiencing economic recoveries that are
more robust than previously expected  The second is that there
is policy shift in China  and even the doves there are happy
that asset prices are no longer rising quickly   he said in a
note 
 YEN FOR YEN
 In the currency market  the yen got an early boost on the
clear as day election result  which eliminated any uncertainty
about Japan s political leadership  The sharp selloff in
Shanghai equities also supported the yen as dealers sought a
safe haven 
 The U S  dollar fell 0 7 percent to 92 75 yen  the lowest
since July 13  and the euro dropped 1 percent to 132 28 yen 
 The sharp decline in Chinese stocks  has muddied the
picture as well as to whether it s a reaction to the election
victory or risk aversion  It s probably a bit of a combination
of both   said a dealer at a European bank in Hong Kong about
the yen strength 
 The Australian dollar was off 0 6 percent to US 0 8373 
though was largely unchanged in August 
 The yield on the benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note
slipped to 3 43 percent  down sharply since hitting 4 percent
on June 10 
 The creeping rise of risk aversion in markets pushed down
oil prices  with U S  crude for October delivery down 0 7
percent to  72 22 a barrel  Brent was down 0 9 percent to
 72 12 a barrel

 By Elaine Lies and Aiko Hayashi
 TOKYO  Aug 31  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average fell on

Shanghai stocks added additional pressure  erasing an earlier
jump to an 11 month high after an opposition election win 
 Sunday s landslide victory for Yukio Hatoyama s Democratic
Party ends a half century of almost unbroken rule by the Liberal
Democratic Party and breaks a deadlock in parliament 
 The Nikkei lost 0 3 percent or 27 38 points to 10 506 76
after bouncing briefly to an 11 month high  led by buying of
Nikkei futures that set off short covering  But it fell back as
the yen advanced to a seven week peak against the dollar and
exporters lost ground 
 Shanghai shares tumbled 5 4 percent  falling to a three month
low and breaking beneath the key 125 day moving average used by
Chinese investors to delineate a bull versus a bear market 
  The election probably had an impact for about the first 30
minutes of trade  when stocks jumped  but then the stronger yen
and Shanghai pushed the market lower   said Koichi Ogawa  chief
portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments 
  Exporters  such as carmakers and tech firms  are very
sensitive to the higher yen and even though the market s pretty
surely bottomed out  this could still have a bad impact  
 Market players said there was little sign of foreign
investors    long a key driver of the Nikkei    in the market 
with some investors selling on the fact the election was over

Democratic policies there s likely to be long term support   said

percent at one point  falling by over 1 percent later  and
turning briefly positive several times after that 
  The market will likely take a wait and see approach for

 TOKYO  Aug 25  Reuters    The Nikkei average fell 0 8 percent
on Tuesday as exporters such as Canon Inc took a breather after a
rally the previous day  while investors focused on Japan s Aug 
30 general election and U S  economic data 
 Market analysts say many expect Japan s opposition Democratic
Party to gain power but investors remain hesitant about actively
taking positions before they see the results  though some say the
election has already become a neutral trading factor 
  The market is facing profit taking for now  but downward
pressure isn t so strong either  as U S  stocks didn t fall too
much and the dollar yen is still trading around 94 5 yen   said
Yutaka Miura  a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities 
  Investors are also paying attention to U S  economic
indicators  which have been mixed lately  to see if the economy
is steadily improving  
 The market will closely watch economic data out of the United
States such as Case Shiller home price indexes due later in the
day for further clues about the progress of an economic recovery

Party of Japan ahead of the LDP  A solid win for the Democrats

 TOKYO  Aug 25  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average drifted
lower on Tuesday  hit by profit taking after surging 3 4
percent the day before  with investors finding few reasons to buy
actively before Japan s Aug  30 election and U S  economic data 
Exporters lost ground after leading Monday s rally  while
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group fell in the wake of losses in U S 
peers after a veteran banking analyst said 150 to 200 more U S 
banks would fail during the banking crisis 
 Market analysts say many expect Japan s opposition Democratic
Party to gain power but investors remain hesitant about actively

  We re basically seeing a profit taking response to
yesterday s rise  with investors waiting to see the U S  housing
data to reconfirm the strength of the economic recovery   said
Noritsugu Hirakawa  a strategist at Okasan Securities 
  People are also reluctant to buy before the election

profit taking  also dented buying interest

there will be more U S  banking failures  But mainly I think
investors are simply reluctant to buy at this level  feeling that
Tokyo may be overpriced   said Tomomi Yamashita  a fund manager
at Shinkin Asset Management 
 Opinion polls show the main opposition Democratic Party of
Japan set for a sweeping victory on Sunday that would end more

  Investors are picking up individual stocks with specific
news  but their basic stance is still index trading mainly in
stock futures   said Yutaka Miura  senior technical analyst at
Mizuho Securities 
  Investors buy on dips but they don t want to aggressively

 In moderate trade  the benchmark Nikkei fell 24 46 points to
10 260 50  while the broader Topix was flat at 949 32 
 The S P 500 Index rose 1 percent on Tuesday  boosted by
better than expected results from Home Depot Inc and Target Corp 
which were largely due to cost cutting and tight controls over
inventory  offsetting an unexpected drop in housing starts 
 U S  government data showed construction starts for
single family dwellings  the worst hit part of the housing
market  rose 1 7 percent last month from June to an annual rate
of 490 000 units    the highest since October 
 But a 13 3 percent drop in new multifamily home projects
pushed overall housing starts down 1 percent to an annual rate of
581 000 units after two months of gains

positions ahead of Japan s national election on Aug  30

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Aug 24  Reuters    Crude oil extended gains on
Monday but a rally in world equity markets sputtered in the
United States after investors questioned whether stock prices
had outpaced the potential strength of economic recovery 
 Oil prices briefly touched a 10 month high near  75 a
barrel after reports showed that new industrial orders in the
euro zone rebounded in June and U S  economic activity improved
again in July   
 The dollar edged up against the euro and yen in extremely
thin trade as Wall Street surrendered earlier gains and traders
repositioned themselves ahead of key U S  consumer and housing
data due later in the week   ID nN24354417 
The early rally in U S  stocks faded about midday after U S 
Treasuries rose as investors swooped in to take advantage of
sharp losses in government debt markets on Friday 
  We have been recently seeing a disconnect between the two
markets  Stocks were up on economic optimism and bonds were up
on economic concerns   said Peter Boockvar  equity strategist
at Miller Tabak   Co in New York 
  Investors are finally catching up with this  and seeing
Treasuries as a sign that they should not be buying so much  
Boockvar said 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  closed up 3 32
points  or 0 03 percent  at 9 509 28  The Standard   Poor s 500
Index  slipped 0 56 point  or 0 05 percent  at 1 025 57

percent  at 2 017 98 
 RISE IN MIDWEST MANUFACTURING
 Economic data was cheered by some investors  but others saw
reasons for caution  A rise in the Chicago Federal Reserve

 In addition  Nouriel Roubini  one of the few economists who
predicted the magnitude of the world financial crisis  said in
an Financial Times article a recovery is likely to be anemic
and there is a  big risk  of a double dip recession 
 The lock step in which commodity prices have tracked equity

 TOKYO  Aug 10  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average
climbed to a 10 month high on Monday after better than expected
Japanese and U S  data underpinned hopes that both economies are
on the mend  with exporters also gaining on a weaker yen 
Shares of Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings  Japan s largest
chemical firm  surged 5 2 percent after the Nikkei business daily
said it is in talks to acquire resin maker Mitsubishi Rayon in a
deal worth up to 200 billion yen   2 1 billion  
 Mitsubishi Rayon soared 20 9 percent 
 Japanese machinery orders  a leading indicator of capital
spending  rose in June for the first time in four months  but
Japanese manufacturers forecast a sixth straight quarterly fall
in machinery orders in July September 
 The data came on the heels of a drop in the U S  unemployment
rate in July  the first in 15 months as employers cut
fewer than expected jobs 
  Machinery orders were quite a lot better than expected and
if you put this together with the U S  jobs data  this will
really give the market a boost   said Noritsugu Hirakawa  a
strategist at Okasan Securities 
  The market was cheered by a solid series of earnings  but we
needed proof of macroeconomic recovery to really push higher  and
now we re starting to get that

target is likely to be 10 800    a level it last saw in October
and a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement from its June 2008 high
and last October s 26 year low just under 7 000 
 But some in the market warned that further gains would be
inhibited for now by concerns about the economy s performance in
the current quarter 
Japan s core machinery orders rose a bigger than expected 9 7
percent in June  but it was unclear whether the rise marked a
lasting recovery in capital spending 
  We really need to start getting some positive macroeconomic
outlooks for this quarter and then the latter half of the year 
and I think market attention is turning to this   said Masayoshi
Okamoto  head of dealing at Jujiya Securities 
 If people were really confident we d be rapidly heading up

companies do not currently have capital ties

 TOKYO  Aug 18  Reuters    Japanese high tech glass maker Hoya
Corp said it aims to turn its Pentax operations profitable in the
year to March 2010  but that its digital camera business needs to
seek alliances for survival in the long term 
 Hoya  which acquired endoscope and digital camera maker
Pentax in 2007 for about 95 billion yen   1 billion   is ready to
spend up to 200 billion yen on M As to strengthen its health
care related businesses  Hoya Chief Executive Hiroshi Suzuki said
on Tuesday 
 The company vies with Olympus Corp and Fujifilm Holdings in
endoscopes  which are used to examine internal organs  and it
competes with Essilor International of France and Germany s Carl
Zeiss in eyeglass lenses 
 Hoya s Pentax unit posted an operating loss of 11 6 billion
yen   122 million  in the year ended March 31  hit by
restructuring costs and sluggish digital camera sales 
  Our digital camera business is not exactly a big operation 
There are naturally questions among us whether it is big enough
to go it alone   Suzuki told Reuters in an interview 
  I m afraid it will need some sort of alliance with another
company in the long term  
 The Tokyo based company sold 2 3 million digital cameras last
business year  That is less than a 10th of Canon Inc s sales of
25 6 million in calendar 2008 
 Hoya is the world s 10th largest digital camera maker
trailing larger rivals such as industry leader Canon and
second ranked Sony Corp 
 Daiwa Institute of Research analyst Hiroyasu Sato said
seeking ties with other companies in the digital camera business
is a step in the right direction for Hoya 
  Its camera business is in the phase of developing
distinctive products and improving profitability   Sato said 
  But if you look beyond the current phase  an alliance is a
necessary step  If you do not have a wide enough range of
products you cannot secure store shelves or broaden your user
base  
 Suzuki said Hoya s financial standing would allow him to
spend up to 150 to 200 billion yen on mergers and acquisitions 
but the timing is not quite right yet 
  There are multiple potential targets  but I m not in a
hurry   Suzuki said 
  Valuations in the M A market are not really reflecting tough
economic reality  I expect valuations to come down to reasonable
levels if we hold back a little longer  
 Besides endoscopes  digital cameras and eyeglass lenses 
Hoya s product portfolio includes hard disk drive components 
contact lenses and LCD photomasks  which are used to etch
circuitry onto liquid crystal display panels 
 Hoya is the largest contact lens shop operator in the
domestic market  running 151 shops in Japan 
 Suzuki said he aims to double the number of retail outlets in
Japan in four to five years 
 He said Hoya s revenues in the business year to next March
are likely to exceed 400 billion yen  That compares with a
consensus figure from analysts in a Reuters poll of 398 billion
yen 
 Shortly after Suzuki s comments  shares in Hoya closed down 1
percent at 2 060 yen  underperforming the benchmark Nikkei
average  which gained 0 2 percent 
   1 94 82 Yen

   profit helped by cost cutting  margin improvement
   Q2 Revenue declined 18 percent
   Revenue seen pressured in rest of year due to economy
   Shares up 1 pct in premarket
  adds results details  stock moves 
 NEW YORK  July 23  Reuters    Xerox Corp  posted
better than expected quarterly results helped by cost cutting 
but said a slowdown in office equipment spending would continue
to pinch revenue for the remainder of the year 
 The world s No  1 supplier of digital printer and document
management services on Thursday also forecast third quarter
profit that fell shy of Wall Street analysts views 
 Shares of Xerox were up 1 percent in thin premarket trade
on Thursday  after the company posted second quarter net income
of  140 million  or 16 cents a share  down from  215 million 
or 24 cents a share  a year earlier 
 That beat analysts  expectations for a profit of 11 cents a
share  according to Reuters Estimates 
 Second quarter revenue declined 18 percent to  3 73
billion  which was marginally higher than the  3 72 billion
expected by Wall Street 
 Cost cutting helped the company improve gross margins in
the quarter to 40 2 percent  up one percent point from the
prior year and up 1 3 points from the first quarter 
 The company has pledged to keep trimming costs  and plans
to reduce its overall debt by  1 billion this year 
 Xerox attributed the revenue decline to  spending
constraints  which has slowed buying decisions and demand for
document related supplies  As the global recession continues 
some large clients have been hesitant about purchasing
higher end technology 
  Assuming current economic conditions persist  we expect
revenue will remain under pressure during the balance of this
year   said Xerox Chief Executive Ursula Burns  who assumed the
role of Chief Executive this month 
 Former CEO Anne Mulcahy  who has been credited with
revitalizing Xerox following severe financial troubles earlier
this decade  has stayed on as the company s chairman 
 The Norwalk  Connecticut based company  whose rivals
include Oce NV   Canon Inc  7751 T  and Ricoh Co Ltd
 7752 T   has in the past year scored solid profits and
improved market share  but efforts to boost revenue have been
derailed by the recession 
 Xerox expects third quarter earnings per share in the range
of 10 cents to 12 cents  and now sees a 2009 profit of 50 cents
to 55 cents 
 Analysts were expecting a profit of 13 cents for the
quarter and 51 cents for the full year

 TOKYO  July 28  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average inched down
0 3 percent on Tuesday after nine straight days of gains  as
stocks that had led the strong run up such as Advantest Corp fell
amid concern about the rapid pace of the rally 
 But investors picked up banking shares that many see as
having lagged the market s advance  with top bank Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group rising 
 Market players said profit taking had set in after the
benchmark Nikkei climbed 11 5 percent during the nine day run 
its longest since 1988 
 Investor reluctance to aggressively take positions ahead of a
slew of earnings announcements was also holding the Nikkei in
check  they said 
  High tech shares that had already rallied are pausing for
now  and clues to further gains in the overall market will depend
on the degree to which investors snap up laggard banking shares  
said Takahiko Murai  general manager of equities at Nozomi
Securities 
 The electronic machinery subindex has advanced about 15
percent during the period  compared with a 5 6 percent gain in
the banking subindex 
  If banks go up much higher we can expect another round of
gains for the Topix index  As for tech stocks  however  the
sustainability of their earnings prospects is questionable as
demand has improved but not enough to push them back into the
black  
 In light trade  the benchmark Nikkei fell 25 78 points to
10 062 88  It rose 1 5 percent the previous day to post its
highest close since June 12 
 The broader Topix was flat at 927 76 
 Japan s corporate earnings season gets into full gear this
week and Canon Inc  Hitachi Ltd and JFE Holdings Inc are among
companies scheduled to report results later in the day 
  U S  earnings generally beat market expectations and that
has prompted the market rally   said Yumi Nishimura  deputy

  But once the earnings season in the U S  and Japan is over 
investors will likely lack factors to further push up the
market

camera maker ahead of Sony Corp and Nikon Corp  came in at 44 9

 TOKYO  July 28  Reuters    Japan s Canon Inc nudged up its
profit outlook as it steps up cost cuts  but maintained a
cautious view on office equipment demand  boding ill for Ricoh Co
Ltd and other copier and printer makers 
 Canon posted a 72 percent fall in quarterly operating profit
on Tuesday  hit by sluggish demand for office machines  but
raised its full year forecast by 6 percent to reflect more
aggressive restructuring steps and a softer than expected yen 
 The world s largest digital camera maker has benefited from
solid demand for high end cameras  helping cushion the blow from
weak sales of copiers and printers as companies worldwide rein in
spending on office machines in a tough economic environment 
  We believe governments  stimulus measures will be starting
to bear fruit from now on  but it s not very easy to talk about a
recovery in the office equipment sector at this stage   Canon
Managing Director Masahiro Osawa told a news conference 
 Canon now expects an annual operating profit of 190 billion
yen   2 billion   higher than the consensus estimate for a 174
billion yen profit in a poll of 18 analysts by Thomson Reuters 
but down 62 percent from 2008 
 It expects unit sales of its cash cow laser beam printers in
2009 to fall 45 percent from 2008 
 The maker of EOS and IXY brand digital cameras also said it
now aims to cut 220 billion yen in costs this year  a 28 percent
increase on its previous target of 172 billion yen 
 HIGH END CAMERA SHINES
 In contrast with sluggish demand for office machines  Canon
enjoyed robust demand for single lens reflex  SLR  cameras 
high end models with interchangeable lenses  as the introduction
of lighter and cheaper entry versions prompts users to shift from
compact cameras to SLRs 
 Canon  which competes with smaller rivals such as Sony Corp
and Nikon Corp in the digital camera market  raised its digital
SLR camera sales target for 2009 by 3 percent to 4 million
cameras 
  The results confirm that the company is able to offset the
deterioration of the copier and printer business with its
consumer businesses  namely digital cameras   said J P  Morgan
analyst Hisashi Moriyama 
  Canon s profit structure is different than that of a pure
office equipment maker  
 Canon s results come after rival Xerox Corp beat quarterly
profit estimates last week  helped by cost cuts  but cautioned
that a slowdown in office equipment spending would pinch revenue
for the remainder of the year 
 Canon competes with Xerox  Ricoh Co Ltd and Konica Minolta
Holdings Inc in copiers and printers 
 Ricoh is set to report its quarterly results on Friday 
followed by Konica Minolta on Aug  6 
 Canon s operating profit was 44 91 billion yen in April June 
down from 160 15 billion yen a year earlier but up from a 20
billion yen profit in the previous quarter  a sign that its
quarterly earnings may have bottomed out 
 Canon reported a quarter on quarter decline in operating
profit for five consecutive quarters to January March 
 It revised its assumption for the euro yen rate to a more
favourable 130 yen from 125 yen for the second half  while
leaving its dollar yen assumption at 95 yen 
 It said it would pay a first half dividend of 55 yen per
share  unchanged from a year earlier 
 Prior to the announcement  shares in Canon closed down 0 3
percent at 3 370 yen  outperforming the Tokyo stock market s
electrical machinery index  which fell 1 percent 
 By Monday  Canon shares had risen 20 percent since April
versus a 28 percent rise in the subindex

 The Japanese camera and office equipment maker is certain to
sell more than nine million digital cameras in the year to March

remains as it is  If the economy recovers in the second half  of
the business year   we will do even better   Higuchi told
reporters on the sidelines of a news conference 
  The company originally estimated sales of 8 3 million units
for the current business year  compared to actual sales of 8 2
million units a year earlier 
 Fujifilm Corp is a Fujifilm Holdings subsidiary that handles
cameras  photographic film  medical equipment and electronic
components 
 In a bid to beat fierce competition and to turn around its
loss making digital camera operations  Fujifilm plans to launch
a new model capable of capturing 3 D images in August 
 The new machine  which comes with two lenses and two image
sensor chips to make 3 D pictures possible  will likely sell for
about 60 000 yen   641  in Japan  a Fujifilm spokeswoman said 
 Fujifilm  the world s eighth largest digital camera maker
competing with larger rivals such as Canon Inc and Sony Corp 
aims to sell 100 000 units of the new model  called FinePix Real

 By Aiko Hayashi
 TOKYO  July 29  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average rose 0 2
percent on Wednesday  helped by companies such as Canon which
nudged up its profit outlook  but investors were cautious as they
awaited more corporate earnings reports 
 Shares of JFE Holdings  the world s No 5 steelmaker  extended
gains  jumping 3 9 percent after it forecast a full year profit
on Tuesday and after Goldman Sachs raised its rating to  buy 
from  sell  
 Honda Motor  Nissan Motor and Nomura Holdings are among
companies scheduled to announce results later in the day  as
Japan s reporting season gets into full swing this week 
  It s natural for the market to take a breather due to
investor fatigue after a nine day winning streak and caution
before earnings reports   said Fumiyuki Nakanishi  manager at
SMBC Friend Securities 
  But foreign investors appear to have a bullish view on the
outlook for the stock markets and that s providing support for
blue chip stocks and a solid floor for the Nikkei  
 In light trade  the benchmark Nikkei added 17 65 points to
10 104 91 by midday  after starting the day slightly lower 
 It edged down 0 01 percent the previous day as investors
booked profits after it climbed 11 5 percent during a nine day
run to Monday  its longest stretch of gains since 1988 
 The broader Topix was flat at 930 17 
 Some 950 million shares changed hands on the Tokyo exchange s
first section  below last week s morning average of 1 billion 
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones  760 to 728 
 CANON  JFE RISE
 Shares of Canon  which raised its profit outlook on cost cuts
but maintained a cautious view on demand for office equipment 
gained 1 5 percent to 3 420 yen 
 JFE climbed to 3 690 yen  extending gains after rising 7
percent on Tuesday on higher output and an improved shipbuilding
business 
 Its recurring loss for April June came to 67 3 billion yen 
compared with a profit of 112 10 billion yen a year earlier and
it forecast an annual recurring profit of 40 billion yen 
  Although the actual earnings figures were not good  the
steelmaker s outlook boosted hopes for an earnings recovery for
the second half of the business year   said Kenichi Hirano 
operating officer at Tachibana Securities 
 Chip linked shares continued to be in favour  with
chip tester maker Advantest climbing 3 8 percent to 1 990 yen and
Tokyo Electron adding 1 7 percent to 4 720 yen 
 Shares of Nippon Steel  which is reporting results later in
the day  advanced 2 1 percent to 385 yen 
 But oil explorer Inpex slipped 1 8 percent to 713 000 yen

economic recovery in the United States  with eyes on Japanese
politics in the wake of an election being called for next month 
 Canon Inc and other exporters gained in line with a slight

 Japan s unpopular Prime Minister Taro Aso called an election

for defeat after more than 50 years of almost unbroken rule 
 Market analysts said investors were watching political
developments  but that it was unlikely to be a strong trading
factor for the day  although a slight jump could come after
parliament is actually dissolved later on Tuesday 
 Now that this has been set we have 40 days of a political
vacuum  and overseas investors may not like this very much  They
tend to be scared off by political instability   said Noritsugu
Hirakawa  a strategist at Okasan Securities 
 But he said  and others agreed  that since the dissolution
and election schedule has been known for some time  the actual
event was no surprise to the market and had mostly been factored
in  along with a victory by the opposition Democratic Party of
Japan 
 For now  the short term message is that the market really
wants change   he added 
 U S  stocks jumped on Monday  with the S P 500 hitting an
eight month closing high  after CIT Group Inc  a lender to nearly
a million small and mid sized U S  companies  reached a deal with
bondholders for  3 billion in emergency financing 
  The situation with CIT has eased market worries about
financial instability and increased hopes of economic recovery 
leading to a revival of risk appetite   said Hiroichi Nishi

 TOKYO  July 22  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average rose
0 7 percent to hit its highest in more than two weeks on
Wednesday as technical buying boosted futures prices  but gains
were capped as exporters such as Canon Inc were soft due to the
yen s strength 
 Chipmakers including Shin Etsu Chemical jumped after the
Nikkei business daily said its unit Shin Etsu Handotai is in
talks to raise the price of 300 mm semiconductor wafers by 30 40
percent 
 Analysts said one key technical level for the Nikkei was
9 600  just under where the 25 day moving average comes in  and
that the index holding above that level prompted some
trend following funds to buy stock futures 
  The market received a boost as futures players bought back
short positions   said Takahiko Murai  general manager of
equities at Nozomi Securities 
  But activity in the cash market stayed subdued  with
investors worried about exporters  profits as the yen remains
strong  
 The benchmark Nikkei gained 71 14 points to 9 723 16  its
highest since July 3  It rose for a sixth straight day  its best
performance in nearly seven months 
 The Nikkei has jumped 7 4 percent in the past six trading
days  supported by growing optimism about a recovery in the U S 
economy after a spate of strong earnings reports 
  At this point I think most people are expecting an economic
recovery  the issue now is just whether they think it will happen
quickly or gradually   said Tomomi Yamashita  a fund manager at
Shinkin Asset Management 
 The main U S  share indexes rose on Tuesday  buoyed by solid
profits at construction machinery manufacturer Caterpillar Inc 
but gains were limited by investor caution after a recent
earnings fuelled rise as well as a warning by Caterpillar that
the current quarter will be tough 
 Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on
Tuesday also kept market participants cautious  The Fed chief
said that mounting joblessness  slumping home values and tight
credit were likely to curb consumer spending    a major driver of
U S  economic growth 
 The yen rose against other major currencies on Wednesday
after Bernanke s remarks cooled investor risk appetite 
 The broader Topix advanced 0 6 percent to 906 58 
 CHIPS  DEFENSIVES SHINE
 Shin Etsu Chemical climbed 4 9 percent to 4 740 yen  while
rival Sumco Corp gained 4 6 percent to 1 579 yen 
 Defensive shares also helped the Nikkei  Seasoning maker
Ajinomoto was up 3 8 percent at 824 yen 
 Sapporo Holdings rose 2 8 percent to 554 yen after the Nikkei
business daily reported on Wednesday that the brewer apparently
broke even in January June  beating the company s own forecast
for an operating loss of 2 billion yen   21 4 million  
 Shionogi   Co Ltd advanced 2 6 percent to 1 916 yen after the
drugmaker and its UK partner  GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals  on
Tuesday reported positive interim results on their experimental
HIV drug 
 Exporters met with lukewarm investor demand as the dollar
stayed below the key psychological 95 yen mark 
 The Bank of Japan s latest tankan survey showed earlier this
month that dollar yen rates which big Japanese manufacturers use
when they make business plans for the current year to March 2010
now average 94 85 yen 
 So any dollar yen rates below that level would make it
difficult for firms to meet earnings forecasts as a stronger yen
would reduce the value of their overseas profits in yen terms 
 Sony Corp slid 0 9 percent to 2 295 yen and Canon fell 1 6
percent to 3 150 yen 
 Trade was moderate  with some 2 1 billion shares changing
hands on the Tokyo exchange s first section  roughly in line with
last week s moving average 
 Advancing shares outnumbered declining ones by nearly 3 to 1

 TOKYO  July 9  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average fell to a
seven week closing low on Thursday  weighed down by exporters
such as Canon as the yen stays near five month highs against the
dollar amid growing doubts about a speedy recovery in the global
economy 
 Energy linked shares fell after oil prices dropped more than
4 percent on Wednesday on bearish oil data that underlined
continued weak demand amid concerns about the economic recovery 
 In a seven day losing streak through Thursday  the Nikkei has
lost 6 7 percent  though it remains more than 30 percent above
its lows hit in March 
 Market players said the 200 day moving average of around
8 800 appears to be forming a support level for the benchmark for
now  compared with the Nikkei s current level around 9 300 
  Over optimism about an economic recovery is being modified
to neutral  The market has started examining the situation more
calmly  though it hasn t turned pessimistic yet   said Mitsushige
Akino  chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management 
  Considering the rally in global stock markets since March 
what we are seeing is still within a correction as there are no
further reasons to keep buying now  
 Akino said risk money that recently buoyed oil and other
commodities is now pouring into the safety of bonds as investors
mull their next move 
 At one point on Thursday  the benchmark 10 year Japanese
government bond yield fell as low as 1 270 percent  its lowest
since March 25  Yields move inversely to prices 
 In moderate trade  the Nikkei fell 1 4 percent or 129 69
points to 9 291 06  its lowest finish since May 22 
 It ended at the day s low  though investors earlier took some
comfort in the dollar s rebound above 93 yen on Thursday after it
slid to a five month low around 91 8 yen the previous day 
 The broader Topix declined 1 7 percent to 873 91 
 After U S  aluminium giant Alcoa Inc reported a
smaller than expected loss after the market close on Wednesday 
corporate earnings season will become a major focus for the
market  analysts said 
  Both the U S  and Japanese markets are in a correction phase
right now  and for further gains  investors need to see corporate
earnings have been steadily improving   said Tsuyoshi Segawa  an
equity strategist at Mizuho Securities

   Market lifted by upbeat results from Goldman Sachs  Intel
   Square Enix boosted by strong demand for blockbuster game
 By Shinichi Saoshiro
 TOKYO  July 15  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average rose 0 5
percent on Wednesday after upbeat results from Goldman Sachs and
Intel lifted hopes of a recovery for the global economy and
helped weaken the yen 
 But market gains were limited  with some analysts saying that
investors who were hurt during a nine day slide in the market
which was broken on Tuesday  may be selling into the upturn to
cut their losses 
  Strong earnings results from the United States  the yen s
stalled advance and upbeat results from some domestic companies
are favouring the market   said Shoji Yoshigoe  a senior
investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities 
 Domestic firms with better than expected earning prospects
included Sanyo Electric Co which advanced 0 5 percent after the
Nikkei business daily said it would book a smaller operating loss
than the company s current estimate 
  The Nikkei could have risen even further today given all the
market friendly factors  but a rapid advance was made difficult
after the damage suffered by investors during the sharp drop this
month   said Yoshinori Nagano  a senior strategist at Daiwa Asset
Management 
 The benchmark Nikkei rose 42 52 points to 9 304 33  It fell
to an eight week low of 9 050 33 on Monday after climbing to a
six month high of 10 170 82 in mid June 
 The broader Topix gained 0 3 percent to 870 72 
 CHIP RELATED STOCKS  SQUARE ENIX RISE
 Goldman Sachs trounced forecasts with a 33 percent surge in
quarterly earnings  while chipmaker Intel reported results after
the bell that surpassed expectations  sending its stock 7 4
percent higher in extended trade 
 Chip related stocks rose after Intel s results  with Tokyo
Electron gaining 1 7 percent to 4 310 yen and Advantest Corp
adding 2 1 percent to 1 751 yen 
 Data released on Tuesday showed U S  retail sales climbed 0 6
percent in June  although a big part of the gain was due to
rising gasoline prices  indicating that consumers remained wary
of stepping up discretionary spending 
 Exporters gained as a recent surge in the yen was tempered 
with Sony Corp rising 0 7 percent to 2 300 yen and Canon Inc
climbing 0 7  percent to 3 040 yen 
 The dollar edged up 0 1 percent to 93 60 yen  pulling back
from a five month low of 91 73 yen hit on Monday 
 Sanyo advanced 0 5 percent to 209 yen after the Nikkei
business daily reported that it will likely report an operating
loss of about 5 billion yen   53 4 million  for the
April September first half  better than its original forecast for
a loss of 20 billion yen 
 Shares of Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical  a drug and health goods

 An adviser to President Barack Obama said on Tuesday the
United States should be planning for a possible second round of
fiscal stimulus to further prop up the economy after the  787
billion rescue package launched in February 
 That heightened fears about the economic recovery and that
the corporate earnings season starting this week will be weak 
sending the Dow Jones industrial average to its lowest close
since April 28

   Hitachi jumps on report of lithium ion batteries
 By Aiko Hayashi
 TOKYO  July 2  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average fell 0 6
percent on Thursday  dented by a fall in blue chip shares as
caution set in ahead of U S  jobs data  but Hitachi jumped on a
report it will boost production of lithium ion batteries for
hybrid cars 
 Market analysts said the Nikkei was due for a pause after
recovering some 40 percent from its March lows  though the mood
remained upbeat  reinforced by reassuring manufacturing data from
Europe  China and the United States 
  The market is at a standstill right now after overshooting
recently and as it s just under 10 000  It will likely spend July
and August    the summer months when trade is thin   
consolidating around the 10 000 level   said Fumiyuki Nakanishi 
manager at SMBC Friend Securities 
 The benchmark Nikkei closed down 63 78 points at 9 876 15  On
Wednesday  it briefly touched its highest in about two weeks
above 10 000 before ending the day slightly lower 
 The broader Topix slipped 0 5 percent to 924 02 
  The overly optimistic view on the economy has been modified
and that is prompting investors to adjust positions in blue chip
stocks  For further gains  the market needs to see more
improvement in the fundamentals of the economy   said Takahiko
Murai  general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities 
  Still  environment related stocks such as battery makers are
faring pretty well as they are the flavour of the month  
 The U S  employment report  due on Thursday as U S  markets
will be shut on Friday for the Independence Day holiday  is
expected to depict an economy still wallowing in recession but it
will likely confirm the pace of job losses has slowed 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0 7 percent on
Wednesday  Surveys from Europe showed manufacturing was shrinking
less than initially thought and in China s case  growing
modestly  while other data showed the U S  manufacturing sector
contracted in June but at a slower pace than in May 
 BLUE CHIPS WEIGH
 Canon Inc shed 1 9 percent to 3 070 yen and electronics parts
maker TDK Corp fell 1 6 percent to 4 460 yen  Honda Motor Co slid
2 3 percent to 2 585 yen  the top drag on the Nikkei 225 
 But Hitachi climbed 3 percent to 307 yen after the Nikkei
business daily reported the company plans to boost production
capacity for lithium ion batteries for hybrid cars  targeting a
70 fold increase by 2015 
 GS Yuasa Corp  a car battery maker  gained 3 percent to 860
yen 
 Steelmakers climbed after Goldman Sachs said April June  the
first quarter of Japan s financial year  is likely to be the
worst of the year for them in terms of earnings and it expects
some of them to almost break even in the second quarter  partly
because steel production has started to pick up 
 Shares of Kobe Steel jumped 3 9 percent to 185 yen  while JFE
Holdings advanced 1 3 percent to 3 240 yen 
 Bridgestone Corp climbed 3 7 percent to 1 574 yen after
Merrill Lynch initiated coverage of Japan s largest tyre maker
with a  buy  rating and a target price of 2 000 yen 
  We expect a sharp earnings recovery in July December 2009  
the brokerage wrote in a note to clients 
  At this time  Bridgestone should be benefiting fully from
the drop in raw materials prices  and we expect passenger car
tire demand to recover from July September  and truck business
tire demand from October December

 TOKYO  June 18  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average fell 1 8
percent on Thursday  pulling away from last week s eight month
high as investors booked profits due to uncertainty about the
prospects for a further pickup in the economy 
 Big banks such as Mizuho Financial Group tracked their U S 
peers lower  while exporters such as Honda Motor Co fell as the
yen hovered near a two week high versus the dollar 
 Mitsubishi Estate Co Ltd bucked the trend  rising 0 5 percent
to 1 568 yen after Japan s second biggest developer told Reuters
on Wednesday it is interested in buying a real estate investment
trust  REIT  in Japan and is preparing to launch a property
investment fund in the United States 
  It seems like a pull back phase  People who want to take
profits are starting to appear   said Koichi Ogawa  chief
portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments 
  Since risk assets have been performing well  there are moves
around the world toward re balancing and profit taking   he said 
 While there has been a recovery in factory production in
Japan as inventory adjustments progressed  there are doubts about
the outlook for final demand  including capital expenditure and
personal consumption  Ogawa said 
 The Nikkei ended morning trade down 177 37 points at
9 663 48 
 The benchmark has pulled away from an eight month closing
high of 10 135 82 reached last Friday  but is still nearly 38
percent above a trough hit in early March 
 The broader Topix fell 1 7 percent to 907 23 
 Investors and market analysts said the Nikkei had been due
for a fall after its three month rally  but rapid declines seemed
unlikely at this stage 
  In Japan  the price earnings ratio has risen to around 40 
compared to around 25 to 26 for Taiwan  and there had been buying
that exceeded actual conditions   said Hideyuki Ishiguro  a
supervisor in Okasan Securities  investment strategy department 
 The Nikkei is likely to be supported at its 25 day moving
average  which is now near 9 600  Ishiguro said  If that support
is breached it could fall towards the 200 day moving average near
9 100  but declines beyond that seem improbable  he said 
  The economy s level may be low but it is clearly headed
toward improvement   Ishiguro said 
 The dollar stood at 95 77 yen after hitting a two week low of
95 51 yen earlier this week 
 That hurt exporters such as Honda  which fell 3 6 percent to
2 580 yen  while Canon Inc was down 2 8 percent at 3 110 yen 
 Mizuho Financial Group  Japan s second largest bank  fell 3 6
percent to 242 yen  and top ranked Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
fell 3 3 percent to 584 yen 
 Cyclical sectors such as construction and sea transport
declined  while defensive sectors such as foods and
pharmaceuticals held firm 
 Laox Co climbed by its daily limit  surging 83 3 percent to
66 yen  after the Nikkei business daily said the struggling
consumer electronics retailer is holding discussions with Chinese
retail chain operator Suning Appliance Co on an equity deal that
would make it the first big Japanese retailer to become a Chinese
company s affiliate 
 In U S  trade  the Nasdaq rose slightly on the back of
technology shares  while the Dow and S P 500 both fell about 0 1

 TOKYO  June 19  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average rose 0 6
percent on Friday after a rise in the U S  Dow and S P 500  with
investors picking up shares such as Canon Inc that fell earlier
in the week 
 Elpida Memory Inc jumped 6 6 percent to 1 103 yen after three
sources familiar with the matter said the chip maker plans to
apply for tens of billions of yen in government funds this month
to shore up its depleted capital 
 A broad swathe of sectors rose  including some tech shares 
financial stocks and automakers that had fallen earlier in the
week  with Canon rising 3 2 percent to 3 200 yen and Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group up 2 6 percent at 4 020 yen 
 Among losers were car battery maker GS Yuasa Corp  which slid
8 8 percent to 1 033 yen  GS Yuasa had climbed as high as 1 228

of 376 yen

 TOKYO  June 19  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average rose 0 3
percent on Friday after reassuring U S  jobs and manufacturing
data boosted hopes for a global economic recovery  with investors
picking up shares such as Canon Inc that fell earlier in the
week 
 Elpida Memory Inc rose 3 7 percent after three sources
familiar with the matter said the chip maker plans to apply for
tens of billions of yen in government funds this month to shore
up its depleted capital 
 Shippers such as Mitsui O S K  Lines rose after Morgan
Stanley stated a positive outlook on the sector over the longer
term and lifted its ratings for Mitsui O S K  and Kawasaki Kisen 
 Tokyo shares seem likely to face profit taking in the near
term  said Masayoshi Okamoto  head of dealing at Jujiya
Securities 
  This is probably not a full scale pullback  but it is hard
to say how long it will continue and what form it will take  
Okamoto said 
 The Nikkei stock average rose 29 41 points to 9 733 13 and
the broader Topix edged up 0 4 percent to 914 70 
 The benchmark Nikkei index is still down about 4 percent on
the week  having retreated from an eight month closing high of
10 135 82 hit last Friday 
  The 10 000 level is a gain of roughly 30 percent from the
start of April  Anyone would sell if they have a 30 percent
profit   Okamoto said 
 The Nikkei hit an eight month intraday high just below 10 200
last week  up 26 percent from its April 1 intraday low just under
8 100 
 TRENDLINES BROKEN
 Tokyo shares have faced profit taking after their three month
rally partly because investors are reluctant to chase share
prices higher amid worries that the outlook for capital spending
and personal consumption remains cloudy 
 While the Nikkei could rise above 10 000 again if investor
confidence improves  recent market conditions point to some
weakness  said Hiroaki Osakabe  a fund manager for Chibagin Asset
Management 
  Many large cap stocks have broken below their trendlines  
he said  adding that Shin Etsu Chemical and Honda Motor Co were
among shares showing such signs of weakness 
 Among gainers on Friday  banking and electrical machinery
shares rose  trimming a bit of their losses on the week  with
Canon rising 3 6 percent to 3 210 yen and Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group up 2 3 percent at 4 010 yen 
 Shipping firm Mitsui O S K  rose 1 1 percent to 648 yen and
Kawasaki Kisen climbed 2 9 percent to 425 yen 
 Among losers were car battery maker GS Yuasa Corp  which slid
14 1 percent to 972 yen  GS Yuasa  one of the most actively
traded Nikkei 225 stocks this year  had climbed as high as 1 228
yen this week  its share price having tripled from a March trough
of 376 yen 
 Shares of car battery makers such as GS Yuasa have gained in
popularity in recent months as investors flocked to companies
seen strong in eco friendly technology 
 The Dow and S P 500 rose on Thursday  supported by data
showing that the number of people staying on jobless benefits
fell for the first time since January  while manufacturing in the
U S  Mid Atlantic region contracted much less than expected in
June 
 But some caution is in order  given that the New York Fed
manufacturing data earlier in the week had been weak  Osakabe
said  Regarding the outlook for U S  employment conditions  one
point to watch is the possible impact from General Motors Corp s
filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier in June  he said 
 Declining shares outnumbered advancing ones 924 to 615

   Seven   I Holdings down on competition watchdog rebuke
 By Elaine Lies
 TOKYO  June 23  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average fell 2 8
percent on Tuesday after investors rattled by falls in overseas
markets and worry about the global economy moved to unload
riskier assets 
 Mitsubishi Corp and other resource linked shares took a
battering as oil fell below  67 and copper extended losses on
fears about slowing demand  while exporters fell as the yen
advanced against the dollar 
 Seven   I Holdings was down but off lows after Japan s Fair
Trade Commission ordered its convenience store unit Seven Eleven
Japan to stop pressuring franchise outlets not to cut the price
of food items nearing expiry dates 
 Though markets appeared spooked by a World Bank report that
said prospects for the global economy remain  unusually
uncertain  and cut 2009 growth forecasts for most economies  some
analysts said the grim outlook had been echoed elsewhere and was
being used as an excuse for profit taking 
  Falling simply on the World Bank report seems strange to me 
it s like being surprised by old news all over again   Nagayuki
Yamagishi  a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities 
  People used this as an excuse to take profits  
 The benchmark Nikkei lost 276 66 points to 9 549 61  at one
point falling as low as 9 511 45  its lowest since early June and
down over 3 percent 
 Trade was moderate  with 2 5 billion shares changing hands on
the Tokyo exchange s first section  roughly equal to last week s
daily average 
 The broader Topix lost 2 3 percent to 901 69 
  I don t think there s as much fund movement based on the end
of the quarter or the first half year as some people say  I think
what we re seeing is just investors withdrawing money that poured
into the markets on excessive optimism during the recent rally  
said Takashi Ushio  head of the investment strategy division at
Marusan Securities 
 In addition  clouds are gathering on the charts 
 The Nikkei has dipped beneath its 25 day moving average   
the Japanese proxy for a month  based on its previous six day
trading week  The 25 day moving average has provided support over
the course of the Nikkei s rally since early March 
 DEATH CROSS NEAR 
 In addition  the Nikkei s 25 day moving average is nearing
its five day moving average and could soon cross above it  a move
known as the  Death Cross  that is often a bearish signal 
But Yamagishi said a similar pattern appeared in late April 
where an apparently imminent Death Cross was avoided at the last
moment and instead signalled the bottom of a brief dip 
 I actually think the market will probably consolidate with
the downside holding around 9 500  and we could see Wall Street
rebound today   he said 
 Mitsubishi and other trading houses fell after crude oil
tumbled below  67 a barrel in the wake of a 4 percent fall on

hurrying to buy at this level  
 The Nikkei rose 2 4 percent or 233 53 points to 9 839 24 
climbing well above its 25 day moving average  now around 9 700 
The 25 day moving average is a closely watched technical
level among Japanese equities traders  and had acted as support
for the Nikkei over the course of its three month rally since
March  but became a resistance level after the average fell below
it earlier this week 
 Many analysts had said that if it broke below 9 500 the
market was likely to quickly fall as far as 9 000  but that may
have been averted for now 
 The Federal Reserve kept interest rates at nearly zero as
widely expected on Wednesday  and gave no hint on an imminent
exit from bold policy easing

2 2 percent on Thursday for its best day in over a month  as

 Aozora Bank and Shinsei Bank soared on news they were in

completely erasing losses sustained in a 2 8 percent fall earlier
this week and marking its best day since May 19 in percentage
terms 
 The broader Topix gained 1 9 percent to 919 77 
 Among notable gainers were property shares such as Mitsubishi
Estate  climbing on a combination of a sense that the domestic
economy is improving and recent positive brokerage reports on the
sector 
  In addition  property shares have always lagged the rest of
the market in responding to trends  and this is true now as
well   said Hideyuki Ishiguro  a supervisor at the investment
advisory department of Okasan Securities 
 Mitsubishi Estate rose 5 7 percent to 1 585 yen and Tokyu
Land gained 6 4 percent to 434 yen  The real estate sector rose
5 1 percent  becoming the biggest gainer among the subindexes 
 The Nikkei s gains put it solidly above its 25 day moving
average  a closely watched technical level among Japanese

 The 25 day moving average had acted as support for the Nikkei
over the course of its three month rally since March  but became

 TOKYO  June 18  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average fell
1 5 percent on Thursday  pulling away from last week s eight 
month high  as investors booked profits due to uncertainty about
the prospects for a further pick up in the economy 
 Big banks such as Mizuho Financial Group tracked their U S 
peers lower  while exporters such as Honda Motor Co slipped as
the yen hovered near a two week high versus the dollar 
 Mitsubishi Estate bucked the trend  rising 1 2 percent to
1 579 yen after Japan s second biggest developer told Reuters on
Wednesday it is interested in buying a real estate investment
trust  REIT  in Japan and is preparing to launch a property
investment fund in the United States 
  It seems like a pull back phase  People who want to take
profits are starting to appear   said Koichi Ogawa  chief
portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments 
 While there has been a recovery in factory production in
Japan as inventory adjustments progressed  there are doubts
about the outlook for final demand  Ogawa said 
 Nevertheless  the Nikkei s retreat seems like a healthy
move  given that its fall comes after the benchmark climbed
above 10 000 last week  Ogawa said 
 The Nikkei fell 149 44 points to 9 691 41  The Nikkei hit an
eight month closing high of 10 135 82 last Friday 
 The broader Topix fell 1 4 percent to 909 84 
 The dollar stood at 95 73 yen  after hitting a two week low
of 95 51 yen earlier this week 
 That hurt exporters such as Honda  which fell 3 7 percent to

 Mizuho Financial Group slipped 2 percent to 246 yen  and

 But their losses were countered by gains in
semiconductor linked shares such as Tokyo Electron as investors
snapped up bargains after the sector fell on Monday 
Market analysts said that while any upturn in the Nikkei was
likely to be limited today  the benchmark could well break above
the psychologically key 10 000 threshold later this week

going bankrupt fell from the same month a year earlier in May for
the first time in 12 months  a research firm said on Monday  in
another sign that Japan s economic downturn may be bottoming out 
  This implies that the amount of bad loans held by banks may

   Softbank climbs after Apple halves iPhone price
 TOKYO  June 9  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average fell 1
percent on Tuesday  as exporter shares such as Sony Corp ran out
of steam after leading the benchmark to an eight month closing
high the previous day 
 Shares sensitive to moves in commodity prices like trading
house Mitsubishi Corp slipped on a broad decline in metals prices
the previous day  while smelters  which had surged last week 
slid as investors took profits 
 But Softbank Corp  Japan s third largest mobile phone
operator  climbed after Apple Inc unveiled its next generation
iPhone 3GS and halved the price of its entry level model 
sparking hopes the move could boost sales at the Japanese iPhone
vendor  
 Market analysts said the Nikkei could touch the
psychologically key 10 000 threshold soon  but it was unlikely to
stay above that level as worries remain about corporate profits
and the impact on earnings from a recent run up in commodity
prices 
 Buoyed by a growing view that the worst may have passed for
the global economy  the Nikkei has so far recovered about 40
percent from its March lows  while oil prices fetched a
seven month high above  70 on Friday 
  What we are seeing is an inevitable adjustment after strong
optimism boosted the market  The index will likely hover around
the current level for a while  even touching 10 000 briefly  
said Masaru Hamasaki  a senior strategist at Toyota Asset
Management 
  Investors are shifting their focus to risk factors such as
rising long term interest rates that could affect an economic
recovery or higher commodity prices that could impact corporate
earnings in the latter half of the year

 TOKYO  June 16  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average lost 2 9
percent on Tuesday for its worst one day percentage loss in more
than two months  with shares sold across the board amid investor
worry about economic recovery as the yen advanced 
 Mitsubishi Corp and other resource shares took a hit as oil
and metals prices extended losses  while property stocks slid on
profit taking after rallying for the past month 
 The benchmark Nikkei fell below the hard won 10 000 line 
with some analysts saying technical factors were turning dark and
the day s fall could turn out to be more than just a simple
adjustment following recent sharp gains 
  The atmosphere is not particularly good  and there s a lot

start of May 
 The benchmark Nikkei lost 286 79 points to 9 752 88  pulling
further away from an eight month closing high of 10 135 82
reached on Friday  in its biggest one day percentage fall since
March 30  The broader Topix dropped 3 4 percent to 914 76

  Yesterday s New York Fed index was basically just taken as a
signal to sell  but it really wasn t that important  We won t see
a major change in the trend unless there s a new financial
problem or an indicator that s unexpectedly bad  
 ANY EXCUSE TO SELL
 Tokyo shares tracked the previous day s decline in U S 
equities  which marked their worst slide in a month on Monday
after the New York Fed s Empire State general business conditions
index showed the factory sector shrank at a much more severe rate
in June than the previous month 
Oil fell for the third straight trading day towards  70 per
barrel and Shanghai copper fell for a fourth day after losses on
Monday 
 The Reuters Jefferies CRB index  a global commodities
benchmark  fell 2 percent on Monday in a sell off sparked by a
stronger dollar and investor worries that prices may have run
ahead of fundamentals 
 Mitsubishi  Japan s largest trading house  lost 5 1 percent
to 1 881 yen and fellow trader Mitsui   Co tumbled 5 5 percent to
1 192 yen  Itochu Corp shed 6 percent to 687 yen and Marubeni
Corp lost 4 2 percent to 455 yen 
 Mitsui Fudosan  Japan s biggest real estate developer  and
other property firms slid after a rally that saw the real estate
subindex surge to a seven month high the previous day 
 Mitsui Fudosan sank 6 4 percent to 1 644 yen and
second ranked Mitsubishi Estate lost 6 6 percent to 1 566 yen 
The real estate subindex fell 6 1 percent 
  It is possible that they could face selling based on a
perception that the recovery in economic sentiment is not of the
sort that justifies buying real estate shares   said Mitsushige
Akino  chief fund manager for Ichiyoshi Investment Management 
 But for today I think it s mostly profit taking  
 Exporters slid as well amid the growing worry about a
recovery 
 Honda Motor Co fell 4 1 percent to 2 680 yen  Toyota Motor
Corp lost 3 4 percent to 3 700 yen and Canon Inc fell 2 7 percent

29334,250849,CAJ,UPDATE 3 Japanese exports show modest signs of recovery,news,"  Exports rise in April from March  annual drop slows
   Shipments to China  U S  fall at slower annual pace
 By Stanley White
 TOKYO  May 27  Reuters    Japan s exports showed modest signs
of recovery in April with shipments to China declining at a
slower pace than a year earlier  suggesting that while the worst
of the global slump in trade may be over most of the pickup is
from stimulus spending 
 Exports rose for a second month in April compared to the
previous month  seasonally adjusted government data showed on
Wednesday  an encouraging sign as Japan s economy recovers from
its worst ever contraction  although it remains to be seen how
sustainable the recovery is 
 Shipments to China  Japan s biggest trade partner  fell 25 8
percent in April from a year earlier  narrowing the margin of
annual decline for a third straight month and showing that
Beijing s  585 billion stimulus package is helping slow the pace
of decline in shipments of Japanese cars and consumer
electronics 
 The data also showed that Japanese exports of machinery fell
at a faster pace  suggesting the absence of a rise in final
demand that would prompt China s factories to gear up 
   The improvement in exports reflects companies restocking
inventories on expectations of an economic recovery   said Satoru
Ogasawara  an economist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo 
  Sentiment is improving in many countries  but so far the
hard data hasn t really picked up  This may not be the real
recovery yet  
 Overall Japanese exports fell 39 1 percent in April from a
year earlier  less than the median market forecast for a 41 9
percent fall  On a seasonally adjusted basis  exports rose 1 9
percent in April from March 
 According to separate data from the Bank of Japan released on
Wednesday  seasonally adjusted exports rose 7 8 percent in April
from the previous month  the biggest gain in 14 years 
 The pace of annual declines in exports of cars and electronic
parts is slowing overall  showing that trade is improving  a
Ministry of Finance official told reporters at a briefing 
 Exports to China of mobile phones rose 14 3 percent in April
from a year earlier as China s stimulus package filtered through
the economy  Car exports to China fell 46 7 percent in April from
the previous year  also slower than last month s 54 5 percent
decline  However  machinery shipments posted a 36 0 percent
annual slump in April  faster than a 30 percent annual decline in
March 
 READY TO RAISE OUTPUT
 Japanese manufacturers are turning more positive and have
shown signs they are ready to increase production after a
collapse in global trade last year forced them to slash output 
 The performance of Japan s Canon Inc was better than expected
in March and April as stimulus measures around the world start to
work  CEO Fujio Mitarai said on Monday 
  In China and some other parts of Asia  we even achieved
year on year growth   said Mitarai  head of the world s largest
digital camera maker 
 Sentiment has also begun to turn around in Japan s largest
Western markets  U S  consumer confidence soared in May to the
highest level in eight months as an improving labour market made
people more optimistic about buying cars  data showed on Tuesday 
In Germany  the Ifo business sentiment survey rose in April in a
sign a record slump in exports and investment is easing 
 Still  some analysts were cautious on whether global demand
will recover enough to prompt Japanese companies to go beyond
restocking after a heavy run down of inventories 
  China s economy is doing better than other countries mostly
because of government spending   said Takeshi Minami  chief
economist at Norinchukin Research Institute 
  But like Japan  China s economy is driven mostly by exports 
so unless we see a stable pickup in global demand its recovery
will be limited  That bodes ill for Japanese companies  
 Japanese exports to the United States fell 46 3 percent in
April from a year earlier  smaller than a 51 4 percent drop in
March  although automobile shipments continued to fall sharply 
dropping 70 0 percent from a year earlier 
 The trade balance logged a surplus of 69 0 billion yen
  729 million   higher than the median estimate for a 57 5
billion yen shortfall 
 The Nikkei share average gained 1 4 percent on Wednesday 
tracking the previous day s jump on Wall Street due to gains in
U S  consumer confidence 
 Blue chip exporters such as Sony Corp were buoyed as the
dollar edged further above 95 yen  a level many exporters have
based their earnings forecasts on for the financial year to next
March 
 Japan s government raised its assessment of the economy for
the first time in three years on Monday  saying the pace of
deterioration in exports and industrial production is slowing 
 The government joined the Bank of Japan  which also upgraded
its view of the economy this month for the first time in almost
three years 
 Japan s economy shrank at a record 4 0 percent in the first
quarter as domestic demand and investment buckled  and some
economists say a recovery depends on whether final demand picks
up overseas

tracking the previous day s jump on Wall Street due to gains in
U S  consumer confidence 
 Blue chip exporters such as Sony Corp were buoyed as the
dollar edged further above 95 yen  a level many exporters have
based their earnings forecasts on for the financial year to
next March 
 Japan s government raised its assessment of the economy for
the first time in three years on Monday  saying the pace of
deterioration in exports and industrial production is slowing 
 The government joined the Bank of Japan  which also
upgraded its view of the economy this month for the first time
in almost three years 
 Japan s economy shrank at a record 4 0 percent in the first
quarter as domestic demand and investment buckled  and some
economists say a recovery depends on whether final demand picks
up overseas

   Nikkei could hit 10 000 soon but caution remains   analysts
 By Aiko Hayashi
 TOKYO  June 8  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average hit its
highest point in eight months on Monday  buoyed by a weaker yen
that pushed up exporters such as Canon Inc and by hopes for a
recovery in the U S  economy after it shed fewer jobs than
expected in May 
 JGC Corp shot up nearly 5 percent after the Nikkei business
daily reported on Monday that the plant engineering firm won a
150 billion yen   1 5 billion  order for a natural gas project in
Algeria 
 Market players said the Nikkei could soon reach the
psychologically important 10 000 mark  but they cautioned that
the road to a recovery for the global economy is set to be rocky 
  The rate of deterioration in the economy is slowing  though
it s not as if economic indicators are all turning positive from
negative yet   said Takahiko Murai  general manager of equities
at Nozomi Securities 
  Money is flowing into assets such as commodities and stocks
as risk tolerance has steadily improved on the back of hopes for
a recovery  But we are still not in a position to be overly
optimistic over the medium to long term  
 In subdued trade  the benchmark Nikkei rose 1 percent or
97 83 points to 9 865 84  after rising as much as 1 5 percent to
reach its highest level since Oct  8 
 That followed a 2 6 percent gain made last week  and a rise
of almost 8 percent in May  So far  it has recovered about 40
percent from its March lows on a growing view that the worst may
have passed for the global economy 
 The broader Topix also added 1 percent  to 925 49 
 The U S  Labor Department reported on Friday that employers
cut 345 000 jobs in May    substantially less than analysts had
forecast    but the U S  unemployment rate hit 9 4 percent  its
highest since 1983 
 U S  stocks flip flopped throughout Friday s session  with
the major indexes ending split as investors paused to consider
conflicting signals in the jobs data 
  Investors are welcoming the weaker yen and the
better than expected U S  jobs report   said Yutaka Miura  senior
technical analyst at Mizuho Securities 
  But investors will need to be cautious as unemployment in
the United States may increase  considering what may happen with
GM s restructuring  
 General Motors last week filed for bankruptcy in the
third biggest such filing in U S  history and the largest ever in
U S  manufacturing 
 EXPORTERS LEAD GAINS
 The dollar was fetching around 98 40 yen after hitting a
one month high at 98 90 yen on EBS on Friday as the
smaller than expected U S  job losses sparked concerns that the
Federal Reserve may lift interest rates sooner than previously
thought 
 In the stock market  investors cheer a softer yen as it
boosts exporters  profits when they are repatriated 
 Digital camera maker Canon jumped 4 percent to 3 380 yen and
Sony Corp added 1 5 percent to 2 735 yen 
 Toyota Motor Corp rose 1 8 percent to 3 930 yen  after the

 HONG KONG  June 8  Reuters    Japanese stocks rose to an
eight month high on Monday after smaller than expected U S  job
losses suggested a recovery is under way  while government
bonds slid as investors speculated central banks may have to
raise interest rates sooner than previously thought 
 After its biggest weekly rise in two months  the U S 
dollar slipped as dealers bought back other currencies at
cheaper levels  But higher U S  Treasury yields and doubts
about the speed at which central banks will diversify their
dollar reserves have improved the dollar s outlook 
 Investors will likely focus this week on a deluge of
Chinese economic data for clues on whether consumer demand for
Asian goods is strengthening in major Western markets  and if
Chinese domestic demand is continuing to partly offset weak
exports 
 Reports due this week include trade  industrial production 
fixed investment and retail sales 
 Japan s Nikkei share average advanced 1 2 percent  with
major exporters such as Canon Inc and Honda Motor Co among the
biggest supports to the index 
  Money is flowing into assets such as commodities and
stocks as risk tolerance has steadily improved on the back of
hopes for a recovery  But we are still not in a position to be
overly optimistic over the medium to long term   said Takahiko
Murai  general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities in
Tokyo 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fell
0 65 percent  with declines spread out fairly evenly across the
sectors  suggesting investors were trimming positions amid
concerns about how much longer a three month global equity
rally will last 
 Hong Kong s Hang Seng index was the biggest loser in the
region  falling 1 45 percent  Shares of global lender HSBC fell
2 2 percent  weighing on the index 
 Australian markets were closed for a public holiday 
 U S  markets ended mixed on Friday 
 DOLLAR
 The dollar index  a gauge of the greenback s value against
a basket of six currencies  shed modest early gains and eased
0 06 percent to 80 618 by late morning 
 The dollar index rose 1 6 percent on Friday  its best
performance since Dec  19  according to Reuters data 
 The euro crept back up to  1 40 after falling to a low
around  1 3930 on Friday  after a U S  nonfarm payrolls report
for May showed the fewest job losses since September 
 The dollar s reaction to the payrolls data was significant
because in the last several months  positive U S  economic
surprises have usually pushed the dollar down  as investors
moved out of safe assets to higher yielding ones 
 Yet  with the spread of 2 year euro zone government bond
yields over the same maturity U S  Treasuries collapsing around
22 basis points since last Thursday  investors may begin to
look for higher returns in the U S  assets 
   We suspect the dollar will continue to remain supported
over the coming days  especially if interest rate differentials
are once again regaining their influence   said Mitul Kotecha 
global head of foreign exchange strategy with Calyon in Hong
Kong  in a note 
 Higher commodity prices kept the Australian dollar
supported  The currency climbed 0 5 percent from late New York
on Friday to US 0 7975 though it was well off eight month highs
around  0 8263 hit last Wednesday 
 U S  Treasury yields edged up further after jumping on
Friday  The benchmark 10 year yield rose to 3 87 percent having
risen about 74 basis points in the last month 
 The 2 year yield inched up to 1 33 percent to the highest
since November 2008 
 The swift rise in longer dated yields and the smaller than
expected job losses ignited fears that the U S  Federal Reserve
may have to raise interest rates sooner than expected  which
could dampen an economic recovery 
 Japanese government bond futures fell 0 4 point having
declined 1 2 percent in the last two months 
 U S  light crude for July delivery slipped to  67 95 a

Obama s stimulus package and other measures  Stocks worldwide
rose on Wednesday  due in part to optimism over Obama s plans 
 TOXIC DEBT
 Every Republican House member voted against Obama s
stimulus package  with opposition lawmakers complaining that
the spending component was too high and tax cuts too small 
 It must still pass through the U S  Senate  which will
likely approve an  887 billion version of the plan  and
Democrats hope it will be signed into law by mid February 
 Obama s fledgling administration also floated the creation
of a government  bad bank   or aggregator bank  to absorb toxic
debt and help banks recapitalise 
 Obama and his economic team have also discussed tighter
regulation of the banking industry  at the centre of the
problems which dragged the world s largest economy into the
worst recession since World War Two 
 Seeking alternative measures  the U S  Federal Reserve also
said on Wednesday it was prepared to buy long term Treasury
bonds if that would help improve credit market conditions 
 Bond purchases could help lower mortgage rates and help
curb the housing downturn at the heart of the global crisis 
 The U S  central bank also held its main interest rate in a
range between zero and 0 25 percent and said the rate could
stay unusually low for some time 
 The International Monetary Fund has underlined the scale of
the crisis  slashing its projection for 2009 global growth to
0 5 percent from a November estimate of 2 2 percent  The IMF
even said it was in danger of running out of money 
 Up to 51 million jobs worldwide could disappear by the end
of this year as a result of the economic slowdown that has
turned into a global unemployment crisis  the International
Labour Organisation  ILO  said on Wednesday 
 CATCH UP
 The Philippines economy grew more than expected in the
fourth quarter  boosted by Christmas spending  but analysts
still saw a rate cut off at least 450 basis points later on
Thursday as Manila plays catch up with the global easing trend 
 The economy grew a seasonally adjusted 1 0 percent in the
fourth quarter from the third quarter  higher than forecasts of
a 0 7 percent growth in a Reuters poll this week 
  Iceberg tips are misleading  and we can expect that the
economy is not too far off from tipping over   said Vishnu
Varathan  an economist at Singapore s Forecast Pte 
 In Wellington  New Zealand s central bank slashed rates by
1 5 percentage points to a record low 3 5 percent and left the
door open for more  smaller cuts after  frontloading  since
July 
  The aggressive move pre empts a lot of the downside risk
to the economic outlook   said ASB Bank Chief Economist Nick
Tuffley 
 The world s biggest dairy product exporter is going through
its worst recession on record  The New Zealand dollar fell
around 2 percent to a low of  0 5190 after the rate decision 
 In Japan  Canon  the world s largest digital camera maker 
reported an 81 percent fall in quarterly profit on Wednesday
and forecast a further slide in annual profit to a 14 year low 
 On Thursday  Nippon Steel Corp  the world s second biggest
steelmaker  almost halved its 2009 net profit forecast to 175

 Nintendo Co Ltd is expected to prove the exception to the
Japanese corporate earnings rule with its quarterly profit
report  as its Wii game console and DS handheld device have
been big hits with families seeking low budget  stay at home
entertainment 
 The message from Europe has been mixed  with new reports
there showing the recession has deepened but consumer sentiment
surveys in France and Germany turning positive 
 But a poll of CEOs attending the annual Davos meeting of
the world s business and political elite found that confidence
has plunged to a new low 
 The U N  International Labor Organization has also said
that another 51 million jobs  could be lost worldwide if the
global recession deepened in 2009

29387,250902,CAJ,PluggedIn  HD video in still cameras breaks creative ground,news,"By Niclas Mika
 AMSTERDAM  Jan 8  Reuters    Watch a video recorded by an
average digital photo camera on a big screen television  and
you re often in for a disappointment    grainy  jerky  and poor
sound to boot 
 Camera makers such as Nikon Corp  7731 T  and Canon Inc
 7751 T  are trying to change this by adding high definition
video capabilities to their digital single lens reflex  DSLR 
cameras 
 While the new DSLR cameras lack some crucial features of a
camcorder  they have chips for large  high resolution imaging
and can shoot video that looks good on a large TV screen  They
also allow videographers to pick from a wide variety of lenses
from fisheye to telephoto 
 Some recent DSLR models that offer high definition  HD 
video include Nikon s D90 and Canon s 5D Mark II  Manufacturers
such as Fujifilm  4901 T  are also offering compact cameras
with HD video 
 Ambitious amateur photographers have long been attracted to
DSLR cameras  which    although bulkier than compact cameras   
offer more flexibility with interchangeable lenses and higher
degree of control over the technical aspects of taking a
picture 
 Photographers can  for instance  manipulate the so called
depth of field  keeping only the subject in focus before a hazy
background  or choose a shutter speed that slightly blurs a
moving object to show motion 
 Some of these techniques translate well to shooting video 
 A Nikon D90 is capable of effects that are hard to
re create with consumer grade video cameras  such as shifting
focus from an object close to the camera to one further away
while filming 
 In other respects  however  it is no threat to camcorders 
The D90 s auto focus does not work while filming  zoom is
manual and the built in microphone is mono only 
 Canon offers a compromise in the form of a compact camera 
the PowerShot SX1 IS  It also shoots HD video  records stereo
sound and offers a power zoom  but lacks the flexibility of
interchangeable lenses 
 The Powershot sells for about 550 euros   750  in
Europe  while Nikon s D90 costs about 1 000 euros with a
multipurpose lens  Canon s 5D Mark II tops the list at around
2 500 euros without a lens 
 Reviewing the D90 s video capabilities  photographer
Michael Reichmann on his website 
said the D90 was no replacement for a camcorder 
  But  put it on a tripod  do all manual settings  add a
terrific Nikon lens between fish eye and super telephoto  and
you may have a useful add on tool to the  independent  and
creative film maker   he said 
 Canon made a similar argument for its high end DSLR 
  It s entirely possible that creative potential of EOS 5D
Mark II will attract a new group of videographers  from
students to professionals   a Canon spokeswoman said 
  The large  high resolution sensor  lens options  fine
depth of field and low light performance of 5D Mark II mean
that it could certainly provide a viable alternative for users
who do not have the tens of thousands of pounds required to set
up a functional  high end   file based video workflow   she
added 
 But neither Nikon nor Canon see these cameras as a threat
to camcorders made by Sony Corp  6758 T   Panasonic Corp
 6752 T  or Canon 
  We re not making traditional movie cameras  The Internet
causes movies to change  Many customers just need a clip  a few
minutes   Makoto Kimura  head of Nikon s imaging business  told
Reuters

29404,250919,CAJ,FOREX Yen rises broadly after big slide this week,news,"  Traders  yen slide this week too big to extend
   Yen rises vs dlr after Japan investor repatriates funds
   Kiwi retreats from near 5 mth high vs yen
 By Satomi Noguchi
 TOKYO  March 27  Reuters    The yen rose against other major
currencies on Friday  recovering from a five month low versus the
New Zealand dollar  as investors concluded that the yen s broad
slide this week was too big to extend for the time being 
 The repatriation of funds by a major Japanese investor ahead
of the end of the business year on March 31 prompted the yen to
rise against the dollar 
 That in turn prompted some investors to take profits from
recent strong gainers against the yen such as the Australian
dollar after its jump to a near five month peak earlier this
week 
 The Aussie has climbed 10 percent versus the yen during
March  poised for its biggest monthly rise since 1995  as growing
stability in stock markets encourages investors to buy riskier
and higher yielding currencies 
 The New Zealand dollar has been another beneficiary of such
moves after government yields rose in a sign that investors were
reining in expectations for lower rates 
 The yen  on the other hand  had been battered due to views
that Japan could be the slowest among major economies to recover
from recession after a slew of dire economic data 
 Figures on Friday showed that Japanese consumer price
inflation has stalled and suggested the economy was edging toward
deflation  while retail sales in February fell more than
expected 
  Gains in yen crosses this week have been big and sharp  and
traders naturally want to take a break before the weekend   said
a senior trader at a Japanese brokerage firm 
 The Nikkei average was little changed on Friday  with
exporters such as Canon Inc climbing on growing optimism about a
recovery in the U S  economy but other stocks succumbing to
profit taking after rallies over the past two weeks 
 U S  stock futures edged down in Asian trade and pointed to a
possible retreat in Wall Street later in the day  reducing some
risk appetite that had helped the Australian and New Zealand
dollars  traders said 
 The dollar fell 0 5 percent from late U S  trade on Thursday
to 98 20 yen 
 Traders said price action in Asian hours is likely to stay
choppy as more flows are expected to come through the market
before March 31  when many Japanese companies and investors close
their books 
 Japanese companies may also sell the dollar and euro in a
last minute attempt to hedge their overseas earnings before the
book closings  they said 
  Flows related to the end of the business year and the
quarter have made price movements volatile in recent days   said
Kengo Suzuki  a currency strategist for Shinko Securities  adding
that this had disrupted the recent correlation between higher
stocks and a weaker yen and dollar 
 Japan s budget for the new fiscal year is expected to be
passed on Friday along with tax related bills  according to
domestic media 
 The tax related bills are expected to include a Japanese
version of the U S  Homeland Investment Act  which would allow
corporations to repatriate funds held at overseas affiliates free
of tax 
 Market watchers said that while such a change is a
potentially supportive factor for the yen  economic weakness was
offsetting this 
  Changes to tax regulations is in theory yen supportive  but
the country s weak fundamentals is seen as a potential risk for
anyone looking to buy the yen   said Takahide Nagasaki  chief
forex strategist at Daiwa Securities SMBC 
 The euro fell 0 1 percent to 133 40 yen  while it rose 0 4
percent against the dollar to  1 3586 
 The New Zealand dollar lost 0 6 percent to 56 45 yen after
climbing as high as 57 14 yen earlier  its highest since Nov  11 
on the Reuters dealing system 
 The kiwi s gains earlier came despite data showing New
Zealand s economy contracted in the fourth quarter at its fastest
pace since September 1992  as the market had expected slightly
worse figures 
 The kiwi fell 0 3 percent to  0 5754  off a 10 week high of
 0 5803 struck on Thursday 
 The Australian dollar fell 0 9 percent to 68 64 yen  off a
near five month high of 69 60 yen touched on Tuesday  The Aussie
fell 0 4 percent to  0 6996  below a 11 week peak around  0 7095
hit earlier this week

manager of equity marketing at Nikko Cordial Securities 
  It s true some are taking profits on a recent rally  But
there is also enough buying to offset the negative impact from
profit taking   Nishi said 
 The benchmark Nikkei ended down 0 1 percent or 9 36 points
at 8 626 97 after climbing as high as 8 843 18  its highest
since Jan  9  On the week  the Nikkei jumped 8 6 percent  the

 TOKYO  May 22  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average dipped 0 4

 Analysts said markets were not moved by the Bank of Japan s

29445,250960,CAJ,UPDATE 4 Japan expands stimulus plans  on guard over yen,news," Recasts  adds stimulus package  fresh quotes 
 By Yoko Nishikawa and Leika Kihara
 TOKYO  Dec 12  Reuters    Japan expanded a fiscal stimulus
plan and bolstered a war chest for bank rescues to  131
billion  but kept markets guessing on whether it would
intervene to stop a surging yen from pushing the economy deeper
into recession 
 The abrupt rise in the yen prompted investor speculation
that authorities could try to stop the currency s ascent that
Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa said was undesireable and
which he was watching  with great interest  
 Also on Friday  Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso  whose
approval ratings have fallen sharply ahead of an election due
by September  mapped out wide ranging tax cuts to combat a
deepening recession  He said he still wanted a long mooted rise
in consumption tax to happen in three years time 
 The yen strengthened to fewer than 89 per dollar 
threatening to further cripple exporters struggling with the
worst global downturn in decades that has knocked the United
States  Japan and Western Europe into recession 
  Big moves in markets will have undesirable effect on the
economy   Nakagawa said  Asked whether Japan will intervene to
stop the rise  he said   I m not thinking at all about whether
or not we would intervene  
 Indeed  markets appeared to be overreacting to the failure
of a  14 billion U S  carmaker rescue  said Naoyuki Shinohara 
vice finance minister for international affairs  said 
  We will act appropriately depending on the market
situation   he told reporters  when asked about the possibility
of intervention in currency markets 
 Analysts said that if Japan was to intervene  it would
likely go it alone  given that the U S  dollar has been broadly
firm against other currencies 
  It has come to the point that Japanese authorities may
take some measures  such as the Bank of Japan lowering rates to
near zero or increasing the monetary base   said Hiromichi
Shirakawa  chief economist at Credit Suisse   Japanese
intervention in the currency market will also be an option  
 WOES
 Japan s economy sank deeper into recession in the third
quarter  fuelling fears that the world s second largest economy
is facing its longest contraction ever combined with a return
to deflation 
 Japan s Nikkei stock average slid 5 6 percent as the dollar
sank to 88 1 yen  its weakest since 1995  while Japanese
government bond futures jumped more than a point 
  The worst case scenario for Japanese authorities is that
the yen s appreciation pushes down Japanese share prices which
will further aggravate the economy  and they see it happening
now   said Masafumi Yamamoto  head of foreign exchange strategy
for Japan at RBS 
 In the latest plan to boost the economy  the government
would increase spending to ease the pain from a worsening job
market and cut taxes on purchases of low emission cars 
 It would also strengthen an already announced package of
economic measures worth 27 trillion yen   295 billion   which
included 5 trillion yen in new spending and featured payouts to
families  tax breaks on mortgages and relief for small firms 
 In addition  the government plans to expand its bank rescue
scheme to 12 trillion yen   131 billion  from 2 trillion yen 
 Aso also said the government will set up a scheme by March
to buy up to 3 trillion yen   33 billion  in commercial paper
through a state backed lending institution to ease tight
funding conditions  A seized up commercial paper market has
forced many companies to boost borrowing from banks at a record
pace as they set aside cash at the year end  when demand for
funds increases 
 YEN CORPORATE THREAT
 The collapse in global demand has forced leading Japanese
companies such as Sony and Canon to slash jobs and investments
and the yen s strength is threatening to further erode their
export earnings 
 Japanese car companies Toyota Motor Corp  Nissan Motor Co
and other Japanese carmakers have already cut production in the
face of sliding car sales globally  and their shares fell more
than 10 percent on Friday 
 The stocks were hit both by the yen s jump and fears among
analysts and auto executives that a bankruptcy of a U S  auto
maker could cause failures at parts suppliers  hurting other
automakers 
 The U S  dollar has held ground against other currencies in
past months while the yen has been under upward pressure from
the unwinding of risky trades financed by the low yielding
Japanese currency  but Friday s move was still a surprise 
  It comes just when sentiment among institutional investors
had been starting to calm down  but now it is as if cold water
has been poured over their heads   said Kimihiko Tomita  head
of foreign exchange at State Street Global Markets

 TOKYO  Dec 17  Reuters    A dramatic rate cut by the U S 
Federal Reserve has ratcheted up the pressure on a reluctant Bank
of Japan to follow suit this week  with analysts saying to hold
back would rock Japanese markets and worsen the crisis 
 Some analysts suggested the Japanese central bank could also
cut rates to almost zero on Friday  whereas before the Fed move
the BOJ was seen as ready to take more steps to ease a credit
crunch but undecided about cutting rates 
 The U S  Federal Reserve broke into uncharted territory by
chopping benchmark rates to as low as zero and pledging to use
 all available tools  to turn back a deepening recession 
 As government officials pushed the BOJ to take more action 
investors saw a 60 percent chance of it cutting rates to 0 1
percent from its current 0 3 percent 
  With the Fed having come this far  markets would be hugely
disappointed if the BOJ keeps rates on hold at 0 3 percent this
week  The rate differential could trigger sharp yen rises and
push down stocks  reviving the market crisis in October   said
Hirokata Kusaba  senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute 
  The BOJ needs to do something and I m sure they are aware of
that  It s likely to cut rates  even to zero  this week  It needs
to avoid keeping Japanese rates higher than those of the U S  
 In further pressure  chief government spokesman Takeo
Kawamura  a cabinet minister  said the BOJ must support the
economy 
  The abnormal rise in the yen could affect export industries
and I hope that the BOJ will make a comprehensive consideration 
including those factors  to decide its monetary policy   Kawamura
told a news conference 
 The Fed s surprisingly big rate cut sent Japanese government
bonds surging and the yen back towards 13 year highs against the
dollar  to the likely dismay of a BOJ worried about the strong
yen s impact on Japanese exports 
 The yen was seen rising further against the dollar with U S 
interest rates now lower than Japan s  adding pressure on the BOJ
to slash rates  analysts said 
 SEVERE CONDITIONS
 BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa added fuel to the fire on
Tuesday  when he warned Japan s economy was in severe condition
and monetary conditions were rapidly becoming less accommodative
   his bleakest prognosis yet 
 Central banks across the globe are slashing rates and eyeing
unorthodox policy measures as the global financial crisis sends
many rich countries into recession and slows growth in China and
India 
 Japan  like the United States  is already in recession as
companies such as carmakers Toyota and Honda slash output as
customers close their wallets worldwide 
 But the BOJ decision this week could be a close call as some
within the central bank are reluctant to cut already low rates
further 
 They argue that doing so would do little to boost the
economy  preferring instead more moves to ease tight credit 
 These steps could include expanding the type of collateral it
accepts in its fund operations 
 The BOJ could follow the Fed into buying commercial paper
outright or purchase asset backed securities  reviving a scheme
that was put in place five years ago during the bank crisis 
 Commercial paper is a form of short term unsecured borrowing
often used by companies to fund day to day operations
 Other steps being floated are for the BOJ to boost the amount
of long term Japanese government bonds it buys outright each
month from the current 1 2 trillion yen   13 5 billion  or expand
the type of assets it accepts in fund operations  analysts said 
  The BOJ can t get away with doing nothing  but past
experience shows it is always behind the curve in acting against
market moves   said Yasuhide Yajima  senior economist at NLI
Research Institute 
  The chance of the bank cutting rates this week is 50 50  
 The collapse in global demand has forced leading Japanese
companies such as Sony and Canon to slash jobs and investments
and the yen s strength is threatening to further erode their
export earnings 
 With its own tankan survey showing the biggest plunge in
business confidence since the 1970s oil crises  the BOJ is set to
downgrade its already bleak economic assessment  analysts say 
 The BOJ cut its key policy rate to 0 3 percent from 0 5
percent in October and unveiled a series of measures to ease
credit strains as the fallout from the global financial turmoil
spread 
 But that had done little to ease the seized up commercial
paper market  which has forced Japanese companies to boost
borrowing from banks at a record pace as they hoard cash on
jitters over of a year end credit squeeze 
 Currently  the Bank of Japan buys commercial paper in its
market operations to provide funds to banks  but only with a
re sale agreement rather than buying the debt outright

29480,250995,CAJ,Tokyo business executives fear bearish Year of Ox,news,"TOKYO  Jan 6  Reuters    Japan s top businessmen toasted the
new year at a party on Tuesday  but the mood was bleak as the
world s No 2 economy hunkers down for a bearish Year of the Ox 
 A languishing stock market and the dismal outlook for
exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp made for dour banter among
bankers and chief executives  who bowed and toasted each other at
the annual gathering of Japan s biggest business lobby 
  I never expected the crisis to spread this fast  and leave
this deep a scar   Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe said on the
sidelines of the party  just hours after his firm reported a 37
percent slide in U S  car sales in December and said it would
halt production at some plants 
  If you look at the automobile market now  it s very  very
tough  We need to proceed with the assumption that this situation
could continue  
 Other exporters such as Honda Motor and Canon Inc have also
been waylaid by a surge in the yen  which threatens to decimate
profits from overseas sales 
  A rapid strengthening of the yen brings major damage to
Japan s economy   said Fujio Mitarai  the chairman of Canon and
Nippon Keidanren  the main lobby group for big firms whose
exports drive the Japanese economy 
 Mitarai told a news conference following the party that he
hoped the dollar would average 95 105 yen this year  after it
slumped to a 13 year low against the yen last month near 87 yen 
 In Japan  which follows the Chinese zodiac  2009 is the Year
of the Ox  Research company Daiwa Institute has said that  Ox 
years have previously been rough ones for Japanese stocks 
 If true  that portends a disastrous year for Tokyo equities 
as the the Tokyo stock market already booked its worst year on
record in 2008 
  Competition is becoming extremely severe  making it harder
and harder for us to rack up profits  These trends would not
change even if the market turns around   lamented Yoshinari Hara 
a former president of brokerage house Daiwa Securities Group 
 Some executives said they expected the Tokyo market s
benchmark Nikkei share average to test 6 000 points this year   
down around a third from current levels after a 42 percent fall
last year    but not all was doom and gloom as the beer flowed
and the executives swapped business cards 
  The stock market has bottomed out  as of the  end of last
year  Both in New York and Tokyo   Tokyo Stock Exchange chief
Atsushi Saito told Reuters 
  I think the stock market will perform reasonably

29489,251004,CAJ,UPDATE 2 Nintendo Q2 oper profit up 36 pct  trims outlook,news,"  Q2 operating profit up 36 pct on DS  Wii sales
  Lowers full year growth forecast on firmer yen
  Raises 2008 09 Wii sales target by 4 pct
  Shares up 10 9 pct ahead of results vs Nikkei s 10 pct gain
  President Iwata sees robust game demand intact
  Adds comments from president  analyst 
 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Yumi Horie
 TOKYO  Oct 30  Reuters    Japan s Nintendo Co Ltd posted a
36 percent gain in quarterly operating profit on brisk sales of
its Wii game gear  but the video game maker trimmed its outlook
amid a global economic slowdown and a surge in the yen 
 The new full year forecast  however  still exceeds market
expectations  and the creator of such game characters as Mario
and Zelda raised its sales target for the Wii  saying video game
demand remains robust despite the deepening financial crisis 
 Both the Wii and DS handheld gear have outsold rival
machines from Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp  helped by innovative
games such as the  Wii Fit  home exercise title and
user friendly hardware design 
  Nintendo cut its operating profit forecast by 3 percent to
630 billion yen   6 4 billion  for the year to March as it
changed its dollar yen assumption to 100 yen from 105 yen for
the second half and its euro yen outlook to 140 yen from 160
yen 
 The latest outlook is still up from 487 22 billion yen a
year earlier and above the market consensus forecast of 624 6
billion yen in a poll of 16 analysts by Reuters Estimates 
  Today s announcement offers little evidence that the
slowing economy is hurting Nintendo s business   Mizuho
Securities analyst Takeshi Koyama said 
  That should provide some sense of relief to investors 
although it does not change the fact that the direction of
foreign exchange rates remains a great source of concern  
 Nintendo s July September operating profit was 132 99
billion yen  up from 98 15 billion yen a year earlier  according
to a Reuters calculation 
 Sales rose 17 percent to 413 5 billion while net profit fell
28 percent to 37 56 billion yen as the yen s appreciation pared
the value of Nintendo s foreign currency denominated assets 
 WHAT DOWNTURN 
 Nintendo President Satoru Iwata said the game sector has
been weathering the adverse business environment relatively well
and the company remains securely on the growth path 
  If we look back  whether or not we have attractive games
has had way more impact on our earnings than ups and downs of
the economy   Iwata told a news conference 
  I think it is safe to say strong game demand is intact
despite all this talk about the financial crisis  
 The company raised its Wii sales forecast for the year to
March by 4 percent to 27 5 million units  far outpacing Sony s
target to sell 10 million units of the PlayStation 3 in the same
period 
 In a bid to stir up demand for its portable game gear ahead
of the holiday season  Nintendo plans a Saturday launch in Japan
of its new DS model that can take pictures and play music 
breaking into Apple Inc s iPod and iPhone territory 
 Sony this week posted a 90 percent drop in quarterly profit
and has predicted its annual profit will fall 58 percent as
demand slows for its digital cameras and flat TVs 
 Microsoft last week reported better than expected quarterly
profit and reduced its outlook by less than many investors had
feared as economic conditions turn tougher 
 Ahead of the results  shares in Nintendo closed up 10 9
percent  or by their daily limit of 3 000 yen  at 30 600 yen 
outperforming the benchmark Nikkei average  which gained 10
percent 
 Shares in Nintendo have fallen 54 percent so far this year 
a bigger drop than the Nikkei s 41 percent 
 The stock is valued at around  44 billion  making it Japan s
sixth most valuable listed company ahead of Canon Inc  Panasonic
Corp and Sony

   Japan exporters  investors sell into dollar s rebound
 By Eric Burroughs
 TOKYO  Oct 29  Reuters    The yen edged up on Wednesday after
suffering one of its biggest drops against the dollar ever the
previous day as reports the Bank of Japan could cut interest
rates this week sparked a hefty stock rally and a recovery in
investor appetite for risk 
 Japan s central bank is considering cutting rates from the
already low 0 5 percent at Friday s policy meeting  a source told
Reuters  joining an expected round of rate cuts in coming days as
central banks grapple with a darkening global economic outlook 
 The move would come after Group of Seven powers issued a rare
warning earlier this week singling out the yen s surge as a
threat that could further destabilise financial markets and the
global economy 
 The G7 action was seen as giving Japan the scope to intervene
in currency markets to weaken the yen  which has soared to a
13 year peak against the dollar and all time high against the
Australian dollar as investors have dumped carry trades 
 Japan s low interest rates have made the yen popular for
years as a source of cheap funds for carry trades    borrowing
the yen to buy everything from higher yielding currencies to
stocks and commodities 
 Analysts said a BOJ rate cut would likely have little impact
on the Japanese economy or the yen but would send a message that
it was acting more in concert with other major economies in
dealing with the worst financial crisis in 80 years 
  A rate cut would send a message to the world that Japan is
cooperating with other nations in tackling the financial crisis 
Now that the news is out  markets would be hugely disappointed if
the BOJ didn t cut rates   said Koichi Haji  chief economist at
NLI Research Institute 
 The yen s jump this month has compounded the slide in the
Nikkei share average to a 26 year low  creating a vicious circle
that analysts see as a major factor behind this week s official
response 
 The reports of the BOJ rate cut  along with a huge rally on
Wall Street  drove the Nikkei up nearly 8 percent at one point on
Wednesday 
 The dollar fell 0 5 percent from late U S  trade to 97 50 yen
after having surged as high as 99 79 yen on trading platform EBS
but well above the 13 year low of 90 87 yen struck last week 
 On Tuesday the dollar soared 6 4 percent against the yen   
the biggest one day gain since 1974 
 Traders said Japanese exporters stepped in to sell the dollar
as it approached the 100 yen level  In reporting quarterly
earnings this week  exporters such as Canon Inc and Panasonic
Corp said they were using the 100 yen level as a target rate for
their business planning 
  Japanese exporters see it as an opportunity to sell dollars
and euros because nobody knows how long this stock rally will
last   said Mitsuru Sahara  senior manager of forex trading at
Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ 
 Some Japanese institutional investors were also selling the
dollar and other currencies as they shed some of their hefty
foreign asset holdings and repatriate funds 
 Trading in currencies remained very choppy due to the very
poor liquidity plaguing many markets  as the severe bouts of
volatility have prompted investors to shift to the sidelines
until conditions calm down 
 The euro dipped 0 3 percent to 124 01 yen but traded in a
wide range between 127 40 yen and 123 60 yen 
 But the euro edged up 0 4 percent to  1 2740 recovering from
a 2 1 2 year low of  1 2335 struck the previous day

 TOKYO  Oct 29  Reuters    The yen climbed on Wednesday after
suffering one of its biggest ever drops against the dollar the
previous day  with market players saying the slide on Bank of
Japan rate cut expectations and rebounding stocks had gone too
far 
 Reports the Bank of Japan could cut interest rates this week
sparked a hefty stock market rally and a recovery in investors 
appetite for risk  But financial markets remained very volatile 
with the Nikkei share average moving in a wide range before
ending up 7 7 percent 
 Japan s central bank is considering cutting rates from the
already low 0 5 percent at Friday s policy meeting  a source told
Reuters  just as the Federal Reserve is expected to slash rates

 Japan s low interest rates have made the yen popular for

the yen to buy everything from higher yielding currencies to

  The yen is expected to stay strong for a while because these
are not conditions in which market players  including hedge
funds  will resume the yen carry trades yet  But the excessive
appreciation of the yen seems to have been halted   said Kazuyuki
Kato  treasury department manager at Mizuho Trust   Banking 
 Traders said the yen was now less likely to strengthen beyond
the 90 87 yen peak against the dollar reached last Friday 
 The yen s jump this month has compounded the slide in the
Nikkei to a 26 year low as well as falls in other stock markets 
creating a vicious circle that analysts see as a major factor
behind this week s G7 response 
 The dollar fell 1 1 percent from late U S  trade to 96 94 yen
after having surged as high as 99 79 yen on trading platform EBS 
well above the 13 year low of 90 87 yen struck last week 
 On Tuesday the dollar soared more than 6 percent against the
yen    the biggest one day gain since 1974 and the second biggest
since being allowed to trade freely in 1973  according to data
from Reuters Ecowin 
 The euro slipped 0 6 percent to 123 55 yen pulling back from
an early high of 127 30 yen but well above the 6     year low of
113 62 yen hit on Monday 
 The iBoxx trade weighted index for the yen has soared about
15 percent this month on the heavy selling of the euro

  Shares close up 2 pct ahead of results
  Adds net profit  sales  closing share price  background 
 TOKYO  Oct 29  Reuters    Japan s Sony Corp posted a 90
percent fall in quarterly profit as growing worries about the
global economy sent the yen higher and hit camera sales  and the
company kept its annual profit outlook of a 58 percent decline 
 The steep profit slide was expected after the electronics and
entertainment conglomerate last week cut its annual operating
profit forecast by 57 percent  citing yen strength and slower
digital camera and flat TV demand 
 Canon Inc this week followed Sony in cutting its
full year outlook  although Panasonic Corp on Tuesday bucked the
trend and kept its annual outlook of 8 percent profit growth
despite the tough business environment 
 Sony  which competes with Canon in digital cameras and with
Samsung Electronics Co in LCD TVs  reaffirmed an operating profit
forecast it issued last Thursday of 200 billion yen   2 02
billion  for the year to March  down from 475 3 billion yen a
year earlier 
 Some industry watchers  however  expect the maker of Bravia
flat TVs and Cyber shot digital cameras to post an even lower
profit for the current business year as the latest outlook is
based on what they consider rather optimistic assumptions 
 Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates on average predict an
annual operating profit of 158 2 billion yen 
 Sony s latest outlook is based on a euro yen exchange rate
assumption of 140 yen for the second half of the year to March
and on the premise that Tokyo stock levels remain unchanged from
Sept  30 for the last six months of the business year 
 The euro traded around 123 yen on Wednesday  while the Nikkei
has lost about a quarter of its value so far this month 
 Operating profit totalled 11 05 billion yen in
July September  down from 111 62 billion yen a year earlier 
 Net profit fell 72 percent to 20 8 billion yen on sales of
2 07 trillion yen  down 0 5 percent 
 Prior to the announcement  shares in Sony closed up 2 percent
at 2 035 yen  underperforming the Tokyo stock market s electrical
machinery index IELEC  which rose 6 7 percent 
 Sony shares have lost 68 percent since the start of the year
through Tuesday  while the subindex slid 56 percent

  Nikon shares close up 13 8 pct before announcement
  Updates with details  background 
 TOKYO  Oct 30  Reuters    Japan s Nikon Corp slashed its
annual net profit forecast by 40 percent to below market
expectations  citing weaker sales of semiconductor making
equipment and a stronger yen 
 Shares of Netherlands based ASML  Nikon s main rival in the
chip equipment market  were down about 2 percent after the
announcement 
 Nikon cut its estimate for sales of new steppers in the
current business year to March by 30 percent to 74 units  the
latest victim of spending cuts by chipmakers adjusting their
budgets as the global economy slows 
 Steppers are multi million dollar machines used in the
production of semiconductors  Canon Inc also competes in this
market with Nikon and ASML 
 Nikon said it now expects to post a net profit of 47 billion
yen for the year  down from last year s 75 5 billion yen and
below a market consensus of 77 5 billion yen from a poll of 20
analysts by Reuters estimates 
 It cut its sales forecast by 4 percent to 940 billion yen 
 Nikon generates about three quarters of its revenues outside
the Japanese market  making its earnings vulnerable to the recent
surge in the yen against the dollar  euro and other currencies 
 Advantest Corp has also been hurt by the chip market slump 
The maker of semiconductor testing machines said on Thursday it
swung to a net loss of 2 9 billion yen in the April September
first half 
 Nikon said digital camera sales remain strong 
 It raised its annual target for shipments of digital single
lens reflex cameras    high end models that use interchangeable
lenses    to 3 5 million units from 3 3 million  while lifting
its compact camera forecast by 7 percent to 10 million units 
 Nikon s rivals in the digital camera market include Canon 
Sony Corp and Panasonic 
 Prior to the announcement  shares of Nikon closed up 13 8
percent at 1 655 as part of a broad market rally  The stock has
