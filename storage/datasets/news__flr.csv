First quarter earnings are now expected to decline 4 2  year over year for S P 500 companies  according to FactSet  compared to a 3 9  decline forecasted just one week ago  That would mark the largest year over year decline in earnings since the first quarter of 2016 
The primary focus for investors will be on companies  guidance as it  will let us know what to expect  whether  potentially negative earnings  is a one quarter blip or if we re moving into an earnings recession   said Jim Powers of Delegate Advisors

Fluor  NYSE FLR  slumped 24  after CEO David Seaton abruptly resigned on the back of disappointing earnings and a cut to full year forecast

14420,235935,FLR,Eskom s New CEO Engaged in Questionable Stock Sales at Sasol,news," Bloomberg      Bloomberg     Andre de Ruyter  the incoming head of South Africa s debt burdened state power utility  engaged in questionable stock sales while working as a senior executive at Sasol Ltd  in 2013  according to a forensic audit report 
De Ruyter  who was Sasol s senior group executive for global chemicals and North American operations  together with then chief financial officer  Christine Ramon  knew about cost overruns at a chemical project and sold the company s stock before that information was disclosed to other executives  says the report  a copy of which was seen by Bloomberg News  The report formed part of a risk and corporate governance assessment commissioned by the petrochemical conglomerate and undertaken by Werksmans Attorneys  a corporate law firm 
Both executives deny wrongdoing  saying they obtained the necessary authorization to sell stock and weren t aware of the Werksmans report  Sasol confirmed that the sales were authorized  The report said  however  that had the information about the overruns been more widely known  approval would not have been given 
 It would appear that the information Mr  Andre de Ruyter and Ms  Christine Ramon had at their disposal was price sensitive information when they traded their shares    the report found  citing as evidence email communication between the executives and people working on the project over several months  Most of the emails were between De Ruyter and other employees  Ramon was copied on some of them 
De Ruyter left Sasol in October 2013  before the report was submitted  following a career that spanned more than two decades  to become chief executive officer of Nampak Ltd   a packaging company  He is set to take the helm at Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd  by mid January  Ramon left a month earlier and took up her current role  as CFO of AngloGold Ashanti Ltd   the world s third biggest gold producer  in July 2014 
Why Eskom s Power Crisis Is South Africa s Top Risk  QuickTake
Eskom supplies about 95  of South Africa s power and is struggling to turn itself around after years of mismanagement and alleged graft that have driven it to the brink of insolvency and saddled the company with about  31 billion in debt  As the nation s biggest state owned enterprise  the utility is key to maintaining financial and economic stability  and its inability to supply consistent power has hindered the economy 
The chairman and acting CEO of Eskom  Jabu Mabuza  said the company wasn t aware of any investigation of De Ruyter   We can confirm that rigorous integrity and reference checks were performed independently in line with normal recruitment processes and as required by the shareholder in supporting the board s recommendations for any appointment to the position    these came back with satisfactory results   he said 
 In 2013  a review into the share trading of certain executives was undertaken    Sasol said in response to questions  Ramon and de Ruyter left before the report was completed and their departures were not related to it  nor were they told about it  the company said  Sasol added it didn t believe it needed to report the trades to regulatory authorities 
Werksmans confirmed it conducted an investigation but declined to comment further  citing attorney client privilege  Andre Visser  general manager of issuer regulation at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange  said companies are obliged to report all share dealings by directors 
The review came at a time of strained relations between Sasol s then CEO  David Constable  and other executives  including De Ruyter and Ramon  according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation  De Ruyter had been a formal contender for the CEO role and lost out to Constable  a Canadian national and former  Fluor Corp   NYSE FLR   executive  Constable  currently a board member at Fluor and  Rio Tinto   LON RIO  Plc  acknowledged a request for comment but did not respond further 
Share sales
Stock exchange filings show De Ruyter sold three tranches of the company s shares for a total of 8 9 million rand   604 000  on May 14  2013  while Ramon sold a single tranche for 33 7 million rand the same day  In both cases  the sales represented the majority of the Sasol stock they held  according to the Werksmans document  Both executives reported to Constable at the time 
On the day the two executives sold their shares  the company held a meeting at which other executives were told about the escalating costs of expanding a synthetic wax production project  according to the audit report  Internal Sasol correspondence showed De Ruyter and Ramon knew about the issue as early as February 2013  the report said 
 Both parties are by extension responsible for material misrepresentations in the form of omission and were potentially significantly conflicted in their roles of preparing and finally presenting the material information    the report said 
On May 24  Sasol started a so called closed period  which would have barred executives from trading their stock  On June 7  2013  Ramon released a financial update revealing that the estimated cost of the wax project in Sasolburg  south of Johannesburg  had surged to 11 9 billion rand  40  to 45  more than previously budgeted  The following month  the company announced a 1 5 billion rand write down on the project  which was eventually completed in 2018 at a cost of 13 5 billion rand 
De Ruyter said he was responsible for the day to day operations of Sasol s chemical plants and not the execution of projects  and that many executives  including Constable  would have been aware of the problems at the project 
The manner in which the report was produced  smacks of an intent to get the imprimatur of a law firm to cast unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations    De Ruyter said in response to Bloomberg s queries   I do not consider the matter adequately dealt with   
He said the fact that the report had come to light six years after he left Sasol seemed to be an attempt to undermine his credibility as incoming CEO at Eskom  De Ruyter s appointment was criticized by some labor unions and opposition parties  which saw it as a blow to racial transformation because they said there were suitable black candidates for the Eskom job  These included Jacob Maroga  Eskom CEO from 2007 to 2009  and Dan Marokane  the utility s former head of group capital  according to people with knowledge of the situation 
Stock rebound
Despite the losses  Sasol s per share earnings rose 11  in the year through June 2013 as output from its synthetic fuels business increased  That meant the trades didn t work out optimally for the two executives  The stock surged 25  between the date they sold and the end of 2013 
De Ruyter sold 1 49 million rand worth of Sasol stock in 2011 and 2012  according to stock exchange disclosures  There is no record of Ramon selling stock 
 I strongly deny that I have acted wrongfully or unlawfully in any manner as alleged or otherwise   Ramon said in a response to Bloomberg   I strongly deny that I have made any material misrepresentations and that I was conflicted in any manner as alleged  Sasol s wax production project had no bearing on my decision to sell my securities in Sasol  
The audit  which covered the period from Feb  1 to Aug  31  2013  and was concluded after the two executives  departure  analyzed emails  regulatory filings and other documents supplied by the company  Its authors said they were given an unrestricted mandate and had unfettered access to information  They didn t uncover evidence that Sasol board members breached their fiduciary duty during the review period  the report said 
South Africa s Financial Markets Act of 2012 specifies that anyone who knowingly deals in securities with undisclosed insider information that could affect their value commits an offense  The Johannesburg Stock Exchange s listing requirement stipulates that directors need written authorization to trade in their company s stock and may not be given clearance in any period where they have access to price sensitive information  Sasol also has American depository receipts  subjecting it to U S  Securities Exchange Commission rules that require it to disclose material information about legal proceedings and other matters to investors 
While the conduct of individual managers posed challenges  Sasol s systems and controls were found to be impeccable  and its risk management and peer review mechanisms were robust  the report concluded  The company s public disclosure and reporting processes were also compliant with the rules  to a fault   it said

  KBR  Inc   KBR   Fluor Corporation  NYSE FLR   FLR  and AECOM  ACM  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Increasing construction activities in residential and government projects in the United States   that require state of the art construction and engineering services   are expected to benefit the construction and engineering services industry  Other tailwinds include the rapid usage of advanced technologies to deliver smart buildings and mega projects  while identifying and checking margin contraction and costs  The Trump administration s investment in defense and cyber security is conducive to the industry s growth  The players are also gaining from rising global demand for alternative nuclear energy  as they provide engineering  procurement  construction and maintenance services to nuclear power plants  Meanwhile  increasing public investments in transportation  water infrastructure  utility plant and healthcare market are anticipated to drive the industry s growth  In addition  infrastructure services business of the industry players continues to thrive  supported by robust demand from the communications industry  Chemical derivative and refining opportunities  both domestic and international  along with upstream and LNG opportunities should also spur growth  However  slowing global growth  a tight labor market  trade war induced rise in raw material costs  volatility in commodity prices and the cyclical nature of the industry s commodity based business lines pose significant challenges  Some of the companies have also been witnessing a dearth of larger pipeline projects owing to volatility in consumer spending  Again  significant cost overruns  as prices of several companies  contracts are fixed  have been hurting the bottom line of some of the companies  Increasing competition is another dampener  The industry faces intense competition in the global engineering  procurement and construction industry  which is detrimental to companies  contract prices and profit margins Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Engineering   R D Services industry is a 17 stock group within the broader Zacks

Fluor has had a rough couple of years  The stock price was down 41 3  in 2019  and over the past three years  through Jan  31  it s dropped about 67   From the beginning of the year to the time of this writing  its share price is down about 4  to around  18  Is it a good time to buy 



Strategic review yields new focus
The company laid out an operational restructuring plan in the third quarter of last year designed to right the ship  In its most recent earnings report in the third quarter  there was a net loss from continuing operations of  782 million compared to net earnings of  69 million from the previous year s quarter  
The strategic review calls for refocusing the business on the core markets of engineering  construction  and maintenance services  Thus  it plans to sell off its government and equipment rental businesses  as well as surplus real estate and other non core assets  These moves are expected to generate about  1 billion in proceeds 
The restructuring is also designed to help the company better execute on its backlog  The company has seen its backlog rise  particularly in the energy and chemicals segment  Meanwhile  new awards have dropped sharply year over year  to  2 6 billion at the end of the third quarter from  6 3 billion the previous year 
The problem  as my colleague Lee Samaha explained  is that Fluor had been overly aggressive in bidding on projects  and many of them were fixed price contracts that incurred charges that ate into earnings  So  the company will now only pursue fixed price contracts that adhere to strict criteria  
This will help create a future backlog that s comprised of higher quality projects  

 As a result of this process  I believe we have a better understanding of our backlog  and I have confidence that our backlog can positively drive future results   Fluor president and CEO Carlos Hernandez said on the third quarter earnings call   We are committed to following a clear criteria to pursue the right contracts with the right terms  and we believe our new pursued criteria will help us de risk the business and deliver higher margins  
Should you buy 
Fluor reports fourth quarter earnings on Feb  18  and we ll get a better picture at that time on how they are executing on this strategy  It seems like the company is headed in the right direction 
In late January there was good news as Fluor was awarded a project management consultancy services contract by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited  BPCL  at its refinery and petrochemicals complex in India  
Cautious investors may want to wait for fourth quarter earnings for more clarity on how the restructuring is progressing before investing  However  at this valuation and with its restructuring plan  Fluor is a stock worth keeping an eye on ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqwyg,2075476

126298,347813,FLR,Goldman Crunches Data to Pick the Best Trades for a G 20 Rally,news," Bloomberg     It s no secret that global trade tensions have spurred market volatility  which means this week s G 20 meeting is likely to offer both peril and opportunity for investors 
The gathering in Buenos Aires  which will include a much watched dinner between U S  President Donald Trump and China s Xi Jinping amid heightened trade tensions  offers one of the year s last remaining potential catalysts for a big move in markets  So   Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   looked at previous trade related stock moves to figure out what might be winners this time around 
 We see an opportunity in the options market for investors to express a view that trade news could be more constructive than feared by buying calls on the stocks that have lagged   Goldman strategists led by Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall wrote in a note Wednesday   If this scenario does materialize  we see the potential for shares that have been most exposed to trade news to trade higher  benefiting buyers of calls   they said  offering the caveat that they  are not making a call on the outcome of trade talks and the G 20  
The Goldman strategists identified about 20 stocks that have shown unusually high volatility around seven periods of trade news since March  and have sufficiently liquid options  A call that s 5 percent out of the money is cheapest on eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY    Stanley Black   Decker Inc  NYSE SWK   and  Fluor Corp   NYSE FLR    they said  with companies like Applied Materials Inc  NASDAQ AMAT    Las Vegas Sands Corp  and Huntsman Corp  also making the list 
On average  stocks in that group have lagged the S P 500 Index by nearly 40 percent since March 21  but one 5 percent out of the money call option costs just 3 percent  the strategists said  They noted that call buyers risk losing the premium paid if shares close below the strike price at expiration 
Sector exchange traded funds might also be good places to try trading the G 20 meeting  as some industry groups have shown more volatility than others around trade news  Goldman said  recommending the purchase of calls on industrials  ticker XLI   materials  XLB   semiconductors  SMH  and technology  XLK  funds 
 Calls on certain country ETFs  i e   China and Emerging Markets  as well as S P 500 could perform well if trade talks are constructive in the coming days   the strategists added ",2018-11-28,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goldman-crunches-data-to-pick-the-best-trades-for-a-g20-rally-1703278,1703278

126400,347915,FLR,In Houston  oil workers may face the ax but employment still grows,news,"By Howard Schneider
BAYTOWN  Texas  Reuters    Plunging energy prices robbed the Texas economy of an estimated 60 000 jobs last year  as oil and gas companies put the brakes on production and slashed investment  throwing engineers and geologists out of work 
But the forest of construction cranes sprouting around this petrochemical hub tell the flip side of the story  as some of the same forces that drove down those prices sparked tens of billions of dollars in investment in new processing plants to take advantage of cheap and plentiful supplies of oil and gas 
 Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM  and  Chevron  Corp  N CVX  are building mammoth chemical crackers to process polyethylene from natural gas  and logistics firms have created millions of new square feet of warehouse space as they plan to ship the output to the global plastics industry 
Rising chemicals output has contributed to record traffic at the Houston Port Authority  and officials say the trend is expected to continue  Throughout the Baytown area  which is on the outskirts of Houston  an estimated  8 billion worth of projects is expected to be finished this year and another  22 billion completed in 2017 
This has all propped up employment in Texas at an otherwise difficult time  The positive impact on the overall U S  economy from the chemicals industry that this illustrates is also one of the reasons the U S  should avoid a downturn despite troubles elsewhere in the world  That in turn should create the conditions for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again this year 
 They are shedding jobs upstream  That s the nature of the business   said B J  Simon  associate executive director of the Baytown West Chambers County Economic Development Foundation  But  the opportunity to build these crackers just could not be passed up   access to cheap feedstocks changed the whole equation downstream

JOBS THE FED S NORTH STAR
The global economy may be sputtering  with weak demand one of the reasons that oil prices have cratered  But the U S  keeps adding jobs  and at a rate consistent with the outlook from Fed policymakers who expect growing U S  payrolls will mean enough domestic spending to keep the economy expanding overall 
Texas  lost a lot of energy jobs   said Dallas Fed research head Mine Yucel  but the state  has been very resilient  I was surprised  
Across the oil patch  there s a similar pattern of positive trends offsetting bad news  Though low prices have crippled investment in exploration and cut drilling rigs  overall employment in Oklahoma continues to rise in a state that has built large logistics and defense contracting industries 
In North Dakota  ground zero for the fracking boom  overall employment has dropped  but the unemployment rate remains a super low 2 7 percent compared to the national average of 4 9 percent  The number is held down by an expected adjustment  just as workers flocked to the state when vacancies were plentiful  the labor force has declined as the jobs disappeared and workers returned home 
These states represent a drop in the bucket compared to Texas s  1 6 trillion  12 5 million job economy  a size approaching that of Canada  Despite the oil downturn  the unemployment rate is only 4 7 percent as non energy companies like fiber optic manufacturer Applied Optoelectronics  O AAOI  expand in the state 
In a rough year for the oil business  the state as a whole added 144 000 jobs in 2015  according to the Texas Workforce Commission  with strong gains across the trade and hospitality sectors  as well as professional services  health and education 
ROCKY START
The Fed meets next week to take stock of the U S  economy after a rocky beginning to the year 
A rate hike is not expected at the March meeting but the central bank s post meeting statement and fresh economic projections from policymakers will provide important insight into how worried the Fed is about the combined impact of cheap oil and weak global demand on prospects for U S  jobs  growth and investment 
In an organization that prizes consensus under Chair Janet Yellen  clear cracks have emerged  between Vice Chair Stanley Fischer s recent statement that inflation is  stirring   for example  and Fed Governor Lael Brainard s continued caution about how the rest of the world may inhibit the U S 
The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in a decade and projections by its policymakers at the time showed they expected four hikes this year  However  many investors and analysts now feel the Fed may be stuck where it is for much of the rest of the year 
The jobs growth figures provide a counterweight to that view  The labor recovery has been going on for seven years now  and whenever hiring has slowed in one sector of the economy another has picked up the slack 
The early strength in commodity based jobs that spread across the fracking fields of North Dakota and Oklahoma gave way over the past two years to a surge in construction  education and health related positions  Even in government  where belt tightening by local  state and federal agencies trimmed payrolls coming out of the recession  employment is growing again 
U S  non farm jobs growth has held at an average of 190 000 per month during the recovery  That s faster than anticipated and strong enough to both accommodate new entrants to the labor force and bring sidelined workers back into jobs 
There have been concerns that many of the jobs being created were at the low end of the wage spectrum  in restaurants  hotels and retail stores  But more recent analysis of occupation and wage trends by Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  showed that over the past two years in particular job gains have been strongest in higher paying positions 
For a graph showing the composition of U S  jobs growth in the past few years  see 
In its most recent Beige Book release of anecdotal economic information  Fed officials noted that former oilfield workers were shifting into jobs as auto mechanics  while construction and petrochemical companies had shortages in fields considered complementary to the skills of frontline oil and gas workers 
 It s easier to place a welder right now than someone with a four year degree   said Jim Hanna  a vice president for human resources and industrial relations with Fluor   N FLR  the engineering and construction giant working on the Chevron project in Baytown 
Fluor s workforce at the Chevron site is already up to 3 000  with 600 more to be hired over the summer 
FEWER BMWS
In the Houston metropolitan area  which compared to the rest of Texas has traditionally been most dependent on the energy sector  the oil crash did not prevent a net gain of 23 000 jobs last year  That was well short of the above average 100 000 positions that the city had been adding in recent years as oil production surged  said Patrick Jankowski  vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership  But it is also more in line with the city s long run average and likely more sustainable 
While there may be some impact on wages from the loss of higher paying positions for geologists and engineers  said Jankowski  some of the skilled construction trade and health jobs that will replace them also pay above average 
Fluor s Hanna said it was typical for construction workers to put in 50 hour weeks or more  with annual wages running upwards of  100 000

126402,347917,FLR,Intelligence gaps may have helped Afghan Taliban breach NATO fortress,news,"By Mirwais Harooni and Qiamuddin Shams BAGRAM  Afghanistan  Reuters    In the year before Qari Naib blew himself up on Nov  12 inside a NATO base near Kabul killing four Americans  Afghan intelligence warned the U S  military at least twice that a worker could be planning an attack  government and security officials said  The Afghan officials also said they repeatedly asked Western forces to share information about local employees at the vast Bagram air base in order to check for  suspicious people among them   but were refused  When asked about the information sharing  NATO spokesman Captain William Salvin said NATO forces  routinely partner with ANDSF  Afghan National Defence and Security Forces  on all elements of security  to include information sharing   We maintain a strong  day to day working relationship with our Afghan counterparts but due to operational security we do not get into specifics about what is shared   According to Afghan authorities  the U S  military was cooperating closely now   After this attack  American forces have agreed to share that information about their Afghan workers with us   said Wahid Sediqqi  the governor s spokesman for Parwan province where the sprawling  heavily fortified base is located  Authorities subsequently discovered that Naib  a known Taliban militant before undergoing a government de radicalization program  was using a fake name  Qari Enayat  at work  Many intelligence leads turn out to be false and it is not clear whether better coordination would have unearthed Naib s true intentions in time to prevent him killing two U S  soldiers and two contractors and wounding at least 15 others  in one of the worst assaults on U S  forces for years  But the first attack inside one of NATO s most secure bases has raised questions about Western forces  screening of local workers and about program designed to reintegrate insurgents into society  The insider attack has also further complicated operations in a country where the Afghan Taliban  al Qaeda and  more recently  a local offshoot of Islamic State  are inflicting heavy casualties and making more territory unsafe  Since the Bagram attack  the base has been in near lockdown  with few Afghan workers now permitted inside  Only 200 of an estimated 3 000 Afghans are believed to be allowed to return to work for now  police in Bagram said  SUCCESS STORY Until Nov  12  Naib would have been seen as a success story for Afghanistan  which has tried to turn militants away from the stubborn insurgency that is bent on toppling the government and ridding the country of foreign troops   He was a former Taliban     working inside the base for a long time  gained their trust  and based on that trust he carried out this attack   said Sediqqi  In early 2012  after signing up for the reintegration program  Naib enrolled in a nine month course at the Korean Vocational Training Center inside Bagram base  learning English  computer skills and how to fix cars  Like most students at the center  Naib was offered a job straight away  After going through security checks  including finger prints and biometrics to make sure he was not involved in past crimes  Naib started working for Texas based  Fluor Corp   N FLR  as a car mechanic at the base  members of his family told Reuters on a recent visit to his modest home a short walk from the base  Fluor Corp  said he was hired by one of its subcontractors   Fluor does not directly employ Afghans at Bagram   the company said   Furthermore  screening and vetting of employees follows a process prescribed by the U S  government  We follow this process and require our subcontractors to do the same   Naib  who was in his mid 20s  worked the night shift from 5 p m  to 6 a m   originally earning around 20 000 afghanis   300  a month  In March  he received a pay rise bringing his monthly salary to 30 000  his mother  Gulalai  said  According to his family  his supervisor was  very happy  with Naib and trusted him  giving him food and drinks to take home to his parents and four siblings  whom he alone supported  On Nov  11  the evening before the attack  Naib left the house for work at 4 p m  as usual  and  a loud explosion  was heard the next morning  Gulalai recalled  speaking in her dead son s room  She also urged authorities to release his body so that he could be buried  U S  and NATO officials are investigating how Naib was able to breach the base s rings of security  which include numerous checkpoints and body scanners  Afghan police have detained Naib s father and a cousin as part of their investigation into the attack  PREVIOUS SUSPECT The Afghan Taliban claimed responsibility soon after the bombing  saying the assailant was one of their fighters and that they had been planning it for four months  A spokesman declined to discuss Naib s case further  It is not known why or when the soft spoken mechanic rejoined the Taliban  or if he ever really left  Bagram base  protected by concrete barriers and barbed wire fences and home to around 14 000 coalition soldiers and contractors  has come under attack before  mainly from rockets launched by militants outside  but never from within  Five years ago  Naib had been a suspect in one of those rocket attacks  Afghan security officials said  forcing him to go into hiding for days to avoid arrest  But the authorities never found any evidence linking him to the crime  and his mother said he was innocent   My son was an angel at heart  He was not guilty at all   Gulalai said  To clear his name and prevent future police harassment  village elders recommended that Naib join a reintegration program that promised education and jobs  Around 11 000 militants have joined such schemes  but it is unclear how many remain peaceful  A U S  government watchdog recently said the program had not led to a  significant diminishment of the military capacity of armed opposition   The government has documented 154 participants that have returned to fighting  but officials privately say the actual number is much higher  Some Afghans remain wary of American involvement in their country  and  while opposing militant violence  see foreign troops as a part of the problem  not a solution to it   Even if he has blown himself up  he has killed and wounded Americans   said a relative of Naib  who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter  
 He has not hurt any Afghans    Additional reporting and writing by Randy Fabi  Editing by Mike Collett White ",2016-11-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/intelligence-gaps-may-have-helped-afghan-taliban-breach-nato-fortress-443396,443396
126403,347918,FLR,U S  refiners face severe labor shortage for deferred maintenance,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw  Reuters    After years of running flat out  U S  Gulf Coast refiners are lining up repairs to plants in 2017   but facing a severe labor shortage that could delay work  drive up costs and raise accident risks   Fuel producers such as Marathon Petroleum Corp  N MPC  and  Valero Energy  Corp  N VLO  have delayed routine work in the past 24 months amid high margins  Those margins collapsed this year in a global fuel supply glut  providing an incentive for refiners to undertake the shutdowns necessary for maintenance   But refiners are now competing for pipe fitters and ironworkers with a host of billion dollar energy projects  including Cheniere Energy s  A LNG  liquefied natural gas export terminals and a new petrochemical unit for  Dow Chemical   N DOW   Without undertaking the work they need  refineries run the risk of more unscheduled outages at plants  Plant shutdowns can disrupt fuel supplies and are closely tracked by oil traders because they directly affect demand for crude and supply of fuel   Putting off work definitely affects the safety of the refinery   said Ed Lee  an independent refinery safety consultant who worked at Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  for three decades   Refiners can mitigate the risks   but at a cost  by slowing output or avoiding types of crude that are difficult to process  Less said   In recent months  a spate of unexpected outages have hit refineries nationwide  taking hundreds of thousands of barrels off the market and boosting gasoline prices and margins   U S  refiners are expected to spend  1 26 billion on planned maintenance next year  up 38 percent from this year and the highest level since at least 2010  according to Industrial Information Resources  IIR   which tracks labor supply for refiners and other industrial companies  Many will struggle to execute those plans  said Anthony Salemme  a vice president at IIR   Refiners are going to have trouble finding even the lowest skilled workers  such as scaffold builders  and you can t do work at a refinery without a scaffold   Salemme said   That s going to complicate scheduling and even extend outages   FEW WORKERS  MANY PROJECTS IIR estimates that the coastal region from Brownsville  Texas to New Orleans   the largest U S  refining region   will be short roughly 37 400 craftsman needed to complete all of the planned capital projects in 2017   We are definitely feeling the labor shortages in skilled craft labor   said Paul Tooze  construction manager for the oil  gas and chemicals business at Bechtel  one of the world s largest industrial contractors  Tooze said the company spends a lot of time and money to attract and retain employees  but still has to bring in workers from other regions to complete projects  That typically requires  100 per day travel allowances that drive up project costs  Bechtel employs between 40 percent and 70 percent workers requiring daily allowances on their Gulf Coast projects  Tooze said  The shortage will be most acute in Lake Charles  Louisiana  the home to several refineries and petrochemical plants  There  South African energy firm Sasol  J SOLJ  is investing billions on a chemical project  and the call on labor for the plant is one of the reasons the area will be short more than 18 000 workers in 2017  according to IIR  Sasol raised its cost estimate on the project in August by 25 percent to  11 billion  in part due to rising labor costs   Chevron  Phillips   the joint venture between Chevron  N CVX  and Phillips 66  N PSX    is spending  6 billion on building a petrochemical units in Baytown and Old Ocean in Texas  Labor costs would drive the projects  costs up 10 percent from previous expectations  Phillips 66 President Tim Taylor said in an earnings call earlier this month  Fluor  N FLR   one of the world s largest industrial contractors  took a  154 million charge on the plant in November due to cost overruns  including labor   Earlier this year  Fluor opened a skilled craft training center in the Gulf Coast  stating that while the firm could not train its way out of the shortage  it hope to alleviate the problem  COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS Refiners are also competing for workers with a broader range of power companies  pharmaceutical firms and industrial manufacturers nationwide  which are also preparing for a spike in maintenance projects in 2017  according to IIR  In the southwest region that includes Texas  Louisiana  Oklahoma and Arkansas  IIR counted 952 planned projects among the various groups it tracks  the most since at least 2010 and a 24 percent increase from this year  A recent survey conducted by the Associated General Contractors of America found that 74 percent of Texas contractors are having trouble filling hourly craft worker positions  and a majority of them believed they would continue to struggle over the next year   More than 60 percent of the respondents said they bumped up salaries to attract more skilled craft workers   
 These shortages have the potential to undermine broader economic growth by forcing contractors to slow scheduled work or choose not to bid on projects  thereby inflating the cost of construction   said Stephen Sandherr  head of the Associated General Contractors ",2016-12-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-refiners-face-severe-labor-shortage-for-deferred-maintenance-450283,450283

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK  May 6  Reuters    An unexpectedly strong report
on U S  payrolls helped equities bounce back on Friday from
four days of losses  tempering worries that stocks could suffer
 the sharp declines seen this week in commodities 
 Stocks held strong gains for most of the session but ended
the week down more than 1 percent  Speculation that Greece
might leave the euro zone late on Friday caused stocks to trim
gains and gave investors something to worry about as the
strength of the market s rally comes into question 
 However  the S P held above key support levels  indicating
the week s retreat could set the stage for further gains in
contrast to the tumultuous declines in silver and oil markets 
  The stock market is trying to stand on its own feet   said
Nick Kalivas  senior equity index analyst at MF Global in
Chicago   Corporate news has been pretty strong  and stocks
look like they re more attractively valued than commodities  
 A massive selloff in materials and oil on Thursday forced
investors out of high risk assets  The iShares Silver Trust
suffered its worst week of outflows ever after heavy losses in
the metal 
 Stocks biggest boost came from the strong U S  April
payrolls report  according to Brian Jacobsen  chief portfolio
strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls 
Wisconsin  The data showed an increase of 244 000 jobs  the
most in 11 months  
 But stocks came off highs after German magazine Spiegel
carried a report  later denied  that Greece had raised the
possibility of leaving the euro zone  
  People s memory of the Greek crisis last year caused
liquidation that is spilling over from currency and commodity
markets into the stock market   said Kalivas 
 The three major stock indexes were up more than 1 percent
through most of the session  Despite Friday s gains  the S P
posted its largest weekly percentage drop since mid March 
 The industrial sector of the S P 500  which could benefit
from a slide in commodity prices  was the session s best
performer with a 0 77 percent advance 
 Fluor Corp  the largest publicly traded U S  engineering
company  was the top percentage gainer on the S P 500 after it
posted a small increase in quarterly profit that beat analysts 
estimates  Its shares jumped 7 9 percent to  70 87 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 54 64 points  or
0 43 percent  to 12 638 81  The Standard   Poor s 500 added
5 10 points  or 0 38 percent  to 1 340 20  The Nasdaq Composite
rose 12 84 points  or 0 46 percent  to 2 827 56 
 For the week the Dow lost 1 3 percent  the S P fell 1 7
percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1 6 percent 
 The S P 500 held above important technical levels with the
week s low just below 1 330 and Friday s close above 1 340 
  On a weekly basis this 1 330 area is a very good support
for stocks   MF Global s Kalivas said 
  If you were to work below that  it would question the
breakout we saw last week  We re in a battle zone here and next
week is going to decide the fate  of the market  he said 
 Still  the CBOE volatility index   rose 1 1 percent to
18 40  its highest closing level since March 28  The gauge rose
24 7 percent this week  its biggest weekly percentage gain in
almost a year   A rise in the VIX means investors will pay more
for protection against their equities exposure 
 Friday marked the one year anniversary of Wall Street s
 flash crash  when nearly  1 billion was wiped off U S  stocks
in a matter of minutes before the market bounced back  The
crash diminished many investors  confidence in the market 
 On Friday about 8 24 billion shares traded on the New York
Stock Exchange  NYSE Amex and Nasdaq  below last year s
estimated daily average of 8 47 billion but still above the
year s daily average so far 
 Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by
a ratio of 2 to 1  while on the Nasdaq  about three stocks rose
for every two that fell

126443,347958,FLR,U S  House Republicans push two month extension for transport projects,news,By David Lawder WASHINGTON  Reuters    Republicans in the U S  Congress  unable to reach agreement on a long term transportation funding bill in time for a May 31 deadline  on Friday introduced legislation for a two month extension to buy more negotiating time  The House of Representatives bill would extend federal spending authority on major road  bridge and rail transit construction projects through the end of July  about the time that the Highway Trust Fund is expected to be depleted  Lawmakers from both parties want a six year transport funding bill  but have made little progress on finding a way to fund the nearly half trillion dollar expected cost  There also is no consensus on how to fund the roughly  11 billion that would be required for an extension to year end  The two month extension proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster would not require offsetting savings as it uses the remaining trust fund assets   It was our preference to move an extension through the end of the year  but we will need more time to reach a bipartisan agreement on offsets   Shuster and Ryan said in a statement   This legislation will allow transportation spending to continue through July  while we work towards a next step to close the Trust Fund s shortfall   Infrastructure advocates say the extension will keep money flowing to existing projects but will not provide enough certainty for states to launch new major construction projects that would benefit engineering  materials and equipment companies such as  Fluor Corp   NYSE FLR   Vulcan Materials and  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   Major business groups  including trucking companies  advocate funding a long term surface transportation bill by raising federal fuel taxes  unchanged since 1993  Both Democrats and Republicans have dismissed such an increase as politically impossible  Many Republicans advocate using revenue captured from inducing or mandating the repatriation of some  2 trillion in profits held overseas by U S  corporations  But a  repatriation holiday  that grants companies a lower tax rate to bring funds home is viewed by some  including Ryan  to be a key part of a broader tax reform plan  complicating its use as a funding source for road and rail projects  The Highway Trust Fund  fed by fuel taxes  has been chronically underfunded for more than a decade due to higher vehicle fuel economy  lower miles driven and rising construction costs  Congress has kept it going with  52 billion in general fund transfers since 2008 ,2015-05-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-house-republicans-push-two-month-extension-for-transport-projects-342109,342109
126444,347959,FLR,Senate passes two month transportation spending patch,news,By David Lawder WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Senate early on Saturday passed a two month spending extension for federal transportation projects that puts off a decision on long term funding for road  bridge and rail transit projects until the height of the summer construction season  The unanimous voice vote sends the measure to President Barack Obama for signing into law before current transportation spending authority expires on May 31  The White House said Obama would sign the short term fix if work continues towards a long term bill  Obama has requested a six year   478 billion transportation bill  and last week said he was in talks with congressional leaders and willing to look at all revenue sources to fund it   I don t have much progress to report  unfortunately  at this point   White House spokesman Josh Earnest said of the talks about a long term plan  The two month extension resulted from lawmakers  inability to agree on funding for either a six year bill  or even a much shorter extension through the end of 2015  which would cost about  11 billion  Because it relies on the remaining money in the Highway Trust Fund  the short term extension requires no offsetting savings  representing the easiest solution for Congress before it embarked Friday on a 10 day Memorial Day break   It will avoid disruption to current construction sites  but sets up a new deadline in July  when the trust fund is due to run dry again  Fed by fuel taxes that have not changed since 1993  the fund has experienced chronic shortfalls in recent years due to rising vehicle fuel economy  fewer miles driven and construction cost inflation  Lawmakers from both parties have ruled out a fuel tax increase despite support for that from trucking and industry groups  The Obama administration has proposed capturing revenue by requiring U S  corporations to bring home some  2 trillion profits held overseas at a lower  14 percent tax rate  But some Republicans  including House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan  have said this would require a broader tax reform plan  State transport officials and many lawmakers contend that a series of short term funding patches may keep existing work going  but they do not provide enough long term funding certainty to launch major new projects  That may cloud the demand outlook for major construction materials  equipment and engineering suppliers such as  Lafarge   PARIS LAFP  SA  Deere   Co  and  Fluor Corp   NYSE FLR  ,2015-05-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/senate-passes-two-month-transportation-spending-patch-343222,343222
126455,347970,FLR,After Last Week s Stock Market Drop  Expect A Bounce Before More Pain ,opinion,"Stocks dropped last week after the Fed and the President each surprised investors  as I pointed out in the latest Market Week show  As a result  the S P 500 sank 94 points last week to 2932  a decline of 3 1   
While Fed Chair Jerome Powell cut interest rates by a quarter point  he also quashed hopes for further cuts when he explained   We re thinking of it essentially as a midcycle adjustment   rather than the  beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle   
On the next day  President Trump announced new import tariffs via Twitter   The US will start  on September 1st  putting a small additional Tariff of 10  on the remaining 300 Billion Dollars of goods and products coming from China into our Country   
These factors caught investors leaning too bullishly in the stock market  and as such  strong selling ensued

Let s also take a look at Fluor Corporation  NYSE FLR   which lost nearly a quarter of its value after reporting a loss per share of   3 96 and total revenue of  4 1 billion  compared to analyst estimates of  0 50 and  4 7 billion  CEO Carlos Hernandez explained that the company started   a comprehensive operational and strategic review

close In the last reported quarter  the company s adjusted earnings and revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23 8  and 2   respectively  However  its bottom line decreased 25 7  from the year ago figure of 35 cents  owing to foreign currency headwinds and incremental G A expenses related to Datawatch transaction audit and SOX implementation costs Nonetheless  the company has an impressive earnings surprise history  Altair topped the consensus estimate in five of the trailing six quarters  with an average positive surprise of 64  Which Way are Estimates Trending Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release Altair Engineering Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 8 cents in the quarter to be reported has remained stable over the past 60 days  The estimated figure indicates an increase of 60  from the year ago earnings of 5 cents per share  Moreover  revenues are expected to be  108 million  suggesting a 13  year over year improvement Factors to ConsiderIn the second quarter  Altair is likely to benefit from ongoing momentum in software related services and inorganic moves  The company has been gaining from optimization of product design  positive trends in its primary end market  automotive  and operational efficiency  These factors are anticipated to have aided Altair in the to be reported quarter as well Contract wins in new and existing accounts across broad geographies and industries also add to the positives For the second quarter  the company expects total revenues in the range of  106  108 million  compared with  95 6 million reported a year ago  and non GAAP revenues within  108 2  110 2 million  Particularly  Software Product revenues  which accounted for 81  of total first quarter revenues  are projected between  83 million and  85 million  up from  72 8 million generated in prior year period  Non GAAP Software Product revenues are likely to be within  85 2  87 2 million The company s recent acquisitions of Datawatch  SIMSOLID and FluiDyna GmbH  as well as focus on R D to optimize product design are likely to add to the positives Notably  it expects non GAAP net income within  5 6  7 6 million  indicating an improvement from  3 9 million reported a year ago However  the company s margins are likely to be negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency headwinds and incremental G A  The company has been incurring heavy R D expenses owing to investment in new product designs  This is ultimately hurting its profitability  The same is expected to remain a headwind in the quarter to be reported  Although its operational efficiency bodes well  concerns surrounding the bottom line exist  The company projects adjusted EBITDA to be in the band of  3 8  5 8 million  compared with  7 3 million reported in comparable prior year period Also  its revenues are seasonal  based on renewal dates from customers  Generally  the first and fourth quarters have typically greater renewals and expansion revenues than the second and third quarters  The company expects these headwinds to impact results in the to be reported quarter What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model shows that Altair is likely to beat estimates in the to be reported quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most

by 59 3  Revenues during the quarter totaled  4 09 billion  lagging the consensus mark of  4 56 billion by 10 2  and declining 16 2  year over year  The downside was mainly caused by lower

segment s revenues decreased 30 6  year over year to  1 397 1 million  During the quarter  the segment s loss came in at  229 1 million against a profit of  97 2 million a year ago  Loss margin was 16 4  versus profit margin of 4 8  registered in the prior year The tepid performance was due to pre tax charges related to late design changes  schedule driven cost increase  client and subcontractor negotiations on two fixed price downstream projects and scope reductions on a large upstream project  Results in the quarter were also impacted by pre contract costs related to its continued evaluation of the probability of receiving an award and the removal of embedded foreign currency derivatives  New awards came in at  732 million  up from  493 million in the comparable period of 2018

up 12 9  on a year over year basis  The segment s loss margin was 8 1  during the quarter against a profit margin of 3 1  a year ago  owing to agreements in principle associated with client disputes on three gas fired power projects and forecast revisions on several fixed price infrastructure projects  The segment booked new awards worth  510 million  significantly lower than  3 629 million a year ago  Backlog at the end of the quarter amounted to  13 5 billion compared with  12 4 billion a year ago Government segment reported revenues of  612 million  which declined 29 5  year over year  Loss margin from the segment came in at 36 9   significantly up from the year ago profit margin of 3 1   primarily due to cost revisions for late engineering changes  rising costs and ongoing

126476,347991,FLR,Post FOMC Hangover,opinion,"Markets may have a post FOMC hangover  The Fed stuck to the patient script but inflation optimism took rate cut bets in the short term off the table  The dollar has little to show this morning  while stocks are pointing to a mixed open 
US Data   Labor market remains robust
FOMC   Still patient  adds transitory factors at work
BOE   More than one hike needed for inflation target
Stocks   S P 500 slight rebound after biggest selloff in 5 weeks
Oil   Lower on stockpiles surge and Maduro still controls military
Gold   Dovish induced Fed rally may stall
US Data
Jobless Claims came in higher than expected but that may be attributed to the Easter holiday and spring break  Data around those dates are typically volatile and do not raise any alarm that the labor market is losing momentum  Yesterday s ADP employment report surprise of 275 000 new jobs showed the slow start of the year did not impact hiring  Expectations are for tomorrow s nonfarm payroll report to see a gain of 190 000 jobs  the range is 120 000 to 250 000 jobs 
The nonfarm productivity reading for the first quarter grew at the fastest pace since 2014  The unit labor costs also declined 0 9   down from the revised higher prior of 2 5   Increases productivity could mean the economy can grow further without triggering a surge with inflation 
FOMC
The Fed is likely to remain patient throughout the summer and contrary to what Fed Fund futures are saying  they see transitory factors at work on inflation and that it will pick up later in the year  Short term interest rate futures fell after yesterday s meeting and they now see a 29  chance of a cut at the September and a coin flip for the December meeting 
The financial services and apparel prices have kept Core PCE lower and those are the transitory factors Powell are most likely what Powell was referencing  Inflation will be closely watched and even if we see another weak reading next Friday  we may not see too much of jump on rate cut bets 

BOE
The British pound whipsawed after the BOE was nowhere as hawkish as market participants expected  The Bank kept rates steady in a unanimous vote  but many were expecting Saunders to dissent  Cable spiked higher on the headline that the BOE signals more than one hike needed to keep inflation in check  The BOE quarterly inflation report  QIR  saw cuts to the inflation outlook and raises to the growth forecasts  Expectations now see a 65  chance for a hike at the November meeting 

Stocks
Earnings results are still coming with roughly 70  of the S P 500 companies already reporting  This morning we saw results from Fluor  NYSE FLR  and Cigna  NYSE CI   Fluor reported poor results as revenue came well below expectations and their CEO stepped down  Healthcare giant  Cigna reported roughly in line EPS and raised their forecast 
Much of Wall Street remains optimistic in the short term  JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in a note advised their clients not to bail on the market  RBC thinks the S P 500 could overshoot 2950 in the short term  While Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  thinks a rally to 3 000 would trigger a sell signal  Canacord Genuity thinks we could see near term losses capped at 5  

Oil
Crude prices continue to selloff as expectations grow for OPEC   to abandon to their production cut pledge  The first half of the week saw oil lower mainly on the rising stockpiles from the US  The US government data saw inventories jump to almost 10 million barrels last week  almost four times what analysts were expecting  Reportedly Saudi Aramco received a request from Asian buyers for additional oil supplies in June and July  It is unclear if this on top of what was needed to makeup for the shortfall from the lifting of waivers on Iranian sanctions 
It appears the Venezuelan story is slowly making its way to the back pages  The immediate tension seems to have been alleviated  but that story will not be going away anytime soon  Venezuela  which holds the world s biggest crude reserves is likely to see continued protests that are led by opposition leader Juan Guaido 

Gold
The precious metal continues to weaken post FOMC and is dangerously approaching support levels that may not be able to withstand the optimism that will come from a trade deal between China and the US  While central banks have ramped up purchases at the fastest pace in six years  that may not be enough of a catalyst if we continue to see stronger data out of Europe and a trade induced rebound

126484,347999,FLR,Earnings Preview  Fluor  FLR  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Fluor  FLR  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This engineering  construction and operations company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 52 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  35 8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 56 billion  down 6 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7 39  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fluor 
For Fluor  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 91  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fluor will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Fluor would post earnings of  0 54 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 14  delivering a surprise of  125 93  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Fluor doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-fluor-flr-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200444840,200444840
126485,348000,FLR,Fluor  FLR  Misses Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Fluor  FLR  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 33 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 52 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 81 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  36 54   A quarter ago  it was expected that this engineering  construction and operations company would post earnings of  0 54 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 14  delivering a surprise of  125 93  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Fluor  which belongs to the Zacks Engineering   R and D Services industry  posted revenues of  4 09 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 22   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 88 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Fluor shares have added about 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 9  
What s Next for Fluor 
While Fluor has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Fluor was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

126513,348028,FLR,Is Fluor Corporation  FLR  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Fluor Corporation   NYSE FLR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Fluor Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 58  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 17  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Fluor Corporation s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 14 91  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Engineering   R and D Services industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 39  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Fluor Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 29  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Fluor Corporation s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Fluor Corporation has a P S ratio of about 0 29  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 31 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Fluor Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes FLR a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Fluor Corporation is just 0 86  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 41  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  FLR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Fluor Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of F  This gives FLR a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen two estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and three downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 16 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has fallen 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Fluor Corporation Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineFluor Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 36  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to

126515,348030,FLR,Fluor  FLR  Reports Q1 Loss  Lags Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Fluor  FLR  came out with a quarterly loss of  0 14 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 54  This compares to earnings of  0 56 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  125 93   A quarter ago  it was expected that this engineering  construction and operations company would post earnings of  0 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 77  delivering a surprise of 26 23  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Fluor  which belongs to the Zacks Engineering   R and D Services industry  posted revenues of  4 19 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 82   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 82 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Fluor shares have added about 21 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 6  
What s Next for Fluor 
While Fluor has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Fluor was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

The significant increase in backlog stemmed from a whopping new awards count  which is expected to generate higher revenues for the company in the future  Also  Fluor s total new awards recorded an increase of 152 3  in the third quarter  courtesy of improvements in energy and commodity markets  as well as achievements in infrastructure and government business Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderCurrently  Flour carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the  sector are Great Lakes Dredge   Dock Corp    NASDAQ GLDD    Altair Engineering Inc    NASDAQ ALTR   and EMCOR Group  Inc    NYSE EME    While Great Lakes currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Altair Engineering and EMCOR both carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Great Lakes  Altair Engineering and EMCOR s 2018 earnings are expected to increase 111   23 1  and 20   respectively The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2018-12-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fluor-flr-to-transform-red--purple-rail-lines-in-chicago-200367980,200367980
126547,348062,FLR,Analysts Estimate Fluor  FLR  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Fluor  FLR  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 21  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise

This engineering  construction and operations company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 61 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 9  
Revenues are expected to be  4 83 billion  down 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fluor 
For Fluor  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fluor will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Fluor would post earnings of  0 58 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 55  delivering a surprise of  5 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Fluor doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-fluor-flr-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200388220,200388220

126651,348166,FLR,Construction Spending Remains Low  Will It Impact Q1 ,opinion,Spending on construction projects in the United States inched up marginally in February from the previous month  after a flat January  Does this mean that though the economy is improving  it is failing to provide an impetus toward spending on the construction of highways  schools  hospitals or homes Incidentally  U S  stocks suffered heavy losses on Monday  following new Chinese tariffs on U S  goods and the growing difficulties among the domestic technology companies  The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1 9   and the S P 500 index and Nasdaq sank 2 2  and 2 7   each  The volatility mainly stemmed from investors  fear related to the impact of an intensifying trade war between the United States and China  Per Bloomberg  the S P 500 s fall of 2 2  is the widest decline to begin April 2018 since 1929 Drab February Construction Spending In February 2018  construction spending improved 0 1   falling shy of market expectations  The figure came in at  1 27 trillion  seasonally adjusted   logging an annual growth rate of 3  but depicting month over month increase of just 0 1   as revealed by the Commerce Department on Monday  The solid labor market along with robust consumer confidence has supported an increase in non residential  lodging and office  construction  However  spending on highways suffered a decline Spending on public construction projects tumbled 2 1  last month  marking the widest decline since June 2017 and almost reversing January s 2 3  rise  Under the public construction umbrella  educational construction was measured at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  74 6 billion  0 5  down from the prior month  Highway construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  88 5 billion  0 2  down on a monthly basis and 5 1  year over year Meanwhile  private outlays grew 0 7  in February  with spending up 0 1  for residential projects and 1 5  for non residential projects  Of the total private outlay  residential construction inched up 0 1  from January  On the other hand  the non residential construction for February was up 1 5   suggesting stronger growth in real investment in non residential structures in Q1 Again  private spending on health care facilities dropped 2 2  in February from the preceding month  Spending on the power grid rose 0 9  on a monthly basis but dropped 8 5  year over year  On the positive note  spending on manufacturing jumped 1 2  last month after months of annual declines  However  it plunged 5 6  from February 2017 Homebuilding Remains StrongAlthough public sector outlay took a downturn in February  residential construction was up 0 1  and especially new single family construction grew 0 9  on a monthly basis  Compared to February 2017  new single family construction increased 9 5  Apart from concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve  homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage  limited land availability  higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment  These are restricting homebuilders from responding to growing demand The implications of the metal tariffs and mortgage hike are yet to be felt in the sector that has been in the top 25   4 out of 16 sectors  of the Zacks Industry Rank since last week  which hints at further growth  Currently  top performing construction stocks  i e  stocks sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   which are cashing in on positive fundamentals include Boise Cascade Company   NYSE BCC    Beazer Homes USA  Inc    NYSE BZH    EMCOR Group  Inc    NYSE EME    Fluor Corporation   NYSE FLR    Kb Home   NYSE KBH    Louisiana Pacific Corporation   NYSE LPX   and Advanced Drainage Systems  Inc    NYSE WMS    You can see  Modest Spending   Slow Factory Activity to Play Spoilsport February s marginal growth in construction spending might mar first quarter GDP growth estimates  which tends to remain weak owing to seasonality Meanwhile  the index of national factory activity fell to 59 3 in March from a 14 year high of 60 8 in February The slowdown in the monthly manufacturing reading was partly due to lower job growth in the manufacturing sector  Evidently  the employment index slipped to 57 3 in March from 59 7 in February  The new orders index also slid to 61 9 in the month from 64 2 in February  while the production index dipped to 61 from 62 Prices paid rose 3 9 points to 78 1  the highest since April 2011  The survey pointed out rising commodity prices across industry sectors  particularly in metals  corrugates  and parts made from plastics  Electronics manufacturers are also suffering from component shortages Before becoming bearish  investors should note that 17 out of the total 18 industries  including fabricated metal products  computer and electronic products  machinery and chemical products  witnessed growth last month  Apparel  leather and allied products was the only industry that suffered a decline Notably  though the figures in March suffered a decline  any reading above 50 indicates growth in the manufacturing sector  Although domestic manufacturers still remained strong in March  several executives have raised concerns about bottlenecks getting supplies or transporting their goods to customers  according to the latest survey by ISM  They are also worried of the recent tariffs on steel and Chinese goods whose long term implications still remain uncertain Despite the skepticism stemming from the impact of tariff and the subsequent trade war  executives showed faith on global demand that can spur growth Atlanta Fed Raises Q1 GDP Growth ForecastMeanwhile following the latest release of construction spending data by the U S  Census Bureau and the manufacturing ISM report  the Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow forecast model expects the economy to grow at a 2 8  annualized rate in the first quarter compared with the Mar 29 prediction of 2 4  The upbeat outlook mainly reflects improved forecasts for real consumer spending and private fixed investment growth that increased to 1 6  and 5 6  from 1 3  and 3 9   respectively What s Ahead Although shortage of components and labor have started to create production and shipping delays  the growth forecast and pricing pressure suggest that demand for U S  manufactured goods remains strong  However  concerns remain regarding the imposition of tariffs by the U S  administration on steel and aluminum along with aerospace  information and communication and machinery imported from China  These tariffs could deal a blow to business confidence both domestically and abroad  Nevertheless  the tax reform and fiscal stimulus are expected to boost the economy The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-04-02,Zacks Investment

Momentum Trader   That recent volatility spike is set to fade away and be forgotten  A string of victories coming out of the hole have put the market back on a very bullish trajectory  It s not just the number of days in the green but the size of the moves that are so significant and calming  Several trading days after coming down to put the 200 day into play  the market is now beginning to test the top end of the trading range all over again 

 Among all the major market indexes  the NASDAQ Composite has had the most linear bounce back from the recent market lows  Not only has the bounce been pretty dramatic  but it s been a textbook move in cooperation with the Commodity Channel Index  When I m looking for a CCI Buy I want to see the index dip below  100 then cross back up through the zero line to get the buy  Sometimes you can jump the signal by buying the cross back over the  100 line but that signal is weaker than the cross over the zero line 

 You can see the crossing of the zero line around Valentine s Day  At the same time  the market stalled out that day  If you re playing a signal like that  it makes you very nervous because if that CCI were to reverse at that zero line it s  Look out below   Luckily  the NASDAQ Composite kept on going after spending a few days moving sideways  Note how as the market chopped sideways the 50 day moving average stayed below the market  That sort of bullish support was a key in pushing this thing higher     Dave Bartosiak  who is also head of Surprise Trader

126682,348197,FLR,Mortgage Rates Hit 4 Year High  Will It Foil Housing ,opinion,The uptrend in mortgage rates continued for the ninth straight week during the week ended Mar 8  According to Freddie Mac s latest Primary Mortgage Market Survey  the 30 year rate rose 3 basis points to 4 46   marking the highest point since 2014  The result was greater affordability pressure at the start of the traditional spring home buying season  In the year ago period  it averaged 4 21  Meanwhile  total mortgage application volume remained essentially flat last week  up just 0 3  on a seasonally adjusted basis  according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association  MBA   Volume was 5  lower than the same week  a year ago Mortgage applications for buying a home  which are rate sensitive  did not move much with the start of usually busy spring market  This was perhaps due to market concerns over President Donald Trump s trade tariffs Tariff of 25  and 10  on imported steel and aluminum  respectively  were pronounced by Trump yesterday  as promised  These followed Trump s first tariff between 3  and 24  on five Canadian lumber companies  in April 2017  The tariffs were in response to Canada s restrictions on the import of U S  dairy products  Lumber prices have gained since then and now homebuilders are expecting higher steel costs Will Affordability Take a Toll on Housing Construction accounted for 43  of all steel shipments in the United States  according to the American Iron and Steel Institute  The tariffs  and the much expected rise in the price of raw materials  come at a time when the country faces an acute affordable housing shortage Inventory constraints are already pushing prices higher  thereby affecting affordability  The affordability index for first time buyers fell to 103 8 in 2017 from 110 1 in 2016  as per the latest report from National Association of Realtor  Pending home sales fell 4 7  to 104 6 in January  per the latest report from National Association of Realtors or NAR  Investors should note that NAR s index of pending home sales tracks real estate transactions in which a contract has been signed  but the transaction hasn t closed Limited supply of homes for sale has been the biggest issue facing the market and the problem will continue  particularly at the entry level market  Total housing inventory at January end for existing homes available for sale is still 9 5  lower than a year ago and has fallen year over year for 32 consecutive months Limited land availability is driving prices higher  as median sales price of a new home jumped 2 4  year over year last month  The median house price increased 5 8  for existing homes from a year ago and marked the 71st consecutive month of year on year price gain  This has to some extent restricted first time buyers to enter the market as they comprised 29  of sales in January  down from 32  in December 2017 and 33  a year ago Apart from supply constraints  higher mortgage rates appear to be weighing on home sales  since buyers are facing higher borrowing costs  Sales of newly constructed homes  accounting for roughly 10  of all U S  home sales  fell 7 8  in January from the prior month and 1  from the year ago period to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593 000 units  as per the latest report from the Commerce Department  Notably  January s figure is the lowest since August 2017 Additionally  higher mortgage rates are expected to pose serious threats to the construction industry  with higher expected input costs at a time when political pundits are seriously considering a national infrastructure revamp  Earlier this year  President Trump unveiled a massive  1 5 trillion plan to modernize America s infrastructure  The plan incorporates  200 billion in federal funding to promote state  local and private investments and maximize the value of every taxpayer dollar Indeed  President Trump s plan to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts  deregulation and higher infrastructure spending bodes well for the construction sector  But a potential lineup of interest rate hikes  growing labor shortage  limited land availability  higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are significant headwinds Construction Sector s StandThe implications of the metal tariffs and mortgage hike are yet to be felt in a sector that has been in the top spot since last week  Currently  top performing construction stocks  i e  stocks sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   which are cashing in

uncertainty for builders The National Association of Home Builders or NAHB Wells Fargo Housing Market Index  HMI   which measures confidence in the market for new single family home  dropped to 64 this month  from a downwardly revised 67 in August Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Louisiana in late August  and Irma lashed Florida in early September  Economists are of the opinion that shortage of skilled construction labor is expected to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive construction costs higher causing delays  The construction sector

126739,348254,FLR,Fluor  FLR  Beats Q3 Earnings Estimates  Tightens  17 View,opinion,Fluor Corporation s   NYSE FLR   third quarter 2017 earnings came in at 67 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents by 15 5   The figures also reflected a massive increase from the prior year quarter s earnings of a meager 3 cents  Top line expansion and improved margins drove the bottom line growth Inside the HeadlinesThe company s third quarter revenues came in at  4 941 6 million  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 793 million by 3 1  and moving up 3 7  year over year  Three of the company s segments recorded revenue growth  which was somewhat offset by decline in the Diversified Services segment Growth was primarily driven by the Energy  Chemicals   Mining segment  led by the mining and metals business line as we start to execute on recent awards Revenues from the Energy  Chemicals and Mining segment rose 3 8  year over year to  2 412 8 million backed by increased project execution activities for certain downstream  and mining and metal projects Industrial  Infrastructure and Powersegment s revenues inched up 0 9  year over year to  1 138 8 million  Sales at this segment largely benefited from increased project execution activities for several life sciences and advanced manufacturing projects  which was offset to a large extent by lower levels of project execution for certain power and infrastructure projects Revenues at the Government segment were up 12 4  year over year to  766 million  on the back of higher project execution activities for several large multi year decommissioning and cleanup projects Diversified Services revenues were down 1 3  to  624 million on a year over year basis  Revenue growth from the equipment business in North America was more than offset by declines resulting from the completion of certain large Stork projects in Australia For the reported quarter  Fluor s new awards plummeted 45 6  to  3 8 billion on a year over year basis  Orders at the Industrial  Infrastructure and Power segment were  628 million  while orders in the government business came in at  234 million Orders at the Energy  Chemicals and Mining segment totaled  2 623 million  including a copper project in Chile  and several petrochemical projects in Malaysia  the Philippines and the United States  Orders at the Diversified Services segment grossed  338 million  including new contracts to provide operation support services in Colombia  and asset integrity services in the North Sea Consolidated backlog at the end of the third quarter was  32 9 billion  down from  44 3 billion recorded in the year ago quarter  The backlog erosion is attributable to exclusion of two large reimbursable nuclear projects Fluor Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Liquidity   Shares RepurchasesAs of Sep 30  2017  Fluor had cash and marketable securities  including non current  of  2 135 7 million  up from  2 105 million as on Dec 31  2016  Long term debt at the end of third quarter 2017 rose to  1 581 million from  1 517 9 million as of Dec 31  2016 2017 Guidance Concurrent with the third quarter results  the company tightened its 2017 guidance and now projects earnings per share in the range of  1 50  1 60 compared with the previous range of  1 40  1 70 Our TakeAfter a downbeat second quarter  Fluor seems to have turned around with decent top  and bottom line beats  However  low capital spending  intermediate softness in key end markets and continuous erosion in the backlog levels are also pressing issues for the company Going forward  we expect the company s margins to suffer  as it transitions from higher margin engineering to lower margin construction activities  Slow backlog conversion is a persistent problem in this sector  Hence  slow burn on some projects is likely to hinder this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company s growth Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the broader construction sector include NVR  Inc    NYSE NVR    Toll Brothers Inc    NYSE TOL   and KB Home   NYSE KBH    While NVR sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Toll Brothers and KB Home carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

Westinghouse Revenues at the Government segment were up 13 1  year over year to  744 2 million  on the back of higher project execution activities for the Idaho Cleanup Project Core Contract   Idaho Core Project   and construction services projects Diversified Services revenues were down 9 9  to  641 4 million on a year over year basis  Completion of large Stork projects in Australia and delays in the seasonal upturn in European markets weighed down on the top line performance of this segment For the reported quarter  Fluor s new awards were down 50 3  to  3 2 billion on a year over year basis  Orders at the Industrial  Infrastructure and Power segment were  672 million  including the Southern Gateway highway project in Texas  The orders in the government business came in at  1 109 million  including task orders for LOGCAP IV in Afghanistan  additional funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Idaho Cleanup Project Core Contract Orders at the Energy  Chemicals and Mining segment totaled  860 million  Orders at the Diversified Services segment grossed  554 million Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter was  37 6 billion  down from  47 3 billion in the year ago quarter  The backlog erosion is attributable to adjustment for a liquefied natural gas project in Canada  cancellation of a nuclear power plant project for Westinghouse and adjustment made to limit the contractual term of the Magnox nuclear decommissioning project Fluor Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Liquidity   Shares RepurchasesAs of Jun 30  2017  Fluor had cash and marketable securities  including non current  of  2 144 9 million  up from  2 105 0 million as on Dec 31  2016  Long term debt at the end of second quarter 2017 rose to  1 560 5 million from  1 517 9 million as on Dec 31  2016 2017 Guidance CutConcurrent with the second quarter 2017 results  the company slashed its 2017 guidance for the second time in a row  The company currently projects earnings per share in the range of  1 40  1 70 compared with the previous range of  2 25  2 75 The downward guidance revision is mainly attributable to charges incurred in the Industrial  Infrastructure   Power segment and the winding down of the V C  Summer Nuclear Station project  In addition  slowdown of the pace of new awards and a waning revenue trajectory adds to the company s grim sentiment  This apart  volatility in commodity prices is likely to play spoilsport Our TakeFluor s second quarter results mainly took a beating on account of the pre tax project expenses  Despite the company s second quarter earnings beat  precipitous decline in sales and two back to back guidance cuts signals tough times ahead  An unimpressive revenue trajectory is a major risk for the company  Relatively fewer award opportunities in industrial and infrastructure pose a threat to the company s growth prospects  Also  low capital spending  intermediate softness in key end markets and continuous erosion in the backlog levels are also pressing issues for the company  Going forward  we expect the company s margins to suffer  as it transitions from higher margin engineering to lower margin construction activities  Slow backlog conversion is a persistent problem in this sector  Hence  slow burn on some projects is likely to hinder this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company s growth Stocks to ConsiderSome

126791,348306,FLR,Fluor  FLR  Tops Q3 Earnings  Lags Revenues  Guides Down,opinion,After three consecutive earnings misses  multinational engineering and construction firm   Fluor Corporation   NYSE FLR     managed to crush estimates in its third quarter 2016 results  The company s adjusted earnings from continuing operations came in at  1 13 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents by almost 30  However  the figure fared worse in year over year comparison  having fallen 6 6  from the prior year tally of  1 21 per share  A significant increase in cost of revenue and interest expense during the quarter proved to be a drag on the bottom line Inside the HeadlinesThird quarter revenues came in at  4 766 9 million  up an impressive 8 6  year over year  However  it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 986 million  Excellent revenue gains from Industrial  Infrastructure   Power and Maintenance  Modification   Asset Integrity segments more than offset the revenue decline in the Energy  Chemicals   Mining segment  thus resulting in sturdy top line performance Revenues from the Energy  Chemicals   Mining segment continued to be down  falling 17 0  year over year to  2 325 2 million  Softness in mining activities proved to be an overhang Industrial  Infrastructure   Power segment s revenues posted another sound quarter  with revenues soaring 89 3  year over year to  1 128 3 million  Sales of this segment largely benefited from solid execution activities on nuclear and gas fired power projects Revenues at the Government segment were up 3 1  year over year to  681 2 million  mainly on account of profitable project wins and execution Maintenance  Modification   AssetIntegrity revenues almost doubled  up 93 8   to  632 2 million  on a year over year basis  This segment largely benefited from the Stork buyout that boosted sales at the Global Services unit  However  this was partially offset by softness in the equipment and power services business lines For the reported quarter  Fluor s new awards were up 32 1  to  7 0 million on a year over year basis  Orders at the Industrial  Infrastructure   Power segment were  5 5 billion  The orders in the government business came in at  955 million  benefiting from additional funding on the Savannah River project Orders in the Energy  Chemicals   Mining segment totaled  5 6 billion  including an award for the Tengiz Oil Expansion Project in Kazakhstan  Also  Maintenance  Modification   Asset Integrity segment recorded awards totaling  350 million  which include operations and maintenance work in the U S   Australia and the U K Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter was  44 3 billion  up from  41 7 billion in the year ago quarter  The percentage of fixed price

in the Energy  Chemicals and Mining segment  Fluor has revised its full year 2016 guidance downward  Currently  the company projects earnings per share for 2016 in the range of  2 20  2 40  compared with the earlier guided range of  3 25  3 50 per share  The downcast outlook is largely attributable to formidable challenges in the commodity business lines For full year 2017  the company projects earnings per share to be in the range of  2 75  3 25  T he company believes that most of its opportunities in Infrastructure  Industrial and Government segments will continue to be offset by weak commodity business FLUOR CORP NEW Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    To ConcludeThough Fluor s robust earnings beat during the quarter under review is surely a positive  formidable headwinds continue to play spoilsport resulting in both year over year top  and bottom line declines  Additionally  the 2016 guidance cut will leave investors sulking Fluor s tepid financial performance over the past few quarters is largely attributable to the volatile commodity prices  which have been hurting companies operating in the energy domain  particularly the oil and gas sector Precipitous decline in the prices of crude oil and certain metals have impacted the ability of Fluor s clients to fund new projects  This has affected the company s profitability  Prevailing softness in the mining and metals business continues to dampen lucrative commercial opportunities for the company  We also believe that deferrals in investment decisions by major clients will act as major headwinds

And by authorizing the project  he s creating a number of lucrative opportunities for investors  Let s look at why and how you can profit from the construction of the Trump Wall 
How the Trump Wall Is Being Built
Last Wednesday  the president signed his first executive order  That order enabled construction of the border wall and outlined the federal government s strategy for targeting sanctuary cities 
The wall would run along the nearly 2 000 mile border with Mexico  Other than that  there aren t many specifics available yet about what the project would entail 
For one thing  we re still not sure whether the Wall will be a full fledged rampart or a system of fences  According to government estimates  it would cost about  6 5 million per mile for a single fence  or about  11 million per mile to build a more robust wall  That puts the final price tag on the project somewhere between  10 billion and  20 billion 
Both are big numbers  And whether we re building a wall or a fence  it ll still be a huge undertaking for America s construction industry  Therein lies the perfect investment play on the Trump Wall 
How To Invest
To put it in perspective  the U S  Mexico border is longer than the distance between Moscow and Paris  Building  6 5 million worth of wall on every mile of that stretch will be one of the largest construction projects in history  And it will require a lot of construction equipment 
That s why Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and Fluor  NYSE FLR  are likely cheering this turn of events  They re two of the largest construction and engineering firms in the world  Fluor is the largest in the S P 500 and Caterpillar is a Dow Jones Industrial Average component 
As a result of their size and prominence  these two companies had well performing stocks before Trump was elected  But you can see how much both shot up after November 8 

While Trump s forceful leadership style has worried some government contractors  it has been a boon to construction stocks  Companies like Fluor and Caterpillar could get some invaluable contracts from the Trump Wall 
For better or for worse  it seems like our 45th president is following through on his campaign promise  Whether or not you agree with Trump s stance on the Mexican border  there s no denying that the wall is a project of macroeconomic proportions  That means now is the time to trade on the beginning of its construction

126808,348323,FLR,Baxter International  Fluor  BlackRock  Legg Mason And Invesco Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   June 24  2016    highlights Baxter International  NYSE BAX     as the Bull of the Day and  Fluor Corporation  NYSE FLR     as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on   BlackRock  Inc      Legg Mason Inc  NYSE LM       and Invesco Ltd     

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  

  

Baxter International     engages in the worldwide development  manufacture and distribution of a diversified line of products  systems and services used primarily in the health care field  The company provides a portfolio of hospital and renal products that service to treat end stage renal disease  irreversible kidney failure  and acute kidney therapies  The company s products are used by hospitals  clinical and medical research laboratories  blood and dialysis centers  rehabilitation centers  nursing homes  doctors  offices and by patients  at home  under physician supervision 

Baxter has posted positive earnings and has seen rising estimate revisions  which has helped the stock rise 18  higher year to date  The Deerfield  IL based company recently became a Zack Rank  1  Strong Buy  making the stock the Bull of the Day 

Baxter has a market cap of  25 Billion with a Forward PE of 27  The company pays a dividend yield of 1 16  and has an expected 3 5 year EPS growth rate of 8 65   Over the last two years the stock has outperformed the S P 500 by returning almost 17  versus 6   Most of this return has been in 2016  a time when most stocks are struggling to move higher  This outperformance in such a dull market says a lot about the strength of the stock and future price direction if equities were to finally breakout 

 

Fluor Corporation     delivers engineering  procurement  construction  maintenance  EPCM   and project management to governments and clients in diverse industries around the world  The Texas based company operates in five segments  Oil   Gas  Industrial   Infrastructure  Government  Global Services  and Power  Fluor is a primary service provider to the United States Federal Government  It performs operations and maintenance activities for major industrial clients  and also operates and maintains their equipment fleet 

The company has a market cap of  7 2 Billion and has a Forward PE of 15  The stock sports a Zacks Style Scores of  D  in Momentum  The company has 3 5 year growth rate of 14 00  and dividend yield of 1 63   However  a recent guidance cut with the combination of earnings revisions heading lower make the stock a Zacks Rank   5 and today s Bear of the Day 

Earnings

Fluor reported Q1 earnings on May 5th  seeing EPS at  0 85 verse the  0 86 expected  The company saw a slight beat on revenue  seeing  4 42 Billion verse the  4 41 Billion expected  In addition the company cut fiscal year 2016 guidance range to  3 25 3 65 verse the  3 65 expected  The previous range was  3 50 4 00 

The stock fell 8  on the news and has since grinded back close to pre earnings levels  Investors would be wise to sell shares due to falling earnings estimates for the rest of the year  The danger being that shares could dip back below  50 shares and challenge 2016 lows around  40 

Estimates

Over the last 60 days  the Fluor has seen estimates fall for both fiscal year 2016 and 2017  For the current year we have seen a 7 3  revision lower from  3 65 to  3 38  For next year  estimates have fallen 4 3   from  3 68 to  3 52

FSB Proposals  Asset Managers May Face Tough Scrutiny

Similar to  too big to fail  banks  the  76 trillion asset management industry continues to be in the focus of the global regulatory bodies amid heightened regulations and scrutiny in the broader financial system post crisis  The Financial Stability Board   FSB   proposed 14 recommendations to address the contagion risks  given the structural vulnerabilities in asset management industry 
	The FSB  a group of international regulators led by Bank of England s governor Mark Carney  called for additional oversight of exchange traded  mutual and other funds  trading activities of which could potentially pose financial stability risks  According to the FSB  the funds should be able to sell assets to return investors their money even in stressed markets 
	According to the FSB  the structural vulnerabilities in asset management industry included liquidity mismatch between fund investments and redemption terms and conditions for open ended fund units  leverage within investment funds  securities lending activities of asset managers and funds as well as operational risk and challenges in transferring investment mandates in stressed conditions 
	To address these structural vulnerabilities  the FSB proposed the following recommendations  Authorities should widen the availability of liquidity risk management tools to open ended funds  while existing reporting requirements should be reviewed and improved to ensure adequacy 
	Also  liquidity risk management tools should be made available to open ended funds to reduce first mover advantage  Moreover  the authorities should collect data on leverage in funds  monitor the use of leverage by funds and take action when appropriate 
	Further  the International Organization of Securities Commissions   IOSCO   should collect national aggregated data on leverage across its member jurisdictions based on the simple and consistent measures it develops 
	Also  system wide and individual stress testing of asset managers similar to banks along with providing better disclosure to clients about risks involved in funds were among the 14 recommendations made by the FSB to authorities across the G20 nations on Wednesday 
	Carney stated   Given its increased importance  a resilient asset management sector is vital to finance strong  sustainable and balanced growth  
	Daniel Tarullo  Chair of the FSB Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation  said that  The proposed policy recommendations are designed to enhance the resilience of asset managers and funds to future stress in financial markets  
	The FSB proposals are to be implemented over two years from the end of 2017 after being finalized by the end of this year 
	Assets under management rose from  50 trillion in 2004 to  76 trillion in 2014  according to the FSB  With the growth of the asset management industry  several risks and challenges have cropped up and the regulatory bodies continue to work on these issues and have taken up required measures 
	Last year  the FSB dropped its plan to designate certain asset managers or funds as  systemically important  after resistance from the large players of the fund industry like BlackRock  Inc      Fidelity Investments  Vanguard Group Inc  and Pacific Investment Management Co 
	Tougher oversight proposed by the global regulatory bodies will surely not gel well with asset managers like BlackRock  Legg Mason Inc     and Invesco Ltd       The firms believe their size do not pose a systemic risk to financial stability of the broader financial market 
	However  we believe that though the new proposals  if implemented  can impact the revenue growth of the companies in this industry to some extent  the broader system will be secured from any potential downturn

126842,348357,FLR,The Decline Of Oil Leaves A Silver Lining,opinion,"This week s hot stock operates in the volatile oil and gas industry  As you might expect  its stock price has been beaten down over the past six months by the decline in activity in the industry  However  this price decline is unwarranted  as the underlying fundamentals of this business remain intact  After a decline in revenues in 4Q14  expectations for this stock have been lowered  which allows for the perfect entry point  This company s high profitability and steady profit growth  when coupled with its stock s cheap valuation  allow it to earn our Very Attractive rating  This week s hot stock is Fluor Corporation  NYSE FLR  

Fluor Corporation is a global engineering and construction firm that creates and delivers solutions for its engineering  procurement  fabrication  construction  and maintenance clients  The company mainly serves the energy  chemicals  government  industrial  infrastructure  mining and power markets  giving it exposure to numerous income streams  This diversity of markets served gives Fluor the ability to withstand declines in one market as others can make up for the decline  This fact was demonstrated in 2014 as weakness in the Industrial   Infrastructure segment and the government segment was offset by strength in the Oil   Gas and Power segments 

Strength in 2014 allowed Fluor to continue its trend of growing after tax profit    by a steady 6  compounded annually since 2011  Despite a decline in revenue in 2014 due to large contract awards in 2013 and mining weakness  Fluor s NOPAT was still up 3  year over year in 2014  The company s return on invested capital    of 27  in 2014 places it in the top quintile of all companies we cover  Fluor also had  in excess of  859 million at the end of 2014 

The decline in the energy sector seen in the second half of 2014 and into 2015 has caused Fluor s stock price to drop 26  over the past year  This large decline appears overblown when looking at the company s robust fundamentals  and FLR is now undervalued  At its current price of   57 share  Fluor has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 9  This ratio implies that the market expects Fluor s NOPAT permanently decline by 10   While 2015 may be a trying year  management has proven its ability to grow this company and create shareholder value through timely share buybacks  Add in the fact that Fluor recent achieved a record backlog of  42 billion and we feel the current market expectations for this company are overly pessimistic 

If Fluor can grow NOPAT by just 4  compounded annually for the next eight years  the stock is worth  71 share    a 25  upside

126843,348358,FLR,Low Oil Prices Make This Stock A Good Long Term Bet,opinion,"Things have rarely looked so bad for Fluor  NYSE FLR  and the construction management services industry in general  Unlike some other firms in the industry  e g  KBR  NYSE KBR  and Mcdermott  NYSE MDR    Fluor has a history of being a well run company with an effective management team that rarely makes serious mistakes  FLR is not burdened by the same  overblown  concerns regarding nuclear contracts that Chicago Bridge and Iron faces  and the firm has better economies of scale than smaller peer Jacobs Engineering  Despite all this  Fluor has fallen mightily of late  capped by a nearly 10 percent decline after announcing earnings on July 30 
With the stock now near a 52 week low and trading at levels not seen since the first Euro Crisis of 2011  investors have to ask themselves how to respond  If history is any indication  the collapse of FLR s stock represents an excellent long term opportunity albeit with some short term pain  On average  stocks that see significant negative price shocks after earnings represent good long term opportunities for investors 

Another 10 percent fall in the price would take the stock back to the same type of levels seen during the Great Recession  Fluor is forecasting earnings per share of a little over  4 for 2015  but the larger issue for investors is what happens in 2016 and beyond  Fluor  like the rest of its competitors  has benefitted strongly from the new energy infrastructure boom  From Ethylene Crackers to major mining projects  the last decade s commodities boom has been key to Fluor s earnings growth  Now commodities have tumbled  on the back of paper tiger superpower China s slowing growth  and the oil price collapse is adding insult to injury for FLR and all its peers 
Fluor s earnings next year probably won t decline to the same degree that many energy firms  will  but it is clear that the company is going to face substantial headwinds for a while  The firm provides good value at today s levels  Many tech companies  and even the broader stock market as a whole  are arguably slightly overpriced  The same cannot be said for FLR or any of the other firms linked to the commodities complex  FLR is trading at roughly 10X cash flow from operations based on its most recent results 

FLR management has been particularly vocal in expressing disappointment on the non oil and gas side  but that s not new news  Instead  the oil and gas collapse is likely to be an ongoing shock for the firm for a couple of years  For long term investors though  Fluor should definitely be on the radar  The company is a quality operation with good management and a solid reputation  The nature of its business is one of booms and busts  but even as revenues have come down  FLR has restructured and cut its own supply chain costs leading to higher profit margins this year than in the past 
Fluor is still   and the firm has a low level of debt  so the firm is not at serious risk of financial distress  But Fluor is not the type of business that pays a big dividend yield  and given the macroeconomic clouds around the company  it s going to take a while before investors are comfortable enough with the outlook to start bidding up the price again 

As a long term holding  FLR offers great value then  but investors buying in at this stage need a strong stomach as the worst is probably still to come  Financial principles indicate that higher returns require higher risk  and FLR has definitely moved up a notch in both the risk and return space ",2015-08-06,OilPrice.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/low-oil-prices-make-this-stock-a-good-long-term-bet-260738,260738
126844,348359,FLR,Fluor Corp   FLR  Poised To Beat Q1 Earnings  Here s Why,opinion,"Fluor Corporation   NYSE FLR   is set to report first quarter 2016 results  after the closing bell on May 5 
The company has had a disappointing earnings history registering positive earnings surprise in just one out of the last four quarters  resulting in a negative average surprise of 6 6  

In spite of the lackluster earnings history  we expect Flour to beat estimates in the to be reported quarter 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Fluor is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  The   which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  2 33   This is a very meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Fluor carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  Meanwhile  Sell rated stocks   4 and  5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
The combination of Fluor s Zacks Rank  3 and ESP of  2 33  makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming report 
Growth Factors This Past Quarter
Fluor  a well managed company with a proven business model  happens to derive much of its strength from its impressive market diversity that helps it mitigate serious cyclicality of markets in which it operates  This apart  the company s strong financial health  diligent restructuring initiatives and strong foothold in the U S  engineering and construction sector are expected to be conducive to first quarter 2016 results 
The recent uptick in the activities of oil   gas customers of the company has provided the much needed momentum to the company s LNG business which is expected to boost top and bottom line performance in the to be reported quarter  This apart  Fluor has largely pursued strategic alliances in the past to boost its market share and inorganic revenue growth  In this regard  the recently completed buyout of Dutch engineering and construction company Stork Holding B V has piqued investors  interest as this is expected to boost the company s Global Services sales 
Moreover  Fluor s solid track record of winning awards has proved to be a major driver of revenues and margins  Also  the company s strong backlog levels hint at the continuation of this trend in the first quarter as well  Some of the noteworthy contracts clinched by Fluor led joint ventures during the first quarter of 2016 include a design build and project maintenance deal from Arizona Department of Transportation  ADOT  and design build  finance  operate and maintenance award from Maryland Department of Transportation and Maryland Transit Administration for the Purple Line project 
Also  Fluor s industry leading position in the nuclear remediation at government facilities throughout the U S  is expected to pose a major tailwind to its first quarter 2016 performance  During the first quarter of 2016  the company was also selected by the U S  Department of Energy  DOE  to support cleanup mission initiatives at the Idaho Site under the Idaho Cleanup Project  ICP  Core Contract  The long term contract spanning over a period of five years is valued at  1 4 billion  Moreover  nuclear project wins from Westinghouse earlier this year and an uptick in transportation spending in the U S  over the past few months are expected to propel growth in the to be reported quarter   
Despite these potent growth drivers  lower commodity prices and the subsequent uncertainty in consumer spending along with strengthening of the U S  dollar raise caution 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies which you may consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter
