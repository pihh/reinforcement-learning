14094,235609,CMA,Comerica  CMA  Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates  Revenues Down Y Y  Revised ,opinion,Comerica   NYSE CMA   has reported positive earnings surprise of 6 3  in fourth quarter 2019  Earnings per share of  1 85 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 74  Earnings  however  came in lower than the prior year quarter figure of  1 95 Higher non interest income and lower provisions were recorded  Moreover  rise in deposits was another tailwind  Yet  lower loans and rise in expenses were undermining factors  Further  decline in net interest income was a major drag Net income came in at  269 million in the quarter  down 13 2  year over year Furthermore  segment wise  on a year over year basis  net income decreased 3  at Business Bank  52 2  at Retail Bank and 9 4  at Wealth Management  The Finance segment reported net loss as against the income recorded in the prior year quarter For full year 2019  adjusted net income was  1 19 billion or  7 81 per share compared with the prior year s  1 24 billion or  7 24 per share  Earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 74  Notably  the 2019 results include securities repositioning charge and discrete tax items Revenues Down  Expenses EscalateComerica s fourth quarter net revenues were  810 million  down 6 3  year over year  However  the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  802 million For full year 2019  the company reported net revenues of  3 35 billion  slightly up year over year  Further  it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 34 billion Net interest income slipped 11 4  on a year over year basis to  544 million in the quarter  In addition  net interest margin contracted 49 basis points  bps  to 3 20      Total non interest income came in at  266 million  up 6 4  on a year over year basis  Higher fiduciary income  commercial lending fees and other non interest income mainly aided the results  partly mitigated by decrease in card fees and service charges on deposit accounts In addition  non interest expenses totaled  451 million  slightly up year over year  The upswing resulted mainly from higher salaries and benefits expense  outside processing fee expense and other non interest expenses Adjusted efficiency ratio was 55 46  compared with the prior year quarter s 51 93   A rise in ratio indicates a fall in profitability Solid Balance SheetAs of Dec 31  2019  total assets and common shareholders  equity were  73 4 billion and  7 3 billion  respectively  compared with  70 8 billion and  7 5 billion as of Dec 31  2018 Total loans were down 2 1  on a sequential basis to  50 4 billion  However  total deposits inched up around 1  from the prior quarter to  57 3 billion Credit Quality  A Mixed BagCredit metrics were a mixed bag during the reported quarter  Total non performing assets dropped 6 5  year over year to  215 million  Also  allowance for loan losses was  637 million  down 5 1  from the prior year period  Additionally  the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was 1 27  as of Dec 31  2019  down from 1 34  as of Dec 31  2018 In addition  provision for credit losses came in at  8 million  plunging 50  from the prior year quarter  Yet  net loan charge offs surged 90 9  on a year over year basis to  21 million Strong Capital PositionAs of Dec 31  2019  the company s tangible common equity ratio was 9 19   down 59 bps year over year  Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10 14   down from the 11 14  reported in the year ago quarter  Total risk based capital ratio was 12 13   down from the prior year quarter s 13 21  Capital Deployment UpdateComerica s capital deployment initiatives highlight the company s capital strength  During 2019  the bank repurchased 18 6 million shares for  1 4 billion under its existing share repurchase program  This  combined with dividends  resulted in a total payout of  1 8 billion to shareholders in the year Notably  during the reported quarter  Comerica repurchased 2 1 million shares for  150 million under its existing equity repurchase program  This  combined with dividends  resulted in a total payout of  246 million to shareholders Impressive Outlook for 2020Comerica has guided for full year 2020  taking into consideration the current economic and rate environment Comerica expects average loans to be up 2 3   The outlook reflects growth across most lines of business  partly offset by declines in Mortgage Banker Finance and National Dealer Services  Further  average deposits are likely to be up 1 2   with the focus on attracting and holding relationship based deposits The company anticipates lower net interest income  unusually impacted by lower interest rates  funding actions in the prior year and softer non accrual interest recoveries  partially muted by loan growth  Notably  management expects  10 15 million reduction sequentially in the first quarter  while slight decline is anticipated for the remainder of 2020 Non interest income are predicted to be up 1   driven by growth in card fees and fiduciary income  partially mitigated by reduced derivative and warrant income  with the assumption of no returns on deferred compensation assets Non interest expenses is estimated to flare up 3   resulting from higher outside processing expenses  in line with growing revenues  technology costs  inflationary pressures and elevated pension expense Net charge offs are anticipated to be at the 2019 levels of 15 25 basis points  with persistent solid credit quality Income tax expenses are expected to approximate 23  of pre tax income Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is targeted at 10  Our ViewpointComerica will benefit from its ongoing strategic initiatives  Its robust capital position supports steady capital deployment activities through share repurchases and dividend hikes  which seem impressive  Nonetheless  decline in loans and rise in expenses remain concerns  Apart from this  restricted top line expansion  eroded by a lower margin  is a concern  Comerica Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Currently  Comerica carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Performance of Other Wall Street BiggiesRiding on high revenues  PNC Financial   NYSE PNC   reported a positive earnings surprise of 1 7  in fourth quarter 2019  Earnings per share of  2 97 surpassed the Zacks Consensus

share related to certain matters  earnings came in at 60 cents per share compared with the prior year quarter s  1 21 Better than expected trading performance and rise in mortgage banking fees drove JPMorgan s   NYSE JPM   fourth quarter earnings of  2 57 per share  handily outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 32  Lower interest rates drove mortgage banking fees  Further  as expected  both equity and debt underwriting fees improved  rising 10  and 11   respectively  Thus  this resulted in an increase in investment banking fees  up 5   despite a 3  fall in advisory fees  We are

amounted to  179 4 million  up 12 1  on a year over year basis  Higher fiduciary and asset management revenues  brokerage and trading revenues  transaction card revenues  along with elevated mortgage banking revenues  primarily led to this upswing  This was partly offset by lower deposit service charges and fees  along with reduced other revenues Total other operating expenses were  288 8 million  up 1 5  year over year  This uptick mainly stemmed from higher personnel expenses and mortgage banking costs Efficiency ratio increased to 63 65  from the prior years  63 25   Generally  a higher ratio indicates decline in profitability Total loans as of Dec 31  2019  were  21 8 billion  down 2 2  sequentially  As of the same date  total deposits amounted to  27 6 billion  up 5 7  sequentially

rights valuation adjustment of  3 2 million  This upswing resulted from rise in all the components except insurance commissions and credit card  debit card and merchant fees Non interest expenses were  162 4 million  up 6 6  from the year ago quarter  The upside stemmed from the impact of higher salaries and employee benefits  net occupancy and equipment expenses As of Dec 31  2019  total deposits

per share of 28 cents lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents  The bottom line figure also comes in 3 4  lower than the prior year quarter reported tally Results were adversely impacted by lower net interest income and higher provisions  along with pressure on margin  However  decline in operating expenses and fee income was tailwinds  Further  improvement in loans and deposits was the driving factor The company reported net income of  317 million for the quarter  down 5 1  year over year For full year 2019  net income was  1 41 billion or  1 27 per share compared with the  1 39 billion or  1 20 per share reported in the prior year  Results missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 29 Revenues Decline  Expenses Fall  Loans   Deposits EscalateTotal revenues decreased

down 7  from the prior year quarter  This downside resulted from lower net interest margin  NIM   partly offset by an increase in average earnings assets  Also  net interest margin  NIM  contracted 29 basis points to 3 12  Non interest income climbed 13  year over year to  372 million  This upsurge mainly stemmed from increase in almost all components of income  partly muted by lower capital market fees and other non interest income Non interest expenses edged down 1  year over year to  701 million  This was chiefly due to lower equipment  marketing and net occupancy costs  mostly offset by elevated personnel costs  outside data processing and other service costs  along with other expenses Efficiency ratio was 58 4   down from the prior year quarter s 58 7   A decline in ratio indicates rise in profitability As of Dec 31  2019  average loans and leases at Huntington inched up  on a sequential basis  to  75 1 billion  Also  average core deposits increased marginally from the prior quarter to  79 7 billion Credit Quality DisappointsNet charge offs were  73 million or an annualized 0 39  of average total loans in the reported quarter  up from the  50 million or an annualized 0 27

improve  with net charge   offs in the range of about 35 to 45 basis points  and some moderate quarterly volatility The effective tax rate for 2020 is anticipated in the range of 15 5  to 16 5  Our ViewpointHuntington put up a disappointing performance in the October December quarter  Though the company exhibited continued efforts in increasing loan and deposit balances  lower revenues was a concern on declining interest income  Further  deteriorating credit metrics remains a headwind  Nevertheless  the company  which has a solid franchise in the Midwest  is focused on capitalizing on its

14378,235893,CMA,Major Regional Bank Stocks Outlook Rosy On Decent Loan Rise,opinion,"The Zacks  industry includes the nation s largest banks by assets   most operating globally  Financial performance of these banks largely depends on the nation s economic health  As the banks are involved in a number of complex financial activities  they are required to meet the stringent regulations set by the Federal Reserve and other agencies Along with traditional banking services  which are the source of interest income  major regional banks provide a wide array of financial services and products to retail  corporate and institutional clients  both domestic and global  The services offered include credit and debit cards  wealth management and investment banking  among others  Therefore  a large source of revenues for these banks is fees and commission earned from these services Prominent names in this industry are BB T Corp  BBT   Bank of America  BAC   Comerica  CMA   Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB   FITB   KeyCorp  NYSE KEY   KEY   M T Bank  MTB   Northern Trust  NTRS   State Street  STT   SunTrust Banks  NYSE STI   STI   BNY Mellon  BK   U S  Bancorp  USB  and Wells Fargo  WFC  Here are the three major industry themes Major regional banks significantly benefit from higher interest rates  After raising interest rates four times in 2018  the Fed reversed its stance and cut rates in July  September and October this year  Though it is widely expected that there will be no further rate cuts when the Fed officials meet next week  the three cuts have largely offset the favorable impact of last year s higher rates  Though several macroeconomic matters  including the ongoing U S  China trade conflict  Brexit ambiguity and global slowdown fears have adversely impacted business sentiments  strength in the economy and moderate loan demand are likely to support banks  net interest margin and net interest income to some extent  These banks are investing considerably in AI and other digital platforms to improve their online and mobile banking services  and ward off competition from Fintech and other large tech companies  In fact  banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan have been successful in offering customized digital services  While technological investments are expected to result in a rise in operating costs to some extent in the near term  the efforts will help banks save time and provide less error prone services  Gradual easing of stringent regulations by the Fed has resulted in increased financial flexibility for these banks  With declining compliance costs  banks are able to utilize the freed up capital to generate more revenues and expand operations  both organically and through acquisitions   These initiatives are expected to support profitability amid a dismal rate scenario Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Major Regional Banks industry is a 16 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  100  which places it in the top 40  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates outperformance in the near term  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since September end  the industry s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised upward by nearly 1  Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Outperforms Sector and S P 500The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry has outperformed the S P 500 composite and its own sector over the past year While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 16 6  over this period  the Zacks S P 500 composite rallied 13 8  and the Zacks Finance sector have increased 8  One Year Price Performance
Industry s ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry s relative valuation by looking at its price to tangible book ratio  P TBV   which is commonly used for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P TBV of 2 27X  This compares with the highest level of 2 68X  lowest level of 1 44X and median of 2 10X over the past five years  Additionally  the industry is trading at a discount when compared to the market at large  as the trailing 12 month P TBV for the S P 500 composite is 11 03X  as the chart below shows Price to Tangible Book Ratio  TTM 
As finance stocks typically have a lower P TBV ratio  comparing major regional banks with the S P 500 may not make sense to many investors  But a comparison of the group s P TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount  The Zacks Finance sector s trailing 12 month P TBV of 2 63X for the same period is slightly above the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry s ratio  as the chart below shows Price to Tangible Book Ratio  TTM 
Bottom LineLower interest rates a major concern for these banks  Also  the support major banks received from manageable expense levels might not continue  as investments in technology and efforts to find new avenues will gradually lead to higher expenses Nonetheless  the operating backdrop may turn less challenging with the easing of regulatory supervision  Also  major regional banks will benefit from strategic initiatives  decent loan demand and improving domestic economy in the near term Thus  investors may keep an eye on a few major regional bank stocks given their strong earnings outlook None of the stocks in the Zacks Major Regional Bank space currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   So  we are presenting three stock with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  You can see  JPMorgan  JPM   The stock has gained 35 6  so far this year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings has been revised 2 2  upward over the past 60 days Price and Consensus  JPM

14380,235895,CMA,Bank Stock Roundup  Q4 Earnings Commences  BofA  JPMorgan   Citi Top Estimates,opinion,Most banks that reported fourth quarter 2019 results this week managed to record bottom line growth on higher fee income  driven by fixed income trading revenues resulting from strong client activities  Further  remarkable investment banking performance  aided by strong underwriting business and steady consumer banking  was on the upside In addition  mortgage banking revenues rebounded on lower rates mainly owing to rise in mortgage origination volume   In addition  escalation in loans and deposits acted as tailwinds  However  advisory business was on the downside Also  net interest margin was disappointing  adversely impacted by the Fed s rate cuts  Along with low rates  flatter yield curve  deposit pricing and shift in funding mix kept net interest income low  Additionally  an overall rise in non interest expenses  due to high spending on technology and personnel  and other market development initiatives  was an undermining factor  This apart  provisions soared Nevertheless  banks continued with their restructuring and streamlining initiatives  Moreover  legal expenses remained manageable   Read   Important Earnings of the Week1  Citigroup   NYSE C   delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4 4  in fourth quarter 2019  backed by revenue strength  Adjusted earnings per share of  1 90 for the quarter handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 82  Citigroup recorded higher revenues riding on consumer banking  investment banking and market revenues during the reported quarter  Though equity market revenues disappointed on a more challenging environment in derivatives  fixed income revenues were on an upswing  Moreover  investment banking revenues increased on strong underwriting business  partly muted by lower advisory business  Further  loans escalated  However  rise in expenses and cost of credit was on the downside   Read more   2  Improved trading and underwriting performance drove Bank of America s   NYSE BAC   fourth quarter 2019 earnings of 74 cents per share  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents  Also  the figure was up 6  from the prior year quarter  As expected  BofA came out with improved trading and investment banking numbers  Sales and trading revenues  excluding DVA  grew 13   driven by 25  rise in fixed income trading  while equity trading income witnessed a fall of 4  on year over year basis  Investment banking fees grew 9  as underwriting fees recorded a rise  Equity underwriting income and debt underwriting fees grew 18  and 14   respectively  On the other hand  advisory fees fell 5    Read more   3  Better than expected trading performance and rise in mortgage banking fees drove JPMorgan s   NYSE JPM   fourth quarter 2019 earnings of  2 57 per share  which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 32  Lower interest rates drove mortgage banking fees  up 133    mainly due to 94

14457,235972,CMA,Small oil and gas companies get cold shoulder from large banks,news,"By David French and Jessica Resnick Ault NEW YORK  Reuters    The largest banking lenders to the oil and gas sector are becoming more cautious  marking down their expectations for oil and gas prices that underpin loans in a move expected to put further financial stress on struggling producers  industry and banking sources said  Major banks including JPMorgan Chase  N JPM    Wells Fargo   N WFC   and Royal Bank of Canada  TO RY  have  as part of regular biannual reviews  cut their estimated values for oil and gas companies  reserves  which serve as the basis for those companies to receive reserve based loans  RBLs   according to more than a dozen sources familiar with the activity  While the size of the RBL market is unclear  it is estimated that a few hundred companies take such loans  with the cumulative size in the billions of dollars  Those lenders have marked down the perceived value for both oil and natural gas for the coming five years  with the changes kicking in as early as this month  Expected natural gas prices have been cut by around  0 50 per million British thermal units  about 20  below levels set in the spring  Industry sources are forecasting some firms face a 15  to 30  reduction in loan size as a result  Oil prices are expected to be about  1 to  2 lower than spring estimates   Some banks believe they have too much energy exposure and want to reduce some of this risk   said Ian Rainbolt  vice president of finance at Warwick Energy  a private equity firm with upstream investments in Oklahoma and Texas   That is a threat to smaller companies  which are already struggling to find other methods of financing   such as issuing stock or bonds   as investors grow restless with years of poor returns in the shale sector even as the United States has risen to become the world s largest oil and gas producer   Reduced funding could slow growth in U S  oil and gas production  and also threaten more bankruptcies in the sector  Bankruptcy filings among U S  oil and gas producers are at levels not seen since 2016  when U S  crude slumped to  26 per barrel  according to law firm Haynes and Boone  Companies heavily focused on natural gas drilling may be the most threatened  Banks are forecasting natural gas prices between  2 and  2 35 per million British thermal units for the next 12 months  and up to  2 50 at the end of the five year term  all lower than in the spring   I expect the biggest issues to be with over leveraged natural gas producers  especially those without firm transportation in geographically disadvantaged areas   said Brock Hudson  managing director at investment bank Carl Marks Advisors  who referenced companies in Appalachia  the Rockies and parts of Oklahoma  Smaller RBLs can have huge consequences  Alta Mesa Resources  an Oklahoma focused producer headed by former Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  chairman Jim Hackett  filed for bankruptcy a month after its borrowing base was slashed by almost half in mid August  A number of banks  including JP Morgan  Wells Fargo  and  Comerica Inc   N CMA   declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment  REDUCED AVAILABILITY  Eight sources indicated larger banks have set their price decks  the industry term for the value they will ascribe to hydrocarbons behind the RBLs  with oil between  46 and  51 per barrel for the next five years  There are fewer financing options available to help bridge the gap from lower RBLs  Just one U S  producer  Contango Oil   Gas  A MCF   has issued any new equity in 2019  while there has only been one high yield bond offering by a shale producer since March  according to Refinitiv data   Since 2018  the S P 500 Energy Sector  SPNY  is the worst performing sector in the Standard   Poor s 500  falling 18  against a 12 8  increase for the broader index  and many publicly traded shale companies have done even worse  Those facing lower loan guarantees also can not rely on selling unwanted assets to raise cash as mergers and acquisitions activity is at its lowest level in a decade  Profiting from further production is also difficult  as the number of active oil and gas rigs is at its lowest level since April 2017  according to Baker Hughes  Scott Richardson  head of U S  energy investment banking at  RBC  Capital Markets  said any uptick in bankruptcies would likely come from the SCOOP STACK area of Oklahoma and the gas heavy southern portion of Texas  Midland Basin  Loan covenants are also being tightened  according to a Dallas Federal Reserve Bank energy survey published Sept  25  The survey said some participants noted banks had lowered the maximum debt level permissible to 2 5 to 3 times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   from 3 5 to 4 0 times  Some regional lenders have kept prices for oil and gas in fall s redetermination higher than the larger institutions  according to three of the sources

14458,235973,CMA,The Cost of Doing Business in California Is One Blackout a Week,news," Bloomberg     It was only expected to happen a couple times a year    and just as a last resort 
That s what utility giant PG E Corp  originally said 13 months ago when it outlined plans to stage mass blackouts in Northern California during strong winds  a desperate maneuver to keep its lines from sparking wildfires  Nobody anticipated that  over the course of less than three weeks this month  hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses would have their service deliberately cut off  three times 
The count keeps rising  While PG E has begun restoring electricity to more than 3 million people who lost power this weekend in the company s biggest planned blackout yet  the bankrupt utility warned another round of gusts could spur more shutdowns Tuesday 
They are disruptive  to say the least  ATMs can t operate  Restaurants close  Traffic lights go out  Businesses limp along on backup generators  The two stoppages so far cost various parts of the economy upwards of  3 billion  said Michael Wara  a professor at Stanford University 
And PG E has said the outages may continue for a decade as it works to fireproof the grid 
That can t be good news for economic development  Wara said   Are you going to want to set up high tech manufacturing here that s sensitive to having reliable power  
Read More  Why California Fire Threats Cut Lights for Millions  QuickTake
Just the idea of a blackout hitting a tech company in Silicon Valley has  people totally freaked out   he said  So far  the headquarters of giants including Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  have been spared  as has the city of San Francisco 
Glassdoor wasn t  The switch was flipped off for the jobs website company on Oct  9  when PG E cut power to about 2 million people  and Glassdoor s offices were closed for two days  Scott Dobroski  a spokesman  said the expectation is that the lights will go out again this weekend 
 Lots of people worked from home  some worked in cafes and coffee shops in San Francisco   he said   It s really tough to speculate on how many of these things this will take for us to consider moving out of the Bay Area  It would take pretty extreme circumstances  
So far  the blackouts  along with the fires they aim to prevent  haven t made significant marks on overall economic activity  said Stephen Levy  director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto   This is a human tragedy  not an economic tragedy  In a  3 trillion economy  it doesn t show up on the radar  
The macro view isn t much comfort to those bearing the brunt  Robert Dye  chief economist at Comerica  NYSE CMA  Bank  said he agreed that  if the blackouts are limited in scope and frequency  and confined to rural areas  the overall drag on the state economy will be small   But for a business   the lost sales due to blackouts could have severe consequences  
It s simple   After a while  you can t run a business without electricity   said Renae Perry  whose family co owns the Papapietro Perry winery in Sonoma County  She had to close the tasting room during the recent stoppages  though she might have done that anyway because a wildfire was roaring nearby  Fires  she said   are worse  
The planned blackouts are a recourse after a string of devastating fire seasons  as climate change roils the nation s most populous state with ever more extreme weather 
 Here s the reality of what California is facing   PG E s utility chief  Andy Vesey  told reporters Friday   A long term cycle of years of drought  followed by a historically wet winter  followed by record setting heat waves and more than 100 million dead trees across California  All of this has created an exponential increase in wildfire risk across our vast state  
For PG E  avoiding another equipment sparked blaze is imperative  The company was forced into bankruptcy in January after its lines sparked deadly conflagrations in 2017 and 2018  Any more will threaten to derail its restructuring efforts 
Shares Plummet
PG E sank as much as 29  Monday to  3 55 a share  a record low  before paring losses  The company s stock had already plunged 30  Friday after it said that it detected a problem on a transmission line    a broken cable on a tower    near where the recent Kincade fire started in Sonoma County 
The debate is raging among lawmakers  regulators and business leaders over what should  or can  be done to limit the fire risk in California without subjecting its residents to regular outages 
 The vulnerability of our electric grid might affect the decision of businesses over a longer period of time to come here  stay here and grow here   said Rufus Jeffris  a spokesman for the Bay Area Council  a regional business backed public policy group   We re simply not where we need to be as a state in ensuring the resilience of our energy infrastructure 
Governor Gavin Newsom and others have insisted that power cuts can t become the new normal  Newsom earlier this week blasted the state s three major utilities  particularly PG E  for what he said was their failure to spend enough to make their grids more resilient 
Deliberate blackouts shouldn t be happening in a place as technologically advanced as California  he said  and the companies should be more  surgical  about shutoffs so they affect as few people as possible 
PG E  for its part  has said it is striving to limit the impact and is upgrading its grid so it can turn off power to smaller segments of its system  a practice known as  sectionalizing  
The Hardship
 We recognize the hardship of not having electric service   the company said in a statement Friday   The sole purpose of these power shutoffs is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire in the communities that we serve  That s what we re focused on during this wildfire season  and right now with a potential shutoff in the next few days  
Lawmakers have other ideas  Some are calling for a government takeover of the utility  Others want regulators to be embedded within PG E  Newsom has raised the idea of breaking up the company and said Friday that the state has even approached potential buyers  The mayor of San Jose is trying to enlist cities and counties to support an effort to turn PG E into a citizen owned cooperative 
The governor is directing more state money toward backup power systems  solar power and batteries and pushing the idea of microgrids    smaller  self contained power networks 
No amount of solar panels  batteries and regulatory oversight  however  will get around the fact that the grid must still be fireproofed  PG E s Vesey said that the company agrees a  policy discussion  is in order on the best ways to address the crisis 
 There will be a time and place for that   he said   We will be glad to be part of it  But right now  we need to focus all of our efforts on getting through the next extreme weather event coming our way  ",2019-10-28,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/thecostofdoingbusinessin-california-is-one-blackout-a-week-2005968,2005968

over to Curt  who will begin on slide 3 Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankGood morning everyone  Today  we reported full year 2019 earnings per share of  7 87  a 9  increase over 2018  Highlights for the year included driving strong loan growth  which puts total assets to a record level  while continuing to serve our relationship oriented deposit base Also with the benefit of higher fee income  revenue reached an all time high  This growth along  with careful expense control  resulted in an efficiency ratio of under 52   In addition  credit quality remained solid  and we meaningfully reduced excess capital  Our book value grew 10   while we raised our dividend 46   Also our ROE increased to above 16  Slide 4 provides details on our 2019 results  Average loans increased 4   including strong growth in the first two quarters of the year  Deposit trends picked up significantly in the second half of the year  resulting in relatively stable balances year over year  As far as net interest income  the benefit from loan growth and the net impact from higher rates  was offset by an increase in interest bearing deposits  as well as wholesale funding  The provision increased from a very low level in 2018  and reflected continued solid credit quality  where 21 basis points of net charge offs  were only 4 basis points excluding Energy We repurchased 18 6 million shares during the year  reducing our average share count by 11   and together with an increase in our dividend  returned  1 8 billion to shareholders  In summary  we achieved record earnings per share and continue to enhance shareholder value Turning to slide 5  fourth quarter earnings were  269 million or  1 85 per share  These results demonstrate our ability to drive solid returns  with an ROE of nearly 15  and an ROA of 1 5   despite declines in interest rates  Broad based deposit in non interest income growth  strong credit quality and continued active capital management  were positive contributors to our performance Compared to the third quarter  average loans remain relatively steady  as expected  Mortgage Banker continued to benefit from robust refi activity  Also in Commercial Real Estate  and Environmental Services maintained their growth trends  This was offset by declines in General Middle Market  as well as National Dealer  which was partly due to lower inventory levels The tone of recent conversations I ve had with customers and colleagues across our markets is optimistic  and we continue to see slow  steady economic expansion  We are focused on employing new customer acquisition  cross sell and retention strategies that we have launched over the past year  and we continue to make the customer experience a corporate priority  as we seek to raise the expectations of what a bank can be While loans were relatively slow  deposit growth was robust  increasing  1 5 billion relative to the third quarter  with almost every business line contributing  The mix of the growth was favorable  with over 40  coming from non interest bearing deposits  In conjunction with this growth  we have reduced higher cost brokered deposits by nearly  700 million Our interest bearing deposit costs declined 7 basis points to 92 basis points in the fourth quarter  We are closely monitoring the competition  and with the recent Fed rate cuts  we have taken action to adjust deposit pricing  By carefully managing our deposit rates  we are attracting and retaining relationships  Our strategy is working  and is clearly demonstrated by our deposit growth The increase in relationship deposits allowed us to reduce higher cost wholesale funding  and helped reduce our loan total funding cost to 71 basis points  Also  our loan to deposit ratio decreased to 88   Of note  the U S  Treasury recently announced that we will continue to be the exclusive financial intermediary for the Direct Express government benefits card program for another five years  The economics of this program include attractive retail deposits  that should continue to grow  and our ability to leverage a third party platform for processing and servicing As far as net interest income  over 80  of our loans are floating rate and primarily tied to 30 day LIBOR  which on average declined 39 basis points during the quarter  Lower rates were the primary driver for our net interest income decline to  544 million  resulting in a net interest margin of 3 2   We added  750 million of swaps in October  and additional  1 billion in early January  Our strategy is to continue to build our hedging program over time  closely monitoring the markets and then taking advantage of opportunities as they arise Credit quality remained strong in the fourth quarter  with net charge offs of only 16 basis points  Charge offs continue to primarily consist of valuation impairments on select energy credits  as capital markets for this sector remain stalled  Phonetic   Excluding Energy  net charge offs were only  2 million Non performing assets declined and were only 43 basis points of total loans  and the provisions decreased to  8 million  A  10 million increase in non interest income helped offset the more challenging rate environment  We had strong growth in customer derivative income  as well as a gain from the sale of our healthcare savings or HSA business  along with incremental growth in several other categories Expenses increased as expected  primarily related to higher compensation outside processing and seasonal occupancy  This is in line with the outlook we provided for full year expenses to remain flat  excluding 2018 restructuring costs We maintain our targeted 10  CET1 target  We returned  246 million in capital to shareholders through our dividend  which currently provides almost a 4  return and by repurchasing 2 1 million shares under our share buyback program And now  I will turn the call over to Jim James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerThanks Curt and good morning everyone  Turning to slide 6  as Curt indicated  average loans were stable in the fourth quarter  with increases in Commercial Real Estate  Mortgage Banker and Environmental Services  offset by decreases in General Middle Market and National Dealer  Relative to the fourth quarter last year  average loans were up  1 7 billion  Total commitments as of quarter end were stable compared to the third quarter  with growth in Commercial Real Estate  Equity Fund Services  U S  Banking and General Middle Market  offset by reductions in Energy  Dealer and Technology and Life Sciences  Our pipeline remained solid Our loan yields were 4 43   a decrease of 40 basis points from the third quarter  This was a result of lower interest rates  primarily one month LIBOR  in addition to a  3 million decline in non accrual interest from an elevated third quarter level Slide 7 provides details on deposits  average balances increased  1 5 billion  with growth across all three of our markets  Non interest bearing deposits increased over  600 million  while customer interest bearing balances increased  1 45 billion  We ve managed our higher cost brokered deposits down about  700 million As far as deposit costs  with the decline in interest rates  we adjusted deposit pay rates throughout the quarter  Together with the decline in brokered deposits  we achieved a 7 basis point decrease in our interest bearing deposit costs  This is at the high end of the guidance we had previously provided As you can see in slide 8  our MBS portfolio is stable and the yield on the portfolio held steady  Yields on recent purchases have been around 2 4   We have had a modest increase in prepays in the back half of the year  but this is not had a significant impact on our duration or the unamortized premium  which remains relatively small Turning to slide 9  net interest income was  544 million  and the net interest margin was 3 2   Loans had a negative impact of  55 million or 31 basis points to the margin  The major factor was lower interest rates  which had a  46 million impact and 28 basis points on the margin  Also contributing to the decrease were lower balances of the client and non accrual interest from elevated levels  and to a lesser extent  other portfolio dynamics  including lower loan fees Fed deposits added  3 million  but had a 7 basis point negative impact to the margin  Higher balances added  7 million  that resulted in a 5 basis point drag on the margin  The lower Fed rate had an impact of  4 million or 2 basis points  Lower rates improved deposit costs by  3 million or 2 basis points on the margin  and reduced wholesale funding costs by  7 million  adding 4 basis points to the margin In summary  given the nature of our portfolio  our loans repriced very quickly  therefore the net impact of lower rates  including a full quarter impact of the July and September rate cuts  along with October s  was the primary driver of our net interest income in the fourth quarter  Assuming rates remain steady going forward  we believe the bulk of impact from lower rates is behind us Credit quality was strong  as shown on slide 10  Our net charge offs were  21 million or 16 basis points  Excluding Energy  net charge offs were only  2 million  Total non performing assets declined to 43 basis points  one of the lowest levels since 2006  and criticized loans comprised only 4  of total loans as of quarter end As far as Energy  while charge offs were lower in the fourth quarter than the previous two quarters  we continue to see impairment of select Energy loans with valuations of a few liquidating Energy assets impacted by volatile oil and gas prices  as well as weak capital markets  Energy non accrual loans decreased  31 million  However  we have seen a moderate amount of negative migration  as criticized Energy loans increased  146 million  Therefore  we increased our reserve for Energy  which remains at a very healthy level Our reserve ratio for total loans held steady at 1 27  and resulted in a provision of  8 million  a decline of  27 million from the third quarter  As far as our adoption of CECL as of January 1  our implementation process has been successful and is virtually complete  Given the relatively short duration of our commercially weighted portfolio and the expectation of a fairly benign economic environment  we expect the change in reserve will be a decrease of 0  to 5   and therefore will have little impact on our capital ratios Non interest income increased  10 million as shown on slide 11  Customer derivative income increased  7 million  including the rate impact on the Credit Valuation Adjustment  Commercial lending fees increased  2 million  with robust syndication activity  We also had small increases in several other categories  including Investment Banking  brokerage fees and securities trading  This was partly offset by a  5 million decrease in card fees  as a result of the mix shift in the transaction volumes of government cards  as well as two fewer business days in the quarter  impacting corporate and merchant card volumes  Also fiduciary income decreased  1 million  mainly due to tax preparation fees received in the third quarter  During the quarter  we sold our HSA business for a gain of  6 million  Of note  deferred comp asset returns  which are offset in non interest expenses  were  3 million  the same level as the third quarter Turning to expenses on slide 12  salaries and benefits increased  4 million  This was a result of higher incentive compensation and commissions tied to performance  as well as seasonal healthcare expense  In addition  outside processing increased  4 million  due to a better transition fee  and seasonality drove a  2 million increase in occupancy expenses  as well as several other categories  We continue to carefully manage costs as we invest for the future  as evidenced by our efficiency ratio of 55   which is well below the third quarter peer average In the fourth quarter  we repurchased  150 million or 2 1 million shares under our share repurchase program as shown on slide 13  Together with dividends  we returned  246 million to shareholders  Our goal is continue to return excess capital back to shareholders  and maintain our CET1 ratio at approximately 10  Turning to the rate environment on slide 14  assuming interest rates remain at the current levels  the net impact from rates is estimated to be  10 million to  15 million on our first quarter net interest  income relative to the fourth quarter  This includes the full quarter effect of the recent Fed cuts  combined with the actions we ve taken to lower deposit rates  Of course  actual results will vary  depending on a variety of factors  such as LIBOR movements  As far as the remaining three quarters of 2020  if rates hold steady  we expect to see a relatively smaller residual effect from rates  as longer dated assets and liabilities reprice  In addition  continued hedging activity could have a modest negative impact We continue to work to gradually moderate our asset sensitivity  We added  750 million to our hedging portfolio on October  and  1 billion in early January  We currently have about  5 5 billion in interest rate swaps  with an average remaining tenure of about three years and are currently in the money  Overall  we remain positive and constructive on the U S  economy and we plan to make steady progress in building our hedging portfolio over time Slide 15 provides our outlook for 2020  which assumes a continuation of the current rate and economic environment  We expect average loans to grow approximately 2  to 3  in 2020  relative to 2019  We anticipate continued slow  steady economic expansion  yielding growth in most business lines  This is expected to be partly offset by a decline in Mortgage Banker  from elevated levels  as refi volumes normalize  and a modest reduction in National Dealer Services  driven by predicted reduction in auto sales As far as the first quarter  we expect loan growth for most business lines will be mostly offset by a decline in Mortgage Banker  due to seasonality  combined with the slowdown in refi activity  We expect average deposit growth of 1  to 2   We believe we will have the normal seasonality through the year  including the typical first quarter decline  Our goal is continue to attract and retain long term customer relationships  by offering superior products and services  along with the appropriate pricing As I discussed on the previous slide  the rate impact on net interest income is expected to be mostly absorbed in the first quarter  with an additional modest effect for the remainder of the year  Also  the full year expense of higher wholesale funding will have an impact  In addition  we expect a  6 million to  8 million decrease in non accrual interest recoveries from the elevated level we saw in 2019  Loan growth is expected to provide a partial offset We believe our portfolio will continue to perform well  resulting in net charge offs similar to 2019  in the 15 to 25 basis point range  Given the new CECL accounting standards  which became effective January 1st  and assuming the current economic backdrop  we expect provision should be slightly above net charge offs  after taking into consideration our loan growth outlook  Note that this new standard may cause greater volatility in our provision As far as non interest income  we expect growth of about 1   led by card and fiduciary fees  Our expectation includes declines in certain key categories that had strong growth in 2019  such as customer derivative and warrant income  Also deferred comp  which totaled  9 million in 2019  it s hard to predict and is not assumed to repeat  As far as the first quarter  keep in mind that the fourth quarter included the gain on the sale of the HSA business  In addition  we had strong derivative income in syndication fees  as well as deferred comp of  3 million  all of which were dependent on market conditions  and therefore may not continue at these levels Expenses are expected to increase approximately 3  year over year  We expect to see a rise in outside processing tied to fee income growth  and increase in technology investments  as we execute on revenue and efficiency related projects that are in place  Phonetic  In addition  we expect inflationary pressures on items such as annual merit  staff insurance and marketing  As a result of lower discount rate  pension expenses increasing about  7 million  Also  recall the first quarter includes elevated salaries and benefits expense  due to share    annual share compensation and associated higher payroll taxes  which are expected to be mostly offset by seasonally lower marketing and occupancy expenses  Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23   and as far as capital  we expect to maintain our CET1 target of approximately 10  Now  I ll turn the call back to Curt Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankThank you  Jim  The outlook we have provided reflects our expectations for continued moderate U S  expansion through 2020  A cooler world  Phonetic  economy and the strong value of the dollar  remain a headwind for U S  trade  However  many sources of uncertainty that accumulated through 2019  such as China  Mexico and Canadian trade agreements  have been or may soon be resolved  The interest rate environment looks stable for the year ahead  and the labor market in the U S  remains strong and will continue to support the consumer sector  We believe this backdrop should benefit us and our customers  as the year progresses Over our 170 year history  we have managed through many economic and interest rate cycles  With our efficiency ratio in the mid 50s and an ROE of nearly 15   we are better positioned to weather changes in the economy or interest rate environment We remain focused on controlling the things we can control  to maintain our solid performance  Our 2019 results demonstrate our ability to grow revenue  while maintaining favorable credit metrics and well controlled expenses  Our key strengths provide the foundation to continue to enhance long term shareholder value  Specifically  our geographic footprint  which includes faster growing diverse markets  combined with our relationship banking strategy  is expected to result in growth of loans  deposits  and fee income We continue to maintain our prudent expense discipline  as we invest for the future  Also  our conservative consistent approach to banking  including credit and capital management has positioned us well Now we ll be happy to take your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions   Our first question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGood morning  I guess why don t we start off  in terms of the NII outlook  I just want to make sure I really understand what you re trying to say here  The way I read it  is that first quarter s obviously down  10 million to  15 million  and then the rate impact is going to be negative on NII  So dollars go lower in each subsequent quarter throughout 2020  But then you have    presumably you have the asset growth offset to that  Are you trying to say that  NII from a dollar basis is going to be lower than first quarter throughout the year  or like how do you see the net impact of all the different factors affecting NII  after first quarter  Thanks Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankDo you want to take it  Jim James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  thanks for the question  We will see progressively lower impact from rates  as we go through the year  I mentioned the  10 million to  15 million in the first quarter  It will be a much smaller amount in the second quarter  As of now it might be  call it the  5 million to  7 million range  then it becomes closer to a negligible number in the third and fourth quarter  even though we will see some impact all the way through the year  And of course I had mentioned  to the extent we had hedges and depending on the rates there  that will obviously have an impact also  We ll obviously pickup the volume as the year goes on and you heard me mention the non accrual impact  that overall will be an impact on 2020 compared to 2019 Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystSorry  I guess    because you    I m sure you guys do very detailed modeling for the year  Is it right to assume that your NII  if you look at say fourth quarter of  20  is that going to be lower or higher than first quarter of  20 James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYou should see volume overtake rate  once we get beyond the first quarter  to answer your question  So most of that rate impact is felt in the first quarter and then you are right  volume does start to step up and the rate impact starts to decline  So you start to see a crossover  once you get into the second and third quarters Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot you  Okay  all right  that s helpful  I guess maybe just like a second question  in terms of fee income  you mentioned in    I guess in your guidance that assumes things essentially no    what is the right word  no returns on deferred compensation assets  and that s part of the assumptions driving your 1   Can you just explain that  and is it possible that your fee growth is more than 1   if you do get returns on those assets James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerWell obviously  deferred comp is a bit of a wild card  depends on the market and the market returns on deferred comp  So it can actually positive or negative  So I d be very hesitant to assume there is going to be any kind of return there  In fact  it could go the other direction Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  understood  OK  And then just if I could sneak one last one in  in terms of your loan growth  obviously 2  to 3   I think last quarter you talked about something around nominal GDP  And I guess my interpretation of nominal GDP was closer to 4   Can you just comment  are you seeing weakness or any kind of deterioration  I mean presumably  you are seeing some weakness and your expectation for loan growth this quarter versus last quarter  and what s driving that  Thanks Peter L  Sefzik    Executive Vice President  Business BankKen  this is Peter  I think the 2  to 3  that we had communicated  we feel good about  we have seen a little bit of a slowdown in the fourth quarter and I think we listed the businesses that    where we ve seen that  There have been some sort of interesting timing on what we ve had in Dealer and Mortgage  But going into 2020  we feel good about our ability to accomplish the 2  to 3  that we ve communicated Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  all right  Great  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankJohn  good morning John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood morning  And then    also on the NII topic  So I guess this outlook implies probably that we got some incremental compression in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter  And then could you talk about how the margin should progress beyond that  Is it fair to assume stable or some incremental compression from there  as we move through second  third and fourth quarter of 2020  Thanks James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Yeah  happy to answer that  We have a couple of factors that we will be netting against each other  We did note that we have about 5 bps of compression  due to the higher balances plus the excess liquidity that you saw in the fourth quarter  When you bring up the net against that  the  10 million to  15 million guidance that I offered in the first quarter  and progressively smaller amounts after that  And so if you do the simple math on that  it would imply a modest reduction than the current 3 20  Having said that  we re always hesitant to provide NIM percentage guidance  just because it is so impacted by excess liquidity  which based on our customer profile  is very hard to predict John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  got it  And then on the expense front  you indicated in your guidance that you    your expense outlook is impacted in part by higher outside processing expenses related to revenue  And you mentioned in your comments too  it seems like maybe fee revenue  Can you talk about what that is  And then separately  can you talk about what expense levers you may have incrementally  as you look at 2020  given the tougher revenue backdrop  And any consideration for pulling back even harder on the expense side  Thanks Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankOkay  Jim  you want to start James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  very specific to the outside processing fees  So we actually do have some good core growth there  a number of line items in 2020  One of those is card income  and of course  we have associated outside processing fees with that  Now some of these strong core line item growth areas that we have  will be offset by some of the items that I mentioned  the very strong year we had in 2019 with syndications  warrants  derivatives and of course the deferred comp item that we talked about earlier  But we do expect a strong card year  and we will have some outside processing fees associated with that Regarding your second question on where could we pull back  we are always very focused on expense control  I think we have to keep in mind  that we re starting again from a very strong position  with 55  efficiency ratio  But we do feel it s important to make the proper investments in technology  and make sure that we re pushing forward  in terms of moving the company to where it needs to be  So we are going to continue to invest in technology and don t anticipate pulling back on that at this point in time John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  got it  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystHey  good morning everybody Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankHey Steven Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystTo follow up first on John s question on expenses  so if you look at the 3  expected increase in 2020  is there anything unusual you would call out  I mean pension sounds like it was  7 million  or do you    do you think that s a good run rate for the company here  as you continue to reinvest James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  pension would be the only real unusual item there  I would say normal inflation  including merits  would be the largest item  So nothing too unique in terms of what makes up that expense base Going forward  I d be hesitant to call that a run rate  What we re really focused on  is really operating leverage going forward  We do have a bit of a transition year at some of the pension expense and some of the strong non interest income headwinds that we talked about earlier  But we re really more focused on positive operating leverage  and that s where we expect to get in the future Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  And I just was looking for color  you guys put up really strong growth in deposits in the quarter  Do you have more color on why it was so strong James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  it was a very strong quarter  We were very pleased with it  We talked about being up  1 5 billion  But keep in mind  we ran off about  700 million brokered CDs  So the way I look at it is  we actually are up around about  2 2 billion or so on deposits  So we are very pleased there  There is a very concerted effort to go out and deposit gather  We priced appropriately where we needed to  These are relationships that we poured into the Bank  none of these were stand alone deposits Now  I will say that probably at least half of this is seasonal  and it s always hard to tell when this money might bleed out during the first quarter  But approximately half    maybe a little half from what I can tell is seasonal  But there is a strong component of it that I think is core  and will stick with us through of the year  even if we see a minor decline in the first quarter Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankThis is Curt  I might add  Steven  that the relationship component that Jim talked about  We made a deliberate strategy not to chase sort of hot money or transactional deposits  but heavily leveraged our deposit pricing in programs that we ve had in place  like our CD program around new client acquisition and acquiring additional deposits from existing customers  which I think is the right strategy for us longer term  and very consistent with our relationship based approach Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  Maybe just one final one  Curt  your comments recently about Comerica potentially being an acquirer got quite a bit of attention  I m curious  are you actively having conversations with targets  or is this something you re just thinking of really over the longer term  Thanks Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankYeah Steven  I think maybe first thing I would say is that  if you read the text of anything that has been written on me  there is no change in any of our strategies  There were few headlines that maybe were I think a little bit misleading  and we are very focused on organic growth  as we have been for a long time  We ve done two acquisitions in the last 20 years  and what we said and what I ve said and Ralph before me  is that    if there is something that makes sense in Texas and California  that would be a good strategic fit  And one of the major metropolitan areas and major right economics for our company and for our shareholders  we take a look at it  But that lands us fairly narrow  and so sort of day in and day out  we continue to focus on organic growth Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  terrific  Thanks for taking my questions OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankGood morning Jennifer Jennifer Demba    SunTrust    AnalystGood morning Curt  Question on asset quality  looks like the increase in criticized loans was Energy driven  Just wondering if you guys think charge offs will be higher in that sector this year or lower  And are you seeing any other underlying weakness in any other sector in your portfolio  Thanks James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYes Jennifer  So we re guiding 75 to 125 basis points in charge offs and if you take a look at 2019  only 4 basis points of ex Energy charge offs  I don t think that s sustainable  So we would expect that ex Energy  we would see slightly higher charge offs than what we saw in 2019 and we re hopeful that that could be offset fully or at least partially by lower energy charge offs  So that remains to be seen  but that s where we get the outlook Jennifer Demba    SunTrust    AnalystOkay  Are you seeing any any weakness at all in any other sectors or geography speed at this point James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerNo  we re really not  4 basis points of ex Energy charge offs in 2019  and only  2 million in net charge offs ex Energy in the fourth quarter  Our non accrual levels are very low levels  and that includes Energy  So we re seeing a lot of strength  particularly in  48 billion of the portfolio that is ex EnergyJennifer Demba    SunTrust    AnalystOkay  One other question  we saw a major transaction announced in Texas recently  Just wondering if you guys are expecting any merger disruption opportunities from that transaction  Thanks Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankJennifer  there s always disruptions that occur in markets when transactions occur  But I would say in general  there is nothing that strategically changes our focus as an organization  and we are in some different segments and some different customer focused  in a number of those transactions that have occurred Jennifer Demba    SunTrust    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankGood morning  Mike OperatorMike  you may be on mute Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankMike Mike Mayo    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystCan you hear me Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankYes  we can Mike Mayo    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystSorry about that  So how much was your technology spending last year  How much do you think it will increase  and what are the areas of technology spending focus Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankYes we    Jim  you want to start on that and then I ll add in around some of the areas of focus James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah Mike  we don t quote a specific number of technology spending  simply because it s so difficult and challenging to get an apples and apples  work with other banks and defining exactly what falls under technology budget  But I will say we have a    as implied in the expense outlook for 2020  we do have a modest increase in technology expense in 2020  over and beyond the strong spend in 2019  So it is something that we continue to invest in Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankAnd I might just add to that  Mike  that    we ve talked before about the GEAR Up initiative  having positioned us well  from an overall technology spend  We did a lot of work  the last several years to rationalize many of our applications in some of our aging platforms  I think we ve been a leader in terms of the cloud migration  especially in non customer interfacing applications  And there s a lot of the work we have done around that  has helped free up capacity for us for new projects  In the last 12 months  that has included a new    across the company  loan origination and servicing platform  a new companywide CRM platform  major investments in data analytics to help us in the marketing and servicing of our clients  Major upgrades for our call center technology  And then for 2020  a number of key areas of focus and items that will be coming online  related to upgrades to our ATMs  major upgrades to our banking center infrastructure and technology  including enabling all of our employees in the banking center with tablets to make them more mobile in their selling and servicing efforts  a pretty major upgrade to our onboarding capabilities on the digital side  for our consumer  prospecting customers and then  fairly significant upgrades to our treasury management platform in the payments area  as well as a new portal for our Wealth Management clients So we continue to be very focused on things that I would put in a category of colleague and customer enablement  And like most institutions  we have a longer term roadmap we re working on  But we feel like we are well positioned relative to our competitors and providing a really good experience to our customers Mike Mayo    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystAnd then one follow up  I assume you would employ many vendors to help you with this transformation  What took place with the vendor transition costs  I guess  you always have a balance  getting vendors to help you facilitate the transition  On the other hand  there is always the risk of vendor lock in  And during this quarter  you had a vendor transition cost  But can you describe the analysis that goes into selecting vendors  How you prepare against too much vendor lock in  versus the goal of transforming the company faster Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankI am going to take the sort of second part of your question and then I ll turn to Jim for the more specifics around the expense in the quarter  We do have a number of key vendor relationships like most institutions  given the sales organization we are  we try to strike the right balance between proprietary capabilities and leveraging third parties where it makes sense  Those third parties go through the exact same oversight process that we do  as if we were building something or servicing something in house  including robust  Indecipherable  oversight  And we believe we ve gotten really good relationships that we can leverage and we try to get to a good point in terms of balance and trying to help concentration issues with any one single single vendor  So Jim  you maybe want to talk about the specifics around the quarter James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah I would say that  other than size  there is actually nothing real unusual about this vendor transition  We re always evaluating our vendors to do the right thing with both ourselves and the customers  It s not unusual for us to have a vendor transition  This one was a little bit larger  But it is something that we re always evolving on  in terms of looking at both quality and cost and capabilities  And I would just say  that this is a one time cost that s larger than typical  It s not unusual  We have    had vendor transitions really every year  and sometimes multiple times within a year  So that s    I think there is probably not a lot more to that other than the size Mike Mayo    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  thank you Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankThank you  Mike OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankGood morning Ken Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystHey  thanks  Good morning  Question on the deposit cost side of things  You mentioned that you saw the 7 basis point decline in costs and just wondering  what happens from here in a stable rates environment  How much do you continue to have of just natural resetting in deposit costs  versus what else from here would have to be more negotiated with across the customer base  as you ve talked about in the past  Thanks James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  happy to answer that  We did reprice deposits throughout the fourth quarter  as I ve mentioned  So even though we saw the 7 basis points decline in the fourth quarter  I would expect a continued decline in the first quarter  just based off the efforts undertaken thus far The change in the first quarter will be a smaller amount  the 7 bps that we saw in the fourth quarter  I d probably characterize it based on actions taken to date  as being kind of the lower single digits of bps  But we will see where things play out there The two things that    two or three things that would cause a further reduction  one is  we did see some mix shift in the fourth quarter  The actions that we actually took in the fourth quarter  probably would imply a little larger bps reduction  but we did see some of our relationship deposits grow  related to some of the higher priced accounts  So whether or not  some of that mix shift unwinds remains to be seen  so that could be a tailwind Then I would say  it really depends on the competition and what happens in the competitive landscape  I ve seen a little bit of follow the leader out there in terms of deposit pricing  And I think that in turn for the industry will be driven by loan growth and the demand for funding  That s certainly true  specific to Comerica  But I think larger picture  it affects the entire industry  and we re not immune from that  So we ll continue to watch the competitive landscape and do the right thing for our customers and for our balance sheet Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystGot it  And one more question  just on the mix of earning assets  with all this good deposit growth that you have  a lot of it ended up just sitting in cash  And unfortunately  10 year still at 1 80 million  Phonetic  or so  So how do you sort of think about  if this deposit growth continues or hangs around  Does it just stay in cash  or given not much of an optionality versus securities book  Or do you start to flush it back into the securities book over time James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerWell  we do expect some of these deposits dilute in Q1  as we mentioned the seasonality factors  both in Q4 and the typical Q1 seasonality  So how much liquidity and excess liquidity we have  remains to be seen  To the extent we do have excess liquidity  I would say  it really depends on the interest rate landscape  In general  we are happy with the size of our securities portfolio  and the curve is flattened out  but there s not a lot of percentage in tying up that liquidity at this point in time  That s something we will continue to monitor  But I would not anticipate growing our securities book in terms of size  at this point in time Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystAll right  great  Thanks a lot Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankThank you  Ken OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankGood morning Erika Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning  I just wanted to follow up to your response to Steve s earlier question on operating leverage  Obviously in  20  given the poor comparison to  19 NII  that s obviously quite difficult  But is the message that  as we look out into 2021  there is more flexibility for the expense growth to be less than 3   or at least you have more levers to pull it lower than revenue growth Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankSo Erika  this is Curt  I would say that  when you look at the history of our company  especially the last year  we definitely have had a proven expense discipline and you look at the performance metrics  they really are the top of our peer group  and we expect them to be near the top of our peer group  once everybody reports  and especially the efficiency ratio  So we know how to manage expenses  We ve done a good job of that in our history  We remain very focused on expense management  There are a few dynamics in play in 2020 that Jim talked about  and we are going to continue to strike the right balance between managing expenses and investing the things that we need to invest in longer term  to help our customers and to serve our customers appropriately and to grow the institution  But you should expect for us longer term  to remain focused on positive operating leverage  And there s always additional levers that we can pull  We don t believe strategically  that sometimes these are the right things to do  and again striking the right balance between investing in technology and things of that nature and    that s for the overall expense growth numbers Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  And my second question is  you bought back almost  1 4 billion worth of stock  which really helped in a year  when the Fed cut three times  And with the CET1 ratio just 14 basis points above target  how should we think about buyback appetite in 2020 Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankJim James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  we    for us  it s a pretty simple target in terms of    we re simply calibrating what we need to support our loan growth  support our dividend and then calibrate that against earnings generation  And the goal is simply to come as close to 10  as we can  and we ve been in that ballpark the last few quarters  and I would anticipate saying plus or minus to that 10  throughout 2020 Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystJust as a follow up question  I think I ask you this every quarter  but can you really just remind us  what is your actual capital binding constraint  Because I m sure a lot of peer or a lot of investors look at the CET1 and its 150 basis points above the targets of some much larger regional banks  But if you could remind us what your actual binding constraint is on capital James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  there s a couple of ways to look at that  If you look at it from a pure stress testing standpoint  the binding constraint would be Tier 1  we obviously don t have preferred in our stack  But there is another way of looking at it  and that is we re always conscious of our constituents and rating agencies  regulators  customers  And from that standpoint  the CET1 is a very important ratio too  So I m not sure I could say  there s just one binding constraint  It depends on what perspective you re looking at it from Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystUnderstood  Thank you Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankThanks Erika OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankGood morning Michael Michael Rose    Raymond James    AnalystHey  good morning  Just as we think about the efficiency and the technology expense  there has been a lot of talk on this call  Is there any change to kind of the intermediate term profitability ROE  ROA expectations  just given the front loading  some of the expenses in the revenue environment  Thanks James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerNo  we ve enunciated in the past  that we expect to be in the low to mid ROEs  We could drop to the    more of a low double digit  I m sorry  just to clarify  the low double digit and the double digit ROE  and we expect to stay in that range in the foreseeable future  Interest rates will be a significant impact and driver there  We ll see where those go  But we feel pretty good about the double digit ROE going forward at this point still Michael Rose    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  And then just one housekeeping question  just  when I look at the NPAs  how much of that is actually Energy versus non Energy  when I look at the commercial bucket  Thanks James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Mike  I don t have that breakdown for you  I don t think there is a page  Do you have the breakout Darlene Persons    Director of Investor Relations22 James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerPage 10  That s on page 10  So   Michael Rose    Raymond James    AnalystAll right James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer 3 million in Energy   156 million in ex Energy Michael Rose    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  Sorry  I missed that  All right  thanks for taking my question Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankThanks Michael OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with DA Davidson Gary Tenner    DA Davidson    AnalystGood morning  I had a couple of questions  one on the Energy book  As you as you gave your guidance for loan growth in 2020  obviously  you highlighted Dealer Services and Mortgage  I m curious with the pretty significant decline this quarter in E P and what seems to be still a kind of a challenging outlook for that segment  what the appetite is for new lending in that space in 2020 Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankPeter Peter L  Sefzik    Executive Vice President  Business BankGary  this is Peter  So  I mean our appetite  is that we are still looking for opportunities that I would tell you that they are more limited in this environment that we re in  We re not seeing a whole lot of deal flow  you re seeing consolidation in the space  not a lot of capital coming into it  But we re continuing to be a very important energy lender in the space  We ve got really good relationships  We re going to support our customers and to the extent there is new opportunities that makes sense for us  we re pursuing them Gary Tenner    DA Davidson    AnalystOkay  thanks  And then secondly on the HSA business  I assume that there were some associated deposits with that line of business  If so  can you just highlight what the amount was James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerYou know  look its Jim  Those deposits were very negligible  They won t even  Indecipherable  whatsoever  That s a fairly small scale business for us Gary Tenner    DA Davidson    AnalystAll right  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankGood morning Peter Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    AnalystI was just wondering  I was looking at average loan growth  It seemed to have weakened a little bit from the mid quarter update  and I m just wondering  what drove that    what gives you the confidence of the 2  to 3  loan growth in 2020  because first quarter is going to start off  kind of flattish Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankThanks Peter  I will let Pete   Peter W  Guilfoile    Executive Vice President and Chief Credit OfficerI would just remind you again  for last year  we had 4  year over year loan growth  it felt really good  It was across kind of most of our businesses  In the first part of the year  we really saw good loan growth in Middle Market  And I think as we got into the second half of the year  we saw little bit    really in California and Michigan  where middle market slowed down a little bit  But nothing that overly conservative  Texas continued to perform really well So as we go into next year  we feel like our pipelines in Middle Market and those markets look really good  And we feel good about our specialty businesses  Again  we did see a little bit of a dial back in dealer at the end of the quarter  Our EFS business dialed back a little bit  But we still feel really good about those going into 2020 and we feel like we re going to be able to achieve that 2  to 3  that we ve communicated Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    AnalystOkay  And then on a separate note  just one housekeeping  The guidance for net interest income in the first quarter  of down  10 million to  15 million  That does not include one less day count  which I think is about  6 million to  7 million  is that right James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerThat is correct  Yeah  We were simply guiding on the rate impact and we mentioned the  10 million to  15 million  So drastically right  there will be the one day impact Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    AnalystGot it  Okay  thanks very much Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankThanks Peter OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystGood morning Lana  Good morning  Just couple of cleanup questions  one on the fee income side  the expectations for growth in 2020 from the fiduciary side  it was kind of flat in 2019  What s driving growth expectations in 2020 Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankYeah  fiduciary specifically Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystYeah  I think that was one of the drivers of the fee income growth in 2020  Card and fiduciary Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankYeah  I would say a couple of things related to fiduciary  One  that s a business that we ve been in for a long time and a business in which we have scale  both in serving our existing clients  or in the institutional Trust business as well  And then we have a third party trust platform  where we provide trust services for many of the larger broker dealers in the U S  And so we see growth opportunities kind of across all of those various budgets  Fiduciary is also one of those categories that is impacted by the market  And so  optimistic outlook on the equity and bond markets for 2020  The flattish nature to 2019  nothing unusual there  We did have some repositioning with a number of different customers  But over time  that s a business that we have grown nicely  and we would seek for the normal growth in 2020 Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  thank you  And the second question is  can you remind me  do you have a target dividend payout ratio James J  Herzog    Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial OfficerWe do not  Our goal of the dividend is simply to make sure that it is sustainable  That s really where our focus is and obviously  you don t want the dividend payout ratio to get too high  if you have a    what I ll call a normal income stream  which we consider    the stream to be somewhat normal right now  So simply sustainable and strong and we re comfortable with where it is right now Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankJust so to add to that  obviously the last four or five years  we ve had very nice growth in dividend and returned to our shareholders  So we ve been very focused on that and you know  you would expect toward the rate of growth for the dividend to start to slow out for the year Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  thank you  Appreciate it OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankGood morning Brock Vilas Abraham    UBS    AnalystHey guys  this is Vilas Abraham for Brock  Just a quick question on CECL  if you guys could just give a little bit more color on the Day Two impact  how you re thinking about that maybe specifically  as it relates to the Energy portfolio  Thanks Curtis C  Farmer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Comerica Incorporated and Comerica BankPete Peter W  Guilfoile    Executive Vice President and Chief Credit OfficerYeah  So I think the Day two of the impact for    with regard to Energy  we have to look at a couple of different factors  One is  not just our    the economic forecast or how the economic forecast would impact energy specifically  And so  we would expect that there would be modest growth in our reserves for Energy  just like it would be under the incurred  Phonetic  model  But we don t expect CECL would impact that to any larger degree  than with what we see under the incurred model Vilas Abraham    UBS    AnalystOkay  got it  That s it from me  Thanks OperatorI will now turn the call back over to Curt Farmer  President and

146163,367678,CMA,MLB notebook  Brewers  Woodruff  side  likely out 6 week,news,"Milwaukee All Star right hander Brandon Woodruff is expected to miss six weeks after sustaining a left oblique strain during the Brewers  game Sunday against the Arizona Diamondbacks  manager Craig Counsell announced Monday 
That timetable would potentially leave the Brewers without their best starting pitcher until September  An MRI exam detected the seriousness of the injury  prompting the team to place Woodruff on the 10 day injured list 
Woodruff  26  was injured in the fourth inning Sunday while throwing a pitch    the second of the inning    to Arizona s Tim Locastro 
Woodruff is 11 3 with a 3 75 ERA and 136 strikeouts in 20 starts this season  To replace him on the roster  Milwaukee recalled right hander Burch Smith from Triple A San Antonio  Smith  29  was 0 1 with a 5 06 ERA in six relief appearances with the Brewers earlier this season 
  The Chicago Cubs reportedly are one of the teams interested in acquiring Detroit Tigers slugger Nicholas Castellanos before the July 31 trade deadline 
According to the Detroit News  the rumor  has some teeth   and the Cubs likely would move Jason Heyward to center field and slot Castellanos in right field  Castellanos  27  is batting  284 with 11 homers and 36 RBIs in 93 games this season 
The right handed hitter is batting  387 and slugging  694 against left handers  which has been a weakness for the Cubs  lineup this season  Castellanos hit a walk off home run Sunday    the first of his career    then said of Detroit s cavernous Comerica  NYSE CMA  Park   This park s a joke  
  Hoping to get Carl Edwards Jr  back on track again  the Cubs optioned the right hander back to Triple A Iowa  his second demotion of the season 
He gave up a run on a hit and a walk after a third of an inning Sunday against the San Diego Padres  The outing left him with a 5 87 ERA in 20 appearances this season  Edwards  27  who has also dealt with a thoracic strain this season 
The Cubs recalled right hander Rowan Wick  The former catcher and outfielder had a 3 86 ERA in five appearances with the Cubs earlier this season 
  The Texas Rangers put closer Shawn Kelley on the 10 day injured list due to a sore right biceps  The team called up right hander Rafael Montero from Triple A Nashville in a corresponding move and designated outfielder Carlos Tocci for assignment 
Kelly  35  is 5 2 with a 3 00 ERA and 11 saves in 15 chances across 32 appearances this season  He left Texas  5 3 loss in Houston on Sunday after throwing warmup pitches in the bottom of the eighth inning  An MRI that night revealed no acute injury  according to the team 
Kelley had not pitched since July 12  This is his second stint on the IL  as he was out from May 6 21 after surgery to remove two lumps from his throat 
  The Minnesota Twins placed first baseman C J  Cron on the 10 day injured list due to right thumb inflammation 
Cron  29  is batting  263 with 18 homers and 55 RBIs in 83 games this season  The move is retroactive to Sunday 
The Twins also optioned right hander Zack Littell to Triple A Rochester and called up left hander Lewis Thorpe and right hander Cody Stashak  both from Rochester 
  The Detroit Tigers signed veteran right hander Edwin Jackson  who was released by the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday  to a minor league deal 
Jackson is set to join Triple A Toledo  according to MLB com 
Jackson  35  has played with a major league record 14 teams  but he is making a return to the Tigers organization  He pitched for Detroit in 2009 when he went 13 9 with a 3 62 ERA and was named to his only All Star team 
  The Pittsburgh Pirates suspended right hander Keone Kela for two games due to an unspecified violation of his contract 
Manager Clint Hurdle was vague when asked about Kela prior to Monday s game  saying the team was evaluating his status  The team announced the suspension a short time later 
The Pirates activated Kela from the 60 day injured list before putting him on the suspended list  He last pitched for Pittsburgh on May 4 before going on the IL due to shoulder discomfort 
  The Cincinnati Reds placed right hander Tyler Mahle on the 10 day injured list because of a strained left hamstring  The Reds recalled right hander Sal Romano from Triple A Louisville in a corresponding move 
Mahle sustained the injury Friday during his start against the St  Louis Cardinals 
  The New York Yankees recalled right hander Jonathan Holder just short of a month after he was sent back to Triple A Scranton Wilkes Barre 
Holder replaced left hander Stephen Tarpley on the roster after the Yankees optioned the reliever following Sunday s game

interest income  including the benefit of short term rate increase  growth in average loans and repositioning the securities portfolio  Notably  higher wholesale funding  lower interest recoveries  and change in deposit mix might partially offset the benefit Non interest income is estimated to be 1 2  higher backed by growth in fiduciary income and card fees  partly mitigated by reduced

insurance expenses by  16 million from the discontinuance of the surcharge  lower compensation and pension expenses  These are expected to be partly muted by elevated outside processing expenses  in

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Comerica due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Comerica Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates on Higher RevenuesComerica has reported positive earnings surprise of 7 2  in first quarter 2019 on high interest income  Adjusted earnings per share of  2 08 in the first quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 94  Further  earnings were up from the prior year quarter adjusted figure of  1 54  Including certain non recurring items  earnings came in at  2 11 Higher revenues  rise in interest as well as non interest income  and improved credit metrics were recorded  Moreover  rise in loans was another tailwind  However  lower deposits and rise in expenses were undermining factors Adjusted net income came in at  334 million  up 23 2  year over year  This figure excludes securities repositioning charge of  6 million and other non recurring items Furthermore  segment wise  on a year over year basis  net income increased 25 7  at Business Bank  more than doubled at Retail Bank and 3 1  at Wealth Management  The Finance segment reported net loss as against the income recorded in the prior year quarter Revenues Up  Expenses EscalateComerica s first quarter net revenues were  852 million  up 7 4  year over year  However  the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  853 1 million Net interest income increased 11  on a year over year basis to  606 million  In addition  net interest margin expanded 38 basis points  bps  to 3 79  Total adjusted non interest income came in at  246 million  slightly up on a year over year basis  Higher card fees and other non interest income were mostly offset by decrease in mainly fiduciary income and service charges on deposit accounts Further  adjusted non interest expenses totaled  433 million  slightly up year over year  The upswing resulted from higher salaries and benefits expense  outside processing fee expense and other non interest expenses Adjusted efficiency ratio was 50 81  compared with 54 32  in the prior year quarter  A fall in ratio indicates a rise in profitability Solid Balance SheetAs of Mar 31  2019  total assets and common shareholders  equity were  70 7 billion and  7 4 billion  respectively  compared with  72 3 billion and  8 billion as of Mar 31  2018 Total loans were up marginally on a sequential basis to  50 3 billion  However  total deposits decreased 2 7  from the prior quarter to  54 1 billion Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non performing assets plunged 41 3  year over year to  199 million  Also  allowance for loan losses was  677million  down 8 3  from the prior year period  Additionally  the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was 1 29  as of Mar 31  2019  down from 1 42  as of Mar 31  2018 Furthermore  net loan charge offs slumped 60 7  on a year over year basis to  11 million  In addition  provision for credit losses was a benefit of  13 million compared with provision of  12 million in the prior year quarter Strong Capital PositionAs of Mar 31  2019  the company s tangible common equity ratio was 9 66   down 60 bps year over year  Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10 48   down from 11 06  reported in the year ago quarter  Total risk based capital ratio was 12 80   down from 14 12  in the prior year quarter Capital Deployment UpdateComerica s capital deployment initiatives highlight the company s capital strength  During the Jan Mar quarter  Comerica repurchased 5 1 million shares for a total cost of  425 million under its existing equity repurchase program  This  combined with dividends  resulted in a total payout of  530 million to shareholders Impressive Outlook for 2019Comerica has guided for full year 2019  taking into consideration the current economic and rate environment Comerica expects average loans to be up 2 4   The outlook reflects growth across most lines of business  However  deposits are likely to decline 1 2  due to lower non interest bearing deposits The company anticipates 3 4  higher net interest income  including the benefit of short term rate increase and growth in average loans  Notably  higher wholesale funding  as well as lower interest recoveries and change in deposit mix might partially offset the benefit Non interest income is estimated to be 1 2  higher  resulting from growth in fiduciary income and card fees  partly mitigated by reduced derivative income and service charges on deposit accounts Non interest expenses are predicted to be down 3   indicating the end of restructuring charges from the GEAR Up initiatives  reduction in FDIC insurance expenses by  16 million from the discontinuance of the surcharge  lower compensation and pension expense  These are expected to be partly muted by elevated outside processing expenses  in line with improving revenues  technology costs and typical inflationary pressures Provision for credit losses is likely to be 10 15 bps and net charge offs are anticipated to be low  with persistent solid credit quality Income tax expenses are expected to approximate 23  of pre tax income  excluding further tax impact from employee stock transactions Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is targeted at 9 5 10  through continued return of excess capital

146332,367847,CMA,This Is Why Comerica  CMA  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Comerica in Focus
Headquartered in Dallas  Comerica  CMA  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 3 93  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 67 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 75   In comparison  the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield is 2 9   while the S P 500 s yield is 2 03  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 68 is up 45 7  from last year  Comerica has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 25 63   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Comerica s payout ratio is 34   which means it paid out 34  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for CMA for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 23 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 14 31  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  CMA is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-comerica-cma-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200426082,200426082

Weakness among energy company loans could be a sign that overall credit quality among U S  banks has little room to improve  analysts said  Executives from both JPMorgan Chase   Co  and  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co  told investors last week  when posting earnings  that they were increasingly concerned about loans to oil and gas companies 
Texas bank Comerica  NYSE CMA  Inc on Friday set aside about three times as much money to cover bad loans as analysts had expected  sending the regional bank s shares lower by more than 6 percent after the bank reported earnings Friday  Setting aside more money  known as  provisioning   hurts earnings 
 The banks really have very low credit costs and those can go higher   said Fred Cannon  who heads research at Keefe Bruyette   Woods  While  energy overall is not a life threatening issue for the banks  it is earnings threatening   he said 
JPMorgan said on Tuesday it provisioned another  252 million to cover potentially bad wholesale business loans in the quarter  with  140 million of that related to oil and gas lending 
Oil prices rallied in March and April  but in recent weeks have fallen again on expectations that loosened sanctions against Iran create the potential for greater supplies  U S  crude oil prices fell below  50 a barrel on Monday for the first time since April 
U S  accounting rules require that banks set aside money to cover losses on loans only after the loan has shown visible signs of deteriorating  such as a borrower having missed an interest payment  The rules are subject to wide interpretation  however  so that such things as weaker oil and gas prices could potentially prompt some borrowers to increase their provisions 
The hit to earnings from banks  higher provisioning could pour cold water on shares of a sector that has been on fire recently  Since the end of January  U S  bank stocks have risen 18 7 percent  compared with a 6 6 percent gain for the broader Standard   Poor s 500 index  Much of that optimism has come from investors preparing for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates  boosting the rates at which banks can lend and therefore their profits 
Bank profits have been essentially stagnant in recent years  thanks to low rates and tepid economic growth 
JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said the bank  might expect  to add more reserves before this year is out   It is possible we will be selectively downgrading some clients   she said  She described the increases in reserves as  completely normal  in the business cycle   We are still very happy   Lake said 
CEO Jamie Dimon  interjecting as Lake spoke  said   Those reserves do not mean we re going to have losses  
To be sure  credit quality is still good  Wells Fargo said that for its overall loan book  the balance of loans on which borrowers had stopped making interest payments declined  67 million in the second quarter  even though delinquencies rose among energy sector companies  Residential mortgage loans are performing better 
CFO John Shrewsberry predicted energy related credit performance will remain weak 
 We re still resolving these issues   he said on a conference call with investors on Tuesday   Some of them are just coming to light for certain borrowers  but it s a very contained portion of our loan portfolio and the aggregate impact should not be material to Wells Fargo  
Energy exposure accounts for just 2 percent of Wells Fargo s loan portfolio  However  as KBW s Cannon said  the total money the bank has provisioned for bad loans over time is even smaller  just about 1 2 percent  A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment 
 
PLUNGING OIL PRICES
Following an annual exam of loan credit quality  regulators are pressing banks to set aside more money to cover their energy loans  according to a report earlier this month from the Wall Street Journal 
Comerica CFO Karen Parkhill said in an interview that provisions could increase further if oil prices remain low  though this could be offset somewhat if borrowers begin paying down debt  as has occurred in past periods of weak oil prices 
As for why provisioning was so much larger than expected  Parkhill said   we did always say that we would expect continued negative credit migration if oil prices remained low and that s what has happened  
Moody s Investors Service flagged the issue in a report published Monday  Banks it singled out as having particularly high exposure to the energy sector by at least one measure were led by BOK Financial Corp   Hancock Holding Co  Texas Capital Bancshares Inc  and Cullen Frost Bankers Inc  While noting  asset quality deterioration  in the energy loan portfolios of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan  Moody s analyst Joseph Pucella wrote that the exposure of those banks is  comparatively small  
BOK Financial investor relations director Joseph Crivelli responded to questions with a statement noting the bank forecasted loan loss provisions of  15 million to  20 million for 2015 
 We continue to believe that our energy portfolio is sound from a credit standpoint   the statement read in part   Stress tests on the portfolio conducted earlier this year reveal only a handful of customers who would demonstrate weakness in a highly stressed environment  
Spokespeople for Hancock  Texas Capital Bancshares and Cullen Frost declined to comment

activity were witnessed in the to be reported quarter  partly on the U S  government shutdown and other lingering economic uncertainties The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Institutional Client Services division  of which the major portion comprises fixed income revenues  reflects a rise of 2 2  year over year However  the investment management unit of Goldman is projected to have supported

issues related to Brexit  concerns related to unsolved U S  China trade deal negotiations  the U S  government shutdown and expectation of global economic slowdown hampered investment banking

impacted  while its commendable position in the market may offer some respite While dealmakers across the globe were active during the first quarter  global deal value and volume declined on higher borrowing costs and several geopolitical concerns  So  Goldman s advisory fees will be adversely impacted Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the investment banking segment is pegged at  1 7 billion  down 5 6  year over year Investing   Lending to Get a Boost  Improved corporate performance and rising rates are expected to have driven revenues from this source  In addition to higher interest rates  a decent lending backdrop  particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and consumer will offer support to interest income  while weakness in revolving home equity loans  due to slowdown in originations as well as refinancing activities  will partially offset this  Moreover  higher asset values recorded during the quarter might have complemented this rise  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the investing and lending segment is projected at  1 8 billion  down 14 3  year over year Strong Expense Management  Goldman is focused on enhancing its efficiency  while maintaining a strong franchise and investing in new opportunities  As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been slashed by the bank  expense

  Caterpillar warns on third quarter  shares pare gains
  Fed Chairman Bernanke cautious about economy
  Regional banks post losses as loans sour
  Recasts throughout  updates to midday 
 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Tuesday 
retreating after initial earnings fueled gains were
overshadowed by cautious comments on the economic outlook from
company executives and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke 
 Stocks opened higher in a reaction to better than expected
results from Dow components such as Caterpillar Inc  but the
tone on earnings conference calls has been much more
apprehensive  paralleling the Fed chief s cautious outlook 
 Shares of Caterpillar  up 6 1 percent at  38 88  were
still the Dow s strongest  but were far off the day s highs
after the company said it expects the third quarter to be the
year s weakest and  extremely challenging  
 Caterpillar s results showed the company beat bottom line
earnings estimates  but sales fell short of expectations 
 United Technologies Corp shares fell 2 1 percent to  53 84
after the company  a Dow component  posted a 23 percent drop
in profit and lowered its 2009 forecast  The company s chief
financial officer said cost cutting will lead profit growth 
but  we do not anticipate a significant economic recovery in
2010  
  The story  UTX and Caterpillar  put out there is   We
have done a great job cutting costs  we ve done a great job
managing our business and here s a bottom line beat   I don t
think that s enough to get this market going   said Stephen
Massocca  managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San
Francisco 
  If we don t get some revenue beats  this party is going
to end real quick  especially given how overbought we are  
 Further adding to investor caution  Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke said in testimony to a U S  House of Representatives
committee that job insecurity plus declines in home values and
tight credit are likely to limit gains in consumer spending   
a major driver of the U S  economy 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 4 98 points  or
0 06 percent  to 8 843 17  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
dropped 4 98 points  or 0 52 percent  to 946 15  The Nasdaq
Composite Index fell 11 29 points  or 0 59 percent  to
1 898 00 
 The S P 500 closed at an eight month high on Monday  as
the early stages of a healthier than expected second quarter
earnings season increased investors  hopes about the economic
recovery 
 But Tuesday s warnings spoiled the mood 
 Further weighing down the market   shares of Regions
Financial Corp and Comerica Inc  two large U S  regional
banking companies  slid after both posted second quarter
losses  as a deteriorating commercial property market caused
bad loans to soar  Regions  stock dropped 13 4 percent to
 3 50 and Comerica s stock lost 9 5 percent to  20 66 
 The KBW Bank Index dropped 3 6 percent

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  CMA is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-03-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comerica-cma-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200400668,200400668
146368,367883,CMA,Why Comerica  CMA  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Comerica  CMA   This company  which is in the Zacks Banks   Major Regional industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This regional bank has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3 38  
For the most recent quarter  Comerica was expected to post earnings of  1 86 per share  but it reported  1 88 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 08   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 76 per share  while it actually produced  1 86 per share  a surprise of 5 68  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Comerica  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Comerica has an Earnings ESP of  0 65  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 16  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-comerica-cma-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200404304,200404304

146371,367886,CMA,US STOCKS Wall St slide on economic outlook worries,news,"  Caterpillar warns on third quarter  stock pares gains
  Fed Chairman Bernanke cautious about economy
  Regional banks post losses as loans sour
  Recasts throughout  updates to midday 
 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Tuesday 
retreating after initial earnings fueled gains were
overshadowed by cautious comments on the economic outlook from
company executives and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke 
 Stocks opened higher in a reaction to better than expected
results from Dow components such as Caterpillar Inc  but the
tone on earnings conference calls has been much more
apprehensive  paralleling the Fed chief s cautious outlook 
 Shares of Caterpillar  up 6 1 percent at  38 88  were
still the Dow s strongest  but were far off the day s highs
after the company said it expects the third quarter to be the
year s weakest and  extremely challenging  
 Caterpillar s results showed the company beat bottom line
earnings estimates  but sales fell short of expectations 
 United Technologies Corp shares fell 2 1 percent to  53 84
after the company  a Dow component  posted a 23 percent drop
in profit and lowered its 2009 forecast  The company s chief
financial officer said cost cutting will lead profit growth 
but  we do not anticipate a significant economic recovery in
2010  
  The story  UTX and Caterpillar  put out there is   We
have done a great job cutting costs  we ve done a great job
managing our business and here s a bottom line beat   I don t
think that s enough to get this market going   said Stephen
Massocca  managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San
Francisco 
  If we don t get some revenue beats  this party is going
to end real quick  especially given how overbought we are  
 Further adding to investor caution  Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke said in testimony to a U S  House of Representatives
committee that job insecurity plus declines in home values and
tight credit are likely to limit gains in consumer spending   
a major driver of the U S  economy 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 4 98 points  or
0 06 percent  to 8 843 17  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
dropped 4 98 points  or 0 52 percent  to 946 15  The Nasdaq
Composite Index fell 11 29 points  or 0 59 percent  to
1 898 00 
 The S P 500 closed at an eight month high on Monday  as
the early stages of a healthier than expected second quarter
earnings season increased investors  hopes about the economic
recovery 
 But Tuesday s warnings spoiled the mood 
 Further weighing down the market   shares of Regions
Financial Corp and Comerica Inc  two large U S  regional
banking companies  slid after both posted second quarter
losses  as a deteriorating commercial property market caused
bad loans to soar  Regions  stock dropped 13 4 percent to
 3 50 and Comerica s stock lost 9 5 percent to  20 66 
 The KBW Bank Index dropped 3 6 percent

146373,367888,CMA,Comerica  CMA  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Comerica  CMA  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 16  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This regional bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 94 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  22  
Revenues are expected to be  853 08 million  up 7 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 25  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Comerica 
For Comerica  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 52  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Comerica will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Comerica would post earnings of  1 86 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 88  delivering a surprise of  1 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Comerica appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comerica-cma-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200405151,200405151

This San Francisco based banking giant has been embroiled in one scandal after another for more than two years  Troubles have been mounting at Wells Fargo since the revelation of the sales scandal in 2016  which was followed by disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business  online bill pay services  and the Wealth and Investment Management segment  With the ongoing review process of business practices  more wrongdoings may be reported  consequently straining the bank s top line Wells Fargo s mortgage business is expected to have witnessed a slowdown in the first quarter  With interest rates moving higher  refinancing activities and fresh originations have been slowing down  Therefore  no major help is anticipated from this segment  Thus  growth in Wells Fargo s mortgage banking revenues will likely have remained low Further  management expects mortgage originations for the quarter to be down due to seasonality in the purchase market  while production margin is estimated to be within the range of the last two quarters of 2018 Here are the other factors influencing Wells Fargo s Q1 results Soft Loan Growth  Per the Fed s latest   loans are likely to have improved slightly on a sequential basis during the Mar end quarter  Particularly  weakness in revolving home equity loans might have offset growth in commercial and industrial  C I   consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent Furthermore  the Fed s restrictions on Wells Fargo s balance sheet growth due to past misconducts keep limited scope for loan growth Net Interest Income  NII  Might Rise  A decent lending scenario during the first quarter is predicted to have aided growth in net interest income  NII   Also  the December 2018 rate hike will have a partial positive impact on the company s net interest margin despite flattening of the yield curve and steadily increasing deposit betas Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  1 74 trillion for the to be reported quarter indicates slight sequential increase  This  along with modest lending activities  is projected to have been conducive to the company s NII growth in the quarter Expenses May Trend Higher  Wells Fargo might have recorded escalated costs  given its franchise investments in areas  including mobile banking technology  digital lending and brokerage offerings  Moreover  ongoing litigation hassles are expected to have resulted in elevated legal costs in the quarter to be reported Non Interest Revenues Might Escalate  Growth in trading revenues is predicted to have been muted as lingering uncertainties  mainly related to the U S  China trade war and some other geo political tensions were insufficient to induce volatility  However  inflows from the asset management business

146428,367943,CMA,Comerica  CMA  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Comerica  CMA  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 16  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This regional bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 86 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  50  
Revenues are expected to be  864 10 million  up 4 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 05  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Comerica 
For Comerica  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Comerica will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Comerica would post earnings of  1 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 86  delivering a surprise of  5 68  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Comerica appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comerica-cma-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200374065,200374065

146433,367948,CMA,Why Comerica  CMA  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Comerica in Focus
Based in Dallas  Comerica  CMA  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 13 74   The regional bank is paying out a dividend of  0 6 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 07  compared to the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield of 3 17  and the S P 500 s yield of 2 01  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 40 is up 30 4  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Comerica has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 21 11   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Comerica s current payout ratio is 36   This means it paid out 36  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
CMA is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 02 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 11 39  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  CMA is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-comerica-cma-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200376608,200376608

146462,367977,CMA,Will Comerica  CMA  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Comerica  CMA   which belongs to the Zacks Banks   Major Regional industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This regional bank has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 10 56  
For the last reported quarter  Comerica came out with earnings of  1 86 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 76 per share  representing a surprise of 5 68   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 62 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 87 per share  delivering a surprise of 15 43  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Comerica lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Comerica has an Earnings ESP of  0 90  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 16  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-comerica-cma-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200368791,200368791
146476,367991,CMA,Major Regional Banks Stock Outlook  Plenty Of Growth Left,opinion,"Rising interest rates and modest growth in loans and deposits should drive further momentum in U S  bank stocks  which have been grossly outperforming the broader market over the past two years  Particularly  the prospects for major regional banks look bright in the near term as their scale will help them benefit more from a steadily improving domestic economy and the impending easing of regulations 
Moreover  continued efforts to restructure operations and improving asset quality and capital position should keep aiding profitability growth However  the rising rate environment  which should continue driving interest income growth  will keep corporates away from debt and equity issuance and consequently result in dismal investment banking performance  Also  higher rates will make mortgage loans less affordable for borrowers  which will put some pressure on mortgage banking revenues   Nevertheless  uncertainty induced volatility might continue for some time  which will keep supporting trading business Further  digitization of banking operations will result in more cross selling opportunities  This  along with focus on core operations  should lead to improvement in operating efficiency and lend support to banks  efforts to manage expenses  Also  easing of regulations and lower tax rates should aid bottom line growth Attractive Shareholder ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past two years  it appears that the border economic recovery was in favor of the industry  Gradual improvement in operating environment and policy changes were the other factors encouraging investors to bet on major regional bank stocks The   which is a 16 stock group within the broader   has outperformed both the S P 500 and its own sector over the past two years 
While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 55 3   the Zacks S P 500 Composite and Zacks Finance Sector have rallied 33 8  and 29 8   respectively Two Year Price Performance
Major Regional Bank Stocks Trading at Slight DiscountDespite the outperformance of the industry in the past two years  the valuation doesn t look too expensive  One might get a good sense of the industry s relative valuation by looking at its price to tangible book ratio  P TBV   which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next    This ratio essentially measures a bank s current market value relative to what it would be worth if all assets were sold  debt was paid and intangible assets were written off The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P TBV ratio of 2 40  which is slightly above the median level of 2 17  over the past two years  When compared with the highest level of 2 68 in that period  there is apparently some upside left However  the space looks pretty cheap when compared with the market at large  as the trailing 12 month P TBV ratio for the S P 500 is 10 12 and the median level is 9 18 Price to Tangible Book Ratio  TTM 
As finance stocks typically have a lower P TBV ratio  comparing major regional banks with the S P 500 may not make sense to many investors  But a comparison of the group s P TBV ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount  The Zacks Finance Sector s trailing 12 month P TBV ratio of 2 96 and the median level of 3 49 for the same period are above the Zacks Major Regional Banks Industry s respective ratios Price to Tangible Book Ratio  TTM 
Outperformance May Continue Given the Improving Earnings OutlookExpectations of improving profitability with rising interest rates  a decent demand for loans and other strategic initiatives should help major regional bank stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to continue outperforming the broader market in the quarters ahead  Investors may consider the current price levels as good entry points  as there are convincing reasons to predict a decent upside in the near term One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry s prospects for a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies  Empirical research shows that a company s earnings outlook significantly influences the near term performance of its stock One can get a good sense of a company s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with last year s reported number  but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry of  4 55 per share implies a decent year over year improvement  Also  the trend in earnings estimate revisions has been favorable Price and Consensus  Zacks Foreign Banks industry
Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are becoming more confident in this group s earnings potential  The consensus EPS estimates for the current year have been revised 1 1  upward since Mar 31  2018  Current Year EPS Estimate Revisions
Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates continued outperformance in the near term The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  41  which places it at the top 16  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry s rank has remained in the top half of the rank list over the past eight weeks  
Major Regional Banks Long Term Growth Not Too ImpressiveWhile the near term prospects look bright  long term  3 5 years  EPS growth estimates for the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry doesn t seem much impressive  The group s mean estimate of long term EPS growth rate has increased modestly since beginning of 2018 and has remained stable for quite some time at current level of 8 45   This compares to 9 8  for the Zacks S P 500 composite Mean Estimate of Long Term EPS Growth Rate
Since the beginning of 2016  revenues have been improving  mainly driven by rising interest rates and economic improvement  The effect of higher interest rates on the bottom line numbers is expected to gradually reduce    
Bottom LineThe effect of rising rates is expected to lessen in the long run and the operating backdrop may turn into a bit challenging one with easing of regulatory supervision  Also  the support banks receive from manageable expense levels at present might not continue as investments in technology and efforts to find new avenues will gradually increase expenses However  major regional banks will likely continue benefiting from higher interest rates  favorable operating environment and improving economy in the near term  So  betting on this space could be rewarding  One should particularly consider betting on the major regional bank stocks that depict an improving earnings outlook 3 Regional Bank Stocks to Bet OnFifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB   FITB   The stock of this Cincinnati  OH based bank has gained 20  over the past year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year EPS has been revised 6 4  upward over the last 60 days  The stock currently sports Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    You can see   Price and Consensus  FITB

146572,368087,CMA,Why An Earnings Beat Is Likely For Schwab  SCHW  In Q1 ,opinion,The Charles Schwab Corporation   NYSE SCHW   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 16  before market open  Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year Last quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenue growth  no provisions and a significant rise in total client assets  and new brokerage accounts were among the positives  However  higher expenses and a decrease in trading revenues remained headwinds Moreover  the company has an impressive earnings surprise history as its earnings did not lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters  It delivered an average positive surprise of nearly 3 8  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    However  activities of Schwab during the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  Thus  over the last 30 days  its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s earnings remained unchanged at 53 cents  Nevertheless  it reflects a year over year improvement of 35 9  Notably  Schwab s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 35 7  in the past year  outperforming 31 2  growth recorded by the  Will the stock s rally continue post first quarter earnings release  Let s see how things are shaping up A Likely Positive Surprise According to our quantitative model  it is quite likely that Schwab will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter  This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Schwab is  0 31  Zacks Rank  Schwab currently has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsOverall trading activities remained strong during the quarter  driven by significant market volatility  specifically in the months of February and March  Notably  Schwab opened 165 000 and 138 000 new brokerage accounts in January and February  respectively  indicating that investors were interested in entering the market  Also  the company s efforts toward lowering trading fees should have helped in adding more brokerage accounts  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts for the first quarter is 10 936  which reflects year over year improvement of 6  Thus  with growth in brokerage accounts  Schwab s trading revenues might have witnessed improvement in the quarter Further  Schwab witnessed a rise in total client assets and average interest earning assets in January and February on a year over year basis  This should reflect in the company s results for the entire quarter In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets for the quarter is  3 5 trillion  reflecting year over year growth of 18 8   Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the quarter is  233 billion  which is expected to grow 7 4  year over year  Hence  higher assets  along with improvement in the rate scenario  should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter Improvement in the two most important components of Schwab s revenues should support overall revenue growth in the quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to be reported quarter is  2 34 billion  which reflects growth of 12 7  year over year However  Schwab s operating expenses have remained elevated for the past few quarters  Moreover  because of higher compensation and benefits cost  overall expenses are expected to remain high in the first quarter

tax asset related to the recent tax reform  net income came in at  44 7 million or 84 cents per share compared with  48 4 million or 96 cents recorded in the prior year quarter For full year 2017  earnings per share reached  3 73 per share comparing favorably with the year ago earnings of  3 11 per share  Net income available to common shareholders was  187 3 million  up 29  year over year Revenues Rise  Loans   Deposits Go Up  Costs EscalateFor full year 2017  the company reported revenues of  835 6 million  up 19 3  year over year  Moreover  the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  827 6 million Total revenues  net of interest expense  jumped 21 1  year over year to  230 million in the quarter  driven by higher net interest income and non interest income  Furthermore  revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  219 8 million Texas Capital s net interest income was  210 6 million  up 23  year over year  mainly due to rise in loans held for investment  In addition  net interest margin expanded 36 basis points  bps  year over year to 3 47   This resulted from improvement in loan yields  partially offset by high cost of deposits Texas Capital s non interest income advanced 3 2  year over year to  19 4 million  The rise was primarily due to an increase in service charges  servicing income  swap fees  wealth management and trust fee income  along with bank owned life insurance income  These were partially offset by lower brokered loan fees and other income However  non interest expenses flared up 25  year over year to  133 1 million  This mainly stemmed from a rise in almost all components of expenses As of Dec 31  2017  total loans rose 17  year over year to  21 7 billion  while deposits climbed 12  year over year to  19 1 billion Credit Quality ImprovedNon performing assets totaled 0 55  of the loan portfolio plus other real estate owned assets  reflecting a year over year contraction of 52 bps  Total non performing assets came in at  113 2 million  down 39 4  year over year Provisions for credit losses summed  2 million  down 77 8  year over year  Non accrual loans were  101 4 million or 0 49  of total loans  against  167 8 million or 0 96  in the year ago quarter Additionally  the company s net charge offs tanked 95 4  on a year over year basis to  0 96 million Steady Capital and Profitability RatiosThe company s capital ratios demonstrated a steady position  As of Dec 31  2017  return on average equity was 8 18   and return on average assets was 0 71  compared with 10 82  and 0 85   respectively  recorded in the year ago quarter  Tangible common equity to total tangible assets came in at 8 1  compared with 8 5  in the year earlier quarter Stockholders  equity was up 10  year over year to  2 2 billion as of Dec 31  2017  The uptrend chiefly allied with retention of net income Our ViewpointTexas Capital s improved top line and a better balance sheet during the quarter impress us  However  bleak economic situation might hurt the company s performance in the future  Though its inability to control expenses may hamper near term profitability  improvement in margin remains a favorable

146703,368219,CMA,Top Analyst Reports For Schlumberger  General Motors   Monsanto ,opinion,"Monday  December 11  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Schlumberger  SLB   General Motors  GM  and Monsanto  MON   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Schlumberger s shares have lost  24 3  year to date  following the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry s  32 3  decline  However  this compares unfavorably with rival Halliburton s  18 6  decline  But the Zacks analyst stresses that Schlumberger is the largest oilfield services player in the world with presence in every energy market across the world  Also  in all the operating business segments  the company is among the top players  
The firm has been banking on growing hydraulic fracturing work in the North American land market  Schlumberger is also expected to generate significant cashflow from the Palliser Block project where the company will assist Torxen Energy in setting up more than 1 600 oil wells  
However  since 2015  Schlumberger s long term debt load increased considerably  Moreover  the company s cash balance has been declining over the last six quarters  reflecting significant balance sheet weakness 
 You can   
Shares of General Motors have outperformed the Zacks Domestic Automotive industry over the last six months  increasing  21 2  vs   6 1   In November  the United States  the company reported 245 387 deliveries  The company was hugely successful in crossover lineup in November  Its Buick  Cadillac  Chevrolet and GMC brands recorded double digit rises in retail deliveries of crossovers  
In November  General Motors  along with its Chinese joint venture  JV  announced record vehicles deliveries of 418 225 in China  This marks a 13  rise on yearly basis  The company aims to focus more on the development of electric vehicles and plans to roll out 20 electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2023  
The Zacks analyst likes its emphasis on strengthening its brands  increasing retail sales and maintaining operating discipline  However  frequent vehicle recalls  high inventory level of passenger cars and currency fluctuations are few concerns the company has been facing 
 You can   
Monsanto s shares have outperformed the Zacks Agricultural Products industry over the last year  gaining  12 1  vs   11 3   The company believes that elevated sales of crop yield enhancing products as well as premium plant disease control solutions will boost its near term results  
Moreover  deeper penetration of the Climate FieldView platform and stronger innovation will be advantageous  Also  the completion of Bayer  DE BAYGN  s buyout deal is anticipated to open up a number of opportunities for Monsanto  However  commercial rivalry in the global seeds  traits and agricultural chemical industry can prove detrimental  
Also  lack of any research   development as well as unfavorable commodity price fluctuations might be concerns  Over the last 30 days  Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock remained stable for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019

And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation

Goldman s commodities unit  which currently employs about 180 people  had been refraining itself from replacing senior employees in order to control costs Management has decided to shift its focus from controlling costs to improving the unit s performance

The company boasts a weak surprise history  Navient lagged earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters  with an average negative surprise of 2 5  
In the prior year quarter  the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate mainly due to lower net interest income  However  lower provision for credit losses and reduced expenses were the tailwinds 
Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsExpenses Likely to Increase  The company s aim to defend itself against the student loan misconduct case filed against it is likely to increase legal expenses 
Easing Margin Pressure  Owing to the recent interest rate hikes  we expect margin pressure to ease in the second quarter  However  lower treasury yields might offset the benefit slightly 
Benefits from New Acquisitions of Student Loans  The student loans market has turned into one of the biggest consumer debt markets of the nation  Though conditions in the financial markets have been challenging lately  Navient s seeks to acquire student loan portfolios  both Federally Guaranteed Student Loans as well as Private Education Loans  such as JPMorgan s educational loan portfolio  These consistent efforts should lend some support to the quarterly results

While revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year  we can t conclusively predict an earnings beat Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results  let s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter    The company s first quarter 2017 earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  aided by growth in net interest income and non interest income  Further  the quarter recorded a rise in loan and deposit balances  However  on the down side  the quarter witnessed elevated expenses and higher provisions Notably  U S

U S  Bancorp s stock  This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter  However  our quantitative model doesn t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time  Here s why U S  Bancorp doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or at least 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for increasing its chances of an earnings beat  It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative

indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  U S  Bancorp s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsExpenses to Trend Higher  Expenses might trend upward in the upcoming release due to digitization and investments in technology  Moreover  costs are expected to be seasonally higher in the to be reported quarter Pressure on Net Interest Margin to Ease Slightly  Though the lingering low rate environment has taken a toll on the bank s margins for the past several years  the Fed s recent rate hike for the fourth time  since the financial crisis  and its commitment to raise rates faster  one more time  this year  based on a convincing pace of economic growth  will likely help banks get rid of shrinking margins further  However  lower treasury yields during the quarter might curb margin improvement Top line Growth  It is anticipated that an improving economy will spur consumer activity  which will help both payments businesses and consumer lending businesses  An improved economic backdrop should also lead to a rise in business spending on development and capital investments  Further  mortgage revenue is projected to improve sequentially Loan Growth  Per the Federal Reserve s latest data  loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter  Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans  C I  are anticipated to increase  while consumer loans might fall  Therefore  interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally Management expects commercial loan growth to improve on a sequential basis  Credit card  mortgage and auto loan growth is likely to be stronger due to seasonality Activities of U S  Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts  confidence

146999,368515,CMA,Wells Fargo s  WFC  Q1 Earnings Beat On High Interest Income,opinion,Driven by net interest income  Wells Fargo   Company s   NYSE WFC   first quarter 2017 earnings recorded a positive surprise of about 3 1   Earnings of  1 00 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents  Moreover  the figure compared favorably with the prior year quarter s earnings of 99 cents per share Wells Fargo witnessed organic growth aided by strong loans and deposit balances  Higher net interest income was also favorable  In addition  a solid capital position and improving credit quality acted as the key drivers  However  higher expenses and lower non interest income were a concern Notably  reserve release of  200 million was recorded in the reported quarter  driven by improved residential real estate  and oil and gas portfolio  First quarter net income came in at  5 5 billion  in line with the prior year quarter The quarter s total revenue was  22 0 billion  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  22 1 billion  Revenues were also below the prior year quarter figure of  22 2 billion Furthermore  on a year over year basis  revenue generation at the business segments was impressive  Wholesale Banking and Wealth and Investment Management segments  total quarterly revenue climbed around 1 1  and 8 8   respectively  while Community Banking revenues dipped 4 0   Loans and Deposits Rises  Costs Flare UpWells Fargo s net interest income in the quarter came in at  12 3 billion  up 5  on a year over year basis  Increased interest income from trading assets and mortgages held for sale  along with higher other interest income  mainly drove results  However  net interest margin contracted 3 basis points year over year to 2 87  Non interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around  9 7 billion  down 8  year over year  mainly due to reduced insurance  mortgage banking revenue  lower net gains from debt securities and reduced other income  These negatives were partially mitigated by higher lease income  and increased net gains from trading activities and equity investments As of Mar 31  2017  total loans were  958 4 billion  inching up 1 2  year over year  Growth in commercial loan portfolio contributed to the rise  partially offset by reduction in consumer loan portfolio  Total deposits were  1 3 trillion  up 8 3  from the prior year quarter Non interest expense at Wells Fargo was  13 8 billion  up 6  from the year ago quarter  The rise in expenses was primarily stemmed by higher FDIC and other deposit assessments  as well as elevated other and employee benefits expenses The company s efficiency ratio of 62 7  was above 58 7  recorded in the year ago quarter and also exceeded the targeted efficiency ratio range of 55 59   A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability  Wells Fargo hopes efficiency ratio to remain elevated  moving ahead Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo s credit quality metrics was a mixed bag in the quarter  Allowance for credit losses  including the allowance for unfunded commitments  totaled  12 3 billion as of Mar 31  2017  down 3 1  year over year Provision for credit losses was  605 million  plunging 44 3  year over year  Net charge offs were  805 million or 0 34  of average loans in the reported quarter  down from the year ago quarter net charge offs of  886 million  0 38    Non performing assets were down 20 7  to  10 7 billion in the quarter under review from  13 5 billion in the prior year quarter Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position  In the reported quarter  the company repurchased 53 1 million shares of common stock Wells Fargo s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III  fully phased in  increased to  148 7 billion from  142 7 billion in the prior year quarter  The Tier 1 common equity to total risk weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11 2  under Basel III  fully phased in  as of Mar 31  2017  compared with 10 6  recorded in the prior year quarter Book value per share increased to  35 70 from  34 58 in the comparable period last year Our ViewpointWells Fargo has reported decent revenue numbers and we expect top line headwinds to subside  given the improving interest rate environment  However  escalating expenses remained a major drag  along with slowdown in mortgage business Cross selling  which has been the company s major strength in recent years  drew regulators  attention as they discovered that thousands of bank employees were unlawfully enrolling consumers for products and services without their knowledge or consent  in order to receive incentives for meeting the sales targets  This affected retail banking activities during the quarter  The bank has also been subjected to severe political and public outrage  and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well Nevertheless  we believe that over the long term  investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo  given its diverse geographic and business mix  which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth  Going forward  we believe that strategic acquisitions and the bank s efforts to address current adversities will help the company expand its business and enhance profitability Currently  Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Wells Fargo   Company Price  Consensus and EPS

147001,368517,CMA,Is A Beat In Store For Navient  NAVI  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Navient Corporation   NASDAQ NAVI   has a high chance of beating earnings expectations when it reports first quarter 2017 results on Apr 18  after the market closes 
In the prior year quarter  the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny due to lower net interest income and higher expenses  However  lower provision for credit losses and higher non interest income were tailwinds

Easing Margin Pressure  Owing to the recent interest rate hikes  we expect margin pressure to slightly ease in the to be reported quarter Navient s activities during the quarter were inadequate in winning analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter declined to 43 cents per share over the last seven days Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks worth considering in the finance space  as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    NYSE GS   has an Earnings ESP of  0 37  and carries a Zacks Rank  3  The company is slated to release results on Apr 18  You can see

147030,368546,CMA,Comerica Continues Outstanding Performance  XLF Trading Below 2007 Peak,opinion,"Financial Companies Review In our previous article we made an overview of the financial sector and we mentioned that the overall performance was below average as most of the  Top Financial Companies  stocks were in the negative territory since the start of 2016  The acceleration to the upside came during the 4th quarter of the year after the US Election which was as always a driving event as the lows was already in place few days before it  Our dark horse Comerica  NYSE CMA  continued its outstanding performance closing the year for a record of  65  and the stock is approaching a break above 1998 peak which will make the financial services company even more bullish in the coming years  
The so called   Trump Rally   helped the stock market to make it s best rally since the 2008 crisis and the financial sector was the one leading the move with its major companies gains hovering around  20  and  40  since last November lifting confidence around Investors which is always a good sign for the Economy  So if you missed this strong move and still seeking a way to join the bulls don t worry too much as there will always be an opportunity around the corner and you only need to wait for the right setup to take it 

You may have noticed that Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   NYSE BRKb   Top Holder of XLF with 10 74   was left out of the recent charts even it also finished the year with a double digit positive number but the recent rally was a bit slower than the rest  Warren Buffet claimed that purchasing its multinational conglomerate holding company 45 years ago was the biggest investment mistake he had ever made   as if he had invested the money directly in insurance businesses instead of buying out Berkshire Hathaway  those investments would have paid off more billions  The company is one of the fewest Financial Companies that keeps making new all time highs  like JPMorgan Chase and Co  NYSE JPM    unlike others still recovering from the financial crisis which tell us a lot about how strong the bullish trend is  So let s jump to the Elliott wave technical chart to understand the current situation in the financial sector and if Berkshire Hathaway could still represent an investment opportunity 
Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF  Monthly Charts XLF is still trading below 2007 peak but with the recent brake above 2015 highs it opened an extension to the upside which means that the instrument is now showing 5 swing incomplete bullish sequence calling for a move to equal legs area at 31 02   34 80 which clearly take it for new all time highs  As usual  the move higher won t be in a straight line so XLF should be ending the cycle from 2015 and 2016 lows around 24 91   27 24 area before a pullback against 15 04 can be seen  that corrective move should represent a long term buying opportunity in various financial companies that belong to XLF  
We also need to keep in mind that the move from 2009 can also be counted as a triple three structure and reaching the equal legs area 24 11   26 26 will trigger a larger pullback for XLF meaning if 2015 pivot at 15 04 low breaks  the instrument would be seeing a larger pullback in 3 waves against the 2009 low at 4 77 before bouncing higher again   
Consequently  XLF remain bullish in the longer term looking for new highs  However in the near term  the common area for both scenarios around 24   26 could representing a turning point where the financial stocks would see a corrective move to the downside  Berkshire Hathaway  BRKb  Weekly Charts
With the recent break above 2014 peak  BRKb made a new all time high looking for more extension to the upside that s why we are looking for a short term entry for the stock around the 50  61 8  Fibonacci retracement area   154 55    151 52   The Stock needs to hold above the bullish trend line and most importantly October pivot at  141 92 low needs to remain intact so a bounce in 3 waves at least can be seen   
If the bounce fails to make new highs then BRK B could have ended 2016 cycle and doing a larger 3 waves pullback against February 2016 low  123 55 which means the stock will visit the  145 33    140 12 before resuming its bullish trend  The move in Berkshire Hathaway could be leading the rest of financial stocks as it already ended October cycle but with XLF still missing another leg higher  short term pullbacks can still represent a good risk   reward trading opportunity   
Recap   It s never too late to join a bull market if you carefully choose the right time to invest in a bullish stock  that s why you need a very good technique that will allow you to be in the right side of the market and trade with the minimum risk  Constantly  if you are still fan of Warren Buffet company you can look to buy the next corrective pullback of the stock or you can wait for the next long term opportunity in the financial sector XLF among its financial companies as explained above ",2017-01-18,Elliott Wave Forecast,https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-financial-companies-performance-200172801,200172801

147073,368589,CMA,Number 2 s Are Better Than Number 3 s,opinion,"Thanksgiving is upon us and the market tends to slow down a little as the Bond market closes early today and the equity markets close early on Friday   Trading volumes will likely shrink as investors and traders alike kick back to eat some turkey and just as importantly  watch some football 


This year more than most  the pro game has been widely panned   The ratings are down and the excitement just isn t there  I am a bit biased because my hometown team picked up and left while I was in high school and went on to win the Super Bowl  That left a bad taste in my mouth and I have never returned   Instead  I opted for the much more exciting world of College Football 


This weekend we are blessed with several great games  but how can I turn this into a viable investment idea   When you are an Ohio State fan  you have all sorts of ammo to fight that battle  so let s get to the numbers 


Ohio Vs  Michigan


Notice that headline did not say Ohio State  it just referenced the state of Ohio   So the first thing we need to do when comparing the stocks of each state is finding out who has more   So who wins 


According to my rigorous research  Ohio has more publically traded companies than Michigan   The numbers don t lie  with 77 for the Buckeye state and only 18 for the Spartan state 


I don t think the Buckeyes will win 77 18  but I would sure love to see that score this weekend 


Pizza During The Game


A few days after the feast  most of the turkey should be gone  Having suffered from a small overdose of tryptophan a loyal fan of that team up north should be ordering pizza to choke on 


A true fan would only order from one spot  Dominos Pizza  DPZ  as it is based in Michigan   


Investors would also be wise to order up some research on this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock that is within striking distance of 52 week highs 


DPZ is coming off of two consecutive beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The June 2016 quarter was a  0 05 beat for a 5 4  positive earnings surprise and the September 2016 quarter was a beat of  0 06 for a 6 6  positive earnings surprise   The stock traded higher by more than 8  in the session following each release of earnings 


Buckeye fans don t have to like the pizza  but when they see a Price and Consensus chart like this  you have to take notice 



DOMINOS PIZZA Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   


The Baconator


I am not sure if DPZ offers a pizza with bacon on it  but I know that Wendys  WEN  has it on the menu  I mean who doesn t love the baconator 




WEN happens to be based in Columbus Ohio  home of THE Ohio State University   It is also a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and also sports a delicious Price and Consensus chart 



WENDYS CO THE Price and Consensus

   


Keeping Food In Focus


As I look over the stocks from each state I see an opportunity to compare grocery stores   I know this is a reach  but hey  so is the whole premise of this article 


Ohio is the home of Kroger  NYSE KR  while Spartan Nash  SPTN  calls Michigan its birthplace   Both stocks are Zacks Rank  3  Hold  but KR has  A  for both Value and Growth Style Scores   SPTN has a Value stlye score of  B  and a Growth Style Score of  D   




Bank On It


When it comes to financial stocks  Ohio lights up the scoreboard with a handful of banks  


Huntington Banc  HBAN  is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  while KeyCorp  NYSE KEY  and Fifth Third  FITB  are both Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks 


Michigan has Comerica  NYSE CMA  and Flagstar Bancorp  FBC   both of which are Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks   


Regional bank stocks have become much more attractive to investors as the markets look poised for several interest rate hikes in the near future 


THE GAME


Investors don t let state rivalries get in the way of making money   They look for solid growth and excellent earnings potential   You may not like a certain brand of pizza or burgers in general  but earnings growth and price and consensus charts like the ones showed above should get you salivating 


As for THE GAME  well we all know that  2  Buy  is better than  3  Hold  when it comes to the Zacks Rank   Let s just hope it works out that way for my Buckeyes as well

147173,368689,CMA,6 Regional Bank Stocks To Buy As Rate Hike Prospects Rise ,opinion,The timing of the next rate hike has become a topic of contention ever since the Federal Reserve hiked the same for the first time in almost a decade last December  Every time there is a scheduled FOMC meeting or the Fed policy meeting minutes are released  investors start searching for indications for the next rise in the rates Following the release of the Fed s July policy meeting minutes on Wednesday  the chances of another rate hike in the near term seems to be high  Per the minutes   A few participants pointed out that various benchmarks for assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy supported taking another step in removing policy accommodation  The specific timeline for the rate hike was not provided  Notably  the next FOMC meeting is scheduled for Sep 20 21 Apart from this  the latest comments from two Fed officials   the New York Fed President William Dudley and the Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart   indicate that officials remain in favor of a rate hike in the near term  While William Dudley s comments reflected the hike is quite possible next month  Dennis Lockhart indicated that there is a high chance of one rate hike later this year All these have increased the speculations for proposed rise in rates by the end of this year Banks Thrive in Rising Rate EnvironmentBanks have been facing the adverse impact of prolonged low interest rate environment  This has significantly affected their primary source of revenues Banks derive benefits from a steep yield curve  wide spread between short and long terms rates   A rise in short term rates  to which deposits are tied  will help the banks in charging more on loans  to which long term rates are tied   if the long term rates is higher than the short term ones  Hence  banks benefit from rising interest rates only if the increase in long term rates is higher than the short term ones Though the Dec 2015 rate hike helped the banks in improving their top line growth to some extent  a further increase should ease the pressure on net interest margin  Further  as higher rates indicate strengthening of the economy  there is a possibility of a rise in demand for loans and subsequent growth in net interest income  NII  So  with the doors open for a rate hike in the near term  investors should make

147195,368711,CMA,U S  Banks Hold Good Prospects For Long Term Investors,opinion,"There are substantial reasons for bank stocks underperforming over the past few quarters  Particularly  concerns over the industry s vulnerability to a flattening yield curve due to the low rate environment  regulatory hindrance  global growth instability  collapse of commodity prices  and the most recent Brexit aftermath kept investors away  But had there not been enough positives to counter  banks would not have delivered competitive earnings numbers  In fact  proactive actions  technical affluence  slow and steady loan growth  support from an improving domestic economy and many more positive factors might change the fate of banks over time              
 
Moreover  the concerns seem overblown now and perhaps bank stocks are affected more than what was warranted by their fundamentals Banks have learned to take the low rate environment in stride and have earned significant fundamental strength by reorganizing their business models  Moreover  while global economic uncertainty   which has been fueled by Britain s vote to leave the European Union  Brexit    is weighing on the prospect of a rate hike any time soon  it might not demotivate the Fed for long to tighten the monitory policy to the extent it wants  While the global economy might take a decent time to show resilience  the ongoing improvement in the domestic economy might prove convincing for the Fed     At least  the backdrop is not as bad as is needed to keep the rates low for a very long period  Therefore  U S  banks will undoubtedly get a boost from a rising rate cycle  This  along with the strength in core business earned by passing through dragged out regulatory scanners  should help them reach the turning point of consistent growth before long Though the earnings performance over the last few years has failed to garner investors  confidence  the results depict banks  efforts in pairing up aggressive actions  like creating new revenue sources  with defensive measures  like expense control  to tide over persistent challenges  Moreover  banks have earned the ability to deal with crises  as evident by the passing of the Fed s stress test by all 33 banks last month  They can now dodge pressures from the operating environment more easily Moreover  banks are trying to reorganize risk management practices to address potential solvency issues from rising interest rates  Asset quality troubles are also being addressed by divesting segments containing nonperforming assets  Check out our latest  for a more detailed discussion on the fundamental trends  Loan Growth  A Bright SpotDemand for loans is on the rise with recovering economic conditions and easier lending standards  Both business loans and residential mortgages have increased significantly in recent years  Further  the speculation of a higher rate environment any time soon has driven borrowers to apply for loans well ahead of time  leading to increased demand  FDIC s  Problem List  Shortens  The first quarter of 2016 marked the 20th straight quarter of decline in the FDIC s  Problem List   The list contained 165 names as of Mar 31  2016  down from 183 as of Dec 31  2015  In fact  this is the lowest level since the end of 2008 and represents an over 80  decline from the post crisis high of 888 as of Mar 31  2011 This undoubtedly reflects improvement  but the number is still high considering the occurrence of the financial crisis nearly eight years back  There were only 76 banks on the Problem List at the end of 2007  just before the crisis Considering the recovery witnessed by the economy and stock markets so far  the number of problem banks should have been a lot lower by now  This indicates that the industry is still hassled The number of bank failures has nonetheless declined every year since 2010  There have been just three bank failures so far in 2016 compared with 8 failures in 2015  versus 18 in 2014  24 in 2013  51 in 2012  92 in 2011 and 157 in 2010   Though the pace of bank failures has been decelerating  the industry is yet to see an average failure of just four or five banks annually  which would indicate maximum strength Liquidity Standards Strengthens Thanks to RegulationsRegulatory changes  in particular the 2010 Dodd Frank law  made systematically important banks self sufficient  in terms of capital reserves  to some extent  to endure any further crises  So the likelihood of a bailout is now reduced Last year  a proposal by the Fed required the large banks to add another buffer to make them more capable of dealing with future crises and correct their  too big to fail  perception  In order to meet the requirements  six of the eight key U S  banks would need to raise  120 billion  per Fed officials Further  a new set of rules put forth by the Financial Stability Board   FSB    which was created by the Group of 20 nations to keep banks  reckless behavior at check  would make the  too big to fail  notion a thing of the past  The draft rules of the FSB require banks to maintain a loss absorbing capacity ratio  capital plus senior debt total risk weighted assets  of at least 16  to 20   This would act as a buffer should any of these banks run the risk of failure  Though the biggest banks will continue to enjoy low borrowing costs and take bigger risks until these rules are effective  the advantages should wane with time  This will actually make the competitive landscape better for small and mid cap banks Enhanced Focus on Competitive AdvantageAlong with the adoption of advanced technologies to enhance cyber security  banks are resorting to increased use of analytics to drive efficiency  This could help them to better formulate strategies and enhance the top line of different business segments While analytics can elevate their expenses in the quarters ahead  concerted efforts to cut needless expenses should more than offset it Buying OpportunitySince there are plenty of positive drivers amid broader concerns  one can consider buying some beaten down bank stocks that promise better performance in the long run

147196,368712,CMA,Wells Fargo s  WFC  Bid Dismissed In The SEC Lawsuit,opinion,On Friday  a federal judge rescinded the bid filed by San Francisco based Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   to dismiss the U S  regulator Securities and Exchange Commission s  SEC  lawsuit  The regulating body sued the bank along with Rhode Island government agency of misleading investors in a municipal bond offering  which was issued for financing a startup video game company in March  Notably  the former Phillies ace pitcher   Curt Schilling    was the founder of the game company However  the U S  District Judge John J  McConnell Jr  agreed to release a Wells Fargo banker from the complaint  but instantly the SEC said the lawsuit will be re filed and will look into the matter as to the reason for releasing the banker Further  in a separate lawsuit  five existing and former state officials have been subpoenaed for a trial  which is expected to begin in October Proceedings in DetailAt the hearing on Friday for dismissal of the case by Wells Fargo and Cannava  with the denial of charges  Wells Fargo claimed no investors were harmed as all the bondholders were paid to date  Further  the company s lawyer  Luke Cadigan  said 38 Studios  failure in 2012 had started  a process of finger pointing and Monday morning quarterbacking   and noted that the U S  Attorney  FBI  state police and attorney general are of the opinion that the deal has no criminal conduct  No investors were harmed  no investors were misled   Cadigan said  Further  sophisticated and institutional investors bought the bonds knowing the risks Cannava s lawyer said his client s life has been  turned upside down  by the lawsuit   He s a 30 year old banker who now finds himself thrown into this fiasco because he was one of many people  involved in the deal  lawyer Brian Kelly said  He added   No doubt the Rhode Island investors got a bad deal here but that s not Mr  Cannava s fault  However  according to the SEC  all arguments are inappropriate  Moreover  SEC lawyer Kathleen Burdette Shields called it a  simple and straightforward fraud  On the other side  the judge dismisses the complaint against Cannava arguing that the SEC failed to prove Cannava s intentional involvement in the case  However  Shields will file a modified case and look into the matter Notably  Rhode Island Commerce Corporation has not filed for the dismissal BackgroundIn March  the SEC s investigation revealed that Schilling s company  38 Studios failed to produce a multiplayer online game in the market at the stipulated time due to shortage of financing Broadly  in 2010  the game company estimated  75 million for development of the game in relation to which Wells Fargo was hired  Notably  a loan worth  50 million was provided by the Rhode Island Economic Development Corp   RIEDC  to 38 Studios in bond proceeds  RIEDC s interest was drawn toward selling the federally taxable municipal bonds with the expectation of creating hundreds of jobs as it planned to persuade Schilling to move his startup video game company from Massachusetts to Providence However  SEC found that bond offering proceeds fell short by  25 million to finance the game development  which was not disclosed to the investors  Moreover  it was in the knowledge of RIEDC that proceeds from the bond sale will not be sufficient to provide financing to 38 Studios Therefore  on failure to get additional financing  the company failed to bring the game to the market and defaulted on loan as well  Further  it got bankrupt in 2012 and taxpayers were held responsible for the repayment of money Wells Fargo s lead banker on the deal   Peter M  Cannava and two RIEDC executives at that time   Keith W  Stokes and James Michael Saul were also charged for aiding the fraud  SEC said Cannava did not disclose a  conflict of interest   in that the bank was paid  400 000 from bond proceeds Wells Fargo agreed to fight in the court denying charges  However  Stokes and Saul agreed to the settlement to a penalty of  25 000 though they did not admit or denied allegations  Therefore  the case continued against Cannava  Wells Fargo and RIEDC ConclusionBanks across the globe have been facing increasing scrutiny for their business practices  Many of the firms have paid billions of dollars as fines and compensation to settle lawsuits and probes  Many investors have lost their hard earned money as a result of such business malpractices  Such settlements help restore their confidence in law enforcement agencies  Moreover  it reduces the existing litigation burden of banks Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Some better ranked finance stocks include Enterprise Financial Services Corp    NASDAQ EFSC   and Comerica Incorporated

147237,368753,CMA,Will Q2 Earnings Bring Better Luck For JPMorgan  JPM  Stock ,opinion,Better than expected first quarter earnings   primarily abetted by negligible legal costs and effective cost reduction   failed to translate into any strength for the JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM   stock  as evident from its lackluster performance since the results  The sell off triggered by Brexit can be partly held responsible for this weakness  But not just that  it s perhaps the overall business activity of the company that investors found unsatisfactory Things don t look any better for the just completed quarter either  given no betterment in the interest rate environment and tepid demand for loans  In fact  a weak financial market and continued margin pressure might stifle revenues yet again  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  23 8 billion indicates a marginal decline from the year ago quarter    While estimate revisions for Q2 earnings over the last 30 days don t show conservativeness with most estimates moving higher  core business activities might not live up to investors  expectation  So the stock might not have any better luck after the company releases second quarter results on Jul 14    With increasing expectations in terms of the earnings number  the chance of a beat is dim  And an earnings miss will put further pressure on the stock JPMORGAN CHASE Price and EPS Surprise   Our quantitative model also doesn t point to an earnings beat  Here s why JPMorgan doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat Zacks ESP   The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is  0 70   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of  1 42 is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 43  Zacks Rank  JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank  3  but this alone isn t enough to increase the chance of an earnings beat Looking at the fundamentals  here are the factors that should be at play Early optimism on trading revenues may fade away  Based on impressive trading activity in the first two months of the quarter  management hinted at an increase in trading revenues in the mid teens  At an industry conference early in June  the firm s investment bank chief Daniel Pinto said that trading momentum witnessed in March continued in April and May  While client activity was feebler in equities  it was higher for fixed income  However  the firm s experience in June  which is still unknown to the market and not expected to be good for trading and investment banking because of Brexit and other macro concerns  may offset the early momentum Investment banking business likely to remain weak  JPMorgan s revenues from advisory and underwriting may have been dampened by the persistent decline in M A activities and a weakening IPO market in the wake of global economic concerns  Further  continued shift toward electronic platforms may have weighed on investment banking   Mortgage business may have gained momentum  Lower mortgage rates might have given mortgage revenues for JPMorgan a boost  as people may have rushed to get homes financed to avoid higher rates later  However  any significant improvement in outstanding mortgage loans is unlikely as the volume of repayment and charge off of mortgage loans was more than fresh originations  Energy sector lending should not be a big pain  While energy loans are still a concern  the provision requirement should not be as high as it was in the first quarter  thanks to the recovery in oil prices  The chance of its energy loans turning into bad loans lowered in the quarter Expense management remained efficient enough  JPMorgan continued with its efforts to keep expenses at check  There were no major outflows related to legal settlements that might impact the firm s earnings unusually in the to be reported quarter    Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few bank stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination for an earnings beat this time around Comerica Incorporated   NYSE CMA    which is expected to report on Jul 19  has an Earnings ESP of  1 47  and a Zacks Rank  3 Regions Financial Corporation   NYSE RF   has an Earnings ESP of  5 00  and carries a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to release results on Jul 19 BB T Corporation   NYSE BBT   has an Earnings ESP of  1 54  and carries a Zacks Rank  3  It is scheduled to report results on Jul 21 Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ,2016-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-q2-earnings-bring-better-luck-for-jpmorgan-(jpm)-stock-200141104,200141104

147294,368810,CMA,Combi Matrix Skyrockets After Important Medical Publication,opinion,The diagnostics company CombiMatrix Corporation  CBMX  saw weak trading for the entirety of 2012 until last Friday  December 7  2012  when company stock jumped 336 6  in reaction to a publication in the New England Journal of Medicine  While YTD  year to date  gains in the stock still sit at  57   the recent move was a clear sign that investor perception on CBMX may finally be changing for the better CombiMatrix s history as a public company goes all the way back to its IPO at the end of 2002  when the company was initially listed on the NASDAQ at  326 share  While CombiMatrix has now developed an array of diagnostic tests for oncology as well as developmental disorders  the company has also been continuously diluting shares and has not made all that much progress in terms of growth in sales revenue considering how long it has been in operation  In the third quarter of 2012  the company reported total revenues of only  1 3 million  While a positive trend in revenue growth is a good sign for future quarters   1 3 million is simply not enough for CombiMatrix to cover its operating expenses of over  2 6 million each quarter Judging by the action we saw last Friday  it seems that the market is considering the possibility that the recently published research mentioned earlier could provide a much needed lift to CombiMatrix s sales volumes The NIH  National Institutes of Health  performed the largest head to head study comparing something known as chromosomal microarray analysis  CMA  to karyotyping for the analysis of genetic diseases in the prenatal diagnostic setting  as well as stillbirths  What got investors really excited were statements made by the renowned reproductive geneticist Dr  Ronald Wapner  calling for a replacement of the traditional karyotype based genetic analysis with chromosomal microarray analysis  According to his statements  karyotypes provide less information than chromosomal microarrays and hence reduce the accuracy of genetics testing for diseases  Karyotyping has essentially become outdated  replaced by the vastly superior chromosomal microarray analysis Helping this statement were results from the study entitled  Chromosomal Microarray Versus Karyotyping for Prenatal Diagnosis   which enrolled a total of 4 406 women  Microarray analysis gave successful diagnostic results in 98 8 percent of women  and caught mistakes that were made with traditional karyotyping diagnostics  755 women out of the population that had normal karyotypes were tested due to suspected growth or structural anomalies   45 were found to have clinically relevant findings  Out of the total number of women that had normal karyotypes that implied standard indications for prenatal diagnosis  1 7  of pregnancies were found to have clinically relevant information due to chromosomal microarray analysis It s also worth noting that a second study was mentioned in the publication  which showed that CMA is capable of performing genetic analysis on dead tissue  This allows for accurate genetic profiling of stillbirths  which is a big development for geneticists While CombiMatrix moved up over three times its previous market capitalization on this news alone  it s worth noting that the company is still quite small in terms of market capitalization  at  9 2 million  While the cash burn rate of the company  about  5 3 million per year  is eating away at shareholder value very quickly  the market was willing to drastically boost the value of CombiMatrix due to the notion that its sales revenue could jump quite significantly in 2013 Many doctors are unaware that chromosomal microarray genetic analysis is vastly superior to karyotyping  but the publication in the New England Journal of Medicine will certainly draw a lot of attention to this realization  Since CombiMatrix is focuses on diagnostic products that are based on CMA  we should expect sales volume to improve drastically next year as more labs switch from karyotyping to CMA tests  Another trend that could improve CombiMatrix s financial situation is its cost cutting efforts  In Q3  the company s total expenses were 53  higher than they were this year  CombiMatrix has a good chance of becoming profitable as early as next year given that labs begin the switch from karyotype based analysis to CMA analysis fast enough Investors who are interested in CombiMatrix should really be keeping their eyes on the sales growth of the company s diagnostic product line for genetic diseases next year  as well as the company s expenses to gauge the company s trajectory ,2012-12-11,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/combi-matrix-skyrockets-after-important-medical-publication-146986,146986
