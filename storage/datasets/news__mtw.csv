24092,245607,MTW,Add These 7 Value Price to Sales Stocks For Solid Returns,opinion,A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the price to sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry  A company with less debt should have a stable price to sales ratio Current Price greater than or equal to  5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank

24159,245674,MTW,5 Cyclical ETFs   Stocks Top In June,opinion,"Brushing aside the fears of global growth slowdown and still unresolved US China trade dispute  stocks soared in June buoyed by big bets on a Fed rate cut this year  The S P 500  the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite have gained about 4 4   4 7   and 4 7   respectively  in the past month  as of Jun 27   Amid such equity market ascent  a wealth effect is normally realized 
   the wealth effect helps to power economies during bull markets  Big gains in people s portfolios can make them feel more secure about their wealth and their spending   Moreover  a dovish Fed means more months of cheap money inflows  which is expected to bolster consumer and business confidence and spending  which in turn translates into broad based economic growth 
Dovish Fed comments brought down bond yields materially in June  Yield on benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury yield stood at 2 01  on Jun 27  down from 2 66  recorded at the start of the year  Of late  parts of yield curve inverted amid recessionary fears  Investors should note that the Fed s accommodative stance is beneficial to the overall stock market  However  the bump was more visible for cyclical stocks in June  per

24163,245678,MTW,Contrarian CEOs tell the Fed  Go ahead  raise my rates,news,"By Timothy Aeppel NEW YORK  Reuters    Some U S  chief executives think it is time to pick interest rates off the floor  even as many of their peers campaign to maintain the status quo  The Federal Reserve meets this week and the first rate rise in nearly a decade   albeit a small one   is on the table  Most businesses  including over 64 percent of those surveyed last week by the National Association of Manufacturers  think it is a bad idea  Many say the economy is still too shaky to risk it  But not everyone feels that way  interviews with manufacturers representing a broad range of industries and regions  show  Neal J  Keating  chief executive of  Kaman Corp   N KAMN  in Bloomfield  Connecticut  says  a measured  quarter point hike would be beneficial  He foresees no real impact on business investments from a modest hike  and his company would get a boost because higher rates would reduce pension liabilities that weigh down the balance sheet   It would actually remove some of the uncertainty  hovering over the economy  says Mr  Kaman  whose company sells  1 8 billion a year in aerospace and defense parts  including cockpits for Black Hawk helicopters and bomb fuses  When rates are low  the calculations of future returns decline  Many companies  including Kaman  faced underfunded plans in recent years  Scott Wine is another contrarian  who says a rate rise would boost confidence that the economy is truly getting stronger    A nominal interest increase would signal that we re on our way to normalization   says the chief executive of  Polaris Industries  Inc  N PII   a maker of outdoor sports equipment which employs 7 000 people worldwide  He notes that  a rising interest rate environment  is usually a signal that the economy is thriving  This week s two day Fed meeting  which ends on Thursday  was once viewed as a likely moment for the central bank to raise rates for the first time since 2006  but expectations have diminished since a sharp slowdown in China has roiled global markets  NO EASY FIX Advocates of a hike say what is holding the economy back is flaccid growth in demand and misguided policy from Washington  including allowing tax breaks that encouraged capital spending to expire at the end of 2014 and endless budget battles in Congress  None of those problems are being addressed by near zero interest rates    Even with rates extremely low  you only invest when you see opportunities for growth   says Wine   Graphic  Business Confidence   Some are more conflicted  Robert Stevenson  chief executive of Eastman Machine Co  a maker of industrial fabric cutting machines with 50 workers in Buffalo  New York  and 100 at a plant in China  says higher rates would almost certainly hurt exports  which account for half his business  so he is  not enthused  about the prospect of higher rates  Many manufacturers worry a boost in rates would attract foreign investors to buy dollars  pushing up the value of the U S  currency   But as a citizen  I take a somewhat contrary position   says Stevenson   I think it s a problem that there s no savings in this country because there s no point to save   The NAM survey released last week showed larger manufacturers were more likely to want the Fed to hold rates steady  while roughly equal shares of small  medium and large firms said they would like to see an increase  When the Fed pushed rates near zero during the depths of the 2007 2009 recession  it wanted to stimulate business spending of all kinds  A number of studies have concluded that the central bank s efforts staved off a deeper crisis  But business investment has been unimpressive   One broad measure of spending  which includes investments by businesses in structures as well as machines  less depreciation  has averaged only 2 7 percent of gross domestic product since 2010  down from the 4 9 percent average since 1980   Graphic    And there is no sign of an upswing  Duke University s and CFO Magazine s quarterly survey of U S  chief financial officers last week showed they expect capital spending to increase only 2 4 percent over the next 12 months  down sharply from the 5 8 percent they expected in June  Sluggish business spending is a likely culprit in the country s slow productivity growth  and one reason Fed officials have downgraded their expectations for longer term trend growth even as unemployment has fallen to just over 5 percent  half the recession levels  It is not clear  however  why businesses are not spending  Some cite weak demand  others lingering overcapacity that has left factories with plenty of ways to boost output without buying new equipment or buildings    You go to zero interest rates when there s a crisis and you re trying to drive a dramatic change   says Wine  the Polaris CEO   But to hold onto it so long  it s unhealthy   The volatile international environment has played a role too  Since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007  there have been a series of shocks  including the euro zone debt crisis  budget battles in the United States  and now the threat of an

24203,245718,MTW,Why Caterpillar  CAT  Stock Looks Like A Buy Ahead Of Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   have climbed over 13  since Christmas as part of the larger market comeback driven by giants like Boeing   NYSE BA   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    So  it s time to dive into why CAT stock looks like a buy  with the construction and mining power set to report its Q4 financial results before the opening bell Monday 
Overview
Caterpillar stock has suffered over the last year as investors grow nervous about rising costs  driven by metal tariffs  shipping expenses  and more  The company is coming off a top and bottom line beat in the third quarter  but the firm provided lower than excepted guidance 
The industrial equipment manufacturer must also deal with its exposure to China  which could become more of a problem as the world s second largest economy slows down amid the continuing trade war  Investors should pay close attention to any updates from Caterpillar on this front  especially after Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   shocking guidance and Alibaba s   NYSE BABA   projected slowdown  also read    
Caterpillar has committed to lifting its prices to make up for its growing costs  And despite growing global economic concerns  many analysts are still high on CAT stock 
JPMorgan   NYSE JPM   has advised its investors to be long Caterpillar as we move into earnings  The firm has an  overweight  rating on Caterpillar and a  188 price target  which marks a 42  upside from its current price point   From a longer term perspective  our top pick remains Caterpillar as we believe that its resource business is still in the early stages of recovery and should support out year earnings growth as well as opportunities for shareholder friendly capital allocation   JPM  in a note earlier this month 
 
As we touched on earlier  CAT stock has suffered over the last year  In fact  despite its recent climb  shares of Caterpillar rest roughly 24  below their 52 week high  which could set up a solid buying opportunity for those high on Caterpillar  We can see  however  that CAT stock has crushed its peer group s average over the last five years  This group includes Terex   NYSE TEX    Manitowoc   NYSE MTW    H E Equipment Services   NASDAQ HEES    and others 
Q4 Outlook 
Looking ahead  the Illinois based company s Q4 revenues are projected to pop 10 8  to reach  14 26 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  We should note that this would mark a downturn from Q3 s 18  top line expansion  With that said  this growth is projected to come on top of the year ago period s 35  revenue surge 
At the bottom end of the income statement  Caterpillar s adjusted Q4 earnings are projected to soar 38 4  to touch  2 99 per share  Meanwhile  CAT s full year earnings are expected to skyrocket by 69 3   Investors should also note that Caterpillar has earned some positive earnings estimate revisions over the last 30 days   
Bottom Line 
Caterpillar is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  based  in part  on its recent earnings estimate revision trends  CAT is also trading at 10 3X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates at the moment  This marks a discount compared to its industry s 13 9X average and falls well below its own 52 week high of 21 1X and its five year median of 17 3X  Therefore  we can say that CAT s valuation appears somewhat attractive at the moment  especially given its growth outlook 
The firm is also a dividend payer that has paid a quarterly cash dividend of a share during fiscal 2018  up from  0 78 the previous year  Caterpillar is set to announce its Q4 2018 financial results before the market opens on Monday  January 28

24204,245719,MTW,Emerson  EMR  To Report Q1 Earnings  Beat In The Cards ,opinion,"Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   is set to release first quarter fiscal 2019  ended December 2018  results on Feb 5  before market open 
The company pulled off average positive earnings surprise of 3 38  over the last four quarters  beating estimates thrice  Notably  in the last reported quarter  Emerson s earnings of 89 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 26  
In the past month  the company s shares have rallied 9 6  compared with the  s rise of 7 3  

 
We expect it to score an earnings beat in the fiscal first quarter 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise
Our proven model shows that Emerson has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is the case here as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  Emerson has an Earnings ESP of  0 84  as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at 67 cents  higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Emerson Electric Co  Price and EPS Surprise

   Zacks Rank  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat 
Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions 
Factors Likely to Drive Better Than Expected Q1 Results
Emerson is well positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth  as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending  Going forward  the company expects to benefit from a strong macroeconomic environment  favorable trends in its short cycle end markets as well as longer cycle capital investments 
Emerson expects strength in Maintenance  Repair and Operations projects to bolster revenues of its Automation Solutions segment in the fiscal first quarter  On the other hand  continued growth in air conditioning demand and strong demand in cold chain and professional tools markets will likely drive the top line of the company s Commercial   Residential Solutions segment 
Amid this backdrop  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Automation Solutions segment is currently pegged at  2 822 million  higher than  1 967 million reported in the year ago quarter  Revenues from Commercial   Residential Solutions segment are expected to be  1 390 million compared with  1 252 million reported a year ago 
Moreover  Emerson believes that benefits from its restructuring and cost reduction efforts  greater operational efficacy as well as lower corporate taxes will continue driving its profitability in the quarters ahead

24245,245760,MTW,Should You Buy Caterpillar  CAT  Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Shares of Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   closed up marginally on Friday  ending a streak of nearly two straight weeks of losses on the back of heightened trade war tensions between the U S  and China  With that said  now might be the time for investors to consider buying Caterpillar stock based on its currently stellar valuation picture and strong growth prospects 
Caterpillar has been one of the Dow s worst performers during its recent downbeat stretch  which stands in stark contrast to its standing over the last few years  Some investors might not want to jump into CAT at the moment  given the uncertainty about how the current tariff situation might eventually impact the Deerfield  Illinois based company  Inventors should note that Caterpillar said as recently as January that the company didn t anticipate that the Trump administration s policies would spark a trade war 
Amid this confusion  one thing that is certain is how attractive CAT stock looks at the moment based on its relatively near term growth outlook and other fundamentals  So let s jump right into it                       
Recent Price Movement
Caterpillar stock was down 11 1  since June 12  before Friday s small climb  Interestingly enough  the stock is down roughly 11 2  year to date  Still  shares of CAT are up over 34  during the last year 
Investors will see that Caterpillar stock has surged nearly 79  over the last two years  which tops the S P 500 s 31  climb and outpaces its industry s roughly 42  growth  This industry includes the likes of include H E Equipment   NASDAQ HEES    Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX    and The Manitowoc Company   NYSE MTW   
Valuation
Now that we have covered Caterpillar s recent price movement it s time to take a look at its current valuation picture  which looks even better based on its recently plummeting stock price  Going into Friday  CAT stock was trading at 12 4X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks a discount compared to its industry s 15 6X average  as well as the S P s 17 1X  But we re just getting started 
Over the last year  Caterpillar has traded as high as 24 7X  with a one year median of 18 7X  Furthermore  CAT stock has traded as high as 32 6X during the last two years a figure it hit in January 2017  Caterpillar stock is currently trading at its two year low  Therefore  investors should be able to say with some confidence that Caterpillar stock is pretty attractive at its current valuation  Coupled with the fact that its actual stock price is technically cheap  resting well below its 52 week high  CAT stock might just be a steal at the moment 
 
Growth Outlook 
Lastly  Caterpillar s growth projections are worth diving into  since a stock is usually only as good as the company s ability to expand its top and bottom lines  Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Caterpillar s second quarter revenues to hit  13 77 billion  which would mark a 21 5  climb from the year ago period  For the full year  the company s revenues are projected to surge by over 18  to touch  53 68 billion  
Meanwhile  Caterpillar s Q2 earnings are projected to skyrocket by nearly 78  to reach  2 65 per share  Looking a bit further down the road  the company s full year earnings are expected to reach  10 74 per share  representing a 56 1  expansion 
CAT has also earned eight earnings estimate revisions for Q2  with nearly 100  agreement to the upside  all within the last 60 days  The company has also received 11 full year revisions during this same timeframe  against zero downward revisions with two more upward earnings estimate revisions coming in the last 30 days 
Caterpillar is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports  A  grades for Value and Momentum as well as a  B  for Growth in our Style Scores system

24308,245823,MTW,Stocks To Buy   Avoid If Trump Slaps Import Tariffs,opinion,Trump announced late last week his intention to impose severe tariffs of 24  on steel imports and 10  on aluminum imports  for a long period of time   Although the move will safeguard American jobs  it triggered a selloff in the stock market Tariff  A Big Price to PayThe move will be a boon to steel and aluminum makers as it would curb excess global production capacity  pushing metal prices higher  But higher prices will likely be detrimental to the number of industries and overall economic growth  This is especially true as it would not only hurt auto and aerospace sectors but also lead to an increase in prices of a wide range of products including vehicles  pipelines  boats  airplanes  locomotives  and even beer and soft drinks  affecting many industries in the broad market  This would terminate more jobs than curbs on imports create In particular  the restrictions could increase the cost of brewing and packaging beer  thereby resulting in a higher price for beer consumers in the United States  The Beer Institute  a trade group  estimated that the tariff would create the equivalent of a  347 7 million tax on beverages served in cans  This extra cost could equal the  loss of tens of thousands of jobs  The American International Automobile Dealers Association also issued a statement saying car prices will rise and put downward pressure on sales should Trump administration levy the tariffs  The auto sector accounts for 26  of U S  steel demand in 2017  behind the construction industry s 40   according to data provider Statista  As such  homebuilders  which were already struggling with Trump s first tariffs imposed on lumber last year and a shortage of affordable homes  were under pressure from the planned tariffs  This is because higher steel price would raise construction costs  which would force builders to pass the higher cost to homebuyers Further  it could raise concerns over retaliation from China or other major U S  trading partners  triggering a global trade war  The trading partners have already started threatening retaliation  The European Union is weighing retaliatory tariffs on  3 5 billion worth of U S  imports  according to Reuters  while other countries like Canada  Mexico  China and Brazil have also warned of countermeasures  Moreover  the move would further complicate trade talks between the United States  Canada and Mexico over renegotiating NAFTA  Given the threat of a trade war  mega cap companies  which have large exposure to the international markets  are likely to suffer  especially if trade tensions flare up That said  the curbs could lead to few winners but a number of losers from various corner of the equity space if the tariff is slapped  We have highlighted some of the stocks that investors should buy or avoid if Trump makes the final tariff announcement  which is expected this week Stocks to BuyUnited States Steel

24315,245830,MTW,Machinery Stocks To Bear The Brunt Of Trump s Tariff Plan,opinion,On Mar 8  President Donald Trump implemented a tariff of 25  on steel imports and 10  on aluminum imports from all countries except Canada and Mexico to counter an  assault on the country  by foreign competitors  This is a bid to reinforce the American steel and aluminum industries which had long been reeling under the onslaught of cheap imports and suffered significant reduction in production and employment  Cheap Imports a  Threat to National Security  At the behest of the Trump administration last year  the U S  Department of Commerce s carried out investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962  to determine whether the imports pose a threat to national security  Reports were submitted to the President in January 2018  The reports concluded that the quantities of steel and aluminum imports  threaten to impair the national security   as defined by Section 232  In fact  U S  steel imports were nearly four times the company s exports  and that aluminum imports had risen to 90  of total demand for primary aluminum  Six basic oxygen furnaces and four electric furnaces have closed since 2000 and employment slumped 35  since 1998  In the aluminum industry employment fell by 58  in the 2013 2016 period with six smelters being shut down  and only two of the remaining five smelters operating at capacity  despite growth in demand  Taking the scenario into consideration  the Commerce Department recommended that President Trump take action to protect the long term viability of the nation s steel and aluminum industries  Mexico  Canada Exempted The exemption of Mexico and Canada is a significant concession from Trump s initial plan for broad based tariffs on steel and aluminum given that Canada is the largest steel exporter to the United States  accounting for roughly 17  of total U S  steel imports in 2017  Mexico comes in the fourth position with around 9  share of the imports market  The exclusions of these countries are however dependent on the outcome of the North American Free Trade Agreement   NAFTA   renegotiation talks that are underway   There will be provisions for other countries to apply for exemptions provided their imports do not hurt the U S  economy  Will the Consequences be Far Reaching  The announcement has already caused serious friction within the Republican Party and stoked fears of a trade war  It is likely to lead to imposition of retaliatory tariffs on important American exports to other countries  which might hurt the U S economy  The European Union   EU   plans to strike back by imposing tariffs on iconic U S  brands  Brazil  the second largest exporter of steel to the United States with roughly 13  share of total imports last year  also pledged to take  all necessary actions  to protect its interests  South Korea  which comes after Brazil in terms of imports  stated it may file a complaint to the World Trade Organization  China has also warned that it will assess any damage caused by the tariffs and  firmly defend its legitimate rights and interests   Though China only accounts for 2  of U S  steel imports  it is the world s biggest producer of steel accounting for around half of the global production  Its massive industrial expansion has led to dumping excess steel into global markets  Relief for Steel   Aluminium Industry  Concern for Others Per the recommendation of the Commerce Department  the imposition of tariff on imports would increase domestic steel production from its present capacity of 73  to approximately an 80  operating rate and for aluminum it is likely to rise from 48  to 80   These are the minimum rates needed for the long term viability of the industry  The tariffs are welcome news for American steel makers as it will lead to expected lower imports into the United States  which would in turn boost demand for American steel  This will provide the domestic players with more pricing power  However  this move has left have left consumers of the metals ranging from construction  manufacturers of auto  aircrafts and machinery to beverage producers  worried that the higher tariffs will inflate their manufacturing costs  This will make them less competitive in exports market and many have warned that could cut into profits and ultimately spur layoffs  Will the Tariff Hurt Machinery Stocks  Steel and aluminum are intermediate goods and thus the imposition of tariff will adversely affect other manufacturers and hurt margins  Also retaliation by U S  trading partners could hurt companies more reliant on overseas revenues  Another major concern is that U S  farm exports could be hit hard by the retaliatory policies of steel exporting countries  This further exacerbates the troubles of farm equipment makers  which have been battling sluggish domestic agricultural demand for the past few years  Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT    the world s largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment  sells more than half of its machines outside the United States  Per the Director of investor relations  Amy Campbell  these tariffs could hike not only imported but also domestic steel prices  putting the company at a disadvantage against its non U S  competitors  As it is  Caterpillar s supply costs rose at their quickest pace in a year s time in quarter ended December  The company is still assessing what impact the current tariff hike would have on its supply costs going forward  The company has been using long term supply contracts which could be a safeguard against increased costs for six months at most  Another major player in the sector  Deere   Company   NYSE DE    one of the world s foremost producers of agricultural equipment as well as a leading manufacturer of construction  forestry  and commercial and consumer equipment will be affected by this move  The annual increase in Deere s costs in the latest quarter has been the steepest in at least five quarters  Caterpillar and Deere have both substantially improved business model delivering better than expected margin  earnings  and cash flow performance despite weak mining and agricultural conditions over the past few years  Efforts to lower costs through consolidation or closure of facilities and reduction of workforce helped sustain margins  These mammoths will be able to absorb the higher costs considering that the proportion of the higher steel costs is much lower considering they are earnings billions in profits  They will be able to raise prices to recover the higher input costs and deliver strong margins  albeit with a potential lag of a quarter or two  However  smaller players like The Manitowoc Company  Inc    NYSE MTW    Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX   with lower pricing power than Caterpillar and Deere will be hit hard by the policy  Manitowoc is touted to take the biggest hit among the manufacturing companies  The crane manufacturer has been incurring losses  struggling with lackluster demand for its products  It will be difficult for the company to raise prices to combat raw material inflation  Terex Corporation s President and CEO John Garrison sent out a letter explaining  the impact of the rising cost of steel is too large and too sudden  for the company to absorb   The company is adding a steel cost surcharge on its equipment which will cover a portion of the cost increases and will remain separate and transparent from its base prices  Caterpillar flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

looking for 16  growth For investors looking for a way to play the hot job market  Korn Ferry is a stock that should be on the short list Shares at 5 Year HighsWith the global economy humming  it s not surprising that the staffing industry is hot Wall Street has figured it out as shares of Korn Ferry have jumped 75 8  in the last year and are up another 36  year to date Even with the big stock move  the shares are attractively priced for a growth stock It trades with a forward P E of 20 7 For investors looking for a way to invest in the hot job market  Korn Ferry is a stock to keep on the short list  The Manitowoc Company  Inc  finally hit the bottom of the industrial equipment cycle in 2017 but then the steel tariffs hit this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Manitowoc makes cranes and lift solutions in 20 countries  Headquartered in Wisconsin  it provides crawler cranes  tower cranes and mobile cranes for the heavy construction industry Over half its 2017 revenue was generated outside the United States 2017 Was the Bottom On Feb 8  Manitowoc reported its fourth quarter 2017 results and missed on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents  Earnings fell  0 15 versus the consensus of a decline of  0 06 However  the company saw continued improvement in the underlying business  While full year 2017 revenue fell 2  year over year  other fundamentals showed improvement by the end of the year Fourth quarter orders rose 78  to  620 2 million year over year The year end backlog as of Dec 31  2017 jumped 87  to  606 6 million  up from  328 8 million as of Dec 31  2016 Fourth quarter net sales also rebounded  coming in at  481 5 million  up from  378 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016  The majority of that increase was due to increased demand  especially in the U S  and European markets Everything seemed on track for this company to see a big pick up in earnings and revenue in 2018 But then the steel tariffs were announced Steel Tariffs Hammer the StockThe 25  tariff on imported steel sent Manitowoc shares tumbling  The company uses a large amount of steel in its crane manufacturing and Wall Street panicked The stock hasn t yet recovered  It s still down 27  year to date Full Year Estimates CutAfter the company gave guidance for 2018 in February  some analysts lowered their 2018 full year estimates as they were overly bullish 4 estimates were cut in the last 60 days but 3 were also cut in the last month  which is probably a reflection of the concern about the steel tariffs  Although  one analyst has also raised in the last week The 2018 Zacks Consensus fell to  0 44 from  0 57 just 60 days ago Additional content Should You Buy eBay Ahead of Q1 Earnings Shares of eBay have climbed 23  over the last year  and Morgan Stanley analysts just recently  double upgraded  the stock  With that said  investors must still consider how eBay is expected to perform in the first quarter  as Q1 will likely have a greater impact on eBay s near term price movement than Morgan Stanley s positive long term outlook Morgan Stanley analysts raised their eBay rating to    all the up way from  underweight   The investment bank also up its price target from  36 per share to  58 a share  which marks a nearly 40  premium compared to eBay s closing price on Wednesday The reason for this substantial upgrade centers on the fact that eBay  which split from PayPal a few years ago  will finally start to transition away from the online payment platform with a full transition expected by mid 2020   EBay acting as both marketplace and payment intermediator could simplify and reduce costs for merchants  who would pay a single fee to eBay   analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients However  eBay s recent upgrade and year long momentum don t mean investors should consider buying the stock ahead of its Q1 earnings report Therefore  we have to look at what to expect from eBay s first quarter earnings results to let investors decide if they want to buy eBay stock in order to take home some possible near term gains Latest Outlook   ValuationEBay s Q1 revenues are projected to surge by 17 2  to reach  2 6 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Meanwhile  the company s EPS figure is expected to expand by 8 2  to reach  0 53 per share It is also worth noting that eBay has experienced nothing but positive Q1 earnings estimate revision activity recently Of course  revenue and earnings growth estimates are just two of the many metrics investors will consider when eBay reports its first quarter financial results Heading into Thursday  eBay was trading with a Forward P E of 21 9  which marks a substantial discount compared to the  Internet   Commerce  industry s average of 49 7  Investors should be excited to see that eBay offers such great value  especially compared to its industry  for a company that is expected to experience big Q1 revenue growth   EBay has also consistently traded at this earnings multiple over the last year  while its stock price has climbed  This signals that eBay s earnings estimates have also continually climbed higher over this period Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to understand what chance eBay has to surprise with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time Ebay is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and sports an Earnings ESP of 0 31   The company s Most Accurate Estimate the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment calls for earnings of  0 54 per share  which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate Therefore  investors can consider eBay a stock that looks poised to top Q1 earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close

24317,245832,MTW,6 Industrial Stocks With Beat Potential This Earnings Season,opinion,The upcoming first quarter earnings for the industrial products sector looks promising on the back of  the upbeat manufacturing data  strong housing and commercial construction markets and an improving U S economy  Industrial production  which is considered one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks  jumped 4 5  at an annual rate in the first quarter of 2018  It is a measure of the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country  Manufacturing output increased 3 1  at an annual rate in the first quarter  Another positive development is that mining output has increased for six consecutive quarters  Manufacturing Activity  New Orders Remain Strong Per the latest report of the Institute for Supply Management   ISM    Purchasing Managers Index   PMI   was pegged at 57 3  in March  This indicates strong growth in manufacturing for the 20th consecutive month  led by continued expansion in new orders  production activity  employment and inventories  The PMI is an indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector with a reading above 50 signalling increased factory activity  New orders index is at 61 2  remaining at or above 60 for the 12th straight month  New orders growth has been positive for a span of 28 consecutive months  Of the 18 manufacturing industries  16 industries reported growth in April orders  The manufacturing sector accounts for about 12  of the U S  economy  The April PMI indicates growth for the 108th consecutive month in the overall economy  The index for April translates to an increase of 4 3  in real gross domestic product  GDP  on an annualized basis  The Production Index recorded a reading of 57 2  in April  registering growth in production for 20 straight months  Steady Growth Forecasted Healthy order and production levels suggest that the strength exhibited by the manufacturing sector is likely to continue  With the newly implemented tax reform  level of investment will increase and the pace of growth could pick up even further  We believe that implementation of the Trump administration s growth policies  especially the proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement will be a boon for industrial stocks  The ever evolving nature of technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries sustain strong demand for farming and mining machinery  Increased global demand for food will sustain long term demand for agricultural equipment  Further  favorable trends resulting from growing  and affluent population along with rising living standards and dietary improvements will provide ample opportunity for long term growth  Moreover  healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations  especially in emerging countries  are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment  Construction machinery demand will remain strong in the years to come aided by population growth  urbanization  increased energy consumption as well as an expanding middle class  Further  rising demand for global infrastructure  such as roads  housing  airports  and energy will help sustain growth  Impressive Performance  Sector Position The  sector put up an impressive 34 8  growth in earnings in fourth quarter 2018  We are in the midst of first quarter earnings season  investors remain eager to know about the performance of the sector this time around  Of the 83 3  of the S P 500 participants that have reported so far  a 38 4  earnings growth has been recorded on the back of a 14 1  rise in revenues  The beat ratio is an impressive 69 2  for both the metrics  Per our latest projections  the sector will put up an earnings growth of 36 5  while revenues will advance 15 8  in first quarter 2018   Read more    We put our Sectors  all 16 of them  into two groups  the top half  i e   sectors with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the sectors with the worst average Zacks Rank   In the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much   To learn more visit    The industrial products sector  with a Zacks Sector Rank  1  enjoys a position in the top half  How to Identify the Outperformers  The encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies likely to beat our first quarter 2018 earnings estimates  Investing in such companies can fetch handsome returns for investors  This is because a stock generally surges upon earnings beat  But with a wide range of industrial stocks thronging the investment space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better than expected earnings  The Zacks methodology makes the task simple  by combining a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive    You can see  Our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP  shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  And research shows that for

24319,245834,MTW,Caterpillar  CAT  Is Not Only A Strong Buy Stock  It s Cheap ,opinion,"Shares of Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   have soared nearly 54  over the last year  which might cause some investors to think that the construction and mining equipment powerhouse s stock is expensive  But that doesn t appear to be the case at all  Let s dive into Caterpillar s recent price movement and growth projections to help show why CAT is currently a strong buy stock that also presents strong value 
Recent Price Movement
Caterpillar stock has skyrocketed 116  over the last two years  CAT s performance crushes the S P 500 s 33  surge  while also slightly outpacing its industry s similarly massive gains which is not shocking since Caterpillar has long been an industry and an economic bellwether  Meaning that  when CAT performs well  the  Manufacturing   Construction and Mining  industry tends to follow  and vice versa  Caterpillar s peers include H E Equipment   NASDAQ HEES    Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX    and The Manitowoc Company   NYSE MTW   
 
Caterpillar stock is down slightly over the last four weeks  This means  right off the bat  its stock price is technically cheaper than it was not so long ago  In fact  CAT stock currently sits roughly 11  below its 52 week high  making it attractive in the sense that it still has a decent amount of room to climb before it must break into a new range 
Valuation
Another highly important factor to consider when thinking about buying CAT stock is what the company s current valuation picture looks like  Despite Caterpillar s insane two year growth  the firm is trading at an earnings multiple well below the S P 500 average 
Coming into Thursday  Caterpillar was trading at 13 9X forward 12 months earnings estimates  while the index rested at 17X  Over the last two years  CAT stock has traded as high as 32 6X a figure it hit in January 2017  The stock has also traded as low as 13X  which it reached earlier this month  Meanwhile  CAT has traded at a median of 22 6X over the last two years and 18 9X over the last year  
 
The lowest Caterpillar has traded at over the last five years was 11 1X  all the way back in June 2013  With that said  CAT stock has traded at its lowest earnings multiples over the last three years  all within that last month 
Therefore  investors should be able to say with some degree of confidence that Caterpillar stock is rather attractive at its current valuation  if not flat out cheap 
Now  let s take a look at Caterpillar s current growth projections that help make its valuation look so great at the moment 
Growth Outlook 
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Caterpillar s second quarter revenues to hit  13 6 billion  which would mark a 20  climb from the year ago period  For the full year  the company s revenues are projected to surge by nearly 17  to hit  53 16 billion  These top line growth estimates aren t directly reflected in Caterpillar s current stellar forward P E  but this revenue expansion looks ready to help the company s bottom line climb 
Caterpillar s Q2 earnings are projected to soar by nearly 76  to reach  2 62 per share  Looking a bit further down the road  the company s full year earnings are expected to reach  10 58 per share  This would mark 53 8  expansion 
CAT has also earned eight earnings estimate revisions for Q2  with 100  agreement to the upside  all within the last 30 days  Meanwhile  the company has received 10 revisions during this same timeframe  against zero downward revisions 
Lastly  Caterpillar is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports  B  grades for Value  Growth  and Momentum in our Style Scores system

24320,245835,MTW,5 Stocks Stealing The Limelight After Broker Rating Upgrades,opinion,While designing their portfolio  an investor may end up making a wrong choice  This can be due to a lack of expertise in identifying outperformers from a plethora of stocks on the market at any point of time Choice of improper stocks can adversely impact investors  returns  thereby ruining the very objective of investing their hard earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market  In a bid to avoid such a scenario  investors  more often than not rely on guidance from proper channels Broker Advice   The SaviorIn the field of investing  brokers are deemed to be experts  equipped with thorough knowledge  Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent   have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors  They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations   Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding on their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Be Guided by Earnings Estimate Revisions Since brokers indulge in meticulous research  the question of their actions being arbitrary out of the blue does not arise  The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa Given the expertise of brokers in investment matters  it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason logic behind brokers improving their recommendation on a particular stock  In fact  a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa  Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks Revenues Performance   A Key PointerAccording to many market watchers  a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   Therefore  one must take the top line performance into consideration as well while formulating a winning strategy  We have included in our screen the price sales ratio  which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric Screening Criteria   Up  Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks   change in Q  1  est   4 weeks    Top  10  This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter To ensure that the strategy is a winning one  covering all bases  we have added the following screening parameters Price to Sales   Bot 10  The lower the ratio the better  companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio Price greater than 5  A stock trading below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors Average Daily Volume greater than 100 000 shares over the last 20 trading days  Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded Market value

Stocks Stealing the Limelight After Broker Rating UpgradesWhile designing their portfolio  an investor may end up making a wrong choice  This can be due to a lack of expertise in identifying

investing  brokers are deemed to be experts  equipped with thorough knowledge  Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent   have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors  They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations   Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding on their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Be Guided by Earnings Estimate RevisionsSince brokers indulge in meticulous research  the question of their actions being arbitrary out of the blue does not arise  The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa Given the expertise of brokers in investment matters  it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason logic behind brokers improving their recommendation on a particular stock  In fact  a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa  Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks Revenues Performance   A Key PointerAccording to many market watchers  a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   Therefore  one must take the top line performance into consideration as well while formulating a winning strategy  We have included in our screen the

24479,245994,MTW,Caterpillar Or Deere  Which Stock Is The Better Option ,opinion,"Industrial production improved 0 9  in October as normal operations resumed after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hampered production in the last two months  Manufacturing output  which accounts for around 75  of total industrial production  increased 1 3  
With modest upward revisions for July through September  industrial production is now estimated to have only edged down 0 3  at an annual rate in the third quarter  The previously published estimate reflected a 1 5  decline  Total industrial production has risen 2 9  in the past 12 months 
As 95 8  S P 500 participants in the  sector have reported so far  the verdict for third quarter is almost out  These companies have reported 16 7  earnings growth in the quarter  Taking into account the rest of the companies that are yet to report  earnings are expected to grow 18 7  in the quarter  almost in line with second quarter s earnings growth of 18 8  
Per our projections  the Industrial Products sector s earnings are expected to further accelerate in the fourth quarter with 20 5  growth  Earnings are anticipated to grow 12 1  in first quarter 2018  12 8  in the second quarter and 9 7  in third quarter 2018   Read more   We note that the sector is currently placed at the top 25  out of the 16 Zacks Sectors   To learn more visit    This sector has also been outperforming the S P 500 market in recent times  Year to date  the sector has gained around 18 3   above the S P 500 Index s growth of 16 9   The sector has particularly exhibited strength following the election of President Donald Trump  primarily due to his promised pro growth policies  Government policies encouraging better trade relations  increase in infrastructural investments  job creation and high consumer end demand are likely to accelerate growth of the U S  economy 
In this context  we put the spotlight on two industrial bigwigs  Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   and Deere   Company   NYSE DE    Caterpillar  with a market capitalization of  81 74 billion  is the world s largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment and also dabbles in agricultural equipment  Deere  with a market capitalization of  46 75 billion  is the one of the world s foremost producers of agricultural equipment as well as a leading manufacturer of construction  forestry  and commercial and consumer equipment 
While both currently flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   it will be interesting to see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals  You can see  
Other top ranked industrial stocks from the sector include The Manitowoc Company Inc    NYSE MTW   and Terex Corp    NYSE TEX    Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1 
Manitowoc has an average positive earnings surprise history of 139 1  in the trailing four quarters  Its shares have soared 73  in the past year  Terex generated four outstanding beats over the trailing four quarters  for an outstanding average positive surprise of 135 9   Terex shares have rallied 53  in the past year 
Caterpillar Beats on the Bourses

Year to date  both Caterpillar and Deere have surpassed S P 500 s performance of 16 9  considerably as well as the overall sector s climb of 20 2   However  Caterpillar price gain of 49 9  has outshined Deere s rise of 45  
Valuation
The most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two industrials stocks is EV EBITDA  This metric is usually used to compare two stocks within the same industry or sector  It is superior to other metrics such as P E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies  Further  EV EBITDA does not include the impact of non cash expenses 
Both Caterpillar and Deere have EV EBITDA ratios of 12 58 and 13 4  respectively  Both are underpriced compared with the sector s EV EBITDA ratio of 15 92  Clearly  Caterpillar is the cheaper proposition in comparison 
Inventory Turnover Ratio
Inventory turnover ratio evaluates the efficiency of an industrial company s manufacturing process  A high inventory turnover ratio ensures that the company is able to manage inventory effectively to generate revenues and avoid wastage 
This is one of the most important financial ratios  which is widely used by industrial companies to measure their ability to utilize inventories  In the last year  the inventory turnover ratio for Caterpillar and Deere has been 3 19  and 4 91   respectively  While Caterpillar has fallen behind the sector s inventory turnover ratio of 4 86   Deere has scored better  Deere is a clear winner in this round 
Return on Assets
Return on assets   ROA   is one of the key financial ratios for industrials as they rely heavily on inventory to create revenues  Although they have a comparatively low level of net profit  an above average ROA denotes that the company in question is generating earnings by effectively managing assets 
A positive ROA indicates that the company has reported gains from assets for the period in question  Coming to Caterpillar and Deere  ROA for the trailing 12 months is 4 25  and 3 53   respectively  which are below the industrial sector s level of 5 69   This round easily goes to Caterpillar 
Dividend Yield
In a year  the dividend yield for Caterpillar has been higher than both the broader sector and Deere  While the broader sector offered a yield of 1 69   Caterpillar returned 2 25   In comparison  Deere has a dividend yield of 1 61  Leverage Ratio
Deere has a total debt to capital ratio of 81 38  much higher than Caterpillar s 69 59   Both have higher leverage than the industry s level of 46 83   Consequently  Caterpillar fares better on this front 
Last Reported Quarter Performance and Projections
Caterpillar delivered an impressive third quarter 2017 with adjusted earnings per share not only surging 129  year over year to  1 95 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a wide margin of 60  
The better than expected performance was due to strong demand for construction equipment in North America  robust sales in China as well as improvement in other markets and disciplined cost control efforts  Caterpillar expects revenues in the range of  42  44 billion and earnings per share of  6 25 for fiscal 2017   Read More   
Deere s second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings surged around 74  year over year to  1 57 per share  a positive earnings surprise of 8   The company s strong results were driven by improving markets for farm and construction equipment

Earnings Surprise History  Considering a more comprehensive earnings history  both Caterpillar and Deere delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters  However  Caterpillar stands out with an average positive earnings surprise of 53 06   better than Deere s average beat of 19 5  
Earnings ESP  When considering   Deere has a better chance of delivering an earnings beat next quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  Deere scores on this front as it sports a Zacks Rank  1 and an Earnings ESP of 4 34   as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher than the Most Accurate Estimate of  1 04 
Meanwhile  Caterpillar has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is in line with the Most Accurate Estimate of  1 69  Caterpillar s Zacks Rank  1 and Earnings ESP of 0 00   makes surprise prediction difficult  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Earnings Projections  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Caterpillar for the current quarter is pegged at  1 69  reflecting an impressive year over year growth of 103 31   The earnings estimate for Deere for the current quarter is pegged at  1 04  depicting a 70 7  year over year rise 
Growth Prospects
Both have witnessed strong order activity lately  Improvement in construction and cost cutting will drive margins for both the companies  The construction industry has now entered a more mature phase of expansion  and construction spending can be anticipated to see moderate gains through 2017 and beyond  Lately  both the companies  share price has benefited from the victory of President Trump as investors expect his plans of big spending in infrastructure would help boost revenues 
Long Term Growth ExpectationsIn terms of long term earnings growth expectations  Caterpillar scores above Deere with a projection of 10 3  compared with the latter s 8 0

24493,246008,MTW,5 Top Ranked Machinery Stocks That More Than Doubled The SP,opinion,"The scenario for machinery stocks has improved this year with indicators pointing toward healthy operating conditions in the industry  Through November  total industrial production    one of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks    has increased 3 4  above its year ago level  The figure is also at 106 4  of its 2012 average in November In November  manufacturing production rose 0 2    its third consecutive monthly gain  The index for mining increased 2  driven by a gain of 3  in oil and gas extraction  The index for mining is up 9 4  from year earlier level  Capacity utilization for manufacturing advanced to 76 4  in November  its highest reading since May 2008  The operating rate for mines increased 1 5 percentage points to 84 5  Per the U S  Census Bureau report  new orders for U S  manufactured machinery increased 4 9  in the first 10 months of 2017  According to the Institute for Supply Management   ISM    its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58 2 in November from 58 7 in October  Though the index has slipped in October  it continues to signal strengthening manufacturing conditions 
Notably  a reading above 50 indicates improved factory activity  The average PMI for 2017 is currently pegged at 57 4  The November PMI indicates growth for the 102nd consecutive month in the overall economy as well as the 15th straight month of growth in the manufacturing sector  Notably  the manufacturing sector accounts for about 12  of the U S  economy The U S  GDP expanded at 3 3  in the third quarter of 2017   the fastest pace of growth in three years  Notably  it is the first time since 2014 that the U S  economy has witnessed growth of 3  or more for two straight quarters  Per a report by the Commerce Department  consumer spending  about 70  of the economy   advanced 2 3  in the third quarter of 2017 In November  the United States created 228 000 jobs while the unemployment rate was at 4 1   Manufacturing added 31 000 jobs in the month  led by machinery which created 8 000 jobs  Since its recent low in November 2016  employment in the manufacturing industry has increased by 189 000 Strong Construction Sector Remains a PillarThe construction sector has demonstrated stability through 2017 and witnessed sustainable growth amid various challenges  It goes without saying that President Donald Trump was the biggest factor  Investors were expecting faster growth based on Trump s assurance of significant tax cuts  higher infrastructure spending and lesser regulations So far  it has been a good year for the housing market and the trend is anticipated to continue in 2018  owing to improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  positive consumer confidence  a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs  Despite the repeated hikes of the Federal Reserve s interest rates  optimism surrounding the housing market remains largely unaffected Further  there has been a recovery in the mining sector driven by improvement in commodity prices  Miners are resuming their capital investments which are translating to better order flows for mining machinery companies All these positive factors have helped the Zacks machinery construction mining  to grow 59 8  so far this year  higher than the broader market s  S P 500  rally of 20 6   Notably  investing in the industry might sound profitable right now  as it falls within the top 1   3 out of 256 sectors  of the   which hints at further growth What Factors Will Help Sustain Growth Improvement in the mining sector bodes well for machinery stocks dabbling in the mining industry  The continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries keep demand strong for farming and mining machinery  Construction machinery demand will remain strong in the years to come aided by population growth  urbanization  increased energy consumption as well as an expanding middle class  Further  increasing demand for global infrastructure  such as roads  housing  airports  and energy will help maintain growth We believe that implementation of Trump administration s growth policies  especially the proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement  will be a boon for industrial machinery stocks Keeping the positive momentum in mind  here

24495,246010,MTW,Manitowoc To Grow On Strategic Initiatives Despite Headwinds,opinion,On Jan 24  we issued an updated research report on The Manitowoc Company Inc    NYSE MTW    The company is making significant progress in the implementation of The Manitowoc Way to drive four key strategic priorities that will help sustain long term margin expansion  It will gain from the rising demand in the Americas  energy and commercial construction markets  However  excess inventory due to cancellation of an order in India  higher input costs  particularly steel  will thwart near term results  After incurring losses for three straight quarters  which bore the brunt of weak crane demand  the company returned to profitability in the second quarter of 2017  The momentum continued in the third quarter as well  This better than expected performance can be attributable to the company s efforts toward consolidating the manufacturing footprint and reducing cost of organizational structure  Additionally  the results were backed by improved U S  energy and commercial construction markets that helped offset persisting weakness in U S  large infrastructure  Asia Pacific and the Middle East  Third quarter orders increased 21  year over year to  376 million and the company ended the quarter with a robust backlog of  467 9 million  up 32  year over year  This bodes well for an improved fourth quarter performance  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at a loss of 6 cents per share  a substantial improvement from the loss of 92 cents in the prior year quarter   Near Term Headwinds Remain Manitowoc declared a cancelation of an order in India worth about  18 million  After the customer took partial delivery of the order  the Indian government implemented a regulation change forbidding the import of the left handed driven vehicles in the particular crane segment  Manitowoc will try to market this excess inventory in the fourth quarter  Further  the fourth quarter is historically a lower sequential margin quarter due to fewer working days  Moreover  continuing weakness in mobile cranes and commercial construction projects are significantly hurting Manitowoc  Some key international APAC markets remain weak  except Australia   The Middle East remains challenging because of geopolitical uncertainties  Increased material costs  particularly steel as well as constraints in the supply chain are likely affect Manitowoc s results in the near term  The company is facing stiff competition from China based crane manufacturers  These crane manufacturers have undergone product line expansion  primarily adding larger cranes  and captured growing shares of the export markets in Asia  Africa  the Middle East and South America  Poised Well on The Manitowoc Way Despite near term headwinds  the company is poised well for the long term as evident from its significant progress in the implementation of The Manitowoc Way to boost the four key strategic priorities   margin expansion  growth  innovation and velocity   that are likely to aid in delivering double digit margin growth in the long term  Margin Expansion Remains the First Priority  To deliver improvement in margins  the company remains focused on controlling cost  reducing headcount  increasing productivity and eliminating waste  Moreover  it continues to align manufacturing capacity to match the current levels of demand  Improving Competitive Position to Gain Market Share  The company is focusing on not only designing quality and reliability of it products but also in the process of manufacturing cranes  To drive growth  Manitowoc has also taken efforts to strengthen distribution network  Meanwhile  to ensure growth  the company implemented key account management on a global basis this year  which has already started reaping benefits  Evidently  Manitowoc received an order from a large crane operator in Poland that will be shipped in the fourth quarter  Previously  the company had received an order from this same operator in 2008  Innovation Holds the Key  Manitowoc continues to focus on new product development to remain competitive  It also has hiked production and delivery of its newly developed TMS 9000 2 truck mounted cranes  The product has received strong customer response and is gaining market share  While the latest product in the company s pipeline continues to be strong  it remains on track to introduce four new mobile products in June 2018  Increasing velocity in all business processes  The company is striving to reduce the number of days it takes to complete an activity from design through manufacturing significantly  Consequently  Manitowoc s long term outlook remains strong  In addition  it continues to be committed toward reaching its target of double digit operating margins with 150 200 basis points of improvement year over year  In fact  the company anticipates achieving long term target of double digit operating margins by 2020 through continued streamlining organizational structure   Over the past six months  Manitowoc has outperformed the  with respect to price performance on the back of improved results  While the stock gained around 72 4   the industry recorded growth of 48 9   Manitowoc currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Stocks to Consider Some better ranked stocks in the sector are

 1  President Trump Tours Asia
U S  President Donald Trump is on his first trip to Asia  He has stopped in Japan already  and will go on to South Korea  China  Vietnam and the Philippines 
Security concerns in the Korean peninsula and the South China Sea will grab a lot of attention 
But investors will also look at trade talks  with Trump particularly keen to address his country s vast trade deficit with China that Beijing calls unintentional  but which he calls  horrible  
 2  Bitcoin Talk Bubbles Over
Investors  appetite for bitcoin appears to have no bounds The digital currency climbed above  7 000 on Thursday for the first time ever  after an astronomical increase of more than 900 percent over the past 12 months  News that the world s biggest derivatives exchange operator  CME Group  NASDAQ CME   was set to launch bitcoin futures was seen as a significant step in bitcoin s road to mainstream adoption  driving the latest surge in price 
But with high profile investors such as Warren Buffett and the head of Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  saying in recent days that the bitcoin market represents a bubble  could that be set to burst in spectacular fashion 
What is to stop a rival cryptocurrency   of which there is a potentially unlimited quantity   from becoming investors  digital currency of choice 
With bitcoin now worth more than  120 billion  more than Citi or Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   the consequences of a sudden crash could be severe 
 3  The JOLTS Labor Market Survey Is Out for the USA
The Nov  7th release of the September Job Opening and Labor Turnover  JOLT  survey will show whether demand for labor has held up or is in need of an   ahem   jolt At the moment  the ratio of job openings versus quit jobs is close to 2 to 1  hovering in a range close to the all time peak of 2 12 hit in July 2015 
 4  Italian Bank Earnings Are Out
Italy s biggest banks  including UniCredit  Intesa and Banco BPM  report their latest earnings and they could make encouraging reading following the euro zone wide pick up in growth and a strong rally in Italian debt over the last month 
It certainly seems a long time since last year s bail out of problem child Monte dei Paschi di Siena  It is now back in the market  and the main Italian banks are comfortably outperforming their euro zone peers in share performance  so the results round should be telling 
 5  Ah Yes  VENEZUELA 
After what feels like years of speculation  OPEC member Venezuela s socialist leader Nicolas Maduro wants to restructure the ailing country s foreign debt 
Maduro has invited Venezuelan bondholders to a Nov  13th meeting in Caracas to discuss the matter  although getting clearance from the compliance department could be interesting for the bankers involved 
Vice President Tareck El Aissami  who is on a U S  blacklist for alleged drug trafficking  said the country remained committed to paying all its debt but wanted to reformulate terms with creditors  which is likely to mean some lively bouts of price discovery

commercial construction markets  Also  it is making significant progress in the implementation of The Manitowoc Way to boost the four key strategic priorities   margin expansion  growth  innovation and velocity   that are likely to aid in delivering double digit margin growth in the long term After incurring losses for straight three quarters  which bore the brunt of weak crane demand  the company returned to profitability in the second quarter of 2017  The momentum continued in the third quarter as well with the company reporting adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share as against the prior year quarter s loss of 28 cents The bottom line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents per share  This better than expected performance can be attributable to the company s efforts toward ing the manufacturing footprint and reducing cost of organizational structure Manitowoc also witnessed a 14  year over year improvement in sales to  399 4 million in the third quarter outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  381 million  Higher demand in the U S  markets  partly offset by lower demand in the Asia Pacific market drove revenues  Approximately 40  of unit revenues in the reported quarter came from Manitowoc s new products after it became a stand alone crane company   Additionally  third quarter orders increased 21  year over year to  376 million  The company ended the quarter with a robust backlog of  467 9 million  up 32  year over year  So far this year  Manitowoc has also outperformed the with respect to price performance on the back of its improved results  While the stock gained around 61 9   the industry recorded growth of 46 1  Therefore  we believe this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company is well positioned to carry the momentum ahead  backed by the implementation of The Manitowoc Way  Let s delve deeper to find out what s in store for the company ahead   Margin Expansion Remains the First Priority  To deliver improvement in margins  the company remains focused on controlling cost  reducing headcount  increasing productivity and eliminating waste  Also  it continues to align manufacturing capacity to match the current levels of demand  The relocation of crawler crane manufacturing from Manitowoc  WI to Shady Grove  PA  is complete as well  This move is anticipated to optimize manufacturing footprint  reduce costs and stretch margins with an estimated pre tax cost savings in the  25  30 million band  It will also help eliminate significant excess capacity and consequently  help drive operational efficiency and provide resources to invest in profitable growth Improving Competitive Position to Gain Market Share  The company is focusing on not only on designing quality and reliability of it products but also in the process of manufacturing cranes  To drive growth  Manitowoc has also taken efforts to strengthen its distribution network  In September  the company hosted more than 200 Potain tower crane dealers from across Europe and Africa  The meeting was one of the largest dealer summits in the company s history and covered best practices  market updates  and improvements for products  Additionally  it launched a council forum to improve communication between Manitowoc and its dealers  and to improve partnerships Meanwhile  to ensure growth  the company implemented key account management on a global basis this year  which has already started reaping benefits  Evidently  Manitowoc received an order from a large crane operator in Poland that will be shipped in the fourth quarter  Earlier  the company had received an order from this same operator in 2008 In the military crane business  the company has completed the final stage of the U S  Army s testing requirements including a rail impact crash and ballistic testing that is anticipated to be complete by year end  While the program continues as planned  shipments of units are expected to increase in 2018 Innovation Holds the Key  Manitowoc continues to focus on new product development to remain competitive  It also has hiked production and delivery of its newly developed TMS 9000 2 truck mounted cranes  The product has received strong customer response and is gaining market share  While the latest product in the company s pipeline continues to be strong  it remains on track to introduce four new mobile products in June 2018 Increasing velocity in all business processes  The company is striving to significantly reduce the number of days it takes to complete an activity from design through manufacturing Manitowoc s long term outlook thus remains strong  In addition  it continues to be committed toward reaching its target of double digit operating margins with 150 to 200 basis points of improvement year over year  In fact  the company anticipates achieving long term target of double digit operating margins by 2020 through continued streamlining organizational structure Over the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Manitowoc  current year s earnings has moved up from loss of 14 cents per share to 4 cents per share  reflecting eight upward revisions versus none downwards  Also  next year s earnings estimates have surged 86  on the back of six upward revisions versus no downward revision All these positive earnings estimate revisions testifies the unwavering confidence that analysts have in the company and further adds to the investors  optimism in the stock Stocks to ConsiderSome other top ranked stocks in the same industry include Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT    Komatsu Ltd    OTC

24611,246126,MTW,5 Stocks To Watch For Accelerating Earnings Growth ,opinion,Consistent earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings Better than expected earnings results mostly lead to an uptick in the share price  Studies  however  have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement  Hence  earnings acceleration works even better in driving stock price Finding Future OutperformersIn case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates So  what is earnings acceleration  It is the incremental growth in a company s earnings per share  EPS   In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be called earnings acceleration Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance The Winning StrategyLet s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1   The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2   The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3   The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3  In addition to this  we have added the following parameters Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This screens out the low priced stocks Average 20 day volume greater than or

Last week  our analysts parsed 350 filings and collected 43 532 data points  In total  they made 7 185 adjustments with a dollar value of  460 billion  That breaks down into 
2 917 income statement adjustments with a total value of  35 billion
3 043 balance sheet adjustments with a total value of  210 billion
1 225 valuation adjustments with a total value of  214 billion

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
During the past week of filing season  we found a change in accounting policies from Manitowoc  NYSE MTW   a misleading ROIC calculation from Lincoln Electric  NASDAQ LECO  and an unusual tax benefit from Pzena Investment Management  NYSE PZN  
Every year in this six week stretch from mid February through the end of March we parse and analyze roughly 2 000 10 Ks to update our models for companies with a 12 31 fiscal year end  This effort is made possible by the combination of expertly trained human analysts with what we call the  Robo Analyst   The Robo Analyst uses machine learning and natural language processing to automate much of the parsing process

One Company To Watch In 2017
Based on our analysis of Compass Diversified Holdings   Compass Diversified Holdings  NYSE CODI   10 K  we have upgraded the stock from Dangerous to Neutral 
Senior Analyst Lindsay Bohannon identified two significant hidden items that artificially depressed CODI s reported GAAP net income in 2016 
First  CODI reported a non recurring  non cash charge of  17 4 million due to the amortization of the step up in inventory basis from its acquisition of tactical clothing brand 5 11  This charge was found on page 28 of the footnotes  page 157 overall 
Second  CODI increased its inventory reserve by  4 2 million  This change was found on page 31 of the footnotes  page 160 overall 
In addition to these hidden items  we made several adjustments for items found directly in the financial statements  including 
Adding back  25 million in write downs to both NOPAT and invested capital
Adding back  25 million in interest expense to NOPAT
Subtracting  660 million in long term debt and deferred tax liabilities from our calculation of economic book value
After making these adjustments  we found that CODI s NOPAT in 2016 was  107 million compared to GAAP net income of just  25 million  CODI was significantly more profitable than its income statement would suggest 
We still have concerns about CODI  including its negative free cash flow and its relatively modest return on invested capital  ROIC  of 7   Still  the improvements in 2016 were enough to push the stock out of Dangerous territory

24716,246231,MTW,Manitowoc  MTW  Hit By Low Crane Demand  Time To Dump ,opinion,On Nov 23  2016  we issued an updated research report on The Manitowoc Company  Inc    NYSE MTW    a leading global manufacturer of cranes and lift solutions  The current global economic environment is severely affecting Manitowoc s customer demand for cranes Manitowoc reported adjusted loss per share of 28 cents per share in third quarter 2016  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents and the year ago quarter s loss of 26 cents  The mobile crane market continued its downward trend in the quarter with weak global oil and gas market  along with lower used equipment prices  continuing to impact demand severely Backlog at the third quarter end was  353 6 million  a sequential decrease of 10  and a 44  plunge year over year  For the third quarter  orders totaled  310 million compared with  349 million in second quarter 2016 and  338 million in third quarter 2015  Manitowoc has significantly reduced its production build schedules for Mobile products to reflect these lower incoming order rates and align its build schedule as well as inventory levels Further  the company is accelerating the relocation of the Manitowoc crawler production to Shady Grove  taking additional headcount reductions  reducing other non employee costs and temporarily shutting down certain mobile production lines during the fourth quarter  These efforts will negatively affect gross profits for the balance of the year For the fourth quarter  Manitowoc anticipates revenues to decline approximately 25 30  year over year in fourth quarter 2016  Adjusted operating loss margin is anticipated to lie between 4  and 6   The fourth quarter outlook reflects the impact from the weak mobile crane market and the negative impact on planned absorption from the reduced build schedules Overall crane business is likely to be very weak and at historical low levels  Based on current activity levels  particularly in mobile cranes  the company does not expect a meaningful recovery in global demand for cranes in the near term  Uncertainty among customers is mounting due to emerging market peers  apprehensions related to China s growth outlook  persistently depressed oil prices and sluggish domestic growth  The company is witnessing particularly soft demand for mobile cranes  primarily due to repressed market performance  especially in the U S  and the Middle East due to a a weak oil and gas sector  Headwinds from oil   gas markets  which account for approximately 20  of crane sales  will persist in the rest of the quarters of 2016 as well Manitowoc currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The estimates for the company for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 has moved south in the past 30 days  reflecting this headwinds  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2016 is at a loss of 15 cents per share and for the full year is at a loss of 40 cents per share   Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the same sector include ACCO Brands Corporation   NYSE ACCO    EnerSys   NYSE ENS   and John Bean Technologies Corporation   NYSE JBT    ACCO Brands Corporation witnessed a 4  increase in earnings estimates in the last 30 days  The company sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see EnerSys also sports a Zacks Rank  1 and its earnings estimates have also gone up 4  in the last 30 days  John Bean Technologies  another Zacks Rank  1 stock  has seen earnings estimates move north by 2  Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Tale of the Tape  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-11-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/manitowoc-(mtw)-hit-by-low-crane-demand:-time-to-dump-200166504,200166504
24717,246232,MTW,Manitowoc Company  MTW  Is In Overbought Territory  What s Next ,opinion,"The Manitowoc Company  Inc    NYSE MTW   has moved higher as of late  but there could definitely be trouble on the horizon for this company  That is because MTW is now in overbought territory with an RSI value of 71 53 
What is RSI         
RSI stands for  Relative Strength Index  and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors  It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down  readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought  while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present 
Other Factors
Yet MTW s high RSI value isn t the only reason for investors to be concerned  as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions in Manitowoc Company s stock as of late  This is especially true when investors dive into some of these revisions in order to get a better picture of MTW s prospects for the near term 
Over the past two months  investors have witnessed 8 earnings estimates revision lower compared to none higher for the current year  The consensus estimate for MTW has also been on a downward trend over the same time period too  as the estimate has fallen from   0 08 share two months ago to just   0 40 share today 
If this wasn t enough  Manitowoc Company also has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell which puts it into unfortunate company among its peers  So  given all of these factors  investors may want to consider exiting this stock now before it falls back to Earth  You can see

24751,246266,MTW,Most Attractive And Most Dangerous Stocks Lists  June 2015,opinion,"Recap from May Picks
Our Most Attractive Stocks   2 5   outperformed the S P 500   1 5   last month  Most Attractive Large Cap stock Goodyear Tire   Rubber  NASDAQ GT  gained 16  and Most Attractive Small Cap stock Triple S Management Corp  NYSE GTS  was up nearly 25   Overall  19 out of the 40 Most Attractive stocks outperformed the S P 500 in May 
Our Most Dangerous Stocks  1 5   rose slightly less than the S P 500  1 5   last month  Most Dangerous Small Cap stock and 3 23 15 Danger Zone pick El Pollo Loco Holdings  NASDAQ LOCO  fell by 20  and Most Dangerous Large Cap Stock Manitowoc  NYSE MTW  fell by 2   Overall  20 out of the 40 Most Dangerous stocks outperformed the S P 500 in May 
The successes of the Most Attractive and Most Dangerous stocks highlight the value of our forensic accounting  Being a true value investor is an increasingly difficult  if not impossible  task considering the amount of data contained in the ever longer annual reports 
20 new stocks make our Most Attractive list this month and 21 new stocks fall onto the Most Dangerous list this month 
Our Most Attractive stocks have high and rising return on invested capital  ROIC  and low price to economic book value ratios  Most Dangerous stocks have misleading earnings and long growth appreciation periods implied by their market valuations 
Most Attractive Stock Feature for June  RPX Corporation  RPXC    16 share 
RPX Corporation  NASDAQ RPXC   provider of patent management services  is one of the additions to our Most Attractive stocks for June  Despite RPX Corporation s strong underlying fundamentals  the stock remains undervalued and has excellent upside 
RPX Corporation boasts a ROIC of 27   placing it in the top quintile of all the companies we cover  Such a high ROIC is a great sign of the company s ability to generate returns on the money being invested into the business  In addition to an excellent ROIC  RPX Corporation has grown its after tax profit  NOPAT  by 7  compounded annually since 2011 
On a trailing twelve month basis  TTM   RPX Corporation has grown its NOPAT by 31   while also increasing its ROIC over 2014 levels  The company increased its free cash flow to  44 million on a TTM basis  giving the company a 7 4  free cash flow yield 
Despite the growing patent litigation industry and RPX Corporation s strong business fundamentals  the stock price is down 4  over the past year  This drop puts shares below their economic book value  At its current price of   16 share  RPXC has a price to economic book value ratio  PEBV  of 0 9  which means the market expects RPX Corporation s NOPAT to permanently decline by 10  
Those expectations seem rather pessimistic when considering RPX Corporation has grown NOPAT by 7  compounded annually since 2011 and over 31  in the past twelve months 
If RPX Corporation can grow NOPAT by 8  compounded annually over the next six years  the stock is worth  20 share today   a 25  upside  Undervalued companies are increasingly harder to find  Investors should take a close look at RPXC 
Most Dangerous Stock Feature  Triumph Group  Inc   TGI    68 share 
Triumph Group  Inc   NYSE TGI   an aerospace designer and manufacturer  is one of the additions to our Most Dangerous stocks for June  The stock is dangerously overvalued  considering the market has not yet priced in the company s declining fundamentals 
Despite increasing revenue at a 4  compounded annual rate since 2012  Triumph s after tax profit  NOPAT  has declined by 17  compounded annually  Narrowing pre tax  NOPBT  margins  from 14  in 2012 to 7  in 2015  caused profits to drop precipitously even while revenues rose 
Figure 1  Rising Revenue Obscures Falling ProfitsSources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Not surprisingly  the company s ROIC has fallen as well  from 8  in 2012 to a bottom quintile 3  in 2015 
Forensic Accounting Reveals Overstated EPS
Triumph Group currently trades at a hefty price despite its deteriorating fundamentals  This disconnect between price and profits appears to be a result of too much reliance on reported earnings  After removing over  80 million in non operating income from the income statement  largely from gains on legal settlements  we see that the true recurring cash flows of the business declined in 2015  This decline runs counter to revenue and the reported 15  increase in net income  Forensic accounting is increasingly needed to protect investors from accounting shenanigans 
Why TGI is Not a Stock to Consider Buying
Taking all the above into account  Triumph Group s expensive valuation looks very risky  Our DCF models explain just how overvalued some stocks can be  To justify its current price of   68 share  Triumph Group must grow NOPAT by 7  compounded annually for the next 24 years  Considering that Triumph Group s NOPAT has been decreasing for the past 5 years  betting on the company to reverse its declining profits and sustain new profit growth for such an extended period of time seems like a risky bet  Why take so much risk in TGI when you have an alternative like RPXC

24756,246271,MTW,Dome Patterns Now Abound On Indexes  ETFs  Stocks,opinion,"During the throes of the 2008 bear market  I looked back at the Russell 2000 aghast and wondered to myself  how could I have missed something this obvious  Not to say that I wasn t short and having a great year  On the contrary  it was  not surprisingly  the best trading year of my life  But the clarity of the pattern made me wonder why I didn t just pour my life savings into RUT puts and make a quadruple digit percentage gain 

I vowed never to let something so  obvious  get away from me again 
Hence my fortitude with respect to the current market  In spite of countertrend rallies  sometimes  like yesterday  multiple ones in the course of a single trading session   I am standing firm  I have my portfolio scattered  at the moment  over 136 different short positions  and I m probably going to expand that to 150  There are simply too many good charts 
The guiding light to all of these positions is the huge dome pattern found on index after index  ETF after ETF  For instance  the NASDAQ Composite 

The Dow Industrials 

And the S P 100 

For some bizarre reason  I have vowed to myself not to hold ETF positions overnight  but instead focus strictly on the very best individual equity positions  One example among these 136 is Manitowoc  N MTW   which after hours is down about 6  as of this post ",2015-10-15,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/under-the-dome-268159,268159

I want to share six ETFs and my disposition toward each  short and sweet  First up is the triple bearish on miners symbol  N DUST   on which I am bullish  as we appear to be heading toward a quadruple bottom 

On Emerging Markets  I am bearish  as we approach the underside of a pattern failed pattern 

On the euro  and the yen  for that matter   I am bullish  with an eye toward a full velocity escape of the triangle pattern 

On junior miners  I am bearish 

I am bearish on the Dow Industrials  diamonds  

On the UltraPro S P500  I am also bearish  no surprise  eh

The world s largest economy holds approximately 17 1  of the global gross domestic product  GDP   on a purchasing power parity  PPP  basis  in 2012  Next in the ranking are China and India  with respective GDP share of 14 9  and 6 4   Machinery shipments increased by 2 9  in the initial three months of 2014  according to the U S  Census Bureau report published in May 2014  Shipments for industrial and metalworking machinery rose by 22 2  and 8 7   respectively  while that for farm as well as construction machinery fell by 6 3   New machinery orders were up 6 4  while order backlog grew 9 2   Export demand has been considered a key factor for the U S  machinery industry  In 2013  the country s construction and agricultural equipment exports fell 25  and 6  year over year respectively  according to a report published by the Association of Equipment Manufacturers  AEM   However in the coming years  the U S  is expected to witness growing international demand for technologically advanced construction and agriculture equipments  Unemployment  though a continually disturbing factor  has showed signs of improvement in Apr 2014  As per the latest report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  job additions in April were 288 000  increasing from 203 000 added in March  The unemployment rate has fallen 40 basis points  bps  to 6 3   On an average  job additions in the last three months  April  March and February  were 238 000  This latest job report strengthens the view that the Federal Reserve will continue to taper its quantitative easing program  Besides positive signs from the labor market  there is a glimmer of hope emanating from the evidence of growing demand in the housing as well as durable goods markets  Conditions in the credit markets are also improving slowly 
Japanese Markets
The recovery noticed in the Japanese economy in the past few quarters was primarily triggered by economic policies undertaken by the government  recovery in capital spending and higher machinery orders from private sector and manufacturing industries  The country increased its sales tax by 3  effective Apr 2014  with a view to curb its growing debt levels  This measure is expected to drive growth in the medium to long term  However  the latest report by Japan s Cabinet Office shows that total machinery orders in Feb 2014 fell 5 9  from the prior month  Private sector machinery order  excluding volatile orders from ships and electric power companies  or core machinery order were down by 8 8   raising concerns over the future of capital investments by companies  Orders from governments and overseas clients increased 6 2  and 2 4   respectively  The weak order trends and the nervousness regarding the impact of sales tax hike on demand of goods compelled the Bank of Japan to lower its real GDP growth forecast to 1 1  for fiscal 2014  ending Mar 2015   from the earlier expectation of 1 4   Also  the IMF has lowered its growth forecast for the economy by 30 bps to 1 4  for 2014

24796,246311,MTW,Cyclical and Turnaround Stocks  There Is A Lot Of Value In This Market  ,opinion,This article represents the final installment in our  There Is A Lot of Value In This Market  series  Links to   In some ways  this article represents prima fascia evidence supporting some of our main hypotheses  First of all  this article will clearly support the notion that not all common stock are the same  and therefore  they should all not be painted with the same broad brush stroke  generalities or opinions   The examples in this article will clearly illustrate just how different individual companies are  Therefore  this further validates the notion that each company should be evaluated on its own individual merit  thereby validating the concept that it is a market of stocks and not a stock market Furthermore  this article will present a significant challenge regarding how to properly calculate fair valuation on cyclical or semi cyclical companies  The real issue with cyclical companies is having the confidence regarding what future earnings might be  In other words  even when consensus estimates are positive  the prudent investor must ask themselves   how long can it last  Moreover  the answer can vary dramatically from one company to the next  In other words  depending on exactly how cyclical the company is and how cyclical its industry is  will ultimately determine whether earnings are to continue rising for a while or suddenly fall out of bed  This is the treachery with investing in cyclical stocks  Sometimes they can be very rewarding  and sometimes they can cut the legs right out of your portfolio s performance Turnaround Stocks  High Risk or High Reward The first equity classification we are going to look at we will define as turnaround situations  This implies a company that  after struggling with significant operating issues  is set to turn its business around  It s important to state  that these are typically not your everyday buy and hold kind of stocks  Instead  these tend to be higher risk opportunities that will often only warrant a short term holding  To put this into perspective  these are the situations that offer a high degree of profit potential  but simultaneously at a high degree of risk  Consequently  they would not be for consideration as a core holding  that might represent opportunities for what some investors like to call their play money Is Goodyear Tire   Rubber  GT  A Turnaround Opportunity Our first example will be Goodyear Tire   Rubber  A quick glance at the 20 year F A S T  Graphs  on this company tells us a great deal about its business instantaneously  For example  we can see that it has been very challenging for this company to maintain any type of profitability  We see that profits began collapsing in the late 1990s  and we also see that price followed  This validates the idea that earnings determine market price in the long run  Another important perspective that this graphic illustrates is how the company quit paying its dividend in 2003  The light blue shaded area indicates dividends  and visually we see that they disappear Since 2003 we see a very cyclical and spotty record of earnings volatility  This begs an important question that a prudent investor should ask  How much can I trust this company s future earnings potential  In other words  forecasting future earnings for this company would be very difficult  to say the least  A quick look at the long term track record of this company with deteriorating long term earnings results validates our notion that this is not a buy and hold candidate  If you are an investor that believes that the strategy buy and hold is dead  then this company could be your poster child  As the performance report reveals  this company has destroyed shareholder value since 1994 Yet  and on the other hand  after a company has generated very weak results  it can often be very easy to generate very high future growth if the business has any earnings power at all  Therefore  our next graph on Goodyear shows an extremely high rate of earnings growth simply because earnings are coming off of such a low base  But  and this is a very important but  we believe this also represents a classic example of how statistics  or put another way  a representation based on just numbers  can be very misleading  Because  it is a fact that since 2010  Goodyear has generated an extraordinary earnings growth rate in excess of 45  per annum Furthermore an observation that we have noticed after reviewing thousands of examples  is that future earnings estimates will tend to have a built in bias based on recent results  In the case of Goodyear  the consensus earnings estimates of nine analysts reporting to Capital IQ estimate five year earnings growth of 46 3  per annum  a number that is very close to what it has achieved over the past four years or so Microsoft MSN Goodyear Tire Forecast From ZacksA cross check look from another source corroborates what Capital IQ analysts are forecasting  Below is a screenshot from Microsoft MSN illustrating the consensus five year estimated earnings growth rate on Goodyear by seven analysts reporting to Zacks  Interestingly  the estimate is identical to Capital IQ  However  it seems too much of a coincidence that this number mirrors recent history so closely to not consider it biased General Electric  GE   A Turnaround That Is SucceedingWhen we look at the long term operating history of General Electric we see a company that was once a classic example  or even the epitome  of a blue chip dividend growth stock  However  since the company had built in a very large financial division  everything changed as the financial industry instigated the great recession of 2008  As we can clearly see  General Electric s earnings collapsed during 2008 and 2009  However  earnings growth has been recovering since  as we will see with our next graphic Since calendar year 2010  General Electric s earnings have staged a very respectable rebound averaging growth of 12 3  per annum  It s also very important and useful to note that stock price has followed suit and has closely tracked the resurgence in earnings growth  Also  notice that the great recession that actually brought General Electric s stock price in line with fair value based on these resurging earnings As a result of the turnaround in General Electric s business  investors who had the foresight to buy the company expecting a turnaround were well rewarded  After the dividend was literally cut in half in 2009  it has once again begun growing again  Moreover  since share price has closely tracked General Electric s recovery earnings  capital appreciation of 16  per annum has been exceptional  Add in the once again rising dividend and shareholders have enjoyed an 18 8  rate of return since the beginning of calendar year 2010  This validates the notion that turnarounds can represent exciting and profitable opportunities Cyclical Stocks  A Roller Coaster Ride To Riches Or The Poor House Cyclical stocks are different than turnarounds  A cyclical stock is a company that has a legacy of its business routinely going through cycles of boom or bust  A true cyclical company can provide investors great profits during the good times  and conversely destroy a portfolio s performance during the bad Textron Inc   TXT   When It s Good It Is Very Good  When It s Bad It Is Very BadLet s examine the long term historical record of Textron Inc   TXT  since 1994 to see a quintessential example of a cyclical stock in action  You will see that when Textron s earnings are strong and growing  stock price follows suit  Conversely  during the times when earnings are falling off a cliff  so do stock prices  The point being that if you can pick a stock when earnings are poised for an intermediate term advance  there are great profits to be had  However  the hat trick is finding when to get out before the music stops  Although that is easier said than done  timing does not have to be perfect  but it does need to be reasonably responsive  In other words  waiting around too long validates the old adage  he who hesitates is lost  In order to get a perspective of how profitable a cyclical stock can be when things are going right  our next graph looks at Textron from calendar year 2002 through calendar year 2007  This was a six year time frame when earnings growth was averaging 28 5  per annum  and when the company s beginning valuation was in alignment Therefore  shareholders in Textron during these profitable years were highly rewarded  Capital appreciation generated 22 9  per annum compounded return  and the addition of its dividend  paid but not reinvested  increase the annual rate of return to over 24  per annum  On the other hand  if you own a cyclical stock during the bad side of a cycle  like the last six years have been for Textron  it can be a devestating investment  The following graphic looks at Textron since the great recession of 2008 where we see the company s earnngs collapsing and stock price following it down  However  since calendar year 2010  Textron s business and stock price have been on a recovery trajectretory  It s amazing what a difference owning a cyclical stock during the bad times can make   The following performance since calendar year 2008  the great recession  shows that shareholder returns were abysmal   Both capital appreciation and dividend income were negative during this period Currently  the consensus of 14 analysts reporting to Capital IQ  expect Textron to once again grow earnings in excess of 28  per annum  If this truly is  as Yogi Berra would say  d j  vu all over again  then this may be a good opportunity to invest in Textron  A cross check with Microsoft MSN corroborates that the consensus of analysts reporting to Zacks also expects similar five year earnings growth at 26  per annum  Although this instills some confidence that there is at least a reasonable consensus  let us remind you of the warning we expressed with our Goodyear Tire example above  In other words  at the end of the day it s always up to us to determine whether or not we think the estimates are reasonable and achievable or not  Our future returns will be a function of what the future investment results turn out to be adjusted for valuation Microsoft MSN Textron Inc  Forecast From ZacksManitowoc Co   MTW  and Caterpillar  CAT Our final two examples review the historical records of Manitowoc  Co   a leading manufacturer of building cranes and a major player in food service equipment  and Caterpillar  who needs no introduction  Although both of these companies would clearly meet our definition of cyclical  the earnings and price correlated graphs on each show that they are different  yet in some ways the same  Both graphics illustrate that these companies are sensitive to economic cycles  you can clearly see how profits rise and fall with the economy  But even more importantly  you can clearly see how stock prices logically react to those same cycles Summary   ConclusionsAs we conclude this series of articles  we hope that readers have at least been given the perspective that not all common stocks are the same  More importantly  we also tried to illustrate that it is not the stock market that ultimately drives the returns of individual companies  Instead  it is the individual operating results of each respective company that will reward shareholders in accordance with the business results that individual companies have achieved on their behalf Therefore  the final message is to encourage investors to quit worrying about what the market might do or what the economy is going to do  Instead  try to identify really great businesses where you like the management and the price  Long term investment performance will follow long term operating performance  Try to keep your emotions in check  try to filter out all the noise that you are bombarded with every day  and try to make intelligent investing decisions on facts  Because  as we have often stated  the problem

earnings twice in the trailing four quarters  the positive surprise being 81 6   on average The Finnish telecom gear maker is expected to have recorded lower aggregate revenues on a year over year basis due to macroeconomic  industry and competitive dynamics  Its Mobile Access business was impacted by increased competition in some accounts as rivals  including Ericsson  BS ERICAs  and Huawei  seek to take share in the early stage of 5G  Some customers have reevaluated their vendors in light of security concerns  creating near term pressure for Nokia to invest in order to secure long term benefits    The company s top line in the quarter under review was impacted by the timing of completions and acceptances of certain 5G projects  based on the evolving readiness of the ecosystem and the staggered nature of 5G rollouts in lead countries  Nokia has reached 63 commercial 5G contracts  with 18 live networks  around the world  Its 5G technology has been contracted by all four nationwide operators in the United States  all three in South Korea and all three in Japan  Against this backdrop  let s find out how things have shaped up prior to the announcement Factors at PlayNokia s gross margin in the to be reported quarter is likely to have been impacted by product mix  a high cost level associated with its first generation 5G products  profitability challenges in China  pricing pressure in early 5G deals  and uncertainty related to the announced operator merger in North America  Some of the key developments are mentioned below During the quarter  Nokia was

106806,328321,MTW,U S  Manufacturing Sector Bounces Back  5 Big Winners,opinion,The U S  manufacturing sector has been languishing in the correction territory for quite some time now  And market pundits started to believe that manufacturing is in recession  Predominantly  the U S  China trade dispute appeared to have dented business sentiments However  factory activities rebounded in January and expanded for the first time in six months  The recent preliminary trade deal reduced tensions among the world s two largest economies and reduced manufacturers  apprehensions about an increase in tariffs  Banking on such upbeat manufacturing numbers  top manufacturers are poised to ramp up profits Manufacturing Recession Fears Squashed  Activities ReboundAccording to the Institute of Supply Management  its manufacturing index climbed to 50 9 in January from an upwardly revised 47 8 in December  The index scaled beyond the 50 mark  which separates expansion from contraction  Analysts  by the way  were expecting a reading of 48 5 Strength in new orders  production and employment supported the gains  The gauge of new orders increased 4 4 points to 52 in January  the highest reading since July  One of the ISM survey respondents said that  our business is starting 2020 stronger than we finished 2019  as we saw a dramatic downturn in orders over the last four months of 2019   Productions also turned positive  while employment in the manufacturing sector increased  The employment index hit 46 6 last month compared with 45 2 in the prior month But most importantly  easing of trade tensions with China and signing of a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada effectively boosted manufacturing activities  After all  high tariffs are always a concern for manufacturers Trade Deals  Blessing for ManufacturersThe Trump administration s recent phase one trade deal with China lessened the burden on global economic growth created by trade imbalances  and in turn boosted manufacturing activities  Lest we forget  the United States and China together account for 35  to 40  of the world s economy  and thus have a significant influence on international growth  And since the negotiations have gone well between the countries  business confidence has improved  driving capital expenditure and in turn stocks The United States said that China has agreed to increase import of commodities in 2020  China has also agreed to protect U S  intellectual property rights and has given assurance of not manipulating its currency  The United States  in the meanwhile  has agreed not to impose extra tariffs on nearly  160 billion of Chinese consumer electronics and toys The House of Representatives meanwhile saw both the Democrats and Republicans united in passing an updated version of the 25 year old NAFTA that many economists believe will eventually prove favorable for the U S  economy  particularly manufacturing activities 5 Big GainersAs the key measure of U S  factory  mining and utility output surpassed expectations  industrial stocks in particular are expected to gain  We have  thus  selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2
