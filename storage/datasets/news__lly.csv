170785,392301,LLY,Will Eli Lilly Outperform in 2020 ,news,"Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY  offers an attractive opportunity for shareholders in 2020  The more than 140 year old drug company has a few compelling metrics that demonstrate significant value for investors  including a strong return on equity  ROE   a modest dividend payout ratio  and continued profitability when compared with peers including GlaxoSmithKline  NYSE GSK  and Pfizer  NYSE PFE  
Management at Eli Lilly is looking to expand its dealmaking activity through 2020 to create new growth opportunities and long term value for shareholders  The company is facing some favorable catalysts in the near term from its Phase 3 clinical trials  as well as potential regulatory actions that should offset some near term patent expirations and boost potential revenue streams 

Armed with cash and ready to deal
CFO John Smiley remarked at the recent J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference that the company intends to focus on dealmaking in 2020  aiming to announce roughly one agreement every quarter  This includes licensing agreements  acquisitions  and other structures 
Eli Lilly already made headlines earlier this year with its acquisition of Dermira  a biopharma working on therapies for chronic skin conditions  The acquisition expands the company s portfolio of Phase 3 clinical trial drugs  as well as one already approved medicated cloth to treat excessive armpit sweat  All of this should mean long term value  new revenue streams  and backup for its drugs that are nearing patent expiration 
Progress in the portfolio
One of Eli Lilly s drugs  Trijardy XR  was approved by the FDA this week  and top line results were announced from a Phase 3 clinical trial for another  Trijardy XR combines three type 2 diabetes medications into one pill that  combined with diet and exercise  lowers blood sugar levels in adults  This combination of different diabetes medications marks an important advancement in the treatment of the disease 
On the clinical trial front  Eli Lilly and Incyte  NASDAQ INCY  announced promising top line results from a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with the common  chronic inflammatory skin disease called moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  AD   better known as eczema  Next  the company plans to apply for expanded approval for a drug that currently treats rheumatoid arthritis to be used for eczema as well  This treatment is currently approved in the European Union  and Eli Lilly expects to submit applications in the United States and Japan this year 
Strong shareholder value
Eli Lilly s forward price to earnings  P E  ratio  a measure of share price relative to per share earnings  is 20 5  Compared with peers including Pfizer  13 15  and GlaxoSmithKline  15   Eli Lilly looks poised for higher earnings in the future  A higher forward P E implies that the market thinks the company is likely to see growth 
For example  Eli Lilly anticipates revenue this year to be between  23 6 billion and  24 1 billion  driven by volume growth in key products including Tulicity  Jardiance  and many others  In the prior year  Eli Lilly s financial guidance called for revenue of  22 billion to  22 5 billion  This shows that management is clearly optimistic that they will meet or exceed their 7  revenue compound annual growth rate  CAGR  target   CAGR is a useful metric for investors who want to see the average annual growth rate of their returns over a period of time  
Investors will want to note that 7  revenue CAGR target and keep an eye on management s strategies for getting there  including high volume growth in their key products  promising results in their development pipeline  and a focus on acquiring new assets every quarter  Success on all these fronts will allow Eli Lilly to achieve the forward P E ratio expected by the market    and provide shareholder value 
The dividend yield is also worth watching  Currently  Eli Lilly s forward annual dividend yield is 2 13   with the trailing dividend yield at 1 80   That increase of 0 33  shows some optimism is already priced in  The dividend payout ratio  which measures the sustainability of a company s dividend stream  is 55 1     against peers such as Pfizer  49 7   and GSK  87 1    this implies that the dividend may have room to grow  With dividend payments dating back to 1973  this company may be appealing to investors who want to receive dividends in good times and bad 
Eli Lilly also offers strong shareholder value in the form of its return on equity  ROE   which reached 49 3  over the trailing 12 months    higher than GlaxoSmithKline s 46 4  and Pfizer s 23 7   ROE is a compelling metric because it reveals whether management is capable of making more profit with less capital  By this metric  Eli Lilly is clearly doing a better job than its peers at creating profits while effectively managing investments  
A profitable diagnosis for 2020
Eli Lilly offers an attractive investment for healthcare investors seeking long term value  Management s focus on acquiring companies and broadening the portfolio has paid off  and the market expects a great year ahead for Eli Lilly ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pox06,2071622
170786,392302,LLY,Is Eli Lilly Stock Overvalued ,news,"Pharma behemoth Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  posted better than expected fourth quarter results ahead of the opening bell this morning  Specifically  the drugmaker topped Factset s consensus revenue estimate for the three month period by a healthy 3 38  and Wall Street s non GAAP earnings per share forecast by a striking 13 8   Those are exceptional quarterly results by any measure  
Nonetheless  Lilly s shares don t come across as a screaming buy  despite the company s industry leading levels of top  and bottom line growth in the most recent quarter  Here s why investors may want to stick to the sidelines with this blue chip pharmaceutical stock right now 

Lilly s Q4 results are good    but not that good
Admittedly  Lilly s 8  year over year revenue growth in Q4 will likely take first place within the realm of big pharma once the smoke clears  Even AstraZeneca  NYSE AZN  and its supercharged portfolio of red hot diabetes  oncology  and respiratory medicines isn t expected to hit such lofty heights when the drugmaker reports its latest financial results next month 
But the fact of the matter is that Lilly s valuation may have already reached untenable levels following the company s meteoric rise during the tail end of 2019 and early days of 2020  At 20 7 next year s projected earnings  Lilly s stock is now the second most expensive among all large cap pharmas right now  The only drugmaker with a richer valuation  in fact  is Astra at 24 times forward looking earnings 
What s more  Lilly and Astra are both trading at nearly twice the prevailing average for their big pharma peer group  The market is clearly expecting big things from these two names in the near future  Unfortunately  Lilly may not be able to deliver the hyper revenue growth needed to justify such a pricey valuation 
Lilly s value proposition centers mainly around the forthcoming approval of new cancer meds like selpercatinib  the recent acquisition of the dermatology company Dermira  and a spate of future midsize acquisitions  While this strategy certainly has its merits  Lilly s aggressive business development activity could easily turn into a huge mistake 
Most acquisitions in this space  after all  fail to justify their enormous price tags at the end of the day  That s a key reason more frugal companies like Biogen have largely shied away from bolt on acquisitions  The most potent value creators in biopharma tend to come from internally discovered candidates or products in licensed during early stages of development  preclinical or immediately after a successful proof of concept trial   The point is that Lilly s ongoing M A bonanza is arguably a far riskier endeavor than the market seems to realize   
Should investors take profits 
Over the past five years  Lilly has returned a whopping 124  to investors  including dividends and assuming a dividend reinvestment plan   That is an extraordinary level of performance for any large cap stock  much less a top biopharma that has had to contend with a wave of patent expirations  But all good things come to an end 
Lilly s shares now appear to be trading mainly on speculation about the company s future acquisitions and management s ability to maximize their value  That s not a solid set of reasons to own any stock  It may indeed be time to consider taking profits on this high flying pharma stock ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/po-ut,2071902
170787,392303,LLY,How Eli Lilly Wowed With Its Q4 Earnings Results,news,"Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  took investors on a roller coaster ride in 2019  with shares swinging by double digit percentages in both directions  The big drugmaker ended the year on a positive note  though  and entered 2020 with solid momentum 
Now the company has added another reason for investors to be optimistic  Lilly announced its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year results before the market opened on Thursday  Here are the highlights of the big pharma company s Q4 update 

By the numbers
Lilly reported fourth quarter revenue of  6 1 billion  a year over year increase of 8   This result topped the average analysts  revenue estimate of  5 9 billion 
The company announced net income in Q4 of  1 5 billion  or  1 64 per share  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   This reflected significant improvement from the prior year period net income of  1 1 billion  or  1 10 per share 
On a non GAAP  adjusted  basis  Lilly s net income in the fourth quarter was  1 6 billion  or  1 73 per share  This was much higher than the company s adjusted net income of  1 3 billion  or  1 32 per share  posted in the same period of 2018  It also blew past the consensus Wall Street Q4 earnings estimate of  1 52 per share  
Behind the numbers
Lilly s top selling drug  Trulicity  delivered an impressive performance in Q4 with sales jumping 31  year over year to  1 2 billion  Two other diabetes drugs also generated strong growth  Sales for Basaglar increased by 32  to  307 million  while sales for Jardiance rose 39  to  268 million 
The company s immunology franchise was also a big winner in the fourth quarter  Sales of Taltz vaulted 37  higher year over year to  420 million  Olumiant s sales soared 82  higher to nearly  83 million 
In addition  migraine drug Emgality  which won FDA approval in September 2018  racked up sales of  66 3 million in Q4  compared to only  4 9 million in the prior year period  Sales for breast cancer drug Verzenio more than doubled year over year to  179 million 
There were a few not so bright spots  though  Cialis continued its decline  with sales plunging 44  year over year in Q4 to  197 8 million  Sales for osteoporosis drug Forteo fell 18  to  360 million 
Lilly s revenue growth trickled down to the bottom line  The company also benefited from the sale of its antibiotics business in China 
Looking ahead
Lilly upped its full year 2020 revenue guidance modestly from its previous outlook  The company now anticipates revenue of between  23 7 billion and  24 2 billion in full year 2020  compared to its previous guidance of between  23 6 billion and  24 1 billion 
The company also revised its full year GAAP earnings per share downward  to a range of  6 18 to  6 28 from the range of  6 38 to  6 48 provided in its previous guidance  However  Lilly maintained its earlier adjusted earnings guidance of  6 70 to  6 80 per share 
As with any pharmaceutical stock  the real key to Lilly s long term success is its pipeline  CEO David Ricks pointed to the company s pipeline in his comments about the Q4 results  stating that Lilly  is in the early phase of an exciting period of growth  and is working to expand its portfolio of drugs 
One key thing to watch on this front is Lilly s pending acquisition of Dermira for around  1 1 billion  Assuming there are no obstacles to the deal s going through  the acquisition will bring several promising experimental drugs targeting chronic skin conditions ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp1-m,2072087
170790,392306,LLY,Drugmaker Eli Lilly Reports Fourth Quarter Earnings,news,"Increasing demand for Eli Lilly s  NYSE LLY  diabetes and oncology treatments helped push its fourth quarter 2019 revenue up 8 5  year over year to  6 1 billion  The company also reported GAAP earnings per share  EPS  of  1 64  up 49 1  year over year  due to expanding margins  Those results exceeded industry watchers  consensus revenue and EPS estimates for  5 92 billion and  1 54  respectively 

As one of the largest manufacturers of medications used to control blood sugar levels  Eli Lilly benefited last quarter from increased sales of diabetes drugs Trulicity  Basaglar  and Jardiance 
Sales of Trulicity  a once weekly glucagon like peptide 1  GLP 1  drug that increases insulin production  grew 31  year over year to  1 2 billion  Basaglar  a biosimilar to the long lasting insulin Lantus  saw its revenue increase 32  year over year to  307 million  and sales of Jardiance  a sodium glucose co transporter 2  SGLT2  inhibitor that increases glucose excretion in urine  improved 39  to  268 million  Those gains more than offset a 1  slide in the sales of the fast acting insulin Humalog  
Eli Lilly also benefited from growing demand for the autoimmune disease drug Taltz and the launch of migraine treatment Emgality  Taltz revenue rose 37  year over year to  420 1 million  and Emgality sales totaled  66 3 million  Sales of erectile dysfunction drug Cialis dropped 44   due to the expiration in fall 2018 of its patent protection and the arrival of generic competition   
Overall  revenue was driven by a 10  increase in volume  slightly offset by a 1  decline in drug prices 
Impacting the bottom line  research and development spending increased 6  to  1 58 billion  while marketing  selling  and administrative expenses were essentially flat at  1 7 billion  Sales growth  cost controls  and share repurchases resulted in Lilly s better than expected earnings  
As for 2020  management now says it expects sales of at least  23 7 billion  up from its prior guidance for  23 6 billion  However  it lowered its EPS outlook from a range of  6 38 to  6 48 to a range of to  6 18 to  6 28 due to costs associated with its  1 1 billion acquisition of Dermira  a biotech company focused on treatments for chronic skin conditions ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp3mf,2072203

the conference over to your host  Kevin Hern  Please go ahead Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsGood morning  Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company s Q4 2019 earnings call  I m Kevin Hern  Vice President of Investor Relations  Joining me on today s call are Dave Ricks  Lilly s Chairman and CEO  Josh Smiley  Chief Financial Officer  Dr  Dan Skovronsky  Chief Scientific Officer  Anne White  President of Lilly Oncology  Patrik Jonsson  President of Lilly Bio Medicines  and Mike Mason  President of Lilly Diabetes  We re also joined by Kim Macko and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team During this conference call  we anticipate making projections and forward looking statements based on our current expectations  Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors  including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10 K  10 Q and any 8 Ks filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission  The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community  It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions As we transition to our prepared remarks  a reminder that our commentary will focus on non GAAP financial measures  which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2018 and 2019  and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1  2018 Now I ll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our Q4 results David A  Ricks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Kevin  2019 was a solid year for Lilly and our strong Q4 financial results highlight the strength of the underlying business  We exited 2019 with momentum and we ll continue to focus on executing our strategy in 2020  which is to deliver excellent business results  develop and launch new medicines for patients  and drive increased productivity Revenue growth accelerated in Q4  increasing 8  versus Q4 2018 or 9  in constant currency  This strong performance was driven entirely by volume  which contributed 10 percentage points of growth despite continued headwinds from the loss of exclusivity in the US of Cialis and the global withdrawal of Lartruvo  Excluding Cialis and Lartruvo  worldwide volume growth was an impressive 15  Newer medicines continue to be our growth engine  representing 46  of our revenue this quarter  We made good progress in Q4 on our productivity agenda as operating income grew 10  versus last year  We posted strong revenue growth and held marketing  selling and administrative expenses flat versus last year while increasing our investment in R D Our non GAAP operating margin was 26 3   an improvement of 40 basis points versus Q4 2018  We finished 2019 with a full year operating margin slightly below our guidance of approximately 28  as we made targeted strategic investments in Q4 across both our commercial portfolio and pipeline  which will enhance our opportunities for future growth  These investments provide good momentum heading into 2020 and keep us on track to achieve our 31  operating margin target this year We ve announced multiple pipeline milestones since our Q3 earnings call  These include positive results in the remaining two Phase 3 trials of the baricitinib BREEZE AD program in atopic dermatitis  the submission of selpercatinib in the US and Europe  and the FDA granting selpercatinib a Priority Review  the submission of tanezumab for OA pain in the US in collaboration with Pfizer  the submission of higher doses of Trulicity in the US and Europe  and the submission of baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in Europe and Japan During Q4 we put our strong operating cash flow to work  returning approximately  900 million to shareholders via share repurchase and dividend  In addition  as previously announced  we increased our dividend 15  for 2020  This marks the second consecutive year of a 15  dividend increase  reflecting our confidence in the outlook for the business Finally  we recently announced the pending acquisition of Dermira  a company focused on developing new therapies for chronic skin conditions  Dermira has an exciting asset in Phase 3 for atopic dermatitis  lebrikizumab  in addition to a currently marketed product for excessive underarm sweating  QBREXZA  This transaction enhances our Phase 3 pipeline and complements our existing efforts in atopic dermatitis with baricitinib  We look forward to closing that transaction here in Q1 Moving to Slide 5  you ll see the list of key events since our last earnings call  In our continued efforts to help make medicines more affordable and reduce out of pocket cost for patients  we recently announced plans to introduce two additional lower priced insulins  Humalog 75 25 KwikPen and Humalog Junior KwikPen  Both products will be available by mid April and will be offered at a 50  lower list price compared to the branded versions Once these additional options are available  more than 90  of Lilly s Humalog options will be accessible to help patients reduce their out of pocket costs and we hope to see payers provide increased access to patients for these solutions  During the month of December alone Insulin Lispro helped nearly 79 000 patients in the US  These recent additions complement existing offerings in the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center  which currently helps as many of 20 000 patients per month better afford their insulin  As a Company that has been in business for over 140 years and invests over  5 billion per year in long term research and development  we take our responsibility to pursue sustainable business  social and environmental practices very seriously Now I ll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q4 results and to provide an update on our 2020 financial guidance Joshua L  Smiley    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Dave  Slide 6 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results to non GAAP measures and Slide 7 provides a summary of our GAAP results  So looking at the non GAAP measures on Slide 8  you ll see revenue increased 8  or 9  in constant currency  Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 70 basis points to 79 9   Excluding the impact of FX on international inventories sold  gross margin as a percent of revenue was 79 6  and on the same basis  our gross margin percent decreased by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q4 2018 driven by unfavorable product mix and a negative impact of price on revenue Moving down the P L  operating expenses grew 6  versus last year s quarter  Marketing  selling and administrative expenses were flat as cost containment and productivity measures offset investments in key growth products  R D expenses increased 14   reflecting higher development expenses for late stage assets  including tirzepatide  selpercatinib and mirikizumab  Operating income increased 10  compared to Q4 2018 as sales growth outpaced expense growth  resulting in an operating income as a percent of revenue of 26 3  for the quarter and 27 2  for the full year This quarter s results are indicative of the potential for growth and margin expansion our portfolio of new medicines offers  We are well positioned to drive top tier revenue growth and invest in the next wave of new medicines while driving margin expansion at the same time  We exited 2019 with significant momentum executing our strategy and are on track to achieve our 2020 full year operating margin target of 31  Other income and expense was income of  206 million this quarter compared to income of  31 million in Q4 2018  driven by investment gains on public equities  As we highlighted previously  this line item can be volatile as public market valuations fluctuate  Gains in Q4 were primarily generated by our investments in China biotech companies through our late Lilly Asia Ventures arm and strategic investments in companies focused in newer technologies like RNAi While we appreciate the gains we are even more pleased with the relationships and the potential to develop new medicines for patients that accompany some of these investments Our tax rate was 12 6   a decrease of 300 basis points compared with the same quarter last year  driven primarily by an increase in net discrete tax benefits  including tax benefits from the resolution of US and foreign audits  At the bottom line  net income increased 26  while earnings per share increased 31  due to a reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases Slide 9 outlines the same non GAAP measures for the full year  While we are excited with our performance in Q4 and the momentum headed into 2020  we re also pleased with our overall performance for the full year in 2019  Last year we experienced the full effect of the Cialis patent expiration and the impact of the withdrawal of Lartruvo  In spite of these headwinds  we grew the top line at 5  in constant currency and generated EPS growth of 11  while investing behind our newer products and pipeline We also generated good shareholder value and established a strong strategic foundation through our split off of Elanco and the acquisition of Loxo Oncology  As we highlighted in December last year  we are well positioned in 2020 to deliver our 5 year financial goals and continue this period of sustained growth Moving to Slide 10  you ll find a reconciliation between reported and non GAAP EPS  Additional details are provided on Slides 26 and 27  On Slide 11 we quantify the effect of price  rate and volume on revenue growth  As mentioned earlier  worldwide revenue grew 9  in constant currency during Q4  driven by strong volume growth of 10   partially offset by price  Foreign exchange had a modest negative impact on revenue growth For the fourth straight year we delivered worldwide revenue growth each quarter despite headwinds from patent expirations  US revenue grew 7  compared with the fourth quarter of 2018  Volume growth of 8  was led by Trulicity  Taltz  Verzenio  Jardiance and Emgality  Excluding Cialis and Lartruvo  volume grew over 15  Pricing was a 1  drag on US revenue growth this quarter impacted by increased funding during the coverage gap in Medicare  unfavorable changes in estimates for rebates and discounts  and disproportionate volume growth in lower net price segments  which was partially offset by the net of modest list price increases and higher rebates as well as reduced reliance on patient assistance programs  primarily due to improved commercial access for Emgality  The full year impact of price was a headwind of 3   consistent with our 2019 and 2020 expectations for US price having a moderate drag on revenue growth Moving to Europe  revenue grew 12  in constant currency driven by impressive 15  volume growth  partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and price  Volume growth was led by Trulicity  Olumiant  Taltz and Verzenio  We re pleased with the uptake of our newer products across Europe and are looking forward to continued strong growth in 2020 In Japan  revenue grew 7  in constant currency driven entirely by volume growth  somewhat offset by a modest pricing headwind due to the government mandated price decreases that went into effect in 2019  Verzenio  Cymbalta  Trulicity and Olumiant were the key contributors to growth  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 14  in constant currency  led by 44  growth in China on the same basis  China growth was driven by strong performance across a number of key products  including Tyvyt  We re excited about the recent launches of Trulicity  Taltz and Olumiant  The same information for our full year revenue is at the bottom of this Slide As shown on Slide 12  our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth  These new medicines delivered nearly 15 percentage points of growth this quarter  continuing the strong trajectory we ve seen throughout 2019  Brands that have experienced loss of exclusivity provided a drag of over 400 basis points driven primarily by Cialis  As a reminder  generic tadalafil entered the US market in September 2018  significantly impacting Cialis revenues  with erosion further accelerating in Q2 2019 as multisource generics entered the market  While the impact of this event is beginning to sunset  it still had a meaningful negative impact on growth in Q4 2019 Slide 13 highlights the contributions of our key growth products  In total  these brands generated over  2 8 billion of revenue this quarter  making up 46  of revenue  Our newest medicines again had impressive results in large and growing therapeutic areas and our ability to reach more patients continues to demonstrate the strength of our commercial execution Within diabetes  the injectable GLP 1 class continues to add new patients despite the entry of a new oral therapy  In the US  total injectable GLP prescriptions grew 29  versus Q4 2018 and Trulicity grew faster than the market  posting an increase of 32  in total prescriptions during the same period  Net pricing in the US for Trulicity declined in the mid single digits  in line with our expectations for Q4 and for 2020  As we discussed on the Q3 call  Trulicity price in Q1 through Q3 of 2019 was impacted by a number of factors that we don t expect to persist in 2020 SGLT2 inhibitors accelerated their trajectory as full US prescriptions for the class grew nearly 20  versus last year s quarter and new therapy starts grew over 46   As the market leader  Jardiance continues to drive strong class growth and accounts for over 55  of total prescriptions  Our sustained market leadership in these two important growing classes within diabetes is a competitive advantage for our diabetes business and positions us well for future growth In immunology  Taltz continues to have strong growth as US total prescriptions grew nearly 40  versus Q4 2018  Despite an increasingly competitive market  Taltz gained over 3 share points in dermatology during 2019 and rheumatology weekly prescriptions have more than doubled during that same time frame  In 2020 we look to build on the strong momentum demonstrated in 2019 and reach even more patients In pain  Emgality continued its US leadership in share of market for new to brand prescriptions at over 47   While pleased with the uptake  we believe there is room for significant additional growth as we expand our commercial presence in primary care  We continue to see progress with roughly 80  of prescriptions reimbursed at the end of Q4  reflecting the strong access of Emgality Within oncology  Verzenio US total prescriptions grew over 46  versus Q4 2018 and the CDK 4 and 6 market is showing encouraging growth as total prescriptions increased by over 16  during the same time frame  Additionally  Cyramza continues to post solid growth as we realized thoracic synergies across our portfolio In addition to the strong performance of our key growth drivers  we look forward to potentially launching three new medicines in 2020 with Reyvow  selpercatinib and ultra rapid lispro  We believe all three new medicines have potential to be first in class or best in class and to improve the lives of patients  In addition  launching new medicines in the therapeutic areas where we have existing commercial infrastructure will support further margin expansion Slide 14 shows the year over year change in select lines of our income statement  Focusing on our non GAAP results  foreign exchange rates had a modest negative impact on revenue  gross margin  operating income and EPS  and a modest net positive impact on operating expenses  On Slide 15 we provide an update on capital allocation  In 2019 we invested over  13 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development  capital expenditures and after tax investment in R D  In addition  we returned approximately  7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases As Dave mentioned earlier  we also announced a 15  dividend increase for the second consecutive year  showing our confidence in the outlook for the Company  We are focused on utilizing the strong cash flow our business generates to develop the next wave of new medicines through both internal and external sources as highlighted by the recently announced acquisition of Dermira  We will remain active in assessing bolt on acquisitions or in licensing where we can create shareholder value and enhance our future growth prospects Turning to our 2020 financial guidance on Slide 16  you will see that we ve updated our non GAAP guidance to reflect the impact of the planned acquisition of Dermira and our recent strong business performance  Specifically  we are increasing our revenue range by  100 million to include QBREXZA and to reflect strong prescription trends we see in the underlying business  updating our SG A guidance to account for the addition of the Dermira sales force and the commercial expenses to support QBREXZA and maintaining all other line items and confirming our non GAAP earnings per share range of  6 70 to  6 80 and operating margin target of 31   On a reported basis  the impact of the Dermira acquisition will have an impact of  0 21 and earnings per share for 2020 is now expected to be in the range of  6 18 to  6 28 We continue to execute our innovation based strategy while leveraging our young commercial portfolio of new medicines to drive margin expansion over the mid term  So now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R D Daniel M  Skovronsky    Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific OfficerThanks  Josh  Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 27  Positive movement since our last earnings call includes the submission of selpercatinib in the US and Europe  as well as the initiation of Phase 3 trials for selpercatinib in patients with RET fusion positive non small cell lung cancer or RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer  the submission of tanezumab in the US for osteoarthritis pain  the submission of higher doses of Trulicity for type 2 diabetes in the US and Europe  the submission of baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in Europe and Japan  the addition of lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis to the Phase 3 portfolio  pending the closure of the Dermira acquisition  the initiation of a Phase 3 study of Tirzepatide in obesity  and a Phase 2 study of tirzepatide in NASH  the initiation of Phase 2 for our checkpoint agonist CD200R in immunology  and the initiation of Phase 1 for four assets  as well as the termination of three early stage oncology assets In addition  we had some important early stage readouts including LOXO 305  our novel BTK inhibitor which we highlighted on the 2020 Financial Guidance Call and continues to progress quickly in development  We also had internal data readouts from two Phase 2 trials of Pegilodecakin in combination with immunotherapy agents in patients with non small cell lung cancer  Cyprus 1 in Cyprus 2 Although the full data will be presented at a medical meeting later this year  I can say that both studies were negative  Though we are disappointed in the lack of efficacy for Pegilodecakin in combination with checkpoint inhibition in lung cancer  we remain committed to finding new therapies for people with cancer  Although we are still analyzing the totality of the data that we have obtained with Pegilodecakin  at present we do not anticipate additional trials with this agent Moving to Slide 18  we show a final tally of how we finished 2019 versus the key events we expected to occur  2019 was a very productive year and we made significant progress in bringing new medicines to patients  In total we added four new Phase 3 clinical programs to our pipeline  all with the potential to be first in class or best in class  We reported 12 positive Phase 3 or registrational trial readouts  including a mix of NMEs and new indications or new data for launched products We submitted 12 NMEs or new indications for regulatory review in geographies around the world and we received positive regulatory action on two new medicines  Reyvow and Baqsimi  as well as four important new indications across Trulicity  Taltz  Emgality and Cyramza  We re proud of the significant achievements we made in 2019 and we re focused on discovering and developing more new medicines to help patients as we enter another promising decade Moving to Slide 19  while it s early in the year we ve already made good progress on our 2020 goals  having announced the initiation of additional Phase 3 trials for selpercatinib  positive results in the remaining two trials of the baricitinib BREEZE program for atopic dermatitis  the submission of baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in the EU and Japan  the submission of Tanezumab for osteoarthritis pain in the US in collaboration with Pfizer  FDA approval of Trijardy  a fixed dose combination of empagliflozin  linagliptin and metformin XR  and regulatory approval of Cyramza for first line EGFR positive non small cell lung cancer in Europe Before turning the call back over to Dave  I d like to spend a few minutes providing additional details on important milestones for two clinical programs that I mentioned earlier  the initiation of additional clinical trials for tirzepatide and the completion of the baricitinib BREEZE AD atopic dermatitis program  Beginning with tirzepatide on Slide 20  we previously shared our plans to initiate a cardiovascular outcome study for tirzepatide this year  assessing tirzepatide head to head against the most widely used GLP 1 therapy  i e   Trulicity This is a bold move  It signals both our confidence in the strength of tirzepatide as well as our desire to deliver meaningful data for patients and physicians on how new medicines measure against leading therapies  Through very collaborative discussions with the FDA  we ve gained alignment on the key design features of this unique study called SURPASS CVOT  This trial will include approximately 12 500 patients with type 2 diabetes and confirmed atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and will measure time to first occurrence of the composite endpoint of CV death  myocardial infarction or stroke This study will assess both non inferiority and superiority of tirzepatide versus Trulicity and we anticipate it will take just over four years to complete  In addition to SURPASS CVOT  we re pleased to share that the Phase 3 type 2 diabetes program SURPASS is progressing extremely well  Investigator interest has been very strong and four of the eight SURPASS clinical trials are already fully enrolled  We look forward to sharing top line results for the first study to readout from the SURPASS program later this year Finally  we re excited that the SURMOUNT Phase 3 obesity program is actively dosing patients and that the SYNERGY Phase 2 program in NASH is currently under way as well  Given the profound weight loss seen in Phase 2 trials of tirzepatide  we re excited about the potential opportunity these additional clinical programs presents to help patients  Together with the ongoing SURPASS studies  these additional studies will expand the current Phase 3 tirzepatide program to over 20 000 patients  We re excited about the breakthrough that tirzepatide represents for patients and we ll continue to invest fully to maximize this opportunity Moving to Slide 21  we recently announced the completion of the final two studies of the BREEZE AD clinical program  BREEZE AD4 and BREEZE AD5  The full BREEZE program was comprised of five studies  assessing baricitinib in both monotherapy and in combination with topical corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  While not all the data have been up and presented  we re particularly encouraged by the strong results for the 2 milligram dose in the US trial  We believe that the full data package generated from BREEZE AD shows the potential that baricitinib could offer as an additional treatment option for patients with atopic dermatitis where there are limited choices In addition  these data add to the large safety database of baricitinib having over 10 000 patient years of safety data  We recently submitted baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in the EU and Japan and we expect regulatory action late in 2020  We plan to submit in the US later this year  We anticipate that baricitinib will be the first oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and we look forward to bringing a new treatment option to patients Finally  we recently announced the planned acquisition of Dermira  Pending deal closing  this transaction would add an additional medicine to the Lilly pipeline for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  that is lebrikizumab which is an injectable antibody targeting IL 13 currently in Phase 3 trials  We view lebrikizumab as highly complementary to our efforts with baricitinib in atopic dermatitis  The unmet medical need here is large and we anticipate physicians and patients will use a range of oral injectable therapies similar to current common practice for the treatment of psoriasis Now I ll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks David A  Ricks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Dan  Before we go to Q A  let me briefly sum up the progress we ve made in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the full year  We delivered impressive performance in Q4  Our revenue grew 8  as our newest medicines were again the catalyst for volume based growth  Our worldwide prescription trends are strong and we are well positioned entering 2020 to continue our positive trajectory and deliver our 2020 financial guidance We advanced our productivity agenda  controlling operating expenses while investing behind key commercial growth drivers and our late stage pipeline  We grew sales in Q4 while keeping marketing  selling and administrative expenses flat versus Q4  18  demonstrating our ability to drive margin expansion We made important pipeline progress in Q4  capping a year that featured significant new additions to the Phase 3 portfolio  several positive readouts in Phase 2 trials and a multitude of regulatory submissions and approvals  Finally  we returned nearly  600 million to shareholders via the dividend and completed  300 million of share repurchases as well As we shared during our 2020 Financial Guidance Call last December  we are in the early stages of a period of sustained growth at Lilly  The balance of new medicines we plan to launch over the next five years and the continued scaling of our newer medicines compared to our limited patent exposure sets up an exciting period ahead  We are pursuing new medicines in some of the most important diseases with both significant unmet medical need and sizable business opportunities  We are pleased with our finish to 2019 and our position of strength as we enter 2020 and the next decade of this Company s history  This concludes our prepared remarks and now I ll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q A Questions and Answers Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Dave  We d like to take questions from as many callers as possible  so we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller  Sean  please provide the instructions for the Q A session and then we re ready for the first caller OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Geoff Meacham  Phonetic  from Bank of America Merrill Lynch Geoff Meacham    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning  guys  thanks for the question  Just one on Taltz and one on the Olumiant filing in AD  so for Taltz the growth has been solid  but what would you say  it could be a demand tipping point looking into 2020 and beyond  Is it new contracts and agreements  is it a broader indication base  do you have to invest more commercially  And then on the Olumiant filing in AD  I wasn t sure if the effect of the 4 meg dose changes the regulatory conversation in the US    the like that you ve had in the RA indication since approval obviously was mostly focused on the 2 meg indication or the 2 meg approval  but I wasn t sure if that changes at all on the back of this new data  Thank you David A  Ricks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Geoff  We will go to Patrik for both of those questions Patrik Jonsson    Senior Vice President and President  Lilly Bio MedicinesThank you very much  We are very pleased with the performance of Taltz in the fourth quarter last year with the growth of total Rx with    we have approximately 40   If we look at the different spaces  first of all  dermatology despite increased competition  we think we are holding ground very nicely and we are maintaining our total Rx share of market in Q4 despite the increased competition  Also added to the body of evidence  we had head to head data  Indecipherable  IL 23 where we again demonstrated superiority on the skin clearance and that s the third study combined with STELARA where we have again demonstrated superiority  So we have confidence in continued growth space of dermatology The biggest opportunity for us remains being in rheumatology where we in Q4 announced the only IL 17 to demonstrate superiority versus  Indecipherable  head to head study and we saw some significant acceleration in Q4 in terms of new to brand and we are confident that we will continue to grow in the rheumatology space where there are lot of opportunities for us We also filed during the second half of the last year the non radiographic AxSpA and that s an indication where we also see a lot of patients that are not being appropriately diagnosed and even if diagnosed not appropriately treated  Lastly  both in dermatology and rheumatology  a huge amount of patients are still treated with anti TNF alphas  in dermatology 40  and in rheumatology 70   and we believe that remains the biggest opportunity for all new assets to ensure that patients are being upgraded to new  modern  more efficacious and safer treatments In terms of Olumiant  well  we don t comment on regulatory actions for specific brands  We continue to explore options to get the 4 milligram dosage approved in the US  However  in light of most recent regulatory actions with other JAK inhibitors  we are also realistic in terms of our expectations to get 4 milligram approved in the US in the near term  But  as Dave mentioned  we are very much encountered by the 2 milligram data of Olumiant in atopic dermatitis and where we are demonstrating    hitting our primary objective in both in terms of at least 75  improvement on skin inflammation  but also in terms of patient reported outcomes improvements on itching  So that is encouraging for us in terms of the Olumiant submission in the US Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Patrik  Geoff  thanks for your questions  Next caller  please OperatorThank you  Chris Schott from JPMorgan Chris Schott    JPMorgan    AnalystGreat  thanks very much  First question was just on the quarterly progression of sales and earnings as we go through 2020  I think last year we saw a depressed first quarter sales relative to the rest of the year that surprised the Street a bit  Should we expect a similar gating of sales in 2020 and are there any particular products we should be watching where I guess 2020 kind of resets its plans could impact those first quarter results My second question was just on the Alzheimer s strategy more broadly  How would the approval or I guess the nod of etokimab impact how you re thinking about your pending Alzheimer s readouts and development strategies from here  Thanks very much David A  Ricks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Chris  We ll go to Josh for the first question and Dan for the second one Joshua L  Smiley    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Chris  If we look at 2020  we don t provide quarterly guidance  but if we look at sort of the trajectory of sales that we d expect  if you look at our guidance for the full year  we re in somewhere in the high single digits for sales growth  We d expect that kind of growth to be pretty consistent through the year  Although  keep in mind  in Q1 we still will have a little bit more of the overhang from things like Cialis  so you might expect to see a little bit more Cialis growth through the year  but pretty consistent On an absolute basis though  Chris  we do always see sales in Q1 lower than Q4  A lot of that just has to do with shipping patterns and otherwise  So  again  growth should look good in Q1 relative to the year  absolute sales will be less  I think that s a trend that you see  I m sure  across almost all companies  There s nothing unique going on there other than normal shipping patterns between Q4 and Q1 Daniel M  Skovronsky    Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific OfficerChris  thanks for your question on Alzheimer s strategy  Of course  we  like many others  will be watching etokimab closely and of course we ll adapt our plans and thinking to meet wherever we see the regulatory bar placed  But I don t think you should expect us to pivot in our Alzheimer s strategy one way or another  We have placed some pretty important bets  We re excited to see those readouts over time both with solanezumab  but also our own plaque clearing antibody donanemab as well as our tau anti tau antibody that s in Phase 2  We also have a tau small molecule in Phase 1 and other agents earlier in development  So we ll continue to progress those  We think we have smartly designed trials that will give us important readouts over time Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Dan  Chris  thanks for your questions  Next caller  please OperatorThank you  Louise Chen from Cantor  Please go ahead Louise Chen    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my questions here  So first question I have for you is  can you provide more color on what might be driving your stronger volume growth when compared to other companies out there in this space and if this is durable over the longer term  And then my second question for you is  with this growing competition in atopic dermatitis  where do you see Lilly fitting into the evolving treatment paradigm  Thank you David A  Ricks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  So we ll go to Josh for the first question and Patrik for the second Joshua L  Smiley    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Louise  Good morning  I think in terms of volume growth  what we see at a corporate level is a function of our portfolio  As we mentioned  about a little bit less than half of our sales are coming from new products that we ve launched since 2014  10 of those  They re all still in    very much in their growth phases  Trulicity growing at 31  for example  Taltz at 37  So we ve got a relatively young portfolio  We expect the volume gains that we saw in Q4 to be sustainable between 2020 and 2025 as we mentioned on our guidance call  We expect to see top tier revenue growth over that period  It ll be driven by volume gains  it ll be driven by that cohort of products  as well as the new launches that will expect over this period  including the three that we re planning for this year  You couple that going forward with last generic exposure  then probably most of the companies that we compete against or that you cover and I think that would certainly say to us that the volume gains we re seeing or something that we re planning for and think are sustainable Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Josh  Patrik Patrik Jonsson    Senior Vice President and President  Lilly Bio MedicinesWell  currently it s estimated that approximately 18 million Americans are suffering from atopic dermatitis and 10 million of those are suffering from severe to moderate atopic dermatitis and the treatment opportunities are very limited  One is saying that they feel atopic dermatitis is pretty much where psoriasis was 15 years ago And in the light of that we believe that we are extremely well positioned  As we shared  we are encouraged with the most recent data on Olumiant  both in the US and outside the US  and we have submitted Olumiant for approval in Japan and EU and we ll take regulatory actions in 2020 here in the US and we believe that Olumiant could definitely be an option for patients that are having fear of injection And we re also excited about the announcement we made a few weeks ago about our intent to acquire Dermira  and lebrikizumab is the big driver of that deal and we see lebrikizumab based upon its Phase 2b data as the medicine that will at least be competitive with Dupixent and we have an opportunity given the best in class differentiating on each So overall we believe that we can play a very important role in the field of atopic dermatitis  We built the first oral JAK inhibitor for patients of fear of injections and the potential best in class medicine in lebrikizumab Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Patrik  Louise  thanks for your questions  Next caller  please OperatorThank you  Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research  I apologize  Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI Umer Raffat    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  thanks so much for taking my two questions  and both of them are Kevin s favorite topic  So the first one is on CNS penetrance of your GLP 1 and I have two parts on the first one  So there s feedback out there that Trulicity doesn t cross blood brain barrier very much  perhaps in part because of its size  A  can you comment on that  and in that same question I also want to ask  tirzepatide does not have an IGG  So presumably  it should have good CNS penetration  I just want to make sure I hear your take on the CNS penetrant of both Trulicity and tirzepatide Secondly  Dave perhaps for you  so the A4 trial in asymptomatic Alzheimer s  my understanding is it was fully enrolled in December 2017 and at this point it s already past two years in every single patient and by end of 2020 you would have hit a three year landmark in every single patient  So my question is  strategically thinking if regulators are being more accommodating of late  wouldn t it make strategic sense to possibly consider taking an efficacy read at three years  because even at three years it s 2 times the duration of all prior sola and aducanumab trials  Thank you very much Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Umer  for those questions  This is    Butler Bulldogs basketball is probably my favorite topic  but we don t cover that on the call  this is a close second though  We ll go to Dan for both of these Daniel M  Skovronsky    Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific OfficerOkay  great  Thanks very much  So with respect to CNS penetration of GLP 1s  you re right that these are large molecular weight molecules  Actually both FC fusion molecules like Trulicity and also isolated peptides like tirzepatide  Those modifications to the peptides are what gives them the long half life that enables once weekly injection and molecules of that size typically don t penetrate the blood brain barrier Having said that  we don t see those attributes  blood brain barrier penetration as being important for the efficacy of this class of drugs as evidenced I think by the tremendous efficacy that we ve seen with Trulicity and unprecedented efficacy that we ve seen with tirzepatide  so I think that addresses that With respect to A4  you re right that this is a longer duration trial and really I think any other large Alzheimer s trial has ever been  The reason for that though is because these patients are asymptomatic at the beginning of the trial  so they are very early in the disease course and it takes a great deal of time to let these patients progress in their disease course and it s only through progression of patients on the placebo group and hopefully differential  less progression of patients on therapy that we could hope to see an effective drug  So that s why the design includes such a long follow up period Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks Dan  Umer  thanks for your questions and we ll go to the next caller please OperatorThank you  Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research Tim Anderson    Wolfe Research    AnalystHi  a question on your PD 1 with an event and really plans for that product outside the US  It seems like last summer when I talked to management it was really described as the China only opportunity with limited potential  but it seems that you may have pivoted in recent months and may have bigger plans to bring them in to other geographies  so I m hoping you can give us your latest thinking And then second question is just on the Dian Tu Alzheimer s trial  confirming that we should see those results really any time  can you confirm that  And then just how do you view odds of success  It kind of seems to me that it s highly improbable that this will yield positive results for solo  but what are your views  Thank you Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Tim  We ll go to Anne for the first question and Dan for the second Anne E  White    Senior Vice President and President  Lilly OncologyWell Tim  thanks for the question on Tyvyt and our Innovent collaboration  So as you said  our current focus is on development and commercialization of Tyvyt in China  However  Innovent has been really important and terrific strategic partner to us  And so we re always open to discussing opportunities to expand that for mutual benefit  There s really not more we can say at this time  We re really pleased I think as Josh and Dave mentioned  the performance of Tyvyt in China  it s been a remarkable story and really now as you know the only PD 1 that s included on the NRDL list and I think that demonstrates how the NHSA has recognized its clinical value and then we were able to share the great news that we had the first line non squamous read out at interim that s positive  so we ll be planning to submit that this year and we expect additional readout in first and second line squamous this year with Innovent  So it s been a great product and we look forward to what more we can do here  But thanks for the question Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Anne  Dan Daniel M  Skovronsky    Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific OfficerYeah  Tim  on DIAN  just reminded for everyone that this is dominantly inherited type of Alzheimer s  It s rare and sort of severe and fast progressing form of Alzheimer s disease where we testing solanezumab  Your question on timing of results  we don t have the data yet  but we do expect that this quarter In terms of the odds of success  I think it s hard to speculate  but as you know this is a very small trial  small population is being studied and it is as I said a severe form of Alzheimer s  So those factors weigh against it  there is other factors that weight for it  We know that it s driven by mutations here and amyloid over production and has a relatively longer follow up  but we ll just have to wait and see that data Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Dan  Tim  thanks for your questions  Next caller  please OperatorThank you  Andrew Baum from Citi Andrew Baum    Citi    AnalystThank you  A couple of questions   Technical Issues Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsAndrew  this is Kevin  Andrew  we are really having trouble hearing you and can t really pick up the question  other than we heard tirzepatide Andrew Baum    Citi    AnalystIs that any better Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsNo  not much  we ll try it Andrew Baum    Citi    AnalystMy question is on tirzepatide  talking about your outcome trail  You are running a head to head trail versus Ozempic  which you described as a high bar  There is some literature on potentially GIP agonism could potentially be increased in cardiovascular rather than decreasing it  given its evidence is a marker for heightened cardiovascular disease as well as some preclinical data Perhaps you can talk to your thoughts on the relevant development literature and then second more broadly we d like to think that Lilly is perhaps second in place than many of your pears in understanding the direction of this particular administration in terms of healthcare reforms There has been some discussions about whether the IPI proposal could be expanded to include Medicare part D drugs rather than just part B  Perhaps you could share your thoughts on what you expect in that direction  Apologies for the long question Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Andrew  We ll got to Dan for the question on tirzepatide and then Dave on the policy question Daniel M  Skovronsky    Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific OfficerYeah  thanks  First of all  just a clarification that tirzepatide trial just head to head against Trulicity  Look I think that there is a little bit of literature out there as you referenced about    it s actually GIP 1 but our thinking is really based on the clinical data that we ve already obtained with tirzepatide in the Phase 2 trials I think everything we see in those trials point to a large cardiovascular benefit for a drug like this  and so that s the driver  that s what gives us confidence is the real clinical data with this molecule  The combination of GLP 1 and GLP 1 gives certain effects which we are able to see  So for example the improved day 1 C control and notably the very dramatic improvement on weight loss  which I think will drive cardiovascular benefits even higher than we saw in Trulicity Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Dan  Dave David A  Ricks    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo on the policy front  we continue to advocate for change in the US system because although we re in a    as an industry and certainly as Lilly a deflationary price environment those savings are not reaching consumers at the pharmacy counter  And so either through a combination of passing through a transparency of those discounts or insurance reform  we re for change  And our focus is primarily right now with the legislative pathway on both those fronts  There is one more vehicle probably left in this Congress to work on those  but progress is difficult in Congress  So we continue to advocate for change on the  Indecipherable  though As it relates to IPI  this proposal was part of the blueprint in spring of  18  It s been sitting out there for a while  We ve yet to see any draft guidance for proposed rulemaking or any version of this in detail  There is always a lot of swirling rumors about it  including expanding it to other parts of government programs or changes to it in terms of the objectives We see it largely as misguided  primarily because in Part B patients hardly have any cost sharing to begin with  So if we re worried about out of pocket costs for patients  IPI will do very little  it s mostly just a punitive measure against the industry going back to decisions made on European pricing sometimes decades ago  It won t probably change those prices in Europe if that s the present goal  and it certainly won t change the affordability equation for patients in the US  So we oppose it for those reasons That said  it s administrative potential action and want to read it if it comes out and decide what to do from there  but it pretty much is a difficult thing to support for our industry and you ll probably see pharma universally oppose it  So we ll wait and see Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Dave  Andrew  thanks for your questions  Next caller  please OperatorSeamus Fernandez from Guggenheim Seamus Fernandez    Guggenheim    AnalystThanks for the question  So maybe that the first question is really for Josh  Josh  can you just help us understand the progression of margins as we move through the balance of next year  or sorry this year in 2020 When I look at the original guidance from this year  I think you guys had said 28  was the target  I think ultimately we ended up at 27 2  at the final point in the year  But on the guidance call in December  you stated and reiterated the 31  target  Can you just help us understand the past to that 31  just because the second half of this year I think kind of came in below investors  expectations to some degree  and we re just trying to understand a little bit better the very strong move in margins going higher  Obviously  the pieces of guidance makes sense  I think we re just trying to understand the path as we move through the balance of the year And then the second question  the pegilodecakin update  thanks for that  Appreciate the understanding and the challenges  Can maybe    Jay can just sort of update us on his thoughts and also Dan  could update us on your thoughts for the growth of the oncology development portfolio and directionally where you re headed  Thanks OperatorJosh  and then Dan Joshua L  Smiley    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGreat  Thanks  Seamus  In terms of margin this year  again we reiterated that we are on track for 31   And the one thing that we have said is Q1 will likely be below 31  that s mostly a function of the less absolute sales that I talked about on a prior question  on top of a relatively fixed opex absolute amount So I think as you look or model opex for the year  we see that it s pretty constant on an absolute base quarter over quarter  Of course some small variation  and then you ll see absolute sales dollars on a quarter over quarter basis grow  So we don t expect to be at 31  in Q1  but that s    again that the function of the dynamics of the growth through the quarters Remember though in terms of how to get there in totals for the year  we said for 2019 that we would grow our R D at a unusual growth rate in 2019 as we scale up programs like tirzepatide and Mirikizumab  In 2020 those programs are running at more like full speed  We are able to bring and a an asset like Dermira and keep that with relatively smaller growth rate and R D So I think we are confident that the sales growth that we are seeing that we talked about in Q4 should persist for the year on top of a slower growing opex that we can predict and manage  will get us to 31  and again I wouldn t be too concerned in Q1 if we are not at that level  but you should expect it as we move through the year Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Josh  Dan Daniel M  Skovronsky    Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific OfficerThanks for the question on oncology strategy  Of course on the last call we talked about our Loxo Oncology at Lilly and how that s changed oncology strategy and we re quite pleased with the progress that we made on executing against that strategy  You can see some portfolio changes in our pipeline update and we also talked about the three key early stage programs  305  KRAS and SERD  all of which are progressing in the clinic While we said we re going to focus on a lot of our resources on high probability  biology that s well understood  bets like those  we will also from time to time continue to pursue more novel biology  higher risk  high reward bets like Pegilodecakin was and that will be a smaller part of our portfolio in the future Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Dan  Seamus  thanks for your question  Next caller  please OperatorDavid Risinger from Morgan Stanley David Risinger    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks very much  I have two questions  first just going back to the high level on GLP 1s and Alzheimer s  Novo has recently conveyed enthusiasm about the potential for GLP 1 treatment in Alzheimer s  Could you just comment on your view of whether GLP 1 treatment over a few years can actually change the progression of Alzheimer s  And then second with respect to high dose Trulicity  could you please frame what we should focus on when we see the Phase 3 data and your planned positioning of that product  Thank you OperatorThanks  Dave  We ll go to Dan for the first question and then Mike for the second one Daniel M  Skovronsky    Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific OfficerThanks  Of course we are aware of the comments that Novo has make on GLP 1 and Alzheimer s disease and the potential there  Look forward to seeing data from that first trial  Look I think we know that GLP 1 treatment has beneficial cardiovascular outcomes  including we ve seen reductions on stroke  probably that s a tip of the iceberg and there s other micro infarcts that are decreased by GLP 1 therapy  That could over time contribute to a slower rate of cognitive decline  Is there a direct effective of GLP 1s on Alzheimer s pathology  I think that s not yet known So we ll watch how the field evolves  If it turns out that there are great opportunities  I think we have the best in class incretin in the form of tirzepatide and we d be opened to future opportunities for it OperatorThanks  Dan  Mike Mike Mason    Senior Vice President and President  Lilly DiabetesDavid  thanks for your question on our favorite subject  It proves we had another great quarter  growing by 32  on volume and 29  on revenue  We are still quite excited about the overall GLP market growth  The 52 week rate was at 29 7  while the monthly rate in December was at 31 5   So the market continues to grow and Trulicity continues to hold up in a very strong market share leadership position outpacing TRS class growth in the face of some of GLP type product launches So we expect that both the new Trulicity rewind  as well as the high dose label enhancements will continue to drive class growth as well as solidify our market leadership position place  So we re excited about that  I think as you take a look at the results of that  take a look at increased our A1C results  as well as the weight loss results And what we think is the strength of Trulicity is the fact that you get real world benefits by having powerful efficacy simply delivered and this will just give people using Trulicity another reason to stay on it Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Mike  David  thanks for your question  Next caller  please OperatorTerence Flynn from Goldman Sachs Terence Flynn    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  good morning and thanks for taking the questions  The first one is on tirzepatide and the CVOT trial  I was wondering if you can share any more details on the stats or powering assumptions there  as well as the discontinuation rate that you re assuming in the arms of the trial And then for Emgality you mentioned  looking into the next phase of growth here in the primary care market  what are some of the markers beyond obviously sales that we should look to in terms of gauging successful uptake there and then any thoughts on potential impact from oral CGRP  Thank you Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsOkay  thanks  We ll go to Dan for tirzepatide and then Mike and then Patrik for the oral CGRP question Daniel M  Skovronsky    Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific OfficerYeah  thanks for your question asking for more detail on the tirzepatide SURPASS CVOT trial design  I think at this moment we don t sort of comment on any of the finer details around clinical trial design and dropout rates  But I would say that having a trial like this where it s a head to head with two great active drugs  one on each arm should be a very compelling opportunity for enrolling physicians and a great opportunity for treatment for patients as well  So I think those kinds of factors should help with both enrollment and retention in the trial Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsGo ahead  Mike Mike Mason    Senior Vice President and President  Lilly DiabetesI think as we look at the opportunity and really learn from what providers and payers want  they want active competitors  I think this provides a lot of value and lot of insights into the incremental value of one product over another product  And so obviously doing a head to head trial versus Trulicity is a bold bat  but I think it really reinforces the confidence we have in tirzepatide in its population  So we re very excited about the study  It is a bold bat  but one that we are very excited about the potential of this product and CVOT Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Patrik Patrik Jonsson    Senior Vice President and President  Lilly Bio MedicinesThank you  If you look at on the prevention market with currency 6 million patients eligible for prevention treatment in the US  but only 3 million of those are being treated  So that s a big opportunity for us with increased competition in the market place as well to drive patient activation  And specifically for Emgality  if you look from the prescriber base today  it s relatively limited and only 15  of our targets are currently  regularly prescribing Emgality  so that s where we see a tremendous opportunity both in specialty care  as well as in primary care In terms of the oral CGRP  I think it s important to have in mind that they are only approved or will be approved for the treatment of acute migraine this year and the prevention indication is coming later on  We are very confident with the profile of Emgality  particularly taking into account that we are now the market leader and the preferred CGRP in the marketplace and particularly with a differentiation  we have been labeled with both efficacy of 50 75 and 100  level and also the convenience that the device offers from the same device platform as Trulicity The oral CGRPs will be competing in that huge space and we are also very excited about the announcement that was the pre publication notice from the DEA that was publicly displayed this morning and will result in an announcement in the Federal Register tomorrow  enabling us to bring Reyvow to the marketplace  probably late next week  And that s where we have a tremendous opportunity to bring more value in the space of acute migraine and for the first time we ll be able to talk about complete pain elimination already after two hours with one single dose of Reyvow and not just compete pain elimination  but also complete elimination of bothersome symptoms such as sun phobia  light sensitivity and nausea So we believe that we have very well positioned us in the preventive space as well as the acute phase but patient activation will be key and that s something that would be beneficial with also new entrants in the marketplace Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Patrik  Terence  thanks for your questions  Next caller  please OperatorSteve Scala from Cowen Steve Scala    Cowen    AnalystThank you  I have a couple of questions  I ll take the other side of an earlier question and suggest it would be surprising if DIAN TU didn t hit it endpoint given the signal you saw in the expedition trials and the fact that DIAN TU is testing a higher dose in a more homogeneous population for a longer time with the tailor made endpoint So Dan  I m trying to understand your pessimism and maybe you could please tell us on which of the points that I stated you disagree  And then there are four components to the primary endpoint  Do you need to hit all four to achieve success  Thank you Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Steve  Dan Daniel M  Skovronsky    Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific OfficerOkay  Steve  So look most of the commons you said are right  The importance of those factors in the outcome of the study is what we don t know  and there are other factors as I said earlier going against us here  The one that should give anyone the most pause I think is the small sample size and Alzheimer s trials are    I think even in large trials notorious for surprising us because of the heterogeneity of the fact and variability in the outcome measures  So it s factors like that that could make it difficult to really know what is true Look I still think it s regardless an interesting scientific question  a partner experiment we ll look forward to seeing the data  With respect to the specifics around the composite  I think the nature of a composite is that you have to hit the overall composite score as the primary endpoint  which could be driven by the various sub measures or not  but as you point out this was custom made for this trial Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Dan  Steve  thank for your questions  Next caller  please OperatorNavin Jacob from UBS Navin Jacob    UBS    AnalystThanks for taking the questions  Just on Verzenio  Pfizer has slightly delayed its IBRANCE adjuvant trial PALLAS to early 2021  Wondering    and they highlight the event rate progressing much slower  Wondering how relative to your expectations the event rate has been progressing and MONARCH  And is the time line still for an early 2021 readout  and any color on the potential for an interim would be appreciated  That s on Verzenio And then just on Humalog  I think your press release suggested that pricing in the US benefit from a better segment mix  Is that because of the volume shift to the Humalog authorized generic and that s assuming that the authorized generic is being recorded within the Humalog revenue line  I just wanted any    if you can provide any clarity on that  Thank you so much Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  thank you  We ll go to Anne for the question on Verzenio and Mike for the question on Humalog Anne E  White    Senior Vice President and President  Lilly OncologyNavin  thanks for the question on Verzenio  So as you know we have not disclosed any interim analysis  Now this is an event driven trial similar to PALLAS  but our estimates make us quite confident that we are looking at a readout in the first half of 2021  So we continue to expect that and as you know the trial unrolled remarkably well and so we re able to roll ahead of schedule  which helps obviously drive  Indecipherable  rates for that And again we specifically designed this trial with a high risk population and that was both a strategy of where we believe that Verzenio would really differentiate  but as well it drove the speed of the trial  So again we feel quite confident in that As you know the positive MONARCH 2 overall trial results  particularly as we saw those with primary resistance and visceral disease  really an eight month survival benefit in the patients with visceral disease really reinforce our confidence and the potential  the success of MONARCH  So we designed it with that high risk population and really used what we think are thoughtful selection factors the physicians use today to make prescribing decisions in that adjuvant setting  So things like the number of nodes involved  the tumor size and the measure of proliferation  And so we feel quite confident in the design of the study and again look forward to the readout in 2021 Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Anne  Mike Mike Mason    Senior Vice President and President  Lilly DiabetesThanks for your question on Humalog  The biggest drive in Humalog segment mix is the fact that with Humalog uptake they are taking volume away from Humalog in Medicaid since our Medicaid rebate rates are essentially 100   that TRx decline actually doesn t have    had a flat to positive impact on net revenues for Humalog Navin Jacob    UBS    AnalystAnd just to confirm the AG products are consolidated into the Humalog Kevin Hern    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Mike  Navin  thanks for your questions  We ll go to Dave

Lasmiditan is an orally available 5 HT1F receptor agonist that blocks pain transmission without the side effects of the class of migraine therapies called triptans  The 5 HT1F receptor is a serotonin subtype that lacks the vasoconstrictive properties of other serotonin receptors which can cause adverse cardiac events in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease

Reyvow was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in October  but a DEA review was required because it acts on the central nervous system  Now that it has received a favorable decision on the scheduling of the drug  Lilly said it will be available for prescription immediately and will be in pharmacies in the next few days 

The new migraine drug joins Emgality in Lilly s portfolio  the company s relatively new monthly injection for the prevention of migraines  Sales of Emgality have been ramping up quickly    it  generated  66 million in revenue in the fourth quarter  Lilly thinks it ll be able to leverage the infrastructure and experience from the Emgality launch to strengthen its position with Reyvow 
However  Reyvow has some  will additional competition  Allergan  NYSE AGN   which is seeking to merge with AbbVie  NYSE ABBV   received approval in December for UBRELVY  an oral acute treatment of migraines that s in the same drug class as Emgality  and it is available to patients

170828,392344,LLY,FDA Approves Eli Lilly s and Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals  Triple Combination Diabetes Drug Trijardy XR,news,"On Monday  the Food and Drug Administration approved Trijardy XR  a combination treatment that contains three drugs already approved for type 2 diabetes  Jardiance  Tradjenta  and the generic drug metformin 
Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  and its partner  Germany based Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals  will market the drug  as they do Jardiance and Tradjenta  The companies formed a strategic alliance in 2011 that brought their diabetes pipelines together 
Boehringer Ingelheim arguably brought more to the deal    it owned both Jardiance and Tradjenta    while Eli Lilly initially made an upfront payment to its new ally to even out the alliance 

On the surface  Trijardy XR is simply designed for convenience since the healthcare companies aren t making any claims about how well the triple combination works  The FDA approval was based on two clinical trials that showed the single pill produced an equivalent effect to taking the three individual pills for healthy volunteers 
But both Jardiance  which is an SGLT2 inhibitor  and Tradjenta  which inhibits DPP 4  are in competitive drug classes    multiple other treatments use the same mechanisms of action  Merck  for instance  sells SGLT2 inhibitor Steglatro and DPP 4 inhibitor Januvia  AstraZeneca markets SGLT2 inhibitor Farxiga and DPP 4 inhibitor Onglyza 
This triple combination pill could help keep competition at bay and encourage diabetes patients to stay in the Eli Lilly Boehringer Ingelheim family when their doctors want to add drugs in additional classes to their regimens  In fact  the companies already sell pills that pair each of the available double combinations    Synjardy  Jardiance and metformin   Glyxambi  Jardiance and Tradjenta   and Jentadueto  Tradjenta and metformin     facilitating the progression from a single drug to two drugs  and eventually to Trijardy XR ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnxzq,2069479
170830,392346,LLY,FDA Reviewing Eli Lilly s Cancer Drug Candidate Selpercatinib,news,"The Food and Drug Administration has agreed to give Eli Lilly s  NYSE LLY  cancer drug selpercatinib a priority review  which will shave four months off the review time  The agency is expected to deliver a decision about the marketing application in the third quarter of 2020  although it could come sooner considering that the drug has been given a  breakthrough therapy  designation 
Eli Lilly inherited selpercatinib  which used to go by the code name LOXO 292  through its  8 billion acquisition of Loxo Oncology last year  Much of the value of that company was tied to its already approved cancer therapy Vitrakvi  but selpercatinib was touted as the pipeline drug to watch 
Selpercatinib inhibits a protein called RET  which is involved in cell signaling in the presence of growth factors  The gene becomes altered in some tumors  leading to uncontrolled cell growth 

Eli Lilly has applied for approval of the treatment in three different types of tumors with altered RET  non small cell lung cancer  medullary thyroid cancer  and thyroid cancer  Its application is based on data from the Libretto 001 phase 1 2 clinical trial  where initial results showed response rates between 45  and 77  in the different types of tumors  More recent results focused on lung cancer patients showed 68  of them responding to the treatment 
In December  the pharmaceutical company started two phase 3 clinical trials  Libretto 431 in lung cancer patients and Libretto 531 medullary thyroid cancer patients  Both studies will enroll patients who hadn t been previously treated  so in addition to confirming the results from the phase 1 2 study  data from the new studies could be used to pursue an expanded approval that would increase the population of patients approved to be treated with selpercatinib ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pojn8,2070924
170859,392375,LLY,Drugmakers slash prices to be eligible for China s bulk buy program,news,"BEIJING  Reuters    Global pharmaceutical majors and generic drugmakers chopped by 53  on average prices of some of their off patent products in the latest bidding round under China s national bulk buy program  government officials said late on Friday 
Beijing has been pushing forward the program where drugmakers have to go through a bidding process and cut prices low enough to be considered over generic copies and be allowed to sell their products at public hospitals via large volume government procurement 
Some global firms such as AstraZeneca  L AZN  and Merck  N MRK  have already cautioned about intensifying price pressures on their mature brands in the world s second largest drug market  as China expands the usage of the program 
In the latest bidding on Friday that involved 33 drugs and 122 companies  Bayer  DE BAYGn  slashed the price of its popular diabetes treatment Acarbose to 0 18 yuan   0 0262  per pill  78 5  lower than the price ceiling set by the government in December last year  elbowing some Chinese generic providers out of the tender  according to a Reuters calculation based on the preliminary results released by the authority overseeing the program 
Bayer was not immediately available for a comment 
 Products that won bids in this round of centralized procurement saw a huge price drop  which squeezes out unreasonable overpricing that has existed in drug distribution for a long time   the authority said in a statement published alongside the preliminary result on Friday 
Sale prices of over 100 types of commonly used drugs are on average about 17 to 18 times of their manufacturing costs  the statement said 
Chinese copycats won bids for most of the 33 drugs  including generic versions for drugs ranging from Johnson   Johnson s  N JNJ  prostate cancer treatment Zytiga to Eli Lilly s  N LLY  erectile dysfunction treatment Cialis  the results showed 
In Friday s bidding  for products with two bid winners  60  of the government procurement volume can be shared among the winners  according to official document detailing the tender rules released in December  For products with four winners and more  as much as 80  of the volume can be shared among the companies

170861,392377,LLY,What Company Will Eli Lilly Buy Next ,news,"Targeting smaller  bolt on  acquisitions in the range of  1 billion to  5 billion  Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  plans to expand its research and development pipeline by acquiring a company roughly every quarter  The company s CFO made these comments during the J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference as he discussed the company s  1 1 billion purchase of Dermira  NASDAQ DERM   

Knowing that the big pharmaceutical company is going shopping  some biotech deal makers and investors looking for exits hope their companies will be snapped up next  Here we will explore a few companies that could be on Lilly s shopping list 
Arvinas
Following its public debut in 2018  Arvinas  NASDAQ ARVN  is set to commence its first human clinical trial this year with its protein degraders  This approach aims to eliminate unwanted disease causing proteins  whereas many other cancer approaches  including Lilly s  try to stop those proteins from being made at all 
What s attractive for Lilly  Two cancer programs  for specific prostate and breast cancers  should enter clinical trials in 2020  The approach complements Lilly s targeted oncology R D and has further application into neuroscience  another therapeutic area of interest for Lilly  Priced at nearly  2 billion today  Arvinas would not be a cheap acquisition  but it would bring a whole new approach to targeted treatments in multiple disease areas 
Alector
To bolster its pipeline aimed at neurodegeneration  Lilly needs to look no further than Alector  NASDAQ ALEC   Alector s immunology driven approach tackles difficult diseases like dementia and Alzheimer s  both of which Lilly targets already  Alector s lead clinical stage programs aim to increase the expression of the protein progranulin  a regulator of immune activity in the brain  Pursuing the same diseases through different  unique mechanisms makes Alector a reasonable target should Lilly wish to expand its portfolio of drugs for neurodegeneration 
SpringWorks Therapeutics
Targeted therapies continue to be all the rage in oncology  and with good reason  Drugs are gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration after relatively small clinical trials  This is the result of personalized medicine where patients receive specific drugs to match the genetic profile of their tumors  SpringWorks Therapeutics  NASDAQ SWTX  aims to acquire and develop treatments for genetically defined tumors which dovetails with the revamped oncology strategy Lilly announced in December 
SpringWorks  pipeline boasts three drugs  with two in potential registrational clinical trials for rare types of cancers  As a business model  it focuses on in licensing promising drugs rather than discovering them in house  That it has specific drug candidates and not a platform technology may make it more attractive for a potential pharmaceutical buyer  The buyer gets specific compounds and does not have to contend with integrating an early stage research operation  SpringWorks only went public last September  but shareholders and employees may prefer a buyout over the risk of potential clinical trial setbacks 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals
This one may be less obvious at first  but hear me out  First  Lilly would gain Tavalisse  a drug for adult immune thrombocytopenia purpura  ITP   a disease whereby the body attacks its own blood platelets  Tavalisse s sales continue to grow  but a broader push under the Eli Lilly brand could help it jump in market share  Rigel Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ RIGL  hopes to expand Tavalisse s approval to include warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia  a disease affecting 45 000 Americans in which the body destroys its own blood cells  Rigel believes this could be a  1 billion market  
The remainder of Rigel s pipeline fits Lilly s therapeutic focus  Two early stage immunology drugs use mechanisms different from Lilly s own efforts  Rigel successfully licensed four other drugs  allowing it to sit back and collect milestones and royalties  The two oncology drugs fit the targeted therapy approach pursued by Eli Lilly  Rigel out licensed two dermatology drugs to Aclaris  One aims to tackle alopecia areata  an autoimmune disorder causing hair loss in around 6 8 million people in the U S   The other could treat atopic dermatitis  better known as eczema  Lilly has R D programs for these diseases  including one drug with a similar mechanism to Rigel s atopic dermatitis candidate   
Stay tuned
We will have to wait to see what Lilly ultimately buys    if anything  Don t forget Lilly can easily snap up private companies as it did in the 2018 acquisition of cancer company AurKa Pharma  The risks associated with investing in biotech are many  and trying to invest in companies likely to be acquired at a premium can be exceptionally challenging since big pharma companies often keep their cards close to the vest ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plv9k,2065914

Diabetes patients that want to manage their blood sugar levels with Humalog Mix 75 25 or Humalog Junior will have a new less expensive option  Eli Lilly will offer generic versions of both insulin lispro containing brands 

Wider margins at half the price
A five pack of Insulin Lispro Protamine injector pens will have a list price set at  265 20  which is less than half as much as the identical product branded as Humalog Mix75 25  Despite the steep discount  Eli Lilly will probably record more net revenue from each pen sold as a generic 
Insurers and healthcare plan sponsors have a bottomless appetite for rebates and discounts that they don t always share with their customers  The gap between list prices Eli Lilly raises each year and the amount the company records as net revenue has finally reached a breaking point 
A not so big deal
During the first nine months of 2019  sales of Humalog and Humulin products fell to  3 0 billion but its continued decline isn t going to send Eli Lilly off a cliff  That s because the pharmaceutical company has done an impressive job expanding its line of successful product offerings in recent years

170894,392410,LLY,Eli Lilly to offer half priced versions of two more insulin products,news,"By Manas Mishra and Michael Erman
 Reuters    Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  and Co said on Tuesday it plans to sell two versions of insulin products at half their current U S  list prices  eight months after it started selling a half priced version of its widely used Humalog injection 
Lilly will sell new versions of Humalog Junior KwikPen and Humalog Mix75 25  which contains a mix of fast  and intermediate acting insulin  at a list price of  265 20 for a pack of five KwikPens  They will be available at that price by mid April  the company said 
Major insulin makers Lilly  Sanofi  PA SASY  SA and  Novo Nordisk   CSE NOVOb  have been making some of their life sustaining diabetes medicine available at lower costs to counter heavy criticism from lawmakers and patients 
People with Type 1 diabetes need insulin to control blood sugar levels  and it is also used by some with advanced Type 2 diabetes as well  Its cost in the United States nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016  and stories have emerged of patients forced into risky rationing of the medicine 
Lilly has said insulin is highly rebated  meaning that list price does not reflect the actual cost  Drugmakers argue they have to keep list prices high because of rebates or discounts they must pay to pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers to get products on their lists of covered drugs 
 Insurance coverage should ensure no one with diabetes is forced to ration or skip doses for financial reasons   Lilly diabetes head Mike Mason said in a statement on Tuesday 
T1International  which represents people with Type 1 diabetes  said Lilly s half price insulin has been difficult to obtain and said the latest move  may be nothing more than a further PR response to continued pressure from advocates  
 The two pen types that were added to Lilly s half price offerings today will undoubtedly lead to positive headlines for Lilly  but these pens are not widely used in the type 1 diabetes community and will do little good for patients if they are unable to obtain them   the group s U S  advocacy manager  Allison Bailey  said in an email 
Lilly in May started selling a half priced version of Humalog called Insulin Lispro 
For the week of Dec  30  around 22  of U S  prescriptions for Humalog were filled with the company s half priced version  according to data compiled by retail drug price tracker GoodRx from sources including pharmacies and insurers 
Novo Nordisk said earlier this month it would offer free insulin to U S  patients in immediate need  following its September announcement that U S  patients can buy three vials or two packs of pens of its analog insulins for  99

It will focus largely on earlier stage opportunities across key therapeutic areas including oncology  pain  immunology  and neurology  CFO John Smiley told Reuters in an interview at the JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco earlier this week 
Eli Lilly has been on a deal making spree in recent years in a bid to increase products and sales in core franchises as older blockbuster medicines  such as diabetes treatment Humalog  face generic competition and pressure to lower prices 
Last week  it announced a  1 1 billion deal to buy dermatology products maker  Dermira  Inc  O DERM   With the purchase  Lilly will acquire Dermira s experimental treatment for atopic dermatitis  a serious form of eczema  which is in late stage testing  as well as an approved medicated cloth to treat excessive armpit sweating

In a presentation to investors this week  Lilly Chief Executive David Ricks said most of its deals will be in the cancer space  but that other therapeutic areas remain of strong interest as well 
While the company is still looking at late stage assets  Smiley said the most opportunity for shareholders is in drugs in earlier stages of development 
Deals could include licensing agreements  outright acquisitions  or other structures  he added 
In its most recent earnings call  Lilly forecast a higher than expected profit for 2020  citing growing demand for its newer medicines including diabetes drug Trulicity and Taltz for psoriasis and other related autoimmune diseases

What s on Eli Lilly s wish list 
While there are plenty of young growth drivers in Lilly s product line  sales of aging insulin lispro products sold under the Humalog brand are under a lot of pressure  Instead of growing its presence in the increasingly crowded space for diabetes drugs  though  Eli Lilly will probably continue expanding into immunology and oncology 
The recent acquisition of Dermira gives Lilly access to an experimental treatment for eczema which could be an important revenue stream in the years ahead  Last year s purchase of Loxo Oncology showed us management is serious about developing new targeted cancer therapies and we can reasonably expect the company to buy more mid sized companies developing new tumor blasters treatments ",2020-01-17,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjdn1,2062142

170930,392446,LLY,Eli Lilly to Boost Its Dermatology Pipeline with  1 1 Billion Dermira Acquisition,news,"The midwest s largest pharmaceutical company  Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  recently made a big bet on a protein that nearly landed on a scrap heap just a couple of years ago  Today  Lilly announced its plans to acquire Dermira  NASDAQ DERM  a commercial stage biotechnology company developing a potential new eczema treatment called lebrikizumab  The deal is valued at  1 1 billion  
Dermira markets disposable cloths that prevent excessive underarm sweating under the Qbrexza brand  but sales reached just  20 7 million during the first nine months of 2019  The asset Eli Lilly s really interested in is lebrikizumab  an IL 13 IL 4 inhibitor that leans toward IL 13 

The one that got away
Dermira s developing lebrikizumab to treat patients with moderate to severe eczema  but this protein wasn t discovered by Dermira  Roche  OTC RHHBY  quickly out licensed lebrikizumab in 2017 after it failed to provide a clear benefit for asthma patients in a mid stage clinical trial 
Dermira stock began rocketing higher last spring after the company reported encouraging results from an eczema study with 280 patients  Although Roche probably wishes it held on to lebrikizumab  the Swiss pharmaceutical giant is still eligible to receive significant milestone payments if lebrikizumab continues to and a royalty percentage that tops out in the high teens 
Competition ahead
Regeneron  NASDAQ REGN  and Sanofi  NASDAQ SNY  market Dupixent  an IL 4 inhibitor that succeeded in studies with eczema patients and patients with severe asthma  Dupixent launched in 2017 and sales hit  1 6 billion during the first nine months of 2019  That suggests there s a good chance that annual lebrikizumab sales can reach  1 billion a few short years from now as a treatment for eczema alone ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pghkv,2057020

Top line data from the BREEZE AD5 study showed that 16 week treatment with 2mg dose of Olumiant met the primary endpoint of at least 75  improvement in skin inflammation  measured by Eczema Area and Severity Index   EASI    from baseline  BREEZE AD5  conducted in North America  evaluated 1 mg and 2 mg doses of Olumiant as a monotherapy in AD patients 
The higher dose of the drug also met a key secondary endpoint of another measure of skin inflammation defined by clear or almost clear skin and at least 2 points improvement in the validated Investigator s Global Assessment for AD  This marks the fifth successful completion of a late stage study evaluating Olumiant in AD patients 
Detailed data from the study will be presented at future scientific conferences and published in peer reviewed journals  Lilly has already submitted a regulatory application seeking approval for label expansion of Olumiant to treat AD patients in Europe  Data from the BREEZE AD5 study will support a supplemental new drug application or sNDA submission to the FDA for a similar label expansion of the drug 
The company previously completed successfully four phase III AD studies   BREEZE AD1  BREEZE AD2  BREEZE AD4 and BREEZE AD7  While 2mg and 4mg dosages of Olumiant met the primary endpoint of BREEZE AD1 and BREEZE AD2 studies  only 4mg dose of the drug met the primary endpoint in BREEZE AD7 study  Earlier this week  the company reported data from BREEZE AD4 study that demonstrated 4mg of Olumiant plus topical corticosteroids achieved at least 75  improvement in EASI from baseline after 16 weeks of treatment 
In the past year  shares of Lilly have gained 19  compared with the  s increase of 12 4  

 
Olumiant is one of the drugs in Lilly s new pharmaceutical product portfolio  which is anticipated to be a key top line driver going ahead  The drug generated  426 9 million in 2019  up more than 110  year over year mainly driven by upbeat sales in Europe 
Lilly is also developing Olumiant as a treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus and alopecia areata in mid to late stage studies 
Meanwhile  competition is on the rise in the JAK inhibitor segment as well as the eczema market  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi s Dupixent is approved for treating AD since 2017 while AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   and Pfizer   NYSE PFE   are developing their respective candidates for the indication in late stage studies Eli Lilly and Company Price

170957,392473,LLY,Drugmakers slash prices in China to get on reimbursement list,news,"By Roxanne Liu and Brenda Goh
BEIJING SHANGHAI  Reuters    Drugmakers including Roche  S ROG  and Novartis   S NOVN  have agreed to cut the prices of some of their newest drugs by an average of 61  in China in order to get on a national reimbursement scheme list  regulators said 
Addition to the list is likely to boost sales volume by opening up markets in smaller and less affluent Chinese cities  but some industry insiders have cautioned that only offering deep price cuts in China could spark criticism of the drugmakers in other markets 
Seventy new drugs such as Roche s  S ROG  breast cancer treatment Pertuzumab  sold under the trade name Perjeta  Novartis s  S NOVN  dermatitis treatment Omalizumab  branded as Xolair  will be added to the list  the National Healthcare Security Administration said on its website on Thursday 
Chinese patients are allowed to use their state medical insurance to cover a significant portion of the cost of drugs named on the list 
Almost all the imported drugs added to the list in the latest update had the  lowest prices globally   the NHSA said in its statement 
 China is and will be the ultimate high volume  low price market  and so international companies feel that they ll have to take a big pay cut but make up for the volume   Brad Loncar  chief executive of biopharma sector dedicated Loncar Investments  told Reuters 
Tumor and diabetes medicines saw an average price cut of about 65   according to the NHSA 
Other drugs added included Adalimumab  an arthritis treatment which AbbVie  N ABBV  sells as Humira  one the top selling drugs in the world 
Also included was cancer treatment Tyvyt  or Sintilimab  co developed by Chinese drugmaker Innovent Biologics  HK 1801  and Eli Lilly  N LLY   It is considered to be a PD 1 PD L1 treatment  a category of novel drugs that work on the immune system to fight cancer cells 
China has already approved five PD 1 PD L1 treatments  including two top selling global blockbusters made by foreign firms Bristol Myers Squibb  N BMY  and Merck  N MRK   However neither have been added to the list 
Analysts say domestically developed Tyvyt s early inclusion could give it an advantage over its foreign rivals 
 Maybe  Chinese PD 1 PD L1 products  don t come in and compete on day one with international  pharmas  in all indications  but just getting a foot in the door might already be a big step for them   UBS analyst Michael Leuchten told Reuters before the NHSA announcement ",2019-11-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/drugmakers-slash-prices-in-china-to-get-on-reimbursement-list-2029938,2029938

170959,392475,LLY,Better Buy  Eli Lilly vs  GlaxoSmithKline,news,"GlaxoSmithKline  NYSE GSK  and Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  are two of the bigger names in healthcare  and they re great options for investors looking to add safe stocks to their portfolios  They have strong fundamentals  and as these two drug manufacturers continue to produce new and exciting medicines  they ll also provide investors with long term growth 
Let s look at how they ve been doing of late to see which stock has the edge today 
Does Eli Lilly offer investors enough growth 
One of the big challenges for Eli Lilly in recent years has been its struggle to generate much growth  Sales of  24 6 billion in 2018 were up a modest 7 4  from 2017 s tally of  22 9 billion  And they ve only grown 25  since 2014  when Eli Lilly reported revenue of  19 6 billion  The positive is that the company s bottom line has remained in the black in four of the past five years  with the only blemish relating to a large income tax bill in 2017  
But lack of sales growth is what s kept the stock down for much of the year  Although the company beat earnings forecasts in Q3 when it released its results in October  the stock still failed to impress investors  That s because one of its key drugs  Taltz  which treats autoimmune diseases  generated just  340 million  well shy of the  400 million expected by analysts 
Total revenue growth for the quarter was just 3 2  with sales reaching  5 5 billion  One area that continued to do well for the company was endocrinology  where sales from that segment were up 10 8  from the prior year quarter 

Eli Lilly got a boost in its share price in December when CFO Josh Smiley updated investors with guidance for 2020  The company anticipates sales for this coming year between  23 6 billion and  24 1 billion  which will be around a 7  increase from the  22 billion to  22 5 billion that the company anticipates it will finish 2019 with 
Is GlaxoSmithKline the safer bet 
One area that GlaxoSmithKline  GSK  hasn t struggled with is growing its sales  The company released its Q3 results in October  which saw revenue growth of 16  from the prior year quarter  totaling  9 4 billion British pounds   12 2 billion   The company upgraded its forecast  no longer expecting profits for the year to decline between 3  to 5  and instead expecting its bottom line to be in line with the prior year s results  
A driving force behind the strong performance has been the strong success of shingles vaccine Shingrix  which saw sales grow 76  during the quarter  coming in higher than analysts were expecting 
There s still a lot more in the works for GSK  Its ovarian cancer drug Zejula has been making progress  with the Food and Drug Administration approving it for use in the treatment of ovarian  fallopian tube  and peritoneal cancer  The company has a total of 41 medicines currently in development  In October  GSK filed a new drug application for Trelegy Ellipta  a single inhaler triple therapy to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases  which the company says will make the treatment option the first of its kind in the U S  market 
GSK has the edge for multiple reasons
With many products in the works and the company showing better growth numbers than Eli Lilly  GSK makes a lot of sense for investors on many fronts  Its forward P E of 15 also makes it a better value buy than Lilly  which has a forward P E of over 19  GSK s dividend yield of 4 2  is an added bonus for investors  since it s well above the S P 500 average of 2  and higher than Eli Lilly s yield of 2 3  
Both of these healthcare stocks are good options for investors  but GSK is the better buy when factoring in its recent results  dividend yield  and overall valuation ",2020-01-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pd1g5,2051801

170968,392484,LLY,With a backup to the backup  insulin makers say they re primed for Brexit,news,"By Kate Holton and Paul Sandle LONDON  Reuters    For two men trained as scientists  the bosses of Britain s major insulin providers have had to become experts in ferry schedules  trucking laws and warehouse capacity as they seek to guarantee the supply of life saving drugs through a chaotic Brexit  With Britain set to leave the European Union within weeks  Pinder Sahota at the world s biggest insulin maker  Novo Nordisk   CSE NOVOb   and Sanofi s Hugo Fry have rebuilt operations to withstand the most turbulent of events   The two companies told Reuters they had spent millions of pounds  which they cannot recoup  stockpiling millions of packets of insulin   used to treat diabetes   inside Britain and building new shipping and air freight routes  Their plans  formulated over three years  show the lengths companies across the continent are having to go to overhaul long standing supply chains that may not survive Britain s biggest trade upheaval in half a century   There is nothing comparable to this   Novo Nordisk s UK General Manager Sahota told Reuters of the Danish company s preparation   It s unprecedented from a logistics point of view  We re preparing for the worst case scenario  the most extreme   With two Brexit deadlines already been and gone  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU with or without a deal by Oct  31   increasing the chance of a sudden departure that brings trade tariffs and customs checks with the continent for the first time in decades   The government s own planning shows that  in a worst case scenario  lorries seeking to enter Europe at the French port of Calais could face delays of two and a half days  creating supply disruptions that could last for months  That poses a real risk for the pharmaceutical industry which imports 37 million packs of drugs from Europe a month  According to the government  three quarters come via that route   While Britain s GSK and AstraZeneca are world leaders in respiratory and cardiovascular treatments  Britain s insulin is imported   In the case of pharmaceuticals  you can t just throw things onto a boat or a lorry  you have to test and validate these routes into the country   Fry told Reuters in his office to the west of London  adding they had backups to their backup plans   Both Sanofi  PA SASY  and Novo Nordisk have reserved space on ferries going the longer route to eastern English ports to avoid the main Calais Dover crossing if needed  and also air freight if required    We anticipate that route is going to become congested so what we ve done is open up other routes   said Sahota   So two other routes that we ve opened up are Denmark to Immingham  in north east England  and Netherlands to Immingham   SKY HIGH STOCKPILES Novo Nordisk  Britain s biggest insulin supplier  has tripled its warehouse capacity to hold 18 weeks  worth of stock   3 8 million packs that piled high would stand 12 times the height of the London Shard skyscraper   Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  of the United States and France s Sanofi  the country s second and third biggest suppliers  have similar stockpiles  Frustration is growing that while they dedicate huge resources to such preparation  they are spending less time on their normal jobs   When we re doing this

balance sheet  on our logistics  keeping all this additional stock in the country  It s not an ideal situation    The companies are confident they will be able to guarantee the British supply of insulin to the around 1 million diabetes patients who need it   But some patients like Georgina from London  who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes more than 30 years ago  have become increasingly alarmed as the chances have grown of Britain leaving the EU without a deal to govern their trading relationship   For me  I can t tell you how worried I am about that  It s life threatening for me   she said  declining to give her last name  She added that she also worried about older patients she encountered at clinics  The British government is organising a regular freight service reserved just for drugs as part of its preparations alongside industry for Brexit on Oct  31    We are doing everything we can to help ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted  including insulin   said the department of health and social care   The two drug companies did not say how much their Brexit preparations had cost  beyond many millions of pounds  With fixed contracts with Britain s health service  they cannot raise prices   Both Fry and Sahota have had to delve into arcane areas of transport   As part of their planning  for example  they have had to factor in how many drivers are needed to avoid breaking legally mandated rest laws  how long refrigerated lorries can operate in one stretch  and what happens in the event of fuel shortages

170971,392487,LLY,Novo Nordisk targets bigger slice of diabetes market with new tablet,news,"By Stine Jacobsen
COPENHAGEN  Reuters    Danish drugmaker  Novo Nordisk   CO NOVOb  is aiming for a big slice of the multibillion dollar diabetes market with a new pill  approved by U S  authorities on Friday  that caters for patients with an aversion to needles 
The company built its position as the world s biggest insulin maker on the back of injectable drugs  but now aims to transform the market with a first of its kind tablet version of its semaglutide drug 
While more than 70  of diabetes prescriptions in the United States are already for oral treatments  none of these are from the GLP 1 class that Novo specializes in  and which are viewed as highly effective medicines that stimulate insulin production 
 We have only worked with around 25  of the patients so far and we see it as a breakthrough because we can now also address the tablet based market   chief scientific officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen told Reuters on Monday 
Investors have been concerned the once daily pill  known as Rybelsus  would be sold more cheaply than comparable injectable treatments as Novo tries to secure a foothold in the tablet market  where drugs tend to be cheaper 
However  chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen told analysts the monthly price would be similar to the company s once weekly injectable version of semaglutide  Ozempic  which has a list price of nearly  800 per month 
 Overall this removes a concern that the company would have been forced much lower on price   said Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia  who has an  outperform  rating on Novo shares 
Competitors include Eli Lilly s  N LLY  injectable Trulicity and Merck s  N MRK  Januvia  an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin  A study last year showed Novo s tablet was superior to Januvia in demonstrating reductions in both long term blood sugar level and weight 
 We have a very strong position if you look at the leading tablet treatments in the market   Thomsen said 
Novo hopes to convince doctors that Rybelsus  which brokerage Pareto estimates will have sales of at least 36 6 billion Danish crowns   5 4 billion  in 2026  provides a new weapon to tackle diabetes earlier  and highly effectively

170975,392491,LLY,FDA approves Pfenex s osteoporosis therapy,news," Reuters    The U S  Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved a bone building drug from Pfenex Inc to treat osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fractures  giving the company its first commercial product 
The company said it is seeking the FDA s authorization to designate the drug  PF708  as therapeutically equivalent to Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  and Co s injectable drug Forteo 
This would permit PF708 to be automatically substituted for Forteo  which lost its market exclusivity in many U S  states in August 
Pfenex hopes to market PF708 as a cheaper option for Forteo  which brought in global revenue of  1 58 billion last year 
Pfenex said it was conducting a comparative study between PF708 and Forteo and expects to submit a final report to the FDA as early as the second half of October 
 We currently expect our commercial partner Alvogen to launch PF708 upon an FDA decision on the therapeutic equivalence rating   Pfenex Chief Executive Officer Eef Schimmelpennink said in a statement 
Analysts at William Blair expect PF708 to bring in sales of  96 1 million at its peak in 2021

170993,392509,LLY,Exclusive  Germany s Bayer seeks animal health merger with Elanco   sources,news,"By Arno Schuetze and Pamela Barbaglia
FRANKFURT LONDON  Reuters    Bayer  DE BAYGn  has approached U S  drug firm  Elanco Animal Health   N ELAN  to discuss a possible combination of their pet health businesses to create an industry giant  three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters 
The two companies are working with banks to ensure any merger would secure regulatory approval  the sources said  speaking on condition of anonymity 
Bayer has delayed the launch of an auction to private equity funds to clinch a bilateral deal with Elanco  the fourth largest player in the animal health industry globally  the sources said 
The German drugmaker is under pressure to raise cash and boost its share price after its  63 billion purchase of  Monsanto   NYSE MON  
Bayer ranks fifth in veterinary medicine  Aside from Elanco  its bigger rivals are former  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  unit Zoetis  unlisted Boehringer Ingelheim  which bought animal health assets from Sanofi  PA SASY   and drugmaker Merck   Co 
Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann said in November his company would divest several assets including its animal health division  which analysts have said could fetch 6 billion to 7 billion euros   6 7 billion  7 8 billion  
The sources said discussions with Elanco were at an early stage and Bayer remained interested in receiving bids from private equity investors later this year 
An auction process was initially expected to start in June but Bayer would only dispatch information packages to prospective bidders towards the end of the summer  they said 
A Bayer spokesman said the firm was  progressing as planned  with efforts to separate the animal health business 
 After the strategic review of the possibilities  the main focus is on a sale   he said  adding Bayer continued to  consider all value maximising options   He declined to comment on Elanco 
Elanco  which also declined to comment on any deal  offers more than 125 products to veterinarians and food animal producers in more than 90 countries 
The company  based in Greenfield in the U S  state of Indiana  has a market value of  12 billion but it might struggle to finance an outright acquisition of Bayer s unit unless the German drugmaker decided to retain a stake in the combined entity  two sources said 
Elanco inherited a significant amount of debt from its previous owner Eli Lilly  N LLY   which spun it off last year 
As of December  it had about  2 5 billion of overall senior debt  In its annual report  it warned investors about the risk of failing to generate sufficient cash to service all its debts 
The sources said an all cash sale to Elanco was unlikely  adding Bayer would need to keep a stake in the merged company to secure a deal 
Private equity firms may offer an easier exit for the German group but they are expected to value the company at a much lower price due to its declining business  the sources said 
Buyout funds had tried to take control of Elanco when it was part of Eli Lilly but the company opted for a more lucrative spin off and listed the business in New York where it trades at about 20 times earnings

171001,392517,LLY,5 Best Performing Biotech Mutual Funds Of 2019,opinion,The biotechnology industry witnessed remarkable growth last year  owing to a series of mergers and acquisitions  initial public offerings  collaborative operations and new job additions in the space that boosted it throughout 2019  What s more  the products and services offered by the industry are always in demand because of their nature  which makes biotech a lucrative investment space irrespective of market conditions Biotech Indexes Fare Well in 2019The industry made headlines since the beginning of 2019  thanks to numerous mergers and acquisitions  and initial public offerings that kept the space in investors  focus  Bristol Myers Squibb s acquisition of Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ CELG  and Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  and Company s acquisition of Loxo Oncology were some of the major deals that took place last year Second  the number of initial public offerings was also considerable  Biotech IPOs have been increasing steadily over the past few years  This is because biotech companies require significant financing  particularly as they advance their research  By going public  a significant portion of this much required financing is taken care of  This also makes these biotech firms more visible for collaborations and acquisitions Strategic collaborations also surfaced as major game changers for the industry  Amgen s collaboration with BeiGene and Biogen s partnership with C4 Therapeutics were some crucial alliances last year Owing to these factors  major biotech ETFs and indexes performed impressively in 2019  Specifically  the SPDR S P Biotech ETF  NYSE XBI   iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  IBB   ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology  BIB  and NASDAQ Biotechnology Index  NBI  gained

171005,392521,LLY,Blue blooded crabs at heart of pharma dispute on drug testing,news,"By John Miller ZURICH  Reuters    If you ve received a vaccination  hip replacement or chemotherapy without suffering toxic shock  chances are you ve benefited from a vast bloodletting of horseshoe crabs  Every year  fishermen net hundreds of thousands of the creatures off the U S  East Coast and in Asia before their prized milky blue blood is drained for use in medical safety tests  Swiss biotech Lonza  S LONN  and U S  based Charles River Laboratories  N CRL  are the biggest suppliers of crab blood based endotoxin tests  which detect bacterial contamination in intravenous drugs and medical implants  They are now at odds over the future of this testing  as Lonza urges adoption of a synthetic alternative called recombinant Factor C  rFC   amid pressure from wildlife campaigners and worries about supply reliability   Meanwhile Charles River  which is still studying rFC  argues moving too quickly could compromise patient safety  There s much at stake   for both companies  the industry and  of course  horseshoe crabs  a 450 million year old species that s more closely related to scorpions than crustaceans   Endotoxin tests number 70 million annually and are rising  If rFC gains traction  it could re shuffle winners and losers in the global market for such testing that is seen growing about 13  a year to close to  700 million in annual revenue by 2021 and  1 billion by 2024  according to market researchers   For Lonza  whose internal testing growth estimates are more modest  the risk is that the synthetic method won t catch on  hurting efforts to capitalize on a  460 million investment it made in 2006 when it bought the technology along with a peer s biological businesses  Conversely  Charles River risks becoming a laggard if the technique wins wide acceptance  PHARMACOPOEIA PUSH The leading U S  pharmaceuticals standards organization  U S  Pharmacopoeia  USP   which publishes a compendium of drug information  told Reuters it was pressing ahead to recognize synthetic tests as comparable to crab blood based ones   There is a consensus on moving forward and USP is fully committed   said Fouad Atouf  USP s Science Global Biologics head   Making sure all the stakeholders are on board and all the data has been collected is what s happening right now   he said  with proposed revisions recognizing rFC due around September for public consultation  That coincides with a push by USP s European counterpart in Strasbourg  to recognize rFC  Japan is also working on the issue  France s  Biomerieux   PA BIOX  and Germany s privately held Haemochrom Diagnostica  which have versions of rFC  are also eager to see pharmacopoeias act   Lonza said its rFC product  PyroGene  now accounts for less than 5 percent of its endotoxin test sales but sees fortunes changing as global pharmacopoeias act   We would hope to see around 10  by 2021   Lonza said  It has won a big customer for PyroGene  Eli Lilly s  N LLY  migraine medicine Emgality last year became the first rFC tested drug to win U S  regulatory approval  Roche  S ROG  and Bayer  DE BAYGn  told Reuters they were also considering rFC   UNACCEPTABLE RISK  Charles River insists additional scrutiny is necessary before rFC technology wins equal standing   Companies pushing rFC must prove it can detect endotoxins in the real world  not just the manufactured strains used so far in studying the synthetic agent  said John Dubczak  Charles River s microbial solutions manager   A move by the pharmaceutical industry towards current rFC methods is premature   said Dubczak  adding more data is needed  Lonza points to analyses by multiple drugmakers demonstrating rFC was comparable to the crab blood tests in ensuring drugs were contaminant free  To be sure  Lonza has no plans to stop bleeding crabs  since many existing medical products will continue to be tested with traditional methods  it said   The industry predicts the global crab blood based test market will also expand in the next few years  But Lonza is counting on rFC emerging as a new pillar of its testing business  contributing to its goal of more than 7 billion Swiss francs   7 1 billion  in group annual revenue by 2022  from 5 5 billion francs  NATURE S INGENUITY Horseshoe crabs  copper rich blood has helped them survive since before the dinosaurs in brackish coastal waters by clotting around endotoxins  the potentially dangerous molecules found in cell walls of bacteria like E  coli   Scientists harnessed nature s ingenuity  using crab blood to make so called amebocyte lysate endotoxin tests which  by the 1970s  began displacing tests on rabbits that were injected with medicine then monitored for fever   However  concerns have since escalated over wildlife conservation and the supply chain s reliability   In Asia  where horseshoe crabs are also eaten by humans  the tri spine species is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as at risk of extinction  Two other species are also imperiled   Glenn Gauvry  director of the Delaware based Ecological Research and Development Group which focuses on horseshoe crab conservation  said Asian crabs destined for dinner tables were first  rented  to biomedical companies for bleeding  Gauvry contends the biomedical industry is perpetuating consumption of crabs in Asia and contributing to their decline  Lonza does not harvest Asian crab blood   Charles River  which does  said it followed local rules    Horseshoe crab blood is collected only to a point where the crab naturally stops bleeding   Dubczak said  adding its Asian suppliers and local governments were responsible for ensuring crabs were released into  waters of appropriate salinity   RUFA RED KNOT Studies paint a mixed picture of the blood harvest s effects on U S  East Coast horseshoe crabs  hundreds of thousands of which are also killed annually for bait or caught incidentally by commercial fishermen hunting other marine species  Those caught by Lonza  Charles River and Associates of Cape Cod  owned by Japan s  Seikagaku Corp   T 4548   are drained of about a third of their blood  then returned alive to the sea  An Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission report from May indicates current harvest levels  appear to be sustainable    Additionally  a recent U S  Geological Survey study found bled crabs  survival rates may exceed those of non bled crabs in New Jersey s Delaware Bay   However  previous studies found anywhere between 4  to 30  of bled crabs may die prematurely  prompting pressure on the biomedical industry  largely out of concern for shorebird populations that rely on crab eggs  Advocates including the Audubon Society became increasingly vocal when the rufa red knot  which eats crab eggs on stopovers at Delaware Bay  was listed as threatened under the U S  Endangered Species Act in 2014   That was the tipping point   said Jay Bolden  an Eli Lilly biologist whose hobby as a birdwatcher spurred him to champion his company s switch to rFC that he believes will ensure supply chain reliability    If it got really serious  and they said nobody could touch the horseshoe crabs because they have to rebuild the red knot population  that was going to be significant   Lilly has shifted three of eight global drug manufacturing sites to rFC testing and is more than halfway to its goal of 90 percent rFC testing by 2020  he added    Until the global pharmacopoeias revise the test method to recognize

Stocks could crash  in a no deal situation  per Matt Maley  the chief market strategist at Miller Tabak  He cautioned that stocks might retreat 4 6  even if the Dec 15 round of tariffs was deferred if not canceled 
Whatever be the case  alike many analysts  we too believe that one sector would stand tall amid trade tensions and that is  Healthcare 
In a no deal scenario  a safe haven rally will take place  Some sectors are normally steady irrespective of any geopolitical development  Healthcare is one  Below we highlight what can drive the healthcare sector in 2020 irrespective of a trade deal  read

There are about 13 industries in the broader medical sector  of which 11 carry a solid Zacks Rank  Below we highlight three key industries 
Medical   Drugs belongs to a favorable Zacks industry  placed at the top 24  of 250  industries   Shares of the same industry can be availed at 17 37x forward P E ratio against the S P 500 ETF IVV s P E multiple of 19 16x  Though a low P E is not indicative of the stock s future performance  cheaper valuation is always good news  The projected EPS growth rate of the sector is 7 80  compared with 5 52  of IVV  The debt to equity ratio of the industry  0 03x  is much lower than 0 72x of IVV 
Large Cap Pharmaceuticals also hails from a favorable Zacks industry  positioned at the top 24    The industry has a forward P E ratio of 14 85x  which reflects its undervalued status  The debt to equity ratio of the industry  0 68x  is slightly lower than that of the S P 500

Other announcements include NextGen Healthcare s  NXGN  purchase of Medfusion  a patient experience platform leader Notably  the latest acquisition announcement was Merck taking over ArQule  strengthening its leadership role in Oncology  read    
Healthy Pace of FDA Drug Approvals
Apart from favorable financials and valuations as well as mergers and acquisitions  the sector is brimming with upbeat drug data  There were 46 drug approvals in 2017 followed by 59 and 41 drug nods to date in 2019  Though the momentum of approval wins slackened a bit  it can still be considered healthy 
Investors should also note that the healthcare sector offers a slightly defensive approach and thus could be a good bet if there is any uncertainty regarding the trade deal  In light of this  we choose five healthcare ETFs that could lead the market in 2020

171104,392620,LLY,Lilly  LLY  Up 6 4  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Eli Lilly  LLY   Shares have added about 6 4  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Lilly due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Lilly Q3 Earnings Top Estimates  Sales LagLilly reported third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share of  1 48  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 43  Earnings rose 10  year over year as higher operating costs were partially offset by slightly higher revenues  a lower tax rate and reduction in shares outstanding due to buybacks Revenues in DetailRevenues of  5 48 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 56 billion  Sales however grew 3  year over year  backed by robust volume growth of new products and international operations  which compensated for lower realized prices  lower sales of older products like Cialis due to the loss of U S  exclusivity and the impact of Lartruvo s product withdrawal Foreign exchange hurt sales growth by 1  in the quarter  Also  lower realized prices had a negative impact of 4  on sales due to rebates and legislated increases in Medicare Part D cost sharing in the United States and price cuts in some international markets  Volumes rose 8   Excluding Cialis  loss of exclusivity and the impact of Lartruvo  volume grew nearly 16  New pharma products  products launched since 2014  generated  2 4 billion in revenues and drove 12  of sales growth in the third quarter and represented nearly 44  total revenues  up from 43  in the previous quarter  The loss of exclusivity hurt volumes by 700 basis points primarily attributed to Cialis U S  revenues were flat at  3 06 billion while ex U S  revenues rose 8  to  2 42 billion Among the established products  Forteo sales declined 5  to  370 7 million  Alimta declined 2  to  508 2 million  Humalog sales dropped 2  to  648 9 million  Humulin sales were flat at  321 8 million Cialis sales declined 61  to  184 3 million as U S  sales were hurt by entry of generic products  Outside U S  sales were also hurt by generic competition  lower realized prices and currency headwinds Among the new products  Trulicity generated revenues of  1 01 billion  up 24  year over year driven by higher demand in the United States and higher volumes in ex U S  markets  which offset the impact of lower realized prices in the United States  The prices were lower mainly in the United States due to higher contracted rebates  changes in segment mix and increased coverage gap funding requirements in Medicare Part D  On the call  the company said that the negative factors  which hurt sales of Trulicity in the third quarter  should moderate substantially going forward as impacts from the donut hole are expected to diminish in the fourth quarter Cyramza revenues were  240 0 million  up 21  year over year driven by higher sales in both the United States and international markets Jardiance sales surged 44  to  240 7 million  driven by increased demand trends within the SGLT2 class of diabetes medicines in the United States and increased volume outside the United States  which offset the negative impact of currency Basaglar recorded revenues of  263 2 million  up 31  year over year  In the United States  sales rose 29   benefiting from higher demand and the impact of higher realized prices  Outside U S  sales growth of 39  was driven by increased volume Taltz brought in sales of  340 0 million  up 29  year over year as U S  sales gained from higher demand  which offset the impact of lower realized prices due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts  Ex U S  sales were driven by increased volume from launches in new countries Olumiant generated sales of  114 6 million in the quarter compared with  102 4 million in the previous quarter backed by increased demand in international markets  In the United States  Olumiant recorded sales of  12 1 million  higher than  10 7 million in the previous quarter  Revenues outside the United States were  102 5 million compared with  91 7 million in the previous quarter Verzenio generated sales of  157 2 million in the quarter  up from  133 9 million in the previous quarter  This was because of increased demand and higher realized prices in the United States wherein Verzenio recorded sales of  124 8 million Emgality generated revenues of  47 7 million in the quarter compared with  34 3 million in the previous quarter  In the United States  Emgality sales were  45 8 million compared with  33 8 million in the previous quarter  Emgality was launched in some international markets in the first quarter  which brought sales of  1 9 million in the third quarter Emgality captured 46  share of the market for new prescriptions in the United States  an increase of 5 points from the end of second quarter Regarding newly launched Baqsimi  Lilly said commercial uptake in the United States was strong as Baqsimi has already captured 33  share of new to brand prescriptions Gross Margin   Operating IncomeAdjusted gross margin of 79 6  in the quarter was down 60 basis points as favorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and greater manufacturing efficiencies were offset by the impact of unfavorable product mix due to lower volumes of Cialis and negative impact of price on revenues Operating income rose 3  year over year to  1 57 billion  Operating margin was 28 6  in the quarter Total operating expenses  including research and development and marketing  selling and administrative expenses  rose 2  in the quarter as the company invested in recently launched products and late stage assets  Marketing  selling and administrative expenses declined 3  due to cost control and lower litigation charges  partially offset by increased investment behind recent launches  R D expense rose 8  in the quarter due to higher development expenses for late stage assets Adjusted effective tax rate was 11 7   lower than 14 9  in the year ago quarter  driven primarily by the impact of U S  tax reform 2019 Earnings Guidance RaisedLilly raised its expectations for full year earnings while keeping its revenue guidance intact   The earnings forecast was increased from a range of  5 67 to  5 77 per share to  5 75 to  5 85 taking into account a lower tax rate The range indicates growth of 4  to 6  from the year ago levels  The guidance excludes discontinued operations results for Elanco  following disposition of Lilly s remaining ownership in the company The revenue guidance was maintained in the range of  22 0 billion    22 5 billion  which indicates 5  growth  at mid point  over 2018 level on a constant currency basis Gross margin is still expected to be approximately 80   Adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 12 versus 13 expected previously  Adjusted operating margin is expected to be 28  in 2019 Marketing  selling and administrative expense are expected to be in the range of  5 9 billion to  6 1 billion  Research and development expense is still expected to be in the range of  5 5 billion to  5 7 billion Going forward  Lilly s revenue growth is expected to be driven by higher demand for its newer drugs including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio  Basaglar  Emgality as well as newly launched glucagon nasal powder  Baqsimi  However  generic competition for several drugs including Cialis  rising pricing pressure in the United States due to rebates and legislated increases in Medicare Part D cost sharing  price cuts in some international markets  currency headwinds and the impact of the failed Lartruvo study are expected to put pressure on the top line  In the United States  prices are expected to decline in a mid single digit range Maintains 2020 GoalsIn 2020  Lilly expects sales to grow 6   It expects new products to help it achieve the sales growth target as the headwind from Cialis LOE and Lartruvo will abate in 2020  It expects to achieve adjusted operating margin of 31  in 2020

mixed as it beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales  Double digit growth in the Specialty Care was offset by persistent sluggishness in Diabetes and Cardiovascular franchises and a

has risen 6 1  in the said time frame while the  has gone up 3 1    Nonetheless  Sanofi s Specialty Care segment is on a strong footing particularly with regular label expansion of Dupixent  The drug could prove to be an important growth driver  Sanofi s R D pipeline is strong and it has delivered important results with several positive data read outs and the achievement of regulatory milestones

171167,392683,LLY,AstraZeneca plots China robot offensive to counter price cuts,news,"By Adam Jourdan and Ben Hirschler WUXI  China LONDON  Reuters    With smart cancer diagnostics  one stop shop diabetes kits and AI systems to improve ambulance pick ups for patients with chest pain  AstraZeneca  L AZN  aims to move from simply supplying drugs to become a broad healthcare provider in China  Tech tie ups with the likes of  Alibaba   N BABA  and Tencent  HK 0700  will not directly lift the British group s drug sales  since they are not specific for any one company s products and in many cases will be low cost or free  But it will expand the overall market and represents a soft power play that dovetails neatly with Beijing s support for Internet based healthcare systems to alleviate a lack of doctors  overcrowding and poor grassroots healthcare    Down the line we benefit  our products benefit  because we have better relationships with doctors and hospital managers and also because we diagnose more patients and they get better treated   Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told Reuters   Surrounded by the latest gizmos at the World Internet of Things Exposition in Wuxi  eastern China  Soriot says he wants to use the power of artificial intelligence  robots and apps to help transform diagnosis and disease management   AstraZeneca has been on a tear in China  more than doubling its sales since 2012  helped by regulatory reforms to fast track new drugs  and today generates 18 percent of revenue in the country    a far higher proportion than rivals  Yet Soriot is anxious to do more to keep doctors and government officials on side in the world s second biggest drugs market  as soaring demand strains the state insurance system and squeezes medicine prices  The company s underlying conviction is that it has the right medicines across chronic diseases like cancer  diabetes and respiratory disorders to win in China  Soriot believes that can keep AstraZeneca growing in a pivotal market in the coming years  even though annual growth is likely to slow to nearer 15 percent from the breakneck 33 percent seen in the first half of 2018  The company has moved quickly to exploit China s new found willingness to use innovative Western drugs  Last year it won a record fast approval for lung cancer pill Tagrisso  which is designed for patients with a genetic mutation that is particularly common in China  It hopes to get a green light before the end of 2018    well before U S  approval    for a new anemia drug called roxadustat being developed with FibroGen  O FGEN   China first approvals for drugs like roxadustat and Elunate  a colorectal cancer treatment from Eli Lilly  N LLY  and Hutchison China MediTech  L HCM   mark a reversal of the historical pattern of Chinese patients getting new drugs years after their launch in the West  There is  however  a trade off  Multinationals that relied in the past on selling older drugs at premium prices in China are seeing prices slashed  AstraZeneca took a 50 percent haircut last year on the price of Iressa  its predecessor to Tagrisso   The government wants to give access to better medicines to more people   said Soriot  who admitted that pressure on prices had come sooner than he expected   To some extent the economy is growing so there is more money to do that  but there is not enough money     They

this growing demand  It has around 7 500 sales staff in China and is looking to push into smaller cities    boosting volume and helping offset lower prices  It aims to get more drugs onto a list of medicines covered by basic insurance schemes    the national drug reimbursement list    and onto fast track approvals  Soriot said  The list was most recently updated last year after an eight year

171201,392717,LLY,This Is Why Eli Lilly  LLY  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Eli Lilly in Focus
Eli Lilly  LLY  is headquartered in Indianapolis  and is in the Medical sector  The stock has seen a price change of  6 76  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 64 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 39   In comparison  the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield is 2 75   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 91  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 58 is up 14 7  from last year  Eli Lilly has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5 54   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Lilly s current payout ratio is 46   meaning it paid out 46  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
LLY is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 72 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 3 14  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  LLY is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-10-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-eli-lilly-lly-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200473539,200473539
171202,392718,LLY,Eli Lilly  LLY  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Eli Lilly  LLY  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 44 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 6  
Revenues are expected to be  5 58 billion  down 7 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 03  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lilly 
For Lilly  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 61  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lilly will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lilly would post earnings of  1 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 50  delivering a surprise of  2 74  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lilly doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eli-lilly-lly-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200474005,200474005

171233,392749,LLY,Why Lilly  LLY  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Eli Lilly  LLY   This company  which is in the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This drugmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1 75  
For the most recent quarter  Lilly was expected to post earnings of  1 46 per share  but it reported  1 50 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 74   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 32 per share  while it actually produced  1 33 per share  a surprise of 0 76  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Lilly  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Lilly currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 22   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on October 23  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-lilly-lly-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200470371,200470371

171296,392812,LLY,Lilly s RET Inhibitor Shrinks Tumors In Lung Cancer Study,opinion,"Eli Lilly and Company s   NYSE LLY   oral RET inhibitor selpercatinib  LOXO 292  demonstrated a 68  objective response rate  ORR  or shrinkage in tumor size in heavily pretreated patients with RET fusion positive non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  
This data was presented from a phase I II registrational study   LIBRETTO 001   at the World Conference on Lung Cancer  WCLC  2019  held in Spain 
This registration dataset consisted of the first 105 patients who had previously received chemotherapy  The median duration of response  DOR  was 20 3 months and median progression free survival  PFS  was 18 4 months in the selpercatinib arm as of the cutoff date of Jun 17  2019  Moreover  in the subset of patients with brain metastases  treatment with selpercatinib demonstrated a central nervous system  CNS  ORR of 91  
Additionally  in the LIBRETTO 001 program  selpercatinib was well tolerated with only nine of the 531 patients enrolled in the safety analysis discontinuing the therapy due to treatment related adverse events 
The company also presented data from 34 treatment na ve RET fusion positive NSCLC patients treated with selpercatinib  In this analysis  selpercatinib achieved an ORR of 85   However  duration of response  DOR  and progression free survival  PFS  in the given patient population were not reached 
Lilly s shares were up more than 2  in pre market trading in response to the positive data  However  the stock has lost 1 4  so far this year  wider than the  decrease of 0 5  

 
Lilly plans to submit a new drug application  NDA  for selpercatinib by this year end  If approved  selpercatinib will become the first genomically guided precision medicine for RET fusion positive NSCLC patients 
Notably  selpercatinib was added to Lilly s portfolio with the February 2019 acquisition of Loxo Oncology  which broadened its scope into precision medicines  The positive data presented now validates the buyout of Loxo Oncology 
Noatbly  precision medicine is an emerging approach to cancer treatment  which tailors a regime depending on the patient s genetic  environmental and lifestyle factors  Many industry players are adopting this approach to bring new cancer treatments 
One such company is Blueprint Medicines Corp    NASDAQ BPMC    which is developing transformational precision medicines to address patients with genomically defined cancers and rare diseases  The company is developing pralsetinib for treating patients with receptor tyrosine RET fusion NSCLC and plans to submit an NDA for pralsetinib pertaining to the NSCLC indication in the first quarter of 2020

171319,392835,LLY,J J  JNJ  Loses Landmark Opioid Case  What s Next For Pharmaceuticals ,opinion,"An Oklahoma judge ruled on Monday that large cap pharmaceutical company Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   would have to pay  572 million to the state  J J is accused of helping fuel the opioid epidemic that killed more than 400 000 people from 1999 2017  The verdict was much better than what many investors and analysts had been anticipating  falling on the low end of the  500 million and  5 billion estimated range  Let s take a closer look at how the trial went for J J and how pharma investors can navigate the litigated market 
Oklahoma Trial 
District Judge Thad Balkman  ruled that J J s marketing of their opioid products was misleading and in turn compromised the health and safety of thousands of Oklahomans  He noted that the defendants  caused an opioid crisis that s evidenced by increased rates of addictions and overdose deaths   The ruling concludes that J J and their pharmaceutical subsidiary  Janssen  downplayed the risks of addiction to their opioid products  marketing the risks as low as 2 6  or less 
The  572 million awarded to the state covers one year of the states plan to combat the opioid crisis despite the state s plea that it would take up to 20 years to successfully carry out the campaign  J J is planning to appeal the verdict  they believe that the decision is flawed because the state failed to present evidence that J J s actions caused a public nuisance 
J J expressed their innocence in court stating that the marketing of their opioid products was appropriate and responsible  The company provided testimonies from doctors and current and former employees who agreed that their marketing practices were appropriate 
The verdict was significantly less than the penalties sought by the state  sending JNJ up about 2  after the verdict announcement  Teva Pharmaceutical   NYSE TEVA   and Purdue Pharma both reached a settlement with the state of Oklahoma before the trial began 
Looking Ahead
While the verdict makes owning J J stock a little easier  Oklahoma is only one plaintiff in a plethora of cases pending before a federal judge in Ohio  The consolidated lawsuit includes 22 defendants who were opioid manufacturers and distributers  including J J 
Recession fears have already plagued the stock market this month and pending lawsuits is not what pharmaceutical companies need  If investors do wish to stay in the sector  dividend paying pharmaceutical companies would be their best bet

171321,392837,LLY,5 Cancer Fighting Stocks To Add To Your Portfolio,opinion,Cancer has become a major health scare in the 21st century  with nearly every individual knowing someone or the other who has been affected  This life threatening disease has attracted many big companies to invest in and develop solutions Majority of the drug makers in the world are spending millions on developing treatment for oncology patients  with focus on the prevention  diagnosis and treatment  With still a diverse area left to explore and companies trying desperately to  lead the market  with its unique cancer drug composition  investors can select stocks to gain attractive returns Cancer   100 and Still CountingCancer in layman s term is a disease that is caused by the uncontrolled division of cells in the body  Doctors and researchers across the world have so far found more than 100 diseases  which can be collectively called cancer  The vast cancer fighting industry has been broken down into several categories pre  in and post cancer treatment Companies that focus on prevention of cancer produce cessation products  for example smoking cessation products to reduce the risk of developing lung cancer  Others focus on diagnostics that involve analyzing and identification through tissue biopsies to determine the presence of cancerous cells  The treatment of cancer remains the primary focus  whether it is invasive and non invasive surgeries or chemotherapies  Some cancer patients need personalized medicines caused by mutation in DNA from the cancer cells  Developing a generic medicine for cancer has a lot of grey area to cover and decades of research work still waits Why Invest in Cancer Fighting Stocks In 2018  IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science reported around  150 billion was spent on medicines to treat cancer and this would rise to  250 billion in 2023  The investment in cancer fighting stocks attracts investors with the potential to generate higher returns over the long term and beat the market So far this year  the biotech sector has seen a boom boosted by new drug discovery  approval of patents and most importantly  mega mergers  The S P Biotechnology Select Industry Index is up by 12  on a year to date basis and is still growing The biotech space took a flight in January 2019 with the announcement of the merger of Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   and Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG    two leading oncological drug makers  Bristol Myers Squibb has offered to acquire Celgene for  74 billion 5 Stocks to Buy NowWith the growing rate of

171327,392843,LLY,Drugmakers see a pricing blueprint in an  850 000 gene therapy,news,"By Caroline Humer SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Global drugmakers are looking to a tiny biotech s  850 000 therapy for a rare type of blindness as a model for getting paid for highly expensive   and effective   new medicines   Spark Therapeutics Inc   O ONCE  plans to launch its recently approved Luxturna treatment for an inherited genetic mutation that causes blindness in March  The drug is to be administered only once  by injection  and Spark plans to charge  425 000 per eye  an unprecedented price  But what is grabbing the attention of other drugmakers is not just what might be called an eye popping price to treat a condition that Spark estimates affects 1 000 to 2 000 people in the United States  but the ways Spark is looking to help payers ranging from the federal government to private insurers absorb the drug s high cost  including spreading out payments over several years   We re laying the groundwork for the future of our pipeline and the future of one time curative gene therapy treatments   Spark s chief executive officer  Jeffrey Marrazzo  said in an interview at the JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Healthcare Conference in San Francisco this week   The high cost of prescription drugs has become an increasingly critical and contentious issue  The independent Institute for Clinical and Economic Review  ICER  issued a report on Friday saying the proposed Luxturna price was far too high in most cases  Healthcare spending accounts for 18 percent of the U S  economy and has been rising faster than the rate of inflation as drugs and medical services costs increase  An influx of very expensive drugs that offer a one time cure   such as a hepatitis C treatment from  Gilead Sciences Inc   O GILD    has already stretched state and federal budgets   The U S  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS   which provides coverage for 125 million elderly  poor and disabled Americans  spends hundreds of billions of dollars annually on medicines  CMS is trying to tackle the overall high drug costs  It has asked for input from private health insurers and drugmakers on payment models that are expected to influence how medical breakthroughs for millions more patients are covered   Spark itself is working with CMS on a legal structure to allow government and private sector health plans to pay for Luxturna  which restores some vision for most patients with the inherited mutation  over several years  rather than in a single payment  without hurting its profits   Spark has also offered refunds if the treatment stops working and ways for payers to buy the drug outside of hospitals  which can significantly mark up the price of a medicine administered in their facilities  In interviews with Reuters  executives from large drugmakers including Eli Lilly   Co  N LLY   GlaxoSmithKline Plc  L GSK   Roche Holding AG  S ROG   Merck   Co Inc  N MRK  and Bristol Myers Squibb Co  N BMY  said they would pay close attention to the outcome of Spark s payment discussions  They are also following two revolutionary gene based therapies for blood cancers from  Novartis  AG  S NOVN  and Gilead Sciences  Novartis  Kymriah  with a list price of  475 000  is covered by CMS based on outcomes achieved for pediatric and young adult leukemia patients by the end of the first month of treatment  Spark is also looking at guaranteeing its product  It is working on a plan with pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co  O ESRX  on a long term payment schedule for privately insured patients   Spark plans to sell Luxturna through specialty pharmacies  including one owned by Express Scripts  so that large employers and health plans can avoid hospital markups that could reach hundreds of thousands of dollars  Express Scripts is working with Spark on provisions to refund money to insurers if the drug does not work as promised   Spark is willing to guarantee its product over a period of time and potentially extend that payment over a period of time  it needs someone to be a chassis   Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said  POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS Large drugmakers already offer refunds on some drugs  including treatments for diabetes or high cholesterol  if they do not provide a benefit  But it is tougher to create a long term payment model for a very expensive drug administered only once  The U S  system is built to cover the whole cost immediately  and CMS needs to determine how smaller payments could be made without triggering bigger than intended discounts   CMS does not negotiate prices or purchase drugs  but it sets ground rules for the managed care companies and state Medicaid agencies that do  CMS chief Seema Verma told Reuters last year that she was looking at new payment models for high priced breakthrough treatments   Another road block under discussion  Patients often change insurance  or move between private and government sponsored health coverage depending on their age or employment status  Under a deferred payment plan  the government could be billed for patients who they no longer cover    The innovation is there  but the financing vehicles need to catch up   said Jack Bailey  GlaxoSmithKline s U S  pharmaceuticals head    Paul Biondi  head of business development at Bristol Myers  said the drugmaker is closely following the payment outcome for gene therapies   I m glad other people are plowing the ground   he said  The next U S  approved gene therapy may come from Bluebird Bio  O BLUE   The small biotech company expects to submit this year a potentially one time treatment for the inherited blood disorder beta thalassemia  which can cause severe anemia  Bluebird also aims to seek approval for a gene based cancer therapy in 2019   We ve been thinking about pricing for years   Jeffrey Walsh  Bluebird s chief financial and strategy officer  said   Now we can bring in the regulators   The company is talking to the U S  government  as well as governments in the UK  France  Germany and Italy  about pricing over a period of time and how to prove a drug is working

171344,392860,LLY,Immunotherapy Stocks With Multiple Catalysts Ahead,opinion,"As our understanding of the human body and the ailments that attack it continues to improve  so to do our medical approaches toward conditions of all levels of severity  While this medical renaissance  so to speak  has led to options that we never thought imaginable  there are still indications that are met with few or no options  
A relatively new approach to addressing some of these conditions is sweeping the medical community as early results show incredible promise  This approach is known as immunotherapy  
In immunotherapy   and pharmaceutical companies aren t working to develop treatment options that attack a specific type of cell  Instead  they are looking to enhance them  The idea is that by enhancing the body s innate immune system  the patient s own line of defense will have the ability to break down and destroy cells and pathogens known to cause adverse medical conditions  
Immunotherapies are being developed to target severe  rare  and debilitating diseases with few options available to patients  Targeting these types of indications not only gives patients that suffer from them hope  but presents tremendous market opportunities in spaces with little to no competition  
As a result  when we see catalystic events out of immunotherapy companies  we tend to see incredible movement in the values of their shares  With that said  here are five immunotherapy companies that have multiple catalysts to look forward to 
Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY   A Classic Not Afraid To Change With The Times 
Founded in the 1800s  Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  is no stranger to the development of blockbuster medications  However  the traditional approach taken by the company may lead many of you to wonder why it is on a list of immunotherapy stocks with catalysts to watch for ahead  The answer is simple  the company fits the bill  
Sure  Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  may be best known for its leading treatments like Trulicity and Basaglar in the diabetes space  but the company is also breaking into immunotherapy  and doing so with a splash  In fact  according to Eli Lilly s  Lilly Oncology  website  the company currently has 10 active clinical trials in various phases  assessing immunotherapies as potential options for patients facing multiple cancer types  
The most promising clinical candidate in Ely Lilly s immunotherapy pipeline to date is known as Pegilodecakin  The treatment has already shown incredible promise in the potential treatment of pancreatic cancer  As a result  the company is in the midst of assessing the treatment for the pancreatic cancer indication in a Phase 3 trial  
Should the Phase 3 clinical trial prove to yield positive results  Ely Lilly will likely quickly advance the asset into regulatory submission and could push the treatment to market relatively soon  Pegilodecakin is also in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer  and in early development for an undisclosed indication  
With several immunotherapy treatment candidates in early stage development  and one option nearing regulatory submission  there are several catalysts ahead  This  combined with the strength that more than a decade in the industry provides  makes Ely Lilly a stock that s well worth paying attention to  
Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   A Comeback Waiting To Happen
Over the past year  Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  has seen some weakness in the market  As AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  competes with the company s hepatitis C virus franchise  ultimately taking market share  many have been counting on declining sales in some of the company s key drug products  
Nonetheless  I believe that the declines in sales have been priced in at the moment  Moreover  a bounceback is likely in the making  
Gilead Sciences  innovation in immunotherapy led to its position as a pioneer in the treatment of HIV  In fact  with six blockbuster HIV drugs on the market  Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  is a clear leader in the space  
Importantly  in February of 2018   the company received FDA approval for Biktarby  yet another immunotherapy designed to target HIV  Nonetheless  this treatment is expected to become the best selling HIV drug of all time due to strong efficacy and minimal adverse events  As such  sales reports surrounding Biktarby will likely prove to be catalystic events  causing strong movement in the value of the stock  
It s also worth mentioning that the Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  pipeline is a strong one  In fact  the company currently has 5 treatment candidates under Phase 3 development and more than 15 in Phase 2 clinical studies  Considering the multiple ongoing clinical trials and anticipated sales reports surrounding Biktarby  Gilead Sciences likely has multiple catalysts ahead  
INmune Bio  INMB   An Undervalued Play With Multiple Ongoing Clinical Trials
INmune Bio is a relatively small company by market cap  Nonetheless  the stock comes with explosive potential  That s because not only does INmune Bio have multiple ongoing clinical development programs  but it is targeting high value indications with little by way of competition  
In my view  the most interesting candidate at INmune Bio is known as XPro1595  The treatment is being studied as a potential option for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer s disease  
XPro1595 is believed to work by suppressing microglia  Microglia is present in high levels in Alzheimer s patients  In fact  it s thought that this is a key factor in the neuroinflammation believed to be a causative factor in Alzheimer s disease  The idea is that by targeting and reducing Microglia  we will see a reduction in Alzheimer s disease related symptoms among the treated patients  
I find this treatment to be compelling because  if it is approved  it will be the only treatment on the market that addresses Alzheimer s disease in this way  Moreover  it will become one of very few options available  giving INmune Bio a leg up in a market that is expected to grow to be worth more than  12 billion annually by the year 2026  
At the moment  XPro1595 is progressing through Phase 1 clinical studies  Moreover  it s one of three candidates under development at INmune Bio  In fact  the company is currently developing INKmune and INB103 as potential options in oncology indications  yet another market with incredible potential  
All in all  with multiple ongoing clinical trials and preclinical development programs  INmune Bio is likely to generate several catalysts ahead  Considering its relatively small market cap  combined with tremendous market potential  this is a stock worth paying close attention to  
Bluebird Bio  BLUE   Breaking Into Commercial Stages With A Potential Blockbuster
Bluebird Bio is a company that is just starting to enter the commercialization phase  In June 2018  the company won European approval for Zynteglo  a gene therapy that s indicated to treat a rare blood disease  The indication  known as transfusion dependent beta thalassemia  or TDT  offers up a blockbuster opportunity  but that s not why the company is on this list  
The truth of the matter is that gene therapy and immunotherapy are two completely different things  Nonetheless  the company is actively involved in the development of immunotherapy options  
In fact  Bluebird is working in collaboration with Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  on very promising CAR T treatment options  In fact  by the end of the year 2019  the two are expected to release clinical data from a Phase 2 study of ide cel  also known as bb2121  The treatment is currently being assessed as a potential option for multiple myeloma  yet another high value indication  
It s also worth mentioning that bb2121 is not the only CAR T treatment that the company has under development  It is also working on a similar treatment option known as bb21217 as a potential option for the treatment of multiple myeloma  The company expects to report data from this study by the end of 2019 as well  
All in all  Bluebird is working on four immunotherapy assets  one of which has achieved European regulatory approval  and all of which have the potential to become blockbuster treatment options  Considering the recent approval  sales reports surrounding Zynteglo  and clinical data likely coming from the company s other assets  we re likely to see several catalysts ahead  
ZioPharm Oncology  ZIOP   Yet Another Immunotherapy Play With Compelling Potential
Finally  we have ZioPharm Oncology  The company is focused on two primary assets within its pipeline  The first  immunotherapeutic asset  known as Ad RTS hIL 12  is believed to change the tumor microenvironment  turning immunologically cold tumors into hot ones  
Cold tumors are cancers that  for multiple reasons  contain few infiltrating T cells  As a result  these cancers are not recognized by the body s innate immune system  thereby they do not elicit a response from the body s innate immune system  
Nonetheless  it is believed that Ad RTS hIL 12 has the potential to change the tumor microenvironment  turning cold tumors into hot ones that are targeted by the immune system  Should this method of action prove effective  the treatment would not only be a strong monotherapy  but would come with tremendous combination potential  especially in combination with immune blockade inhibitor treatments  
Currently  ZioPharm is in the midst of 3 Phase 1 clinical trials and 1 Phase 2 clinical trial assessing the treatment as a potential option in various oncology indications  
Ziopharm is also working on an asset that it has dubbed  Sleeping Beauty   The treatment is currently at the center of one Phase 1 clinical trial and multiple preclinical development programs  Moreover  the company has partnered with big names like the MD Anderson Cancer Center and National Cancer Institute for the development of its Sleeping Beauty asset  
All in all  with several clinical development programs under way and promising early results out of Ad RTS hIL 12  Ziopharm Oncology likely has multiple positive catalysts ahead  So  keep your eyes peeled for opportunity here

Pipeline coming to fruition
Elunate is now being commercialised in China  third line CRC  by partner Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY   Lilly   a major inflection point for HCM and validation of its R D philosophy  While the early sales trajectory is notable  H119 in market of sales of  11 4m   the most interesting opportunity lies in inclusion on China s NRDL  as this would translate into automatic inclusion in all state funded hospitals  more eligible patients  and automatic reimbursement  albeit it at a lower price   Next for potential launch in China is surufatinib  launch for treatment of NET expected early 2021   In addition  a interim analysis of the pivotal China Phase III study  SANET p  in pancreatic NET is due in H120  which  if positive  could further widen its market potential in this area of unmet need 
Financials  Funded to key inflection points
HCM has reduced its FY19 R D expense guidance to  130 170m  from  160 200m   reflecting the depreciation of Chinese yuan versus the US dollar  China R D  and the phasing of global surufatinib and fruquintinib Phase IIb III trials  HCM reported available cash resources of  383 6m  which  combined with the net profit generation from the CP division  means it is well funded to key value inflection points  NDA submissions for savolitinib  surufatinib and fruquintinib in 2019 21

We value HCM at  5 7bn   6 99 share  vs  5 6bn previously  We make no changes to our product forecasts  but have trimmed R D costs for 2019  phasing costs into 2020  to reflect FY19 guidance  rolled forward our model  and updated for FX and net cash of  237 3m at 30 June 2019 
Business description
Hutchison China MediTech is an innovative China based biopharmaceutical company targeting the global market for novel  highly selective oral oncology and immunology drugs  Its established commercial platform business continues to expand its outreach 
Global aspirations
HCM s recent share price underperformance provides an opportunity to revisit the investment case  We believe the long term investment case is solid  with multiple near term catalysts  regulatory filing and potential approval for surufatinib and savolitinib  as HCM successfully launches numerous assets to market   2020 21 and beyond  in China and internationally  Its broad mid  to late stage innovation platform  IP  will translate into diverse global revenue streams with a multitude of other compounds coming to the fore from HCM s established and proven innovative R D platform  Existing partnering deals for savolitinib and fruquintinib support the investment case as milestones and royalties on sales continue to bolster the P L  HCM has global strategic aspirations  and it is only a matter of when rather than if its aspirations are met  in our view  HCM continues to invest in expanding its global innovation organisation  it now has  440 scientific personnel based in China and the US  Shanghai  Suzhou and New Jersey  




CK Hutchison Holdings  CKH  completed a secondary offering of ADSs in July 2019  which has reduced its holding to 51 15   from 60 2  previously   We see this as a significant positive for HCM as it increases the free float  potentially leading to better liquidity  We note that this had no effect on shares in issue and does not dilute any current shareholders  An eventual listing on SEHK will be determined by a number of factors including  but not limited to  management decisions and market conditions  In our view  a capital raise on existing markets  AIM Nasdaq  is still likely in the next 24 months  However  cash resources as last reported  30 June 2019  of  383 6m are more than sufficient to fund HCM to key inflection points  NDA submissions for savolitinib  surufatinib and fruquintinib in 2019 21   HCM could explore non dilutive finance options such as divesting non core commercial platform  CP  assets  Exhibit 1 highlights the plethora of clinical and regulatory catalysts ahead  For more details  see our outlook note  An emerging global biopharma 
Elunate early sales encouraging  NRDL inclusion is key
The launch of Elunate  fruquintinib capsules  for metastatic colorectal cancer  third line and above  by partner Lilly was a defining moment for HCM  as it was the first of its IP assets to launch in China  and the first China discovered and developed new drug for oncology to have full approval and reach the market  HCM reported H119 royalties of  1 7m and  3 0m of sales of Elunate manufactured by HCM for Lilly  The reported  1 7m royalties translates into  11 4m Elunate end user sales in H119  as reported by Lilly 
At the interim results  HCM presented data on the sales evolution of oncology drugs by its international and domestic peers  A key inflection in sales growth is inclusion on China s National Reimbursement Drug List  NRDL   which will define the opportunity for full scale reimbursement nationally  albeit on lower pricing  discount to be agreed by Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  and China s central government   A fourfold ramp in the second full year from launch would require us to revisit our overall peak sales expectations  Inclusion on the NRDL is expected in Q419  Elunate has been added to two regional reimbursement lists in China during the last six months  Zhuhai and Shanghai   which highlights that Elunate s utility in third line CRC has been recognised at a local level 
Elunate s next China development focus is on Phase III gastric cancer  FRUTIGA   for which approval could occur in 2021 22  Life cycle management and extending the labelled use to other solid tumour types will expand Elunate s commercial opportunity further  The global development programme is underway in colorectal cancer  with Phase Ib enrolling patients in the US  HCM has started planning the global Phase II III US EU registration trial  starting in 2020  in third fourth line mCRC in patients who are resistant or intolerant to Bayer s Stivarga  It has filed the FALUCA data for publication  potentially at ESMO 2019 or WCLC 2019  the data should shed light on the failure of fruquintinib monotherapy to meet the overall survival  OS  endpoint in third line non small cell lung carcinoma  NSCLC   having demonstrated statistically significant improvement in all secondary efficacy endpoints 
Surufatinib next in line for China launch
Surufatinib  previously known as sulfatinib  could be the first of HCM s non partnered assets to reach the China market in early 2021  NDA submission expected in late 2019   The strategy for surufatinib was recently validated as positive interim data were announced in the SANET ep Phase III trial testing surufatinib in non pancreatic NET China patients  This was based on the trial meeting its primary endpoint of progression free survival  PFS  at the interim analysis and the trial was unblinded a year ahead of schedule 
NETs are cancers that arise out of cells of the endocrine and nervous systems  predominately the digestive and respiratory tracts  While the current prevalence of NET in the US is  141 000 patients  incidence of  19 000 new cases per year  source    current treatment modalities are limited to subsets of NET with no broadly effective drugs across the NET spectrum  HCM believes that actual incidence of NET in China could be higher than the reported incidence of 67 600  and prevalence could be even greater once an effective broad spectrum treatment becomes available  Expanding the treatment paradigm could improve diagnosis rates and increase eligible patient numbers  Surufatinib could improve on the profiles of existing NET treatments  including somatostatin based treatments and kinase inhibitor therapies  such as Afinitor and Sutent   Broad spectrum use will yield commercial success if it can be used for treating the broad base of NET patients  An interim analysis for the pivotal China Phase III study in pancreatic NET SANET p  is due at H120  which  if positive  could further widen its market potential in this area of large unmet need 
A US Phase Ib II trial in pancreatic NET and biliary tract cancer has completed enrolment of NET patients  An end of Phase II meeting with the FDA is planned for Q419  to discuss the Phase III US EU registration study which HCM expects to start in Q120  HCM retains full worldwide rights to surufatinib 
Savolitinib could coat tail Tagrisso
An estimated 2 3  of newly diagnosed NSCLC patients have a specific mutation known as MET Exon 14 skipping  Exon 14 of the MET gene is not functioning or deleted   leading to c Met over expression  In China  HCM estimates this to be 10 000 patients  A registrational Phase II clinical trial is underway  enrolment complete  in patients who have progressed on prior chemotherapy  or are unable to tolerate additional rounds of chemotherapy  Although the patient size is relatively small  this indication could be savolitinib s first China NDA submission in 2020 and its first monotherapy indication in the region  In the longer term in China  we believe a savolitinib plus Tagrisso combination will expand use in other subsets of NSCLC 
In the field of lung cancer  AZN s Tagrisso is raising the bar as it moves into the first line setting in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC  reporting sales of  1 41bn in H119  Savolitinib s largest opportunity could be in combination with Tagrisso in EGFRm MET  NSCLC patients as MET mutations are one of the biggest drivers for Tagrisso resistance  Following the encouraging data seen from the TATTON study  in December 2018 AZN and HCM initiated the global registrational study SAVANNAH for Tagrisso refractory NSCLC patients  HCM s partnership with AZN remains crucial to the development of savolitinib and our forecast peak sales  Interim data are expected in mid 2020 and the strength of the data will determine whether a larger Phase III is required as part of the US regulatory submission package  although it could be sufficient for NDA filing 
Commercial platform profits reinvested in R D
HCM has multiple strings to its bow  Its China commercial platform division continues to deliver year on year revenue growth of 2   7  at CER  and net income growth of 3   9  at CER   Contributions from non consolidated JVs  primarily Shanghai Hutchison Pharma  SHPL  and Hutchison Baiyunshan  HBYS   are reported below the loss from operations line under US GAAP as equity in earnings of equity investee  net of tax  HCM receives the majority of profits generated from this division as dividends  which the company has reinvested in its innovation pipeline since inception  To date   423m has been reinvested in the business  HCM s non consolidated JV HBYS s vacant land  Plot 2  in Guangzhou remains for sale as part of the Guangzhou municipal government urban development scheme  HCM expects an auction value in excess of  100m  of which 40 50  would be paid to HBYS as compensation for return of the land use rights  We expect that half of this would make its way to HCM via special dividends and would likely be reinvested in the business  although this is not reflected in our forecasts given the uncertainty on timing  Exhibit 2 highlights HCM s objectives for existing assets spanning the breadth of its businesses in 2019 21

CK Hutchison Holdings  CKH  completed a secondary offering of ADSs in July 2019  which has reduced its holding to 51 15   from 60 2  previously   We see this as a significant positive for HCM as it increases the free float  potentially leading to better liquidity  We note that this had no effect on shares in issue and does not dilute any current shareholders  An eventual listing on SEHK will be determined by a number of factors including  but not limited to  management decisions and market conditions  In our view  a capital raise on existing markets  AIM Nasdaq  is still likely in the next 24 months  However  cash resources as last reported  30 June 2019  of  383 6m are more than sufficient to fund HCM to key inflection points  NDA submissions for savolitinib  surufatinib and fruquintinib in 2019 21   HCM could explore non dilutive finance options such as divesting non core commercial platform  CP  assets  Exhibit 1 highlights the plethora of clinical and regulatory catalysts ahead  For more details  see our outlook note  An emerging global biopharma 
Elunate early sales encouraging  NRDL inclusion is key
The launch of Elunate  fruquintinib capsules  for metastatic colorectal cancer  third line and above  by partner Lilly was a defining moment for HCM  as it was the first of its IP assets to launch in China  and the first China discovered and developed new drug for oncology to have full approval and reach the market  HCM reported H119 royalties of  1 7m and  3 0m of sales of Elunate manufactured by HCM for Lilly  The reported  1 7m royalties translates into  11 4m Elunate end user sales in H119  as reported by Lilly 
At the interim results  HCM presented data on the sales evolution of oncology drugs by its international and domestic peers  A key inflection in sales growth is inclusion on China s National Reimbursement Drug List  NRDL   which will define the opportunity for full scale reimbursement nationally  albeit on lower pricing  discount to be agreed by Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  and China s central government   A fourfold ramp in the second full year from launch would require us to revisit our overall peak sales expectations  Inclusion on the NRDL is expected in Q419  Elunate has been added to two regional reimbursement lists in China during the last six months  Zhuhai and Shanghai   which highlights that Elunate s utility in third line CRC has been recognized at a local level 
Elunate s next China development focus is on Phase III gastric cancer  FRUTIGA   for which approval could occur in 2021 22  Life cycle management and extending the labeled use to other solid tumor types will expand Elunate s commercial opportunity further  The global development program is underway in colorectal cancer  with Phase Ib enrolling patients in the US  HCM has started planning the global Phase II III US EU registration trial  starting in 2020  in third fourth line mCRC in patients who are resistant or intolerant to Bayer s Stivarga  It has filed the FALUCA data for publication  potentially at ESMO 2019 or WCLC 2019  the data should shed light on the failure of fruquintinib monotherapy to meet the overall survival  OS  endpoint in third line non small cell lung carcinoma  NSCLC   having demonstrated statistically significant improvement in all secondary efficacy endpoints 
Surufatinib next in line for China launch
Surufatinib  previously known as sulfatinib  could be the first of HCM s non partnered assets to reach the China market in early 2021  NDA submission expected in late 2019   The strategy for surufatinib was recently validated as positive interim data were announced in the SANET ep Phase III trial testing surufatinib in non pancreatic NET China patients  This was based on the trial meeting its primary endpoint of progression free survival  PFS  at the interim analysis and the trial was unblinded a year ahead of schedule 
NETs are cancers that arise out of cells of the endocrine and nervous systems  predominately the digestive and respiratory tracts  While the current prevalence of NET in the US is  141 000 patients  incidence of  19 000 new cases per year  source    current treatment modalities are limited to subsets of NET with no broadly effective drugs across the NET spectrum  HCM believes that actual incidence of NET in China could be higher than the reported incidence of 67 600  and prevalence could be even greater once an effective broad spectrum treatment becomes available  Expanding the treatment paradigm could improve diagnosis rates and increase eligible patient numbers  Surufatinib could improve on the profiles of existing NET treatments  including somatostatin based treatments and kinase inhibitor therapies  such as Afinitor and Sutent   Broad spectrum use will yield commercial success if it can be used for treating the broad base of NET patients  An interim analysis for the pivotal China Phase III study in pancreatic NET SANET p  is due at H120  which  if positive  could further widen its market potential in this area of large unmet need 
A US Phase Ib II trial in pancreatic NET and biliary tract cancer has completed enrolment of NET patients  An end of Phase II meeting with the FDA is planned for Q419  to discuss the Phase III US EU registration study which HCM expects to start in Q120  HCM retains full worldwide rights to surufatinib 
Savolitinib could coat tail Tagrisso
An estimated 2 3  of newly diagnosed NSCLC patients have a specific mutation known as MET Exon 14 skipping  Exon 14 of the MET gene is not functioning or deleted   leading to c Met over expression  In China  HCM estimates this to be 10 000 patients  A registrational Phase II clinical trial is underway  enrolment complete  in patients who have progressed on prior chemotherapy  or are unable to tolerate additional rounds of chemotherapy  Although the patient size is relatively small  this indication could be savolitinib s first China NDA submission in 2020 and its first monotherapy indication in the region  In the longer term in China  we believe a savolitinib plus Tagrisso combination will expand use in other subsets of NSCLC 
In the field of lung cancer  AZN s Tagrisso is raising the bar as it moves into the first line setting in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC  reporting sales of  1 41bn in H119  Savolitinib s largest opportunity could be in combination with Tagrisso in EGFRm MET  NSCLC patients as MET mutations are one of the biggest drivers for Tagrisso resistance  Following the encouraging data seen from the TATTON study  in December 2018 AZN and HCM initiated the global registrational study SAVANNAH for Tagrisso refractory NSCLC patients  HCM s partnership with AZN remains crucial to the development of savolitinib and our forecast peak sales  Interim data are expected in mid 2020 and the strength of the data will determine whether a larger Phase III is required as part of the US regulatory submission package  although it could be sufficient for NDA filing 
Commercial platform profits reinvested in R D
HCM has multiple strings to its bow  Its China commercial platform division continues to deliver year on year revenue growth of 2   7  at CER  and net income growth of 3   9  at CER   Contributions from non consolidated JVs  primarily Shanghai Hutchison Pharma  SHPL  and Hutchison Baiyunshan  HBYS   are reported below the loss from operations line under US GAAP as equity in earnings of equity investee  net of tax  HCM receives the majority of profits generated from this division as dividends  which the company has reinvested in its innovation pipeline since inception  To date   423m has been reinvested in the business  HCM s non consolidated JV HBYS s vacant land  Plot 2  in Guangzhou remains for sale as part of the Guangzhou municipal government urban development scheme  HCM expects an auction value in excess of  100m  of which 40 50  would be paid to HBYS as compensation for return of the land use rights  We expect that half of this would make its way to HCM via special dividends and would likely be reinvested in the business  although this is not reflected in our forecasts given the uncertainty on timing  Exhibit 2 highlights HCM s objectives for existing assets spanning the breadth of its businesses in 2019 21 




Valuation




We value HCM at  5 7bn   42 62 ADS  vs  5 6bn previously  We make no changes to our product forecasts  we have trimmed R D costs for 2019  phasing into 2020  to reflect FY19 guidance  rolled forward our model and updated for FX and net cash of  237m at 30 June 2019 
We use a risk adjusted net present value  NPV  method to discount future cash flows for the innovation platform  IP   valuation of  4 050m   We use earnings based multiples for HCM s commercial platform  CP   subs and JVs   and applying a 20 4x multiple on our forecast 2019 net attributable profit  equity in earnings of equity investees  net of tax  for the JVs of  39 2m yields a valuation of  800 4m  Exhibit 3

HCM reported consolidated group revenues of  102 2m in H119   0  as reported   5  CER  H118   102 2m  and group net loss of  45 4m  H118   32 7m   Depreciation of the Chinese yuan versus the US dollar has affected top line growth as reported in US dollars given the translation impact  as all revenues related to its China commercial platform  CP  business are generated in Chinese yuan

IP reported consolidated revenues of  12 0m in H119   5 5m of which was received from Lilly for Elunate manufacturing  service fee revenues and royalty income  compared to  13 6m in H118  In H119  IP reported a net loss of  63 8m  H118   52 9m   We forecast IP revenues of  28 7m in 2019 and  36 8m in 2020  largely driven by developmental royalties on sales on Elunate and service fees from partners 
Profit before tax and equity in earnings of equity investees at group level reported a loss of  68 3m in H119  vs a loss of  50 5m in H118   R D expenses increased significantly to  69 3m in H119   60 1m in H118   reflecting investment throughout the portfolio  expansion of the US and international clinical and regulatory operations  and establishment of the China oncology commercial infrastructure  S M expenses decreased to  7 5m in H119  vs  9 4m in H118  and administrative expenses increased to  18 8m  vs  14 5m in H118   For FY19  HCM has reduced its guidance for R D expenses to  130 170m from  160 200m and adjusted non GAAP group net cash flow excluding financing activities to  90 120m from  120 150m  The depreciation of the Chinese yuan has effectively reduced China R D expenses in US dollar terms  and start up costs for the global Phase II III registration studies for surufatinib and fruquintinib will move into 2020 
We now expect R D expenses to increase to  152 5m in 2019 and  190 0m in 2020  reported GAAP basis   reflecting the substantial need for investment in the burgeoning clinical trial programs across the IP division  including the increased investment in China and global trials plus the initiation of combination strategies across the portfolio

171350,392866,LLY,Bayer Sells Animal Health Division To Elanco  Now What ,opinion,"On Tuesday  Bayer   OTC BAYRY   announced the sale of its animal health division to American competitor Elanco   NYSE ELAN    for a net price of  7 6 billion  The deal is expected to close in mid 2020 after regulatory approval 
Bayer will receive  5 4 billion in cash and  2 3 billion of stake in Elanco  which it plans to sell off gradually  The combined company will have an estimated market share of about 13   making it the second largest animal health firm by revenue  behind only U S  rival Zoetis   NYSE ZTS    which was owned by Pfizer   NYSE PFE   until 2013 
Bayer s Restructuring
Bayer is in the middle of a lengthy corporate restructuring that was initiated as a result of its June 2018 acquisition of Monsanto  NYSE MON   The firm now is involved in a class action lawsuit due to claims that the active ingredient  glyphosate  in its popular weed killer Roundup causes cancer  There are currently about 18 000 claims in the suit 
Bayer has responded to mounting pressure from investors to prepare for what looks likely to be large fallout from these Roundup lawsuits  Therefore  it has decided to restructure and spin off certain divisions to raise the capital necessary  as it already holds  40 billion in debt  So far  Bayer has spun off its Coppertone and Dr  Scholl s divisions  raising over  1 billion  with its animal health division the latest to be let go  Bayer s goal is to focus on its core agricultural and pharmaceutical businesses going forward 
Bayer s Financial Outlook
Bayer currently holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but has a forward P E ratio much lower than the large cap pharma industry  Our Zacks Consensus Estimates show earnings for this quarter at  0 46 per share  no change over a year ago  Full year estimates call for  1 87 per share  for a 6 86  increase over last year  Next year  the company s earnings are projected to grow another 13 37  over 2019  showing predicted growth from consolidation plans 
Bayer stock is up 4 6  YTD  despite continued hits from the uncertainty surrounding the Roundup suit  BAYRY has also outperformed broader large cap pharma market s 1 5  loss  which consists of firms such as Abbvie   NYSE ABBV    Merck   NYSE MRK    and Lilly   NYSE LLY   

Elanco s Financial Outlook
Elanco stock is down 5 5  YTD  to lag the large cap pharma market  It is  however  above the broader medical care market industry s 7 2  drop  Elanco is also a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  at the moment  with earnings estimates having been revised marginally downward in the past 60 days 
Earnings estimates show a current quarter shrinkage of 10 34  to  0 26 per share  Next quarter is projected to come in at no change from last year  along with a full year estimate of  1 08 per share  an 8 47  decline  However  fiscal 2020 is predicted to see earnings recover 16 36  to  1 26 for the full year  Elanco has consistently reported earnings beats for the past 4 quarters  with an average surprise of 13 43   Therefore  earnings could come in higher 
Bottom Line
This deal is a necessity for Bayer  as the company needs cash and wants to focus on its two core areas  It will likely help Elanco significantly by giving new products and increasing market share and power  Interested investors need to look for how revenue and earnings for both companies change if and when the deal is cleared by authorities

171420,392936,LLY,Eli Lilly  LLY  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Eli Lilly in Focus
Eli Lilly  LLY  is headquartered in Indianapolis  and is in the Medical sector  The stock has seen a price change of  6 38  since the start of the year  The drugmaker is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 64 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 38   This compares to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield of 3 06  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 87  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 58 is up 14 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Eli Lilly has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 4 89   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Lilly s current payout ratio is 46   This means it paid out 46  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  LLY expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 66 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 1 98  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  LLY is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eli-lilly-lly-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200442038,200442038
171421,392937,LLY,Earnings Preview  Eli Lilly  LLY  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Eli Lilly  LLY  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 47 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2  
Revenues are expected to be  5 67 billion  down 10 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 34  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lilly 
For Lilly  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 51  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lilly will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lilly would post earnings of  1 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 33  delivering a surprise of  0 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lilly doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-eli-lilly-lly-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200443134,200443134

171423,392939,LLY,Eli Lilly  LLY  Stock Down 6 8  In 2019  Can Q2 Earnings Boost Performance ,opinion,"Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   stock is down 6 8  YTD  slightly worse than a large cap pharma average of  5 4   Let s dive into Eli Lilly and see what to expect from its results heading into its Q2 earnings report that will be released before the market opens on Tuesday  July 30 
Overview
Eli Lilly is the  in the world  with a market share in 2018 of 2 57   The company was founded in 1876 in Indianapolis by Eli Lilly and has been on the cutting edge of medicine ever since  with innovative products such as Jonas Salk s polio vaccine and the first publicly available human insulin 
Lilly currently focuses on three pharmaceutical areas  oncology  mental health  and diabetes  LLY s stock price has done very well in the past five years  with a huge jump in 2018  The price has backed off from those highs a bit  but we may see it push higher in the coming months 

 
Currently  Lilly sells many widely used drugs such as Cialis  Cymbalta  Methadone  and Prozac  The  for the company is now Trulicity  a once weekly injection treatment for Type II diabetics that helps the body increase insulin levels  Last year  it brought in over  3 billion in revenue 
In January  Lilly announced that it would acquire Loxo Oncology for about  8 billion in cash  The firm s Loxo investment added a lot of weight to Lilly s oncology efforts  Loxo  in partnership with Bayer   OTC BAYRY    currently has one cancer treatment approved by the FDA  but is awaiting approval in the EU  It also has three drugs in clinical development 
The FDA also just approved on Wednesday Lilly s hypoglycemia treatment drug  This drug  called Baqsimi  is a nasally administered glucagon powder approved for emergency treatment  Hypoglycemia is a condition in which blood sugar falls to very low levels  and happens most often in diabetics  Many diabetics keep injectable glucagon on hand in case of emergencies  so this product has a large addressable market as many people may see this as a better and safer alternative to an injection and switch 
Outlook
Lilly currently has   with another 54 in clinical trials  This is a strong pipeline that will hopefully drive Lilly s future growth  Some of these drugs are very promising revenue generators  such as a migraine drug currently under FDA review  Migraine drugs have a very large addressable market  since an estimated 12  of the U S  suffers from them 
Our Zacks Consensus Estimates predict a year over year Q2 revenue will decrease by 11 05  to  5 65 billion  Our estimates also call for fiscal year revenue to fall 9 96  to  22 11 billion  However  revenues have increased each year since 2014  so the company is not exactly in a tight spot  And estimates do show a projected 6 64  comeback in 2020 
Earnings estimates look much more promising for the firm in the coming quarters  This quarter  earnings are projected to shrink by just 2 67  over Q2 2018  While next quarter earnings are projected to grow by 4 32   representing a bounce back 
Full year fiscal 2019 earnings are estimated to expand by 1 98   Plus  next year s estimates project full year EPS to jump 16 14  higher than our current year estimate  Compared to the rest of the large cap pharmaceutical industry  these yearly growth numbers look quite impressive  The industry s earnings are estimated to shrink by 2 3  in 2019 and grow only half as much as Lilly in 2020 at 8 4 
Lilly stock is slightly overvalued compared to its peers at the moment  with a forward P E of 17 58x  against its peer group s 15 18x average  This means investors are willing to pay more for Lilly s future earnings than for other large cap pharma companies  
Bottom Line
Eli Lilly currently holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   as earnings estimates have remained roughly the same throughout the quarter  What little estimate change there was  happened downward  but Lilly does have a strong history of earnings beats so we could be surprised  Investors should watch this stock long term as LLY s strong pipeline comes into production in the next few years

171472,392988,LLY,Hutchison China MediTech  An Emerging Global Biopharma,opinion,"Hutchison China MediTech  NASDAQ HCM   has announced positive data that key late stage asset surufatinib met the primary endpoint of PFS in non pancreatic at the Phase III interim analysis  This translates to an earlier than expected China NDA submission  H219  and the potential launch of HCM s first un partnered asset  early 2021   In China  partner Lilly has launched Elunate  fruquintinib  capsules  Early sales look promising and its potential inclusion on the China NRDL later this year will be definitive to the China opportunity  However  failure of fruquintinib monotherapy in third line NSCLC and the changes in strategy to savolitinib in RCC has negatively affected our valuation  We forecast two further product launches on the horizon in 2021 2022  China launch of fruquintinib in gastric cancer and global launch of savolitinib in NSCLC   HHHL has completed a secondary offering of ADSs  which has reduced its holding to 51 15   from 60 2  previously   We see this as a significant positive for HCM as it increases the free float  potentially leading to better liquidity  We value HCM at  5 6bn   6 72 share  vs  6 5bn previously 


Business description
Hutchison China MediTech is an innovative China based biopharmaceutical company targeting the global market for novel  highly selective oral oncology and immunology drugs  Its established commercial platform business continues to expand its outreach 
Elunate launched  surufatinib to follow shortly
Elunate is now being commercialised in China  third line CRC  by partner Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY   Lilly   a major inflection point for HCM and validation of its R D philosophy  The positive interim readout of surufatinib  met primary endpoint of PFS  in the SANET ep Phase III trial in non pancreatic NET  trial was able to be stopped early  is of huge importance and these data will support a China NDA submission in late 2019  The years 2021 2022 are pivotal  partner AstraZeneca  AZN  could launch savolitinib in China for NSCLC  MET exon 14  and could become HCM s first asset to launch internationally  2022  in combination with Tagrisso for NSCLC 
Combination strategies to drive future growth
HCM has accelerated global  ex China  development of its wholly owned assets  fruquintinib  surufatinib  HMPL 523 and HMPL 689   Ongoing advances and thus changes in treatment paradigms in many oncology indications mean that combination therapy is the best approach to treat resistant cancers  With this in mind  HCM has announced four new PD 1 collaborations for fruquintinib and surufatinib  HCM AZN are focusing savolitinib s ex China strategy on its use in combination with Tagrisso in MET driven NSCLC  a blockbuster opportunity 
Valuation   5 6bn   6 72 share 
We value HCM at  5 6bn   6 72 share  vs  6 5bn previously  Our revised valuation takes into account the success of the SANET ep Phase III trial  failure of fruquintinib monotherapy in third line NSCLC and the changes in strategy to savolitinib in RCC  We have additionally adjusted our product timelines to include combination strategies across the portfolio and revisited our R D and S M costs 
Investment summary
Our long term investment cases rests on HCM s ability to develop and commercialise its assets in both China and the rest of the world  RoW   HCM is rapidly investing in international expansion with five drug candidates in or about to enter global clinical trial development  Fruquintinib  savolitinib and surufatinib lead the pack with the earlier stage spleen tyrosine kinase  Syk  and PI3K inhibitors coming to the fore  The launch of Elunate  fruquintinib  in China  November 2018  is a significant milestone for HCM  while the successful and early readout  June 2019  of surufatinib in the SANET EP Phase III trial in non pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours  NET  supports a China New Drug Application  NDA  submission in late 2019 and a potential launch early 2021  Key to HCM s global ambitions is SAVANNAH  the registrational study of savolitinib in combination with Tagrisso in non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  patients  Clinical trials design and execution will become ever more critical in the fast changing treatment landscape for oncology and we believe HCM remains committed to driving forward only assets and strategies that will have a material impact on returns  Combining its pipeline with approved and novel targets will be of great importance in the future of cancer treatment paradigms 
Recent market update  Increased free float
Hutchison Healthcare Holdings Limited  HHHL  has completed a secondary offering of ADSs  which has reduced its holding to 51 15   from 60 2  previously   We see this as a significant positive for HCM as it increases the free float  potentially leading to better liquidity  We note this has had no effect on shares in issue and does not dilute any current shareholders  In connection with this offering  HCM  its officers and directors  in addition to HHHL have agreed to a 90 day lock up on sale or transfer of ordinary shares  As a result of this the proposed Hong Kong  SEHK  listing is now on hold  However  HCM has reiterated its commitment to the listing and a concurrent global offering of ordinary shares and may still pursue both following the cessation of the lock up  An eventual listing on SEHK will be determined on a number of factors including  but not limited to  management decisions and market conditions  In our view  a capital raise on existing markets  AIM NASDAQ  still remains likely in the next 12 24 months  however  cash resources as last reported  at 31 March 2019  of  391 2m are more than sufficient to enable current operational and strategic goals 
Valuation   5 6bn   6 72 share 
We value HCM at  5 6bn   6 72 share  vs  6 5bn previously  We use a risk adjusted net present value  NPV  method to discount future cash flows for the innovation platform  IP   valuation of  4 004m   We have adjusted our valuation to reflect the success of the SANET ep Phase III trial  the failure of fruquintinib monotherapy in third line NSCLC  FALUCA   the cessation of enrolment in the SAVOIR  savolitinib monotherapy in the papillary renal cell carcinoma  PRCC   study and the discontinuation of the clear cell RCC monotherapy trial  component of CALYPSO trial  in favour of combination strategies  Additionally  launch dates for key assets have been pushed back  while time to peak sales in China has been brought in line with our assumptions for the RoW and peak sales assumptions have been updated  We use earnings based multiples for HCM s commercial platform  CP   subs and JVs   applying a 20 4x multiple on our forecast 2019 net attributable profit  equity in earnings of equity investees  net of tax  for the JVs of  39 2m yields a valuation of  800 4m  We note that the significant increase in our terminal value from  0 56 share to  1 22 share is driven by the adjustment of time horizons  notably the terminal value now captures a greater proportion of key product sales  Adding April 2019 net cash and netting out unallocated costs results in a value of  5 6bn 
Sensitivities  Changing treatment landscapes
HCM is subject to the usual biotech and drug development risks  including clinical development delays or failures  regulatory risks  competitor successes  partnering setbacks  and financing and commercial risks  We note that the rapidly advancing oncology treatment landscape remains a key sensitivity with potential for clinical trial programmes to become irrelevant while in progress  as evidenced by the cessation of the SAVIOR Phase III study  or for early efficacy readouts  eg surufatinib SANET ep  to bring forward regulatory submissions and potential launch dates  In China  regulatory and reimbursement changes mean drugs have a potential faster route to approval and reimbursement than historically  China is becoming an increasingly important market for innovation drugs given supportive government policies and population size 
Financials  Funded to inflection points
Full year 2018 results published in March 2019 highlighted robust growth in net profit attributable to the commercial platform division in China  coupled with clinical progress within the IP portfolio  HCM reported available cash resources of  391 2m  at 31 March 2019  at the group level  cash and cash equivalents including short term investments of  271 9m  and unutilised bank borrowing facilities of  119 3m   In May 2019 HCM entered into a credit agreement with HSBC for an additional  51 3m unsecured credit facility  This  combined with the net profit generation from the CP division  means that HCM is well funded to key value inflection points  NDA submissions for savolitinib  surufatinib and fruquintinib in 2019 2021   even taking into account the considerable rise in R D expenses seen in 2018  which we expect to continue to rise in the near term 
China  A stepping stone to global ambitions
With HCM s financial strength and its drive to retain the economic value of its assets  the next steps for the company are to commercialise its own assets in China then internationally  outside of current partnerships   The launch of Elunate  HCM s first internally developed asset  in China is a significant milestone for HCM and gives us confidence in the company s ability to execute on its R D philosophy of building first  or best in class molecules with lower toxicity profiles to enable combination based strategies for the treatment of cancers  We expect next approvals in China for surufatinib in NET  savolitinib in NSCLC  MET Exon 14 skipping  and fruquintinib in gastric cancer 
Outside China  HCM is now accelerating its operations as it transitions into a global biopharma  importantly  clinical and regulatory teams are now fully operational in the US and EU  HCM s first global approval  we forecast launch in 2022  in the US EU could be for a savolitinib combination with AZN s Tagrisso in epidermal growth factor receptor mutant  EGFRm   MET  NSCLC  Exhibit 1 highlights the numerous clinical milestones  both in China and globally  likely in 2019 

China  Launch of Elunate marks the start of things to come
Eli Lilly launched Elunate  third line colorectal cancer  CRC  patients  in November 2018  at 31 March 2019 HCM reported  0 978m in royalties  implying  6 5m Elunate end user sales in Q119  and the next development focus is on Phase III gastric cancer  FRUTIGA   for which approval could occur in 2021 22 
The recent successful efficacy read out of surufatinib in the SANET EP Phase III trial in non pancreatic NET was earlier than we had anticipated and positions surufatinib as the next internally developed R D asset to launch in China  HCM will hold a pre NDA meeting with the China National Medical Products Administration to discuss the preparation of the NDA  Additionally  in China  registration studies continue for savolitinib in MET Exon 14 deleted NSCLC patients  primary data early 2020  and in surufatinib in pancreatic NET  interim data end 2019   Elunate and surufatinib mark the start of multiple potential drug launches in the near term 
Global  Infrastructure in place as clinical programme expands
Our analysis concludes that much higher economic value resides in the strategy to develop and commercialise HCM s own assets  in particular with respect to fruquintinib  ex China   surufatinib  epitinib  HMPL 523 and HMPL 689  HCM is now accelerating its global operations as it transitions into a global biopharma with clinical and regulatory  C R  teams now fully operational in the US and EU  HCM plans to expand its US and EU C R operations  headquartered in New Jersey  US  to 30 employees by end 2019 and further expansions should be expected in subsequent years as HCM builds ex China commercial infrastructure ahead of the potential launch of non partnered assets surufatinib and fruquintinib  subject to positive clinical trial data and regulatory approval  
Global development is currently focused on savolitinib  with partner AZN  with multiple late stage trials in progress  including SAVANNAH  second line third line EGFRm  Tagrisso refractory  MET positive NSCLC with Tagrisso   CALYPSO  papillary and clear cell RCC with without PD L1 Imfinzi   and VIKTORY  MET positive gastric cancer   Additionally  a proof of concept trial has initiated in Canada testing savolitinib in MET positive prostate cancer 
HCM s first approval  we forecast launch in 2022  in the US and EU could be for a savolitinib plus Tagrisso combination in MET  NSCLC patients  AZN s Tagrisso has quickly become the standard of care in first line NSCLC patients who have an EGFR mutation  EGFRm   Following Tagrisso treatment  the most common mutation is c MET and AstraZeneca sees savolitinib as key to its strategy for MET driven NSCLC  In addition to savolitinib  HCM has already commenced the global development programme for fruquintinib  CRC US registration study in planning based on China FRESCO data and completed US Phase I II data  and surufatinib  US Phase I II pancreatic NET ongoing   Additionally  development programmes for HMPL 523  Syk inhibitor  and HMPL 689  PI3K  inhibitor  in indolent NHL are expected to start Phase I Ib trials shortly  We forecast global launches from 2022 
Worldwide  Combinations the focus across regions
HCM s R D efforts has successfully generated a portfolio of candidates that address existing  well validated targets with lower toxicity profiles as a result of target selectivity  Cleaner toxicity profiles should enable drug combination as often lack of tolerability leads to failure  Combinations of targeted therapies  TKI  tyrosine kinase inhibitor   monoclonal antibodies and immunotherapies  and chemotherapy is increasingly becoming the best approach to treating the complex and constantly mutating disease that is cancer 
In the last 12 months HCM has signed four co development collaborations for fruquintinib and surufatinib in combination with a variety of China developed PD 1  programmed cell death protein 1  monoclonal antibodies  Advances in the field of immune oncology in the last few years and the increasing understanding that different classes of cancer drugs  targeted therapies and checkpoint inhibitors  may act synergistically together means that the industry needs to keep up the pace and ensure that trial design and combinations address the most pertinent question of all  which drug regimen is best for a given cancer  HCM s partnership with AstraZeneca means that savolitinib s international focus is on combinations with a number of AZN s oncology drugs including Tagrisso and Imfinzi  The renegotiated deal with Lilly for fruquintinib has given HCM freedom to explore different line extensions and combinations through non restrictive collaborations 
Pipeline overview
HCM has multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical development  with eight assets in the clinical phase of development across over 30 trials globally  including five registration studies that are expected to read out over the next 24 months  Exhibit 2 provides an overview of the pipeline and segments the asset opportunity by China NDA opportunities  blue  and the international drug development programmes  red   Assets marketed through China CP are in green 

In the next sections we discuss in turn 
Elunate fruquintinib capsules  launched with partner Lilly in China for mCRC in November 2018  FRUTIGA is another trial investigating combination with Taxol in gastric cancer  top line data are expected in 2020  With FALUCA missing its primary endpoint in NSCLC  HCM will now explore PD 1 combinations that could drive earlier use 
Savolitinib  two pivotal studies in NSCLC are ongoing   in China for MET Exon 14 skipping and globally for a Tagrisso savolitinib combination  SAVANNAH   The PRCC strategy will focus on a combination with a PD L1 inhibitor following changes in renal cancer treatment paradigms 
Surufatinib  China NDA filing in 2019 for non pancreatic NET  This would be the first un partnered launch of a HCM asset 
HMPL 523 and HMPL 689  a Phase I Ib study in Australia and China has expanded its enrolment  blood cancers   IND applications for both HMPL 523 and HMPL 689 have been accepted for US and EU clinical development to start 
Elunate  Innovation into commercialisation
The launch of Elunate  fruquintinib capsules  for metastatic colorectal cancer  third line and above  by partner Lilly in November 2018 was a defining moment for HCM  as the first of its IP assets to launch in China and the first China discovered and developed new drug for oncology to have full approval and reach the market  At 31 March 2019 HCM reported  0 978m in royalties  implying  6 5m Elunate sales in Q119  Elunate has been priced at  3 300 per monthly cycle  RMB21 960  and a patient access programme has been implemented to widen availability in China  patients pay for the first  second and fifth cycle   HCM s target patient population for third line CRC is  55 000 60 000 patients  third line is 15  of incidence in China of 380 000 patients per year   Importantly  inclusion on China s National Reimbursement Drug List  NRDL  will define the opportunity given full scale reimbursement nationally  Inclusion on the list is conceivable in H219 as the Chinese government agencies are reviewing inclusions and exclusions on the list much more frequently than in the past 
Exhibit 3 highlights the status of Fruquintinib clinical trials in China and internationally in a broad range of oncology indications 

Positive renegotiated Eli Lilly deal terms
In December 2018  HCM and Eli Lilly renegotiated their 2013 agreement on Elunate  Under the terms of the new deal  Exhibit 4   HCM has acquired the rights to determine for which indications  LCI  life cycle indications  it will further develop Elunate  HCM will now pay the full development costs of any future clinical development in China and in return will benefit from higher economic value retention including both higher approval milestones and royalties  HCM additionally now has the option to co promote Elunate in China  On the occurrence of non fruquintinib related Eli Lilly commercial action  which we assume is related to a China launch of Cyramza   HCM will be able to promote Elunate in provinces that represent 30 40  of sales of Elunate  Lilly will pay HCM a service fee for all promotional activities in the HCM regions  While HCM already has a significant salesforce in China  the co promotion deal enables HCM to gain experience in commercialising its own in house developed products and expand its oncology salesforce prior to launching other pipeline assets  Importantly  HCM retains the full development and commercial rights to fruquintinib outside of China  assuming regulatory approvals are achieved  

The renegotiated deal terms on Elunate  fruquintinib  are a major positive in our view as these give HCM freedom of control on development of the asset into multiple oncology indications  not just as a monotherapy but also in combination therapies  the newly announced collaborations with Innovent Biologics and Genor Biopharma signal this  With the simplification of the LCI decision making process from two parties to one  we expect HCM will accelerate Elunate s commercial development in China beyond the indications currently in development  particularly in immunotherapy combinations 
FRUTIGA top line data in gastric cancer expected in 2020
The National Central Cancer Registry of China reports an incidence of 679 000 gastric cancer cases and 498 000 gastric cancer deaths in China in 2015  Most Chinese gastric cancer patients receive chemotherapy and few targeted therapies are approved  with limited salvage treatments in third line and above  HCM has initiated a pivotal Phase III  FRUTIGA  combination trial  second line  evaluating fruquintinib and established chemotherapy agent Taxol  paclitaxel  for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer patients  n 500  who have progressed after first line standard chemotherapy  5 fluorouracil and platinum doublets   If the FRUTIGA Taxol combination data are positive  this would enable fruquintinib use in earlier lines of gastric cancer  The full top line data are expected in 2020  The primary efficacy endpoint for FRUTIGA was overall survival  OS   secondary endpoints included PFS  progression free survival   ORR and DCR 
FALUCA primary OS endpoint not met in NSCLC
In November  HCM announced data from FALUCA  HCM s China based Phase III trial for fruquintinib monotherapy in third line NSCLC  after failure on two lines of systemic chemotherapy   The trial missed its primary endpoint of improving overall survival compared to placebo  The full dataset is yet to be presented  has been submitted for publication at a scientific conference   but statistically significant improvements were observed across all secondary endpoints  data not disclosed   PFS  duration of response  DoR  and objective response rate  Without a fully analysed dataset  and ascertaining the underlying cause for missing this endpoint  the future direction for fruquintinib monotherapy in third line NSCLC is unclear  What is becoming clear is that advances in cancer therapy  including targeted therapies and in the more nascent field of immunoncology  are changing treatment paradigms and this has implications for ongoing clinical trials that were designed and initiated a few years back  including FALUCA   Higher than expected survival rates seen in placebo arms could be a function of patients receiving other therapies at higher lines not accounted for when FALUCA was initially designed skewing the results  Thus we now assume that any future development in NSCLC is focused on combination therapies  particularly immunotherapy combinations  see below   While there are no planned combinations of fruquintinib with Tagrisso and or savolitinib in NSCLC  we believe any combinations could be synergistic and provide a point of differentiation for fruquintinib 
PD 1 combination the focus for future development
Targeted therapies and immunotherapies  monotherapy  have improved patient outcomes across many tumour types  combinations that work synergistically could enhance results further  HCM has developed Elunate to compete in the   16bn vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  VEGFR  market  which is dominated by Roche s Avastin  bevacizumab   a VEGF A inhibitor that is an intravenously administered monoclonal antibody  Roche reported 2018 sales of  6 9bn   Avastin inhibits VEGF A protein  whereas fruquintinib targets VEGF receptors 
In December 2018 the US FDA approved the triple combination of Tecentriq  Avastin and chemotherapy  carboplatin and paclitaxel  for first line NSCLC  non squamous   which is not driven by EGFR or ALK mutations  Exhibit 5   This serves as a strong validation that a combination of an anti angiogenic agent  Avastin  with an immune checkpoint inhibitor  Tecentriq  can have added benefit to patients with NSCLC  this highlights the potential for fruquintinib and surufatinib  which both inhibit VEGFR1 2 3  in combination with PD 1 antibodies  Similarly  data from three pivotal studies investigating analogous combination therapies for RCC  IMmotion151  JAVELIN renal 101 and KEYNOTE426  look promising  Exhibit 5  and support combination use 
In November  HCM entered into a range of collaborations to test surufatinib and fruquintinib with PD 1 inhibitors  For fruquintinib  HCM has a global partnership with Innovent Biologics and its PD 1 inhibitor sintilimab  IBI308  and a China focused collaboration with Genor BioPharma and its PD 1 inhibitor genolimzumab  GB226  

Fruquintinib  Elunate  peak sales assumptions
We have revisited our fruquintinib  Elunate  expectations  in the light of the differing pricing strategy to our expectations  and the disappointing FALUCA data in NSCLC monotherapy and move to combination strategy in this indication  We forecast global peak sales for fruquintinib of  2 6bn across all indications under investigation  CRC  NSCLC and gastric cancer   The magnitude of fruquintinib s success in part will depend on the global opportunity  we forecast RoW launches from 2023  In China Elunate gross pricing is  3 300 month  but as a result of HCM s Patient Access Programme  the median cost for Elunate over an average five months of use is  1 980 month  We now forecast peak sales of  199m in China vs  149m previously  We believe this pricing strategy and patient access programme could increase hospital formulary access and we assume that Elunate will be added to China s NRDL in the near term  inclusion will be a major growth driver 

Savolitinib  Striving for combination success
Since our last report was published  much clinical progress in the field of MET driven cancers has occurred  Foremost is changes in the renal cancer treatment paradigm  We had previously anticipated that savolitinib monotherapy for PRCC would be the first launched indication  potentially in late 2019 through a breakthrough approval in the US  However  recent paradigm shifts in the treatment of renal cell carcinomas are moving towards combinations with a PD 1 inhibitor  As such  AZN has suspended the Phase III monotherapy study in PRCC  SAVOIR  and future development will likely focus on a combination with AZN s PD L1 inhibitor Imfinzi  see below   this decision also took into account data from the MES  molecular epidemiology study  which showed smaller than expected applicable MET  status 
In the field of lung cancer  AZN s Tagrisso is raising the bar as it moves into the first line setting in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC  reporting sales of  1 9bn in 2018  its second full year on the market  The implication here is savolitinib s largest opportunity could be in combination with Tagrisso in EGFRm MET  NSCLC patients as MET mutations are the biggest driver in Tagrisso resistance  The savolitinib Tagrisso combination could rewrite the second line third line treatment paradigm and our forecast peak sales could be conservative  Following the encouraging data seen from the TATTON study  AZN and HCM in December 2018 initiated the global registrational study SAVANNAH for Tagrisso refractory NSCLC patients  HCM s partnership with AZN remains crucial to the development of savolitinib and our forecast peak sales 
Savolitinib is a highly selective inhibitor of the c Met signalling pathway and targets patients with resistant cancers whose tumour type tests positive for MET mutation  amplification or over expression  Savolitinib is hypothesised to have a greater beneficial impact on c Met driven tumours than approved multi kinase inhibitors  particularly in EGFR resistant patient subgroups  C Met  or hepatocyte growth factor receptor HGFR  is a signalling pathway  dysregulation of which mediates proliferation  apoptosis and migration in many tumour types including NSCLC  RCC and gastric cancer  This aberrant functioning can arise through c Met gene amplification  c Met over expression and gene mutations and the extent of each will differ by tumour type and patient  A key challenge in the area is identifying which biomarker and thus which diagnostic is most relevant to select the appropriate patients for MET targeted treatment as monotherapy and as combinations  Exhibit 7 highlights the incidence of MET dysregulation in NSCLC  the type  eg gene over expression  HGF expression  gene amplification  gene mutation  and the relevant biomarker for testing 

We highlight that the field is still in many ways in its infancy as companies such as HCM and Novartis  capmatinib  are at the forefront of developing c MET inhibitors  In late 2016 Phase III trial results of onartuzumab plus erlotinib in NSCLC did not prove clinical benefit over the comparator arm and it is thought that the clinical eligibility of patients based on MET over expression as measured by IHC may not be sufficiently sensitive and specific as a diagnostic tool to identify MET positivity 

Tagrisso combination could rewrite NSCLC paradigm
In the NSCLC setting savolitinib is being evaluated as a monotherapy in the MET Exon 14 skipping China Phase III registration study  in combination with Tagrisso  global TATTON and SAVANNAH studies   We highlight the largest opportunity is increasingly becoming the Tagrisso plus savolitinib combination in resistant driven EGFRm  MET   patient populations  In our view savolitinib s first approval for NSCLC ex China will likely be in combination with Tagrisso  AZN  for MET   T790M  patients who have progressed following Tagrisso  This specific subset of patients has an unmet medical need and  although we forecast a 2022 launch  BTD award could lead to earlier approval and launch 
AZN has presented analyses of FLAURA  first line Tagrisso  and AURA3  second line Tagrisso  data examining mutation status  via plasma sampling  of patients who become resistant to Tagrisso  While no known mechanism of resistance was identified in 60  of patients in AURA3  MET amplification was identified as an acquired resistance mechanism in 19  of patients and 15  of patients in FLAURA  Understanding the mechanism of acquired resistance following Tagrisso therapy is a key clinical question to inform the next treatment choice  AURA3 suggests that patients could benefit from addition of savolitinib to Tagrisso in MET  ve patients as second line therapy 
Critical for the future clinical trials planned for savolitinib is understanding the width and breath of MET alteration and how it can be best detected  tissue biopsy vs plasma testing   More recently it has been recognised that MET amplification in NSCLC is implicated in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in  20  of cases with EGFR inhibitor resistance  A 2018 analysis of plasma samples from Tagrisso s AURA3 trial identified MET implication to be the cause of Tagrisso resistance in 19  of these patients in second line and above  Data from the Tagrisso FLAURA trial suggest that MET amplification is implied in 15  of cases in first line  In both cases  plasma samples were measured and it is thought that the frequency of MET amplification could be higher in tissue samples  This provides further therapeutic rationale for combinations of MET inhibitors with EGFR inhibitors to resistant NSCLC and the question is how high up in the paradigm savolitinib can be used  in combination with Tagrisso   The SAVANNAH and ORCHARD  see below  studies that are underway should shed light on these questions 
TATTON data  Consistent with interim analysis
In 2014 AZN initiated the TATTON study  a multi arm Phase Ib II study to test the suitability of an array of therapies with Tagrisso  osimertinib  in EGFRm  NSCLC patients who have progressed following treatment with EGFR TKIs  Patients who had cancer progression driven by MET amplification  identified by either NGS  next generation sequencing   FISH  fluorescence in situ hybridization  or IHC  were placed on a combination regime of savolitinib and osimertinib  stratified into two cohorts based on whether they had progressive disease  PD  while on a first  or second generation EGFR TKI  ie Iressa Tarceva  or a third generation EGFR TKI  ie osimertinib   Data from these two dose expansion cohorts were presented at AACR2019  Cohort 1 and Cohort 2   and reaffirmed the tolerable safety profile and promising efficacy data from the preliminary analysis that was presented at WCLC2017 
Following the encouraging data seen from these arms of the TATTON study  AZN and HCM in December 2018 initiated the global registrational study SAVANNAH  a Phase II  single arm trial assessing the efficacy of Tagrisso in combination with savolitinib for patients with EGFRm  MET amplified  locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed  following treatment with Tagrisso  Primary data is expected in 2021  Likewise  AZN is planning to conduct ORCHARD  a Phase II  multiple arm trial looking to identify the drivers of resistance in NSCLC patients who have progressed following first line treatment with Tagrisso  this should act as a feeder to SAVANNAH and aid in patient recruitment 
NSCLC first China NDA submission in 2021
An estimated 2 3  of newly diagnosed NSCLC patients have a specific mutation known as MET Exon 14 skipping  Exon 14 of the MET gene is not functioning or deleted  leading to c MET over expression  In China  HCM estimates this to be 10 000 patients  A registrational Phase II clinical trial is underway in such patients who have progressed on prior chemotherapy  or who are unable to tolerate additional rounds of chemotherapy  Although the patient size is relatively small  this indication could be savolitinib s first NDA in China  Interim data were presented at AACR2019 and of the 31 evaluable patients  17 had a confirmed partial response  ORR of 54 8    12 patients had stable disease and two patients showed disease progression  DCR of 93 5    Savolitinib was generally well tolerated  with only 14 5   six of 41 patients  discontinuing treatment due to treatment emergent adverse events  mainly drug induced liver toxicity  three patients   six patients died on treatment  one of which was suspected to be treatment related  tumour lysis syndrome   Trial recruitment  in China  is expected to complete in 2019 and completion primary data can be expected in 2020  potentially with a Chinese NDA submission in 2021  We forecast launch in this indication in 2022  In the longer term in China  we believe a savolitinib plus Tagrisso combination will expand use in other subsets of NSCLC 
Data presented at ASCO2019 have highlighted the competitive landscape emerging  globally  for targeted treatments of MET Exon 14 skipping NSCLC patient populations  both Merck s c Met inhibitor tepotinib and Novartis s capmatinib demonstrated impressive ORR when used in treatment na ve patients  59  and 68  respectively  and as 2 third line treatments  45  and 41  respectively  
Kidney cancer  ICI combinations are game changing
The savolitinib registration strategy for kidney cancers  in particular PRCC  is being reassessed  taking into account findings from the molecular epidemiology study  MES  in PRCC patients and the realisation that treatment paradigms for RCC have shifted with the approval of PD  L 1 inhibitors and increasing use of VEGFR inhibitors  As a result AZN and HCM have stopped enrolment of patients into SAVOIR  a Phase III global registration study evaluating savolitinib monotherapy  vs sunitinib monotherapy  in MET driven PRCC patients  Successful commercialisation of savolitinib in kidney cancer  both ccRCC and PRCC  now hinges on CALYPSO  an investigator sponsored Phase II study combining savolitinib with AstraZeneca s PD L1 inhibitor Imfinzi  durvalumab  
In clear cell renal cell carcinoma  ccRCC  PD  L 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor are revolutionising the treatment landscape   the combination of MET inhibition with PD  L 1 inhibition could have utility in this space  as underlined by promising preliminary data from CALYPSO presently at ASCO GU 2019 
Savolitinib  Combined peak sales potential of  4 3bn
We forecast global peak sales for savolitinib of  4 3bn  PRCC  ccRCC  NSCLC and gastric cancer indications   lowered from our previous  5 9bn expectation  We have re evaluated our assumptions following changes in market dynamics  and changes in cancer treatment paradigms  In our view savolitinib s first RoW approval for NSCLC will likely be in combination with Tagrisso  AZN  for MET   T790M  patients  Additionally  we have reassessed our expected launch dates  and thus peak year of sales  and have pushed back launch years across indications  Exhibit 9   notably with the first indication launch  in second line third line NSCLC  now forecast for 2022 

Surufatinib  Positive Phase III data  China NDA H219
Surufatinib  previously known as sulfatinib  could be the first of HCM s non partnered assets to reach the China market in early 2021  The strategy for surufatinib was recently validated as positive interim data were announced in the SANET ep Phase III trial testing surufatinib in non pancreatic NET China patients  This was based on the trial meeting its primary endpoint of progression free survival  The data support a China NDA submission in late 2019 and we forecast a launch in 2021  However  a launch could occur in late 2020  It previously took 15 months from submission of the NDA to approval for fruquintinib  Elunate   However  three months was to gain GMP certification for HCM s Suzhou manufacturing plant  which should not be necessary for surufatinib  If the NDA is submitted within four months  October 2019  of the recent announcement of the top line data  as was the case for fruquintinib   then we believe a launch in late 2020 is possible  However  predicting review timelines for the China FDA is notoriously difficult and this timeline could slip  As such  we currently retain our 2021 launch date  Additionally  a pivotal China Phase III study  SANET p  in pancreatic NET is ongoing with data expected by the year end  If positive  this could further widen the market potential of surufatinib 
NETs are cancers that arise out of cells of the endocrine and nervous systems  predominately the digestive and respiratory tracts  While the current prevalence of NET in the US is  150 000 patients  incidence of  19 000 new cases per year   current treatment modalities are limited to subsets of NET with no broadly effective drugs across the NET spectrum  Data from Frost   Sullivan indicate the global NET market in 2018 was worth approximately  5 8bn and is expected to grow to  21 2bn by 2030  In particular  in China there is significant market opportunity with reported incidence of NET in 2018 of approximately 67 600 
Surufatinib is an oral angio immunokinase inhibitor that targets VEGF1  2 and 3  FGFR1 and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor  CSF 1R  kinases  CSF 1R is a cell surface protein that acts as the receptor for the cytokine CSF1  which controls macrophage  a type of white blood cell  function  Inhibition of CSF 1R limits the production of pro tumour macrophages  which  among other functions  is believed to aid in angiogenesis  tumour cell invasion and evasion of the immune system 
Following encouraging POC data from the Phase II study in biliary tract cancer  BTC   a pivotal open label Phase IIb III BTC trial  NCT03873532  in China has recently initiated  with the first patient dosed on 22 March  BTC represents a high unmet need due to limited treatment options and an increasing patient population  HCM is additionally developing the drug internationally  the global Phase Ib II study  NCT02549937  in pancreatic NET  second line in Sutent Afinitor refractory cancer  and BTC started enrolling US patients in July 2018  These trials will be managed by HCM s clinical and regulatory team that is now in place in New Jersey  US 
With the growth and widespread use of PD  L 1 inhibitor in the treatment of solid tumours  clinical trials combining these immune checkpoint inhibitors  ICIs  with CSF1 R  inhibitors have been initiated by several multinational pharmaceutical companies  HCM has recently initiated a Phase I dose escalation study  NCT03879057  in combination with Shanghai Junshi Biosciences  PD 1 inhibitor Tuoyi  toripalimab   which was recently approved in China for melanoma 

Peak sales potential of  1 0bn across all indications
We forecast global peak sales for surufatinib of  953m across the NET and BTC indications  We have removed thyroid cancer and adjusted sales forecasts  Our peak sales forecasts for surufatinib in NET   169m China   454m RoW  are conservative as at this point  We have updated our assumptions for NET in China and now assume an incidence of 68 000  vs 50 000 prevalence rate previously  and 19 months of treatment  vs 12 months previously  in China  This is based on new data from Frost   Sullivan and Phase II median PFS data  19 4 months   However  we note a patient access programme similar to Elunate could reduce the number of months HCM receive reimbursement for surufatinib  Additionally  following the positive SANET ep Phase III data we have upgraded our probability of success in NET to 90  from 75  previously  We forecast peak sales of  187m in BTC in China and  143m in RoW 
Global development of HMPL 523 and HMPL 689
Longevity for R D driven biopharmaceutical companies is dependent on having a pipeline of innovative assets that span both indications and development phases  HCM s strategy to date has focused on developing best in class kinase inhibitors that target solid cancers  the next wave of internally developed assets  HMPL 523  Syk inhibitor  and HMPL 689  PI3K  inhibitor   are kinase inhibitors  which have a clinical focus for various haematological  blood  cancers and autoimmune conditions  Concurrent Global and Chinese clinical programmes are ongoing  and recent IND approvals mean both assets have started US EU Phase I clinical development for indolent NHL 
B cell malignancies are a huge commercial opportunity
Haematological cancers arise in blood forming tissue  leukaemias and myelomas  or in the cells of the immune system  lymphomas   such as B cells or T cells  Treatment options vary according to cancer type and genetic burden  HMPL 523 and HMPL 689 are being developed for a range of B cell malignancies  Exhibits 12 and 13   The commercial opportunity in treating haematological malignancies is substantial  Many novel treatments have reached blockbuster status in haematological cancer sales alone  for example  Revlimid   8 9bn   Rituxan   5 4bn  and Imbruvica   4 5bn  in 2018  The US National Cancer institute SEER data estimate that in 2018 there were c 170 000 new cases of blood cancers  33  of which were leukaemias   18  multiple myeloma  MM   5  of Hodgkin s lymphoma  HL  and 44  with non Hodgkin  NHL   which comprises over 30 types of aggressive  fast  and indolent  slow  B cell and T cell malignancies  Five year survival rates  2008 2014  range from 27 4  in AML to 71 4  in NHL as patients relapse or become refractory  r r  to current treatment options  Efficacy and safety data from the ongoing Phase I studies of both HMPL 523 and HMPL 689 will further define in which patient populations these assets could have utility  as well as give an early indication as to whether they could be used in combination with other treatments  safety data  
The B cell signalling pathway is critical in haematological cancers  Approved novel drugs that target this pathway include Imbruvica  Zydelig  Jafaki and Rituxan  Exhibit 11   Targeting aberrant B cells is not only a proven strategy for the treatment of B cell related malignancies  but also in autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis  MS  and rheumatoid arthritis  RA   highlighted by the commercial success of antibodies such as Rituxan  rituximab  and Ocrevus  ocrelizumab   HCM is evaluating HMPL 523 in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura  ITP   an immune mediated disease that results in low platelet levels 

Both HMPL 523 and HMPL 689 are small molecules designed to target kinases in the same B cell receptor signalling axis as the Bruton s tyrosine kinase  BTK  inhibitor Imbruvica and Zydelig  which  like HMPL 689  acts through inhibition of PI3K   Importantly  HCM retains the global development and commercialisation rights to both of these assets and both could present significant growth drivers in the medium and long term  We believe a key factor in success will be whether both assets can demonstrate good safety profiles as monotherapy as this will indicate potential combination regimes  which is where we believe treatment paradigms are shifting in treating B cell malignancies  Likewise  a well tolerated treatment will be essential for these to show any utility in autoimmune disorders  To date  HMPL 523 has been dosed in c 110 patients and c 118 healthy volunteers  HMPL 689 in c 30 patients and c 48 healthy volunteers and both have shown no off target toxicity 
HMPL 523  First in class opportunity for blood cancers
HMPL 523 targets Syk  an enzyme believed to be involved in diverse range of biological functions including in autoimmune disorders and haematological malignancies  In particular  Syk is involved in BCR signalling and is thought to promote the survival and maintenance of malignant cells  Syk sits just upstream of BTK and PI3K  and mediates their activation  therefore targeting it presents an alternative way of treating patients who are resistant or intolerant to Imbruvica or Zydelig  Exhibit 11   The clinical landscape for Syk inhibitors remains relatively competitive and in 2018 the US FDA approved the first Syk inhibitor  Rigel Pharmaceutical s fostamatinib  Tavalisse  for treating ITP  Entospletinib  developed by Gilead  NASDAQ GILD   is one of the most advanced clinical candidates for treating haematological malignancies 
HCM believes HMPL 523 is a potential best in class molecule and potentially first in class for haematological malignancies and we anticipate that launch in China in 2023 is feasible  Preliminary data presented at ASH2018 from the ongoing the Phase I Ib study in China showed some promising signs of efficacy

171493,393009,LLY,Kazia Therapeutics  Higher MTD  New Collaboration For GDC 0084,opinion,"Kazia Therapeutics  NASDAQ KZIA  has identified a higher maximum tolerated dose  MTD  from a Phase IIa study of its brain penetrant phosphoinositide 3 kinase  PI3K  inhibitor GDC 0084 in glioblastoma  GBM   which may lead to improved efficacy in the ongoing expansion cohort and planned Phase IIb study  A new collaboration with the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology  Alliance  means Kazia will soon have four clinical trials of GDC 0084 underway in primary or secondary brain cancers  It also expects further preliminary efficacy data from its Cantrixil Phase I study in ovarian cancer in H219  We adjust our valuation to between  64m and  103m 

Higher MTD for GDC 0084 in target population
Kazia s Phase I study showed that recently diagnosed GBM patients were able to tolerate a higher  and therefore potentially more efficacious  dose of its oral PI3K inhibitor GDC 0084 than Genentech had reported from its prior study in patients with late stage disease  A 20 patient expansion cohort is expected to report top line efficacy data in Q419 
GDC 0084 is targeting an unmet need in GBM
The GBM trials will test GDC 0084 in patients who have an unmethylated MGMT promotor  This subgroup   61  of GBM patients  obtains little benefit from standard temozolomide chemotherapy  Kazia may seek to position the planned Phase IIb study in GBM as a pivotal study designed to support filing for approval for this patient population who have no effective treatments  If this strategy is accepted  Kazia could be in a position to file for approval in this indication in 2023 
New collaboration targeting brain metastases
Kazia s collaboration with the Alliance will target brain metastases that have genetic alterations of the PI3K pathway  The Phase II study will target brain metastases from a wide range of solid tumor types  allowing Kazia to fully capitalize on the capacity of GDC 0084 to penetrate the brain  The trial is expected to be completed in 2021 
Cantrixil expansion cohort data in H219
Potential efficacy signals from the 12 patient expansion cohort of the Phase I study of Cantrixil in ovarian cancer are expected to read out in H219  We expect Kazia to seek a partner to support the further development of Cantrixil in this indication 
Valuation  Adjusted to  64 103m in two scenarios
We adjust our indicative valuation range to  64 103m or  10 27 16 50 ADR  vs  64 111m   10 31 17 82 ADR   due to revised timelines for post Phase III approval or single pivotal study approval scenarios for GDC 0084  Kazia had  4 1m cash at 31 December 2018 and will likely need to raise funds in H219  We estimate   11 15m will be needed to fully fund the GDC 0084 Phase IIb study 

Business description
Kazia Therapeutics is an ASX  and NASDAQ listed biotechnology company  It is developing the PI3K mTOR inhibitor GDC 0084 for brain cancer and Cantrixil for ovarian cancer  GDC 0084 was in licensed from Genentech in 2016 
Investment summary
Company description  Two novel classes of anti cancer drugs
Kazia Therapeutics is an Australian biotechnology company focused on oncology drug development  listed on both the ASX  KZA  and Nasdaq  KZIA   It is developing GDC 0084  a brain penetrant PI3K inhibitor licensed from Genentech  and a third generation benzopyran drug  Cantrixil  A Phase IIa trial of GDC 0084 in GBM identified a higher MTD than previously reported by Genentech  and is treating an expansion cohort at the higher dose  Kazia is supporting investigator initiated studies of GDC 0084 in breast cancer brain metastases and in the childhood brain cancer known as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma  DIPG   It is also supporting a study of GDC 0084 in brain metastases from a range of solid tumor types that have genetic alterations of the PI3K pathway  A Phase I trial of Cantrixil in ovarian cancer is expected to report preliminary efficacy data from an expansion cohort in H219  The company s product pipeline is summarized in Exhibit 1 

Valuation   64 103m   10 27 16 50 per ADR
We value Kazia between  64m and  103m  We now consider a scenario where approval is obtained in 2024 after a single study as our base case  with a valuation under this scenario of  103m  Our alternative valuation of  64m models a potential approval in 2026 after a confirmatory pivotal study  Our base case valuation is equal to  16 50 ADR  or  15 85 ADR after diluting for options and convertible notes  Our valuation is based on a risk adjusted NPV analysis  which includes net cash and our forecasts for GDC 0084 and Cantrixil  with probability of success of 10 25  to reflect the stage of development of each product 
Financials  Additional funds likely required in H2 CY19
Kazia had  4 1m cash at 31 December 2018 and also had a  2 2m R D tax rebate receivable  It subsequently raised  1 8m through the sale of its Noxopharm shares  We expect the available funds to be sufficient to support operations into H2 CY19  We estimate that Kazia will need additional funds of  11 15m to finance the GDC 0084 Phase IIb GBM study  While the preliminary efficacy data from the GDC 0084 Phase IIa study is expected to read out in Q419  depending on the timing  funds may need to be raised in H2 CY19 before the GDC 0084 trial data are available 
Sensitivities
The key sensitivities for Kazia will be funding risk and the success of its lead drugs in clinical trials  A key question will be whether GDC 0084 works sufficiently well as a single agent in GBM to justify filing for approval after a single pivotal study  or whether a confirmatory Phase III trial  possibly in combination with radiotherapy or temozolomide  will be required for approval  Our base case scenario models a potential approval in 2024 after a single pivotal study  If a confirmatory trial is required  approval could be delayed to 2026 or later  While Kazia has fully funded the ongoing Phase IIa study of GDC 0084 in GBM  it would require additional funds of   11 15m for a Phase IIb trial  which could result in significant dilution of existing shareholders 
Improved tolerability of GDC 0084 in first line GBM
Kazia reported in early May that its Phase IIa study of GDC 0084 in patients with recently diagnosed GBM had determined that the MTD in this patient population is substantially higher than the MTD previously reported by Genentech  60mg day vs 45mg day   Genentech s Phase I study was conducted in a sicker patient population with late stage disease 
The safety and tolerability profile reported for GDC 0084 was encouraging  The dose limiting toxicities in the Phase IIa study included mouth ulcers and elevated blood sugar  hyperglycemia   both of which are anticipated effects of the PI3K inhibitor class of drugs  Notably  Kazia did not observe any of the more serious side effects that are sometimes associated with this class of drugs  such as infections  liver toxicity or gastrointestinal problems 
A dose expansion cohort of 20 patients is being recruited to gather additional safety and efficacy data at the 60mg dose 
If good tolerability is confirmed in the expansion cohort  Kazia will use the 60mg dose in its planned randomized Phase IIb study  This is a positive outcome  in our view  as the higher dose is likely to be more efficacious  thus improving the prospects for a positive result from the study 
GDC 0084 was developed by Genentech to target brain cancer
Kazia in licensed GDC 0084 from Genentech in October 2016  The drug is an orally administered small molecule PI3K inhibitor that targets an important growth signaling pathway in cancer cells  The drug is also deliberately designed to be a moderately potent inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  kinase  to avoid the toxicity seen with drugs that are potent inhibitors of both targets  GDC 0084 was specifically developed to cross the blood brain barrier and target GBM  which is an aggressive brain cancer for which there are few effective therapies  Abnormal PI3K signaling is associated with over 80  of cases of GBM 1
Higher doses inhibited tumor growth in Genentech Phase I
Genentech conducted a Phase I trial of GDC 0084 in patients with advanced disease  which confirmed it readily crosses the blood brain barrier and led to dose dependent inhibition of tumor growth  Seven of the eight patients treated at 45mg day  the MTD identified by Genentech in patients with advanced disease  demonstrated levels of drug in the bloodstream that were associated with significant inhibition of tumor growth in preclinical models 
Exhibit 2 illustrates the tumor responses for the patients treated with GDC 0084 in Genentech s Phase I study  The bars pointing upward from the zero baseline  x axis  in the exhibit represent how much the tumor grew  while the downward pointing bars represent tumors that shrank in volume over the period of treatment with GDC 0084  The upper red dotted line marks the 25  increase in tumor size  sum of product diameters  that is the maximum cut off for stable disease according to the RANO2 response assessment criteria  while the lower red dotted line marks the 50  reduction in tumor volume that is the threshold for a partial response 
Although none of the patients reached the 50  reduction in tumor size that would qualify as a partial response  there was a clear dose response in terms of the impact on tumor growth  with much less tumor growth in patients treated at higher doses  For example  five of the six patients treated at the highest dose  65mg day  achieved a best response of  25  tumor growth  the upper limit for stable disease in the RANO criteria   compared to only three of the six subjects meeting this criterion in the 45mg day cohort  In this patient population  which has no effective treatments available  delaying disease progression by even a month or two would be a meaningful benefit 
The dose response shown in Exhibit 2 highlights the potential importance of the higher MTD identified for GDC 0084 in recently diagnosed patients in Kazia s Phase IIa study  It suggests that using the higher 60mg day dose of GDC 0084 in the upcoming Phase IIb may inhibit tumor growth to a greater degree  and therefore may increase the chances of improving progression free survival  PFS   thus meeting the primary endpoint of the study 

Top line data from expansion cohort expected Q419
Kazia is recruiting an expansion cohort of 20 patients who will be treated at 60mg day  This second part of the study is designed to provide additional safety data and confirmatory efficacy signals and is expected to report top line data in Q419  The subjects will undergo intensive monitoring to better understand the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of the drug  including the effect on major organs including the heart 
Kazia s Phase II studies are being conducted in newly diagnosed  first line  patients who have undergone surgery to remove the bulk of the tumor and a course of chemoradiotherapy to further reduce the tumor burden  Many patients will not have measurable tumors at the start of the study and so they will not be able to be assessed for tumor response  shrinkage  according to the RANO criteria  Therefore  we expect the key efficacy criteria to be PFS and overall survival  OS   FDG PET brain scans will also be assessed to see whether they can predict PFS or OS 
GBM  An aggressive brain cancer with few effective treatments
GBM is the most common and most aggressive primary brain cancer  Approximately 11 500 patients are diagnosed with GBM each year in the US  GBM tumors are characterized by invasive and diffuse growth  which makes complete surgical removal difficult  Standard treatment for GBM entails surgical resection of the tumor followed by radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy with temozolomide  TMZ   followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with the same drug to treat the residual infiltrative component of the tumor  Despite this aggressive treatment  the disease invariably returns  resulting in a five year survival rate of only 5  3
Randomised Phase IIb in GBM the next step for GDC 0084
The company s plan is for the Phase IIa study to be followed by a randomized Phase IIb study in 228 patients with recently diagnosed GBM  Exhibit 3   although this trial design could be modified after further discussions with regulators  The planned Phase IIb study will compare maintenance therapy with GDC 0084 vs standard of care TMZ in recently diagnosed GBM patients who have undergone standard therapy comprising surgery to remove the bulk of the tumor followed by a course of radiation therapy  XRT  combined with TMZ  After completing XRT  patients will be randomized to receive maintenance therapy with either GDC 0084 or TMZ to treat residual tumor cells and delay recurrence of the disease 
The study will target the 61  of GBM patients where tumor cells have an unmethylated MGMT promoter  which counteracts the cytotoxic effect of TMZ   as these patients receive only minimal benefit from treatment with TMZ and are in urgent need of more effective therapies  GDC 0084  which blocks the PI3K signaling pathway  is not affected by the methylation status of the MGMT promoter 


Revised accelerated approval scenario could see GDC 0084 launched in 2024
There are no effective therapies for GBM in patients whose tumor cells have an unmethylated MGMT promoter  Therefore  if the Phase IIb trial shows a meaningful improvement in PFS or OS in these patients  there is a good prospect that it could be eligible to seek approval based on the single pivotal Phase II study  rather than waiting for completion of a confirmatory Phase III trial before filing for approval  Therefore  we model timelines for the approval of GDC 0084 following a single pivotal Phase IIb study and for a scenario of approval following a confirmatory Phase III trial 
With top line data from the GDC 0084 expansion cohort expected in Q419  we have revised our trial timelines  We now model a pivotal Phase IIb study commencing in Q220 and reporting top line data in Q4 CY22  vs Q3 CY21  with a market launch in Q2 CY24  vs Q2 CY23   as shown in Exhibit 5 


In its presentation to the Biotech Showcase in January  the company referred to the upcoming randomized trial of GDC 0084 in GBM as a registration study  which indicates it may be designed to support an application for full regulatory approval in this indication  This has prompted us to adopt the single pivotal study scenario in our base case valuation model  our base case previously assumed that two efficacy studies would be conducted before filing for approval  
We now evaluate the two trial model as an alternative valuation scenario rather than the base case 
GDC 0084 joins NCI sponsored brain metastases study
Kazia announced in May that it has entered into a collaboration with the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology  a US based cancer research network that is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute  NCI   to study GDC 0084 in the treatment of brain metastases  cancer that has spread to the brain from a primary tumor elsewhere in the body  
The Alliance study is expected to recruit around 150 patients with brain metastases in an open label Phase II study  Patients with genetic alterations in the PI3K pathway will be treated with GDC 0084  and it is expected that around 50 patients will fall into this group  Patients with other genetic mutations will be allocated to receive either abemaciclib  Verzenio  Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY    a CDK inhibitor approved for certain forms of breast cancer  or entrectinib  Genentech  a Trk ALK inhibitor undergoing FDA priority review for solid tumors that are positive for NTRK or ROS1 gene fusions 
The study is expected to start recruiting patients in H219 and to take around two years to complete 
Brain metastases are quite common  according to estimates from the American Brain Tumor Association  there are around 200 000 new cases of brain metastases in the US each year 4 Treatment options for brain metastases are limited  as  unlike GDC 0084  many anti cancer drugs do not cross the blood brain barrier 
Kazia s announcement did not spell out whether there is any limitation on the type of primary tumor that will be included in the study  but we note that lung  breast  colorectal  melanoma and renal cancers account for the majority of people diagnosed with brain metastases 5
The Alliance study is in addition to the company s ongoing study in patients with breast cancer brain metastases  in collaboration with the Dana Farber Cancer Institute  One of the advantages of the new study is that it will generate data in patients with a range of different tumor types who have been treated with GDC 0084 
Kazia will support the study including by providing GDC 0084 drug as well as a financial grant  we model Kazia providing  0 4m of financial support  
We leave our modelling of the market potential of GDC 0084 in brain metastases unchanged  Our model is based on the treatment of brain metastases in patients with HER2 positve breast cancer as an illustrative indication  We may look to revise this assumption  depending on the outcome of the Alliance study 
There will soon be four GDC 0084 clinical trials underway
Once the Alliance study in brain metastases is underway  there will be four ongoing clinical trials of GDC 0084 in cancer patients  as shown in Exhibit 7  In addition to the GBM and Alliance studies described above  Kazia is collaborating in two other investigator led trials of GDC 0084 
The first of these is a Phase II trial in collaboration with the Dana Farber Cancer Institute to investigate GDC 0084 in combination with Herceptin in women with HER2 positive breast cancer who have developed brain metastases  Genentech showed that GDC 0084 improves survival in this indication in animal studies and the recent approval of Novartis s alpelisib  Piqray  previously known as BYL719  validates targeting PI3K in breast cancer 
The second collaboration is with St Jude Children s Research Hospital in a Phase I study of GDC 0084 in the aggressive childhood brain cancer DIPG  Although the number of patients with this disease is small  the lack of approved treatments for this aggressive cancer could open pathways to an accelerated approval or Breakthrough Designation  Approval could also earn a valuable FDA pediatric priority review voucher 

First PI3K inhibitor approval in solid tumors
The PI3K signaling pathway plays a crucial role in cellular proliferation  metabolism  survival and apoptosis  programmed cell death   PI3K signaling is initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases or G protein coupled receptors located at the cell surface  and by some oncogenic proteins such as Ras 
The PI3K pathway is frequently overactivated in cancer  This can occur through a variety of mechanisms including mutation and amplification of genes in the pathway  or by loss of function of the tumor suppressor PTEN  which is a negative regulator of PI3K signaling 
Of particular relevance to Kazia  the PI3Kalpha inhibitor alpelisib  Piqray  Novartis  was approved by the FDA on 24 May 2019 for treating patients with hormone receptor positive  HER2 negative breast cancer  whose tumors carried mutations in the PIK3CA gene  In the Phase III Solar 1 study  adding alpelisib to standard fulvestrant hormone therapy almost doubled PFS  11 0 months vs 5 7 months  hazard ratio 0 65  p 0 0013  in patients with PIK3CA mutations  This is the first example of a PI3K inhibitor being approved for treating solid tumors  vs blood cancers  
The first three PI3K inhibitors that were approved all target hematological cancers  cancers of the blood cells   Idelalisib  Zydelig  Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   was first approved by the FDA in 2014 and is approved to treat several types of leukemia and lymphoma  Idelalisib is a selective inhibitor of the delta isoform of PI3K  PI3K    A second PI3K inhibitor copanlisib  Aliqopa  Bayer  DE BAYGN    was approved for treating lymphoma in September 2017  whereas a third  duvelisib  Copiktra  Verastem  was approved for treating two types of leukemia and lymphoma in October 2018 
The approvals of these four drugs provide validation for PI3K as a target for anticancer drug development  However  none of those drugs was designed to cross the blood brain barrier  whereas GDC 0084 was specifically designed to do just that  To the best of our knowledge  Kazia is the only company that is developing a PI3K inhibitor in GBM 
Encouraging efficacy in Cantrixil dose escalation study
Kazia s second drug in clinical development  Cantrixil  is being developed to target ovarian cancer  and potentially other cancers that have spread to the abdominal cavity  Cantrixil is a third generation benzopyran drug that was the product of an in house discovery program  Cantrixil is delivered by infusion into the abdominal cavity  intraperitoneal administration   which increases the exposure of abdominal organs  including the ovaries  to the drug  The company initiated a dose escalation Phase I study of Cantrixil in December 2016  The study recruited women with ovarian  fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who had failed at least two prior lines of therapy  including standard platinum based therapy  eg cisplatin  carboplatin or oxaliplatin  
Kazia presented a poster summarising the safety and efficacy of data from the dose escalation cohorts of the Phase I study of intraperitoneal Cantrixil  TRX E 002 1  at the American Association for Cancer Research  AACR  conference held from 29 March to 3 April 2019 in Atlanta  Georgia  In total  11 subjects were treated with Cantrixil at doses ranging from 0 24mg kg to 20mg kg  Nine subjects received at least three doses  ie one full cycle  and were evaluated for efficacy 
The study identified the MTD as 5mg kg  The main side effects were gastrointestinal  with abdominal pain and fatigue the most common drug related observations  although generally not dose limiting  Treatment centres have strategies in place to manage side effects such as pain  nausea and vomiting  but they were not used in this study because the investigators did not want to mask any adverse events 
Cantrixil also showed encouraging signs of anti cancer efficacy  Five of the nine subjects  56   who had received at least three weekly doses  one cycle  of Cantrixil achieved stable disease when evaluated six weeks after treatment commenced  Exhibit 8  
The five subjects with stable disease at the end of the six week Cantrixil monotherapy treatment period went on to receive Cantrixil in combination with a range of chemotherapy agents  At the end of the 24 week study period  three of the five had developed progressive disease  one remained stable and one had gone on to experience a partial response  as detailed below 

Exhibit 9 shows the progressive tumor reduction in the patient  subject 03 002  who went on to experience a partial response when treated with Cantrixil in combination with paclitaxel after completing Cantrixil monotherapy treatment 
This subject experienced substantial tumor shrinkage during the six week period when she was treated with Cantrixil at 2 5mg kg as a monotherapy  At the completion of Cantrixil monotherapy the patient subsequently received six cycles  18 weeks  of treatment with 2 5mg kg Cantrixil combined with paclitaxel  The tumors continued to shrink and 12 weeks after entering the study the patient had achieved a partial response  The response was ongoing at the end of the 24 week follow up period when the patient exited the study  Exhibit 9 also shows that the tumor shrinkage was maintained at a further assessment two months after the end of the study 

Recruitment of Cantrixil expansion cohort well advanced
Kazia is recruiting a 12 patient expansion cohort that is being treated with Cantrixil monotherapy at the MTD of 5mg kg  As of March 2019  nine of the 12 patients had been recruited  Kazia expects to fully recruit the expansion cohort in Q219 and report initial efficacy data in H219 
The 56  of subjects with stable disease at the end of the 6 week monotherapy treatment period and the substantial reduction in tumor size seen in one patient receiving combination therapy are encouraging signs that Cantrixil may inhibit tumor growth  However  it is not yet clear whether the efficacy is sufficient for it to be a commercially successful product  The expansion cohort will provide additional data to help assess the safety and potential efficacy of Cantrixil 
Future options for Cantrixil  First  or second line combinations
Kazia s overall business strategy is to in license drug candidates then add value by conducting early  to mid stage clinical development  before out licensing or selling the program to a partner that would conduct late stage development 
Therefore  we expect the company to seek a partner for late stage development of Cantrixil  Depending on the level of interest from potential pharma partners and on Kazia s available financial resources  it could also seek a partner for the next stage of Cantrixil development  Another option would be for Kazia to conduct a small study if there is a particular question that potential pharma partners want to have addressed before they commit to a transaction 
Cantrixil has shown encouraging signs of efficacy as a single agent and good tolerability when used in combination with standard second line therapies  These two factors mean Cantrixil is likely to be well suited to use in combination therapy 
If the data from the expansion cohort are sufficiently encouraging and there is enough interest from potential partners  we suspect the likely next step would to be to test Cantrixil in combination with the investigator s choice of standard chemotherapy drugs in either a first  or second line setting 
High unmet need in ovarian cancer
Ovarian cancer accounts for 22 400 new cases and 14 100 deaths in the US each year  with a five year survival rate of 47   Worldwide  there are an estimated 239 000 new cases and 152 000 deaths annually according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer with the highest rates coming from developed countries  The majority of those diagnosed already have distant metastases  which is associated with a 28 9  five year survival rate  see Exhibit 10  

Patients who present with ovarian cancer are typically treated with surgery followed by a platinum based chemotherapy  such as paclitaxel and carboplatin   Unfortunately  around 70  of patients relapse in the first three years following therapy 6 although this is expected to improve  especially among the 10  of ovarian cancer patients with BRCA mutations  with the approval of the PARP inhibitor niraparib by the FDA as a maintenance therapy  PARP inhibitors are also used in those with BRCA mutations in later lines of therapy 
The situation is dire for patients who are platinum refractory or who become platinum resistant  a condition that eventually occurs to all surviving platinum sensitive patients following repeated platinum courses   The current standard of care for platinum resistant or refractory patients is either PEGylated lysosomal doxorubicin  PLD  FDA approved in 1999  or topotecan  FDA approved in 1996   both of which typically have shown a response rate of 10 15   PFS of approximately 3 5 months and OS of 12 months in large trials 7 This segment of the ovarian cancer population continues to be an unmet medical need and would likely be a key target for Cantrixil 
Sensitivities
The key sensitivity for Kazia will be the success of its two lead drugs in clinical trials  A crucial question regarding GDC 0084 will be whether it works sufficiently well as a single agent in adjuvant therapy to receive approval based on a single pivotal study  In this regard  it is encouraging to note that Avastin was granted accelerated approval in 2009 for treating recurrent GBM based on the response rates observed in 141 patients  If GDC 0084 needs to be used concurrently with radiotherapy or with TMZ in order to deliver sufficient efficacy in GBM then one or more additional efficacy trials may be required  delaying potential launch until 2026 vs 2024 under a single pivotal study approval scenario  There is also a significant risk that GDC 0084 may not provide sufficient benefit to justify approval either as a single agent or combination therapy 
Although Kazia is approaching the final stages of the Phase IIa study of GDC 0084 in GBM  we estimate it would require additional funds of   11 15m for the randomized Phase IIb trial  This could result in significant dilution of existing shareholders given the current market capitalization of   15m 
Our valuation includes revenues from the development of two drugs in four disease indications  as well as  risk adjusted  upfront and milestone payments for two licensing deals  While each of these targeted indications is supported by the current preclinical efficacy studies and evidence of a dose response in the GDC 0084 Phase I trial  the company may not ultimately pursue development of the drugs for all of these indications  In contrast  ongoing preclinical efficacy studies could identify additional disease indications that should be investigated in clinical trials  While we believe the drug development timelines used in our forecasts are achievable  at this early stage it is hard to accurately predict how long it will take to get the drugs to market 
Valuation
As explained on page 6  we have swapped the GDC 0084 development programs that we model for our base case and alternative valuation scenarios for Kazia  We have also adjusted our valuation range to reflect our revised timelines for clinical development of GDC 0084 in GBM  Our revised valuation range is  64 103m  vs  64 111m   with the upper end of the range now representing our base case scenario 
Our base case valuation of  103m models a GDC 0084 market launch in 2024 following a single pivotal study  The valuation is slightly lower than in our previous report  which modelled a launch one year earlier  in 2023  Our valuation is equivalent to  16 50 ADR and  15 85 ADR after diluting for options and convertible notes  Kazia s primary listing is on the ASX under the code KZA  each NASDAQ listed ADR represents 10 ordinary shares  Our undiluted base case valuation equals A 2 17 per ASX listed ordinary share at current exchange rates 
Our base case valuation assumes a 40  likelihood that GDC 0084 is out licensed to a marketing partner in 2023 after reporting positive PFS data from the Phase IIb trial in a deal that includes  40m upfront and  120m in clinical and regulatory milestone payments  We also assume Kazia pays a royalty of 10  of net sales to Genentech and that global sales for GBM reach  1 050m in 2030 
Exhibit 11 shows our base case market assumptions for GDC 0084 and Cantrixil and the contribution of product royalties and milestone payments to the rNPV  We have offset the risk adjusted trial cost against milestone revenue for each drug  rather than against royalty revenue  This understates the contribution of the milestone payments to the rNPV and overstates the contribution of royalties 

We have also valued Kazia under an alternative accelerated approval scenario for GDC 0084  which assumes a market launch in 2026 and that Kazia receives a lower 15  royalty rate and a smaller  20m upfront payment due to the need for the partner to complete an confirmatory efficacy study before filing for approval  with other deal terms the same as for the accelerated approval base case scenario  Exhibit 12 shows that requirement for a confirmatory pivotal study for GDC 0084 would reduce our valuation for Kazia to  64m or  10 27 ADR  undiluted  

Financials
Kazia had  4 1m cash plus an  2 2m R D tax rebate receivable at 31 December 2018  It has subsequently raised  1 8m  before costs  through the sale of its shareholding in Noxopharm  We expect the available funds to be sufficient to support operations into H2 CY19  While the preliminary efficacy data from the GDC 0084 Phase IIa study are expected to read out in Q419  depending on the timing  funds may need to be raised in H2 CY19 before the trial data are available  We estimate Kazia will need additional funds of  11 15m to finance the GDC 0084 Phase IIb GBM study 
We have revised our FY20 financial forecasts to include an  0 2m contribution to the Alliance collaborative study  plus a further  0 2m contribution in FY21 ",2019-06-21,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kazia-therapeutics-higher-mtd-new-collaboration-for-gdc0084-200433571,200433571

 Aratana understands the value of relationships with the right collaborators   Aratana Therapeutics CEO Steven St  Peter said in a statement   We believe that this collaboration with Elanco  a leading animal health company  is a watershed event for the emerging pet biotech sector and further validates our focus on the pet therapeutics opportunity  
As part of the deal  Aratana said it will receive an upfront payment of  45 million from Elanco  NYSE LLY    The agreement also calls for Aratana to receive up to  83 million in total if certain development  regulatory and sales milestones are met

Jardiance and Basaglar  which made up for lower sales of older products like Cialis Foreign exchange hurt sales growth by 2  in the quarter  Also  lower realized prices had a negative impact of 3  on sales driven by increased utilization of patient affordability programs Volumes rose 7  as increased demand for new products like Trulicity  Basaglar  Taltz  Jardiance and Verzenio offset lower volumes of some established products like Cialis due to loss of exclusivity  Volumes rose 13  excluding Cialis New pharma products  products launched since 2014  drove 14 8  of volume growth and

Outside U S  sales were hurt by currency headwindsAmong the new products  Trulicity generated revenues of  879 7 million  up 30  year over year driven by higher demand in the United States and higher volumes n ex U S  markets  which offset the impact of lower realized prices Cyramza revenues were  198 3 million  up 8  year over year driven by higher sales in both U S  and international markets Jardiance sales surged 35  to  203 6 million  driven by increased demand trends within the SGLT2 class of diabetes medicines in the United States and increased volume outside the United States  which

realized prices and changes in rebates and discounts estimates  Outside U S  sales growth was driven by increased volume  which offset the impact of lower realized prices Taltz brought in sales of  252 5 million  up 72  year over year as U S  sales gained from higher demand  which made up for lower realized prices  Ex U S  sales were driven by increased volume from launches in new countries  which offset the impact of currency headwinds Lartruvo generated sales of  43 9 in this quarter compared with 83 5 million in the previous quarter   Due to the failure of the ANNOUNCE confirmatory

favorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold  Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold  gross margin declined about 130 basis points due to the negative impact of manufacturing shutdowns  unfavorable product mix due to lower volumes from post patent products and lower price Operating income decreased 8  year over year to  1

billion previously  Research and development expense is expected to be in the range of  5 5 billion to  5 7 billion versus  5 8 billion to  6 0 billion previously In 2019  revenue growth is expected to be driven by higher demand for its newer medicines including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio and Emgality as some older drugs like Cialis lose patent exclusivity Lilly expects U S  regulatory action for nasal glucagon for hypoglycemia and lasmiditan for acute migraine in 2019 as well as line extension approvals for several medicines  which could drive revenue growth in 2019 However  generic competition for several drugs including Cialis  rising pricing pressure in the United States and some international markets  currency headwinds and the impact of the failed Lartruvo study are

171558,393074,LLY,Why Eli Lilly  LLY  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Eli Lilly in Focus
Headquartered in Indianapolis  Eli Lilly  LLY  is a Medical stock that has seen a price change of 0 25  so far this year  The drugmaker is paying out a dividend of  0 64 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 22  compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield of 2 98  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 58 is up 14 7  from last year  Eli Lilly has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 4 06   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Lilly s current payout ratio is 46   meaning it paid out 46  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  LLY expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 66 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 1 98  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that LLY is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-05-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-eli-lilly-lly-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200423040,200423040

171593,393109,LLY,Dainippon schizophrenia drug meets goals in trial,news,"  Lurasidone significantly better than placebo in study
   Discontinuation rate similar to placebo
   Company to seek U S  FDA approval in early 2010
 By Bill Berkrot
 NEW YORK  Aug 26  Reuters    Japan s Dainippon Sumitomo
Pharma Co Ltd  4506 T  said its experimental schizophrenia
drug  lurasidone  was significantly better than placebo in a
pivotal late stage clinical trial  according to data released
on Wednesday 
 The company said it plans to submit its application seeking
U S  approval to sell the medicine early next year 
 Patients with acute schizophrenia in the 478 subject 
six week  Phase III trial received either 40 milligrams or 120
milligrams of lurasidone daily or a placebo 
 Both doses of the drug proved to be statistically
significantly better than placebo in the primary goal of the
study  which was 30 percent or better improvement in the
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale  the company said 
 Fifty three percent of patients who received 40 mg of
lurasidone and 47 percent of those on the 120 mg dose achieved
the primary goal compared with 38 percent on placebo 
 Both doses of lurasidone were also significantly more
effective than placebo on a secondary measure used to test
antipsychotic drugs called the Clinical Global Impressions
Severity scale  the company said 
 In previous trials  lurasidone was also tested at 80 mg and
Dainippon Sumitomo said it would submit all three doses for FDA
approval 
 Lurasidone belongs to a class of drugs known as atypical
antipsychotics and works by blocking serotonin receptors in the
brain  If approved  it would join an already crowded field of
such treatments 
  We re still searching for the right drug for many of these
patients  There s no one size fits all   Dr Herbert Meltzer 
one of the study s lead investigators and professor of
psychiatry at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine  said in
a telephone interview 
 Patients in the trial had been diagnosed with schizophrenia
on average for more than 13 years and most had been previously
hospitalized prior to entering the study 
  If you look at the weight gain  the lipid changes  it s
among the most benign of any antipsychotic drugs  clearly
better than olanzapine  clozapine and Seroquel   Meltzer said 
 Olanzapine is the chemical name for Eli Lilly and Co s
 widely used Zyprexa  clozapine in sold by Novartis AG
 under the brand name Clozaril  and Seroquel is sold
by AstraZeneca Plc  
 Zyprexa and similar drugs can cause significant weight gain
and have been linked to increased risk of diabetes 
 But  this class of drugs as a whole is so superior to the
first generation drugs   said Meltzer  who plans to present the
data from the lurasidone trial at a major medical meeting in
December 
 Lurasidone was well tolerated with a discontinuation rate
nearly identical to placebo    40 percent versus 39 percent   
and the adverse events were generally mild  such as
restlessness and sleepiness 
  From the point of view of efficacy and side effect
profile  once a day administration  the fact that the lower
dose works as well as the higher dose  I think this is going to
have a very good chance of major acceptance among my
colleagues   Meltzer added

171602,393118,LLY,4 Best Biotech Funds To Buy In Q2,opinion,"The biotechnology sector provided excellent returns in the first quarter  Mergers and acquisitions  initial public offerings  collaborative operations  remarkable new job additions and implementation of new technology in the biotechnology domain are some factors boosting the sector 
Investors who aren t afraid of taking risks could find this sector highly lucrative in the coming months 
Biotech Indexes Fare Well in 2019
Major biotechnology indexes had a spectacular Q1  SPDR S P Biotech ETF  NYSE XBI   iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  IBB   ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology  BIB  and NASDAQ Biotechnology Index  NBI  surged 24 3   14 8   29 3  and 14 9   respectively  in the January March period 
Factors Boosting Biotechnology Sector
While the sector has benefited from many developments so far this year  mergers and acquisitions  M As  have been rather prominent in changing the overall landscape of the sector  M As are rather common in the biotechnology sector  and why not  Given the high prices involved in the research and development of drugs  M As help companies build new platforms  cluster sub critical businesses and fund R D programs better 
This year has already been earmarked as another one for M As  starting with pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb s offer in January to acquire cancer drugmaker Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  for  74 billion  Following this  Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY  acquired Loxo Oncology for  8 billion in February 
In addition  companies entering collaborative operations are also driving the sector  Collaborative arrangements basically refer to joint operating activities  which significantly help biotechnology companies to conduct research and drug development as well as share risks and costs 
Apart from M As and collaborative arrangements  a notable number of initial public offerings are also boosting the biotechnology sector  In 2018 alone  the sector witnessed about 60 companies filing IPOs and raising a whopping  6 3 billion in the process  In the United States last year  biotechnology and biopharmacy startups constituted 42  of U S  IPOs in terms of the number of deals  the highest in any sector   
Also  new job additions in the healthcare sector are a definitive indicator of the sector s unprecedented growth  According to the labor department s latest report  the healthcare sector added 49 000 new jobs in March and 398 000 over the past one year 
Last but not the least  the increasing implementation of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud based applications are changing the operational structure  and research and development processes in the biotechnology sector  Drug discovery and development  monitoring patients and other functions have become faster and easier with these 
These encouraging factors make the biotechnology sector a great choice for investments and therefore  investors could consider a few biotech mutual funds  At this point  a rather vital question crosses one s mind  Why should investors consider mutual funds 
This is because reduced transaction costs and diversification of portfolio without several commission charges that are associated with stock purchases are primarily why one should be their parking money in mutual funds  read more

171605,393121,LLY,Is A Beat In The Cards For Incyte  INCY  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   is scheduled to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 30  before the market opens 
In the last reported quarter  the company missed earnings estimates by 7   Incyte s earnings track record has been disappointing so far  The company missed earnings expectations thrice  over the last four quarters  delivering average negative earnings surprise of 34 45  
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model indicates that Incyte is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  as it has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    to be able to beat estimates 
Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP for Incyte is  28 6   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 40 cents  while the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at 51 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Incyte currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat 
Note  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factors Driving Growth
Incyte s lead drug  Jakafi  ruxolitinib   is a first in class JAK1 JAK2 inhibitor  approved for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera   PV    and those with intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis   MF    including primary MF  post PV MF and post essential thrombocythemia MF  While the company markets the drug in the United States  it is marketed by Novartis   NYSE NVS   as Jakavi outside the country 
Incyte continues to gain traction from Jakafi s performance  The drug s revenues totaled  1 4 billion in 2018  up 22  from 2017  driven by strong patient demand 
We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter  The company expects Jakafi revenues of  1 580  1 650 million 
In order to expand patient population and increase commercial potential of the drug  the company is working toward expanding Jakafi s label  further  We expect investors to also focus on pipeline development  given the recent setbacks 
We remind investors that while Jakafi sales and royalties are key components of Incyte s revenue growth  Iclusig sales and Olumiant royalties are also contributing to the top line  Iclusig revenues are expected to be  90  100 million in 2019  This will also boost the company s performance in the to be reported quarter 
Key Anticipated Updates
Earlier in the year  Incyte and partner Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY  announced that the two phase III studies  BREEZE AD1 and BREEZE AD2  evaluating the efficacy and safety of Olumiant monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  AD  met the primary endpoint  The drug is already approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis   RA   in patients with inadequate response or intolerant to TNF inhibitor therapies 
Incyte suffered a setback when the FDA extended the review period of the supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for Jakafi to treat patients with acute graft versus host disease  GVHD   who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids  However  the FDA extended the action date by three months to review additional data submitted by the company in response to the FDA s information requests 
The additional data have been determined by the FDA to constitute a major amendment to the sNDA  Hence  the new Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  target action date is May 24  2019 
Share Price Performance
Incyte s stock has gained 16 8  in the year so far  outperforming the  s growth of 4 8

Here are two health care stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings

171628,393144,LLY,Selvita  Services And Oncology Businesses To Split,opinion,"Selvita s  WA SLVP  announcement of an intention to split into two separate companies was the hallmark event in the Q418 results presentation  By end of 2019  the drug discovery services and oncology R D will be split into separate listed entities  subject to financial authorities and shareholders  approvals  We believe both businesses have sufficient momentum to sustain such a split  The profitable Services segment again delivered substantial sales growth of 34  in 2018  The R D pipeline is progressing according to plan and two clinical trials with SEL24 and SEL120 could deliver data over 2019 2020  Our valuation is slightly higher than before at PLN1 34bn or PLN83 9 share 

A significant step in corporate history
With its Q418 results Selvita released a major announcement about its plans to split into two distinct companies  One company will provide drug discovery services while the other will focus on developing the innovative oncology compound portfolio  which roughly correspond to the current Services  including Ardigen  and Innovations business segments  Both companies will be listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange  Selvita stated the rationale for the split is primarily related to the different risk and cash flow profiles of the businesses  Because both parts of the company are mature enough to continue as separate entities  Selvita believes the timing for the split is right 
Services segment backlog indicates good 2019
Selvita s reported total 2018 revenues of PLN110 1m  up 4  y o y  were largely in line with our expectations  Operating loss of PLN13 6m was slightly better than our expected PLN16 3m loss  as total operating expenses came in at PLN123 7m compared to our forecast PLN121 0m  As usual  Selvita released its first 2019 backlog with its Q418 results  The Services segment had already contracted revenues of PLN41 7m for 2019  up from PLN29 1m a year ago over the same period  which indicates another good year for this segment 
Valuation  Slightly up to PLN1 34bn or PLN83 9 share
Our valuation of Selvita is slightly higher at PLN1 34bn or PLN83 9 share versus PLN1 24bn or PLN77 6 share previously  Both the revision of the operating estimates and rolling the model forward had a small positive effect on the rNPV values of the R D projects and the DCF  Data readouts from ongoing clinical trials with SEL24 and SEL120 should be released over 2019 2020 

Business description
Selvita is an R D and drug discovery services company  It operates three business segments  Innovations Platform  internal R D pipeline   Research Services  medicinal chemistry biology  biochemistry  and Ardigen  a spin out bioinformatics company  52  owned   The lead asset is wholly owned SEL120  currently Phase I ready after the FDA approved an IND application in March 2019  Selvita is focusing on its other projects in a broad pipeline dedicated to oncology 
Details of transaction and the two new companies
According to the initial details released by Selvita  the innovative oncology company will control the current R D pipeline of small molecules and the platform technology  targeted therapeutics  cancer metabolism immunometabolism and immunooncology platforms   The Selvita branding will be retained by the services company  Around 170 employees will be part of the innovative oncology company and the remaining 325 will join the services company  The separation is expected to be complete by end of 2019  Subject to approval by shareholders and the supervisory board  current Selvita CEO Pawel Przewiezlikowski will be CEO of the oncology company and COO Boguslaw Sieczkowski will become CEO of the contract research company  both are co founders of Selvita   The current shareholding structure of Selvita should be maintained by both new companies  For each existing share in Selvita  the shareholders will receive one share in the innovative R D company and one share in the services company  All Ardigen  Bioinformatics spin off  shares owned by Selvita will be allocated to the services company and all NodThera s shares owned by Selvita will be allocated to the new R D company 
Between 2014 and 2018 Selvita s research Services grew by more than 30  per year to a total of PLN59m in 2018  The services company will seek to maximise its sales and profitability via organic growth and acquisition of complementary drugs discovery service providers  Of note is that the latter strategic option will become available as debt funding will be more accessible to the profitable services company 
We provided a detailed overview of Selvita s R D pipeline in our recent outlook report  including the two most advanced assets in clinical development  SEL24  a dual PIM FLT3 inhibitor  and wholly owned SEL120  a selective CDK8 inhibitor  SEL24 is out licensed to Menarini Group  and is now known as MEN1703   therefore we expect the new oncology company will focus on SEL120 and on advancing the broad preclinical pipeline  Selvita indicated that the existing pipeline of R D projects would allow it to progress one new drug candidate into the clinic every year 
Our take
We believe such a split will be beneficial for investors as it will offer investors an investment option to match their risk return profile  The Services segment is fast growing and profitable  As a standalone entity it will be able to diversify its capital structure  lower overall costs of capital and complement organic growth with acquisitions  The innovative R D company will likely resemble a classic drug developer  which tends to be a high risk but high reward type of business  In Selvita s case  the R D pipeline is broad and the company has the same business goals it described in its 2017 2021 development strategy  which are to 
sign a partnership contract for further development and commercialisation of SEL120 in Phase II on significantly better terms than for SEL24  and
independently develop and partner one R D project a year 
If these goals are met  the newsflow should be sufficient to support the share price  Therefore  both businesses appear to have enough momentum to continue as standalone entities  Data readouts could be released from both ongoing clinical trials with SEL24 and SEL120 this year  which are key catalysts for the share price as Selvita splits 
R D progress
According to the Q418 update  Selvita made progress across its R D pipeline and is on track with the plans announced in conjunction with the 2018 share issue 

Targeted therapeutics platform
The Phase I II trial with SEL24 MEN1703 in acute myeloid leukaemia  AML  patients is progressing according to plan and now is run solely by Menarini  which should provide trial updates at scientific and medical conferences in 2019  Selvita anticipates the first clinical data could be released in 2020 
The second lead drug candidate  SEL120  is now ready to enter the Phase I trial after the FDA approved an IND application in March 2019 in patients with AML or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome  The open label  dose escalation study is designed to evaluate safety  tolerability and recommended dose of SEL120  Selvita indicated that the activation of clinical centres in the US started in Q219 and administering SEL120 to the first patients could start in Q319 and  if all goes to plan  the data readout is planned for 2020  This focus on haematological malignancies is supported by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and Selvita has received US 1 1m in research funding in total since the collaboration was established in August 2017  However  the company believes the potential of SEL120 is much wider and could be used in various solid tumours  including in combinations with checkpoint inhibitors 
The targeted therapeutics platform also includes an ongoing project exploring the BRM SMARCA2 target in the so called synthetic lethality space and other projects with undisclosed epigenetic modulators  We reviewed all available preclinical data released by Selvita in our recent outlook report 
Immunooncology platform
The STING agonist project is at the most advanced discovery stage in this platform  One of the key potential competitive advantages of Selvita s compounds is that they are small molecules suitable for systemic administration  rather than several other technologies that are in a clinical stage and based on cyclic dinucleotides scaffolds that are mostly administered intratumorally  In 2018  Selvita continued optimising the compounds and aims to identify the drug candidate for late stage preclinical development by the end of 2019 
Another project in an earlier preclinical stage focuses on regulating the T cell dependent immune response  It involves the target HPK1  MAP4K1   which is one of the major proteins in the signalling cascade triggered by TCR activation  Inhibition of this kinase leads to prolonged activation of T cells and stimulates dendritic cells  antigen presentation  which eventually leads to improved mounting of the immune response directed against the cancerous cells 
Cancer metabolism and immunometabolism platform
In this platform Selvita has its own projects and a longstanding collaboration with Merck  compounds undisclosed   Of the internally run projects  the most advanced are focused on the adenosine pathway  more specifically on the modulation of the production of adenosine by tumour cells  CD39 CD73 enzymes  and its effects on immune cells  A2A B receptors  
Selvita is focusing on best in class dual A2A A2B receptor antagonists and expects to nominate the drug candidate for IND enabling studies in 2019  Compounds are differentiated versus competitors and showed excellent anti tumour efficacy in combination with immuno  and chemotherapies in preclinical studies  Entering the Phase I clinical trial is planned in 2020  Another project in this platform involves SHMT2 inhibitors in early discovery stages of preclinical development 
NodThera NLRP3 inflammasome technology
In June 2018 Selvita s spin out  NodThera  announced a  28m fundraise from a consortium of investors co led by Sofinnova Partners and 5AM Ventures  Selvita s last reported ownership of NodThera is 14  on a fully diluted basis  NodThera was created around Selvita s NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor technology with first in class compounds  Inflammasomes have been identified as the molecular mechanism behind the activation cascade of interleukin  IL  1  IL 1 is a family of pro inflammatory cytokines that have been widely implicated in pain  inflammation and autoimmune conditions and more recently in cancer 
We note that inflammasome inhibitors continue to draw the pharma industry s attention  The most recent example is the deal announced on 1 April 2019 by Novartis and IFM Tre  Novartis paid  310m upfront and up to  1 265bn in potential milestones to acquire IFM Tre  Novartis gained access to a portfolio of two preclinical and one clinical NLPR3 antagonist for an array of chronic inflammatory disorders including atherosclerosis and non alcoholic steatohepatitis  IFM Tre was a spin out from IFM Therapeutics  which sold STING and NLRP3 assets targeting oncological indications to Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  in August 2017 for  300m upfront and potential milestones of up to  1 01bn  IFM Therapeutics was seeded with just  2m in October 2015  so a combined upfront of  610m and potential milestones  2 28bn in less than five years represent a very attractive reward 
Financials
Selvita s reported total 2018 revenues of PLN110 1m  4  y o y  were largely in line with our expectations  The total top line y o y growth was achieved despite strong Q117  when a large income of PLN20 3m was recognised after the company out licensed SEL24 to Menarini Group  Selvita reports in three business segments  Services  Innovation  income from SEL24 was included in this segment  and Bioinformatics 
The Services segment generated sales of PLN59 1m  excluding subsidies  in 2018  an increase of 34  y o y  reflecting continuing solid organic growth  Subsidies in this segment were PLN3 2m  while operating profit was PLN8 8m versus PLN5 3m a year ago  improving the operating margin from 10 8  to 13 5  
Commercial revenues from the Innovations segment were PLN9 7m in 2018 vs PLN36 7m in 2017  with the out licensing of SEL24 to the Menarini Group in March 2017 the main reason behind the strong performance in 2017  In addition  Selvita stopped capitalising the R D costs in early 2018  Commercial revenues from this segment came from payments related to different partnerships  such as milestone payments from drug discovery collaborations  and therefore tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter but offer potentially higher margins  Subsidies in this segment were PLN26 2m  versus PLN15 9m a year ago   while the operating loss was PLN24 6m 
The Bioinformatics  Ardigen  segment recorded revenues of PLN8 6m versus PLN6 9m a year ago  This business was spun out from Selvita  which holds 52  of the shares  in October 2015 and in 2018 the sales grew by 24 3  to PLN8 6m  So while still a small operation for Selvita  the growth rate is very high  Revenues from subsidies in this segment were PLN2 6m and operating profit was PLN2 2m 
Selvita s 2018 net income was also affected by Selvita s spin out NodThera raising new funds from a consortium  Selvita changed the accounting of NodThera s shares from the equity method to fair value and booked PLN16 6m in profit 
We have made some revisions to our revenue estimates in each segment  Overall 2018 revenues slightly surpassed our expectations  As usual  Selvita released its first 2019 order backlog 
Services PLN41 7m  up from PLN29 1m over the same period a year ago 
Innovation PLN2 5m  down from PLN6 9m y o y 
Bioinformatics PLN6 7m  up from PLN4 7m y o y 
Subsidies PLN31 1m  up from PLN27 8m y o y 
The Services segment again appears to be poised for substantial growth in 2019  as does Bioinformatics  Subsidies should also increase as Selvita advances its R D pipeline  Contracted revenues for the Innovations segment could decrease this year  but as we describe above  the value in this segment is created via R D and actual revenues can fluctuate substantially  Operating loss of PLN13 6m was slightly better than our expected PLN16 3m  Total operating expenses were PLN123 7m compared to our expected PLN121 0m  Exhibit 2 summarises our estimate changes post Q418 results  Selvita reported cash of PLN125m at end Q418  PLN114m as of 22 March 2019  and PLN4 1m in debt 

Valuation
Our valuation of Selvita is slightly higher at PLN1 34bn or PLN83 9 share versus PLN1 24bn or PLN77 6 share previously  The revision of the operating estimates and rolling the model forward had a small positive effect on the rNPV values of the R D projects and the DCF  We maintain our valuation approach and assumptions discussed in detail in our last outlook report  We use risk adjusted NPV models with a discount rate of 12 5  for Selvita s R D projects at various stages  Separately  we use DCF based calculations with a discount rate of 10  to value the core drug discovery services business and research collaborations 
We have made one substantial update to our rNPV calculation by replacing the SHMT2 inhibitor project with STING  While both projects are active  we see the STING agonist making rapid progress towards clinical development  According to the latest update  Selvita aims to identify the drug candidate in this project for late stage preclinical development by the end of 2019  We use the following assumptions for this project 
Market potential  STING agonists have broad potential to be used in combinations with other chemotherapeutic agents and immunoncology drugs  such as checkpoint inhibitors  CPIs   The strong rationale for combinations with CPIs is based on the fact that they act late in the immunity cycle  which makes the tumour  visible  to T cells   while the STING pathway appears to prime cancer specific T cells  so both technologies are potentially synergistic  see the overview in our last outlook report   Because of the early stage of development and lack of clarity on specific indications  but to reflect the broad potential  we use  1bn as our peak sales assumption  in line with our other preclinical projects 
R D costs and timelines  We assume that a clinical candidate will be identified in 2019 and partnered in 2021  We assume the R D cost for Selvita to develop the asset to a partnership deal is  2 5m  Phase I will start in 2022  and the partner continues the development and launches in 2031 with peak sales reached in six years 
Licensing terms  We use the terms of the recent deal between Aduro and Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  involving the preclinical stage STING asset  Lilly paid  12m upfront and  620m in milestone payments  We assume 7 10  royalty rates  An earlier deal between Aduro and Novartis was even more impressive  where Novartis paid  200m up front  invested  25m in Aduro  while up to  500m are due in milestones  We use the deal with Lilly to err on the conservative side and due to the fact that it is the most recent one  We assume market protection until late 2030 ",2019-04-08,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/selvita-services-and-oncology-businesses-to-split-200404660,200404660
171629,393145,LLY,Why Eli Lilly  LLY  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Eli Lilly in Focus
Headquartered in Indianapolis  Eli Lilly  LLY  is a Medical stock that has seen a price change of 9 96  so far this year  The drugmaker is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 64 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 03   This compares to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield of 2 8  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 92  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 58 is up 14 7  from last year  In the past five year period  Eli Lilly has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 4 06   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Lilly s current payout ratio is 40   meaning it paid out 40  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
LLY is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 65 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 1 80  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that LLY is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-04-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-eli-lilly-lly-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200405500,200405500
171630,393146,LLY,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Lilly  LLY  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Eli Lilly  LLY  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this drugmaker a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Lilly is 12 6   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 1 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 1 5  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Lilly is 20 6   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 10 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 4 3  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 3 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Lilly  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Lilly a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

171640,393156,LLY,3 Big Pharma Stocks To Add To Your Portfolio This April  ,opinion,"The Zacks  industry  comprising some of the biggest drugmakers in the world  has gained 4 9  in 2019 so far compared with the S P 500 s increase of 13 1   Large  Cap Pharma Versus S P 500 The S P 500 Index witnessed a bull run in the first quarter of 2019 despite pockets of volatility  Upbeat economic growth  improving business sentiment and a dovish Fed helped the S P 500 rally in the quarter  The large cap pharmaceutical industry has underperformed the S P 500 probably due to some pipeline related setbacks  Also  the fourth quarter results were mostly below expectations and the earnings and sales outlook for 2019 was rather soft Nonetheless  the sector is largely expected to pick up as the year progresses  
 The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry features among the top 34  of the 255 Zacks ranked industriesWe believe that new product sales ramp up as a result of rising demand driven by a growth in ageing population  successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas  strong clinical study results  and frequent FDA approvals should help the big drug giants to do well this year despite broader macro issues or the industry s own challenges  Moreover  the industry is likely to perform well even if the global economy slows down this year  as is widely expected  This is because it is a defensive growth sector  which is almost insulated from broader macroeconomic factors Importantly  mergers and acquisition activity has risen this year relative from 2018  which positions the sector for growth  A key announcement this year was Bristol Myers    NYSE BMY   offer to buy Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   for  74 billion  the biggest merger in the industry  Other important acquisition announcements include Lilly s   NYSE LLY   purchase of small cancer biotech  Loxo Oncology and Merck s   NYSE MRK   pending acquisition of Immune Design  Meanwhile  Glaxo   NYSE GSK   closed its previously announced acquisition of small cancer biotech Tesaro in January Meanwhile  most big pharma companies are resorting to restructuring activities  which is increasing their financial capacity  The funds can be used to re stock pipelines with promising new drug candidates bought from smaller innovative drug biotech companies However  the sector faces its share of headwinds like government scrutiny of high drug prices  pricing and competitive pressure  generic competition for blockbuster treatments  slowdown in sales of some of the most high profile older drugs and major pipeline setbacks Nonetheless  we believe pipeline success  cost cutting  share buybacks  product launches  increased M A and collaboration activity and appropriate utilization of cash should keep the sector afloat through the rest of this year In this scenario  investing in stocks with a large market cap is a prudent move given the fact that they control a large portion of an industry  Given this backdrop  it makes sense to invest in some of the bigshot drugmakers Here we have highlighted three stocks that may prove to be good buys  All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and have seen their share price and earnings estimates rise this year so far  You can see  A chart showing the share price movement of the three stocks this year so far is given below   Merck

Lynparza  and Bridion are contributing meaningfully to its top line  Sales of its blockbuster PD L1 inhibitor  Keytruda are gaining momentum with approval for additional indications  especially in first line lung cancer setting  We believe Keytruda has strong growth prospects based on increased utilization  recent approvals for new indications and potential additional approvals worldwide  Meanwhile  Merck s animal health and vaccine products are also performing strongly and remain core growth drivers Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ  J J s shares have risen 8 3  this year so far  a decent recovery from the decline last year  Its earnings estimates for 2019 have gone up 0 1  in the past 30 days J J s sales growth accelerated in 2018 backed by above market sales growth in the Pharmaceutical segment and improving performance in Medical Devices unit  Though generic biosimilar headwinds in the Pharmaceutical segment will hurt J J s sales and profits in 2019  both are expected to accelerate in 2020 supported by drug launches  successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and immunology drug  Stelara  J J is also making rapid progress with its

Perjeta  Tecentriq  Alecensa and Hemlibra has been more than offset by lower sales of MabThera Rituxan and Tarceva  In particular  multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus witnessed strong growth  driven by increased demand  Meanwhile  the company continues to progress with its pipeline as it looks to restructure its portfolio beyond oncology into MS and hemophilia among others  The Ignyta acquisition of

171658,393174,LLY,Eli Lilly  LLY  Flat As Market Gains  What You Should Know,opinion,"In the latest trading session  Eli Lilly  LLY  closed at  123 50  marking no change from the previous day  This change lagged the S P 500 s daily gain of 0 3   At the same time  the Dow lost 0 38   and the tech heavy Nasdaq gained 0 44  
Coming into today  shares of the drugmaker had gained 4 65  in the past month  In that same time  the Medical sector gained 2 07   while the S P 500 gained 2 91  
Investors will be hoping for strength from LLY as it approaches its next earnings release  On that day  LLY is projected to report earnings of  1 35 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 0 75  
LLY s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  5 63 per share and revenue of  25 32 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  1 44  and  3 1   respectively 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for LLY  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system

Cyramza is currently approved in combination with chemotherapy  docetaxel  for second line metastatic NSCLC  The drug is also approved for second line gastric and colorectal cancer  Lilly is also seeking approval of the drug for second line hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer 
The successful completion of the RELAY study may get approval for Cyramza s first indication in previously untreated patient population  The company plans to submit regulatory applications for the drug s label expansion in first line NSCLC in mid 2019  Please note that first line NSCLC has a significant market opportunity due to large number of patients  However  the segment is getting competitive with new approvals and several therapies under development 
In December 2018  the FDA approved a combination of Roche s Tecentriq in combination with Avastin and chemotherapy for first line metastatic non squamous NSCLC  Earlier in October  Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy received approval for treating first line metastatic squamous NSCLC  Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Vizimpro was approved in September for metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutation  Several other therapies were approved for NSCLC related indications in 2018

Apart from Cyramza  Lilly is also developing a wide range of therapies for several indications  The company has launched 10 new drugs since 2014  which have shown strong sales growth  It expects to launch another new 10 drugs in the next five years  If the upcoming launches can replicate the impressive performance of the new marketed drugs  the company will be well poised for growth in the long term 
Lilly s marketed portfolio has diversified products including multiple oncology drugs as well as drugs for other non cancer diseases  The company s revenues are expected to be driven by strong demand for its new drugs including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio and Emgality  However  several legacy drugs are facing generic competition  Moreover  competition from other branded drugs as well as pricing pressure prevailing in the U S  markets will also unfavorably impact the company s top line in 2019 Eli Lilly and Company Price

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Lilly due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Lilly Lags Q4 Earnings  Beats Sales  Lowers 2019 ViewLilly reported fourth quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of  1 33  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 36 and matched the lower end of the guided range of  1 33    1 38 per share Earnings rose 17  from the year ago quarter backed by robust growth in new product sales and higher operating income  A lower tax rate and reduction in shares outstanding from shares repurchase also led to higher earnings in the quarter However  as expected  earnings declined sequentially from third quarter levels due to U S  generic competition for Cialis and launch costs for Emgality Including acquired in process research and development  asset impairment  restructuring  and other special charges  fourth quarter earnings per share were  1 10 against a loss of  1 58 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 Revenues in DetailQuarterly revenues of  6 44 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 34 billion  Sales grew 5  year over year backed by strong demand for its new drugs led by Trulicity  Taltz  Jardiance and Basaglar  which made up for lower sales of established products like Cialis and Forteo Foreign exchange hurt sales growth by 1  in the quarter  Also  lower realized prices had a negative impact of 5  on sales Volumes rose 11  as increased demand for new products like Trulicity  Basaglar  Taltz  Jardiance and Verzenio offset lower volumes of some established products like Cialis due to loss of exclusivity  Volumes of Lilly s diabetes products rose 31  in the quarter New pharma products  products launched since 2014  drove 13 7  of volume growth and generated over  2 1 billion in revenues  representing nearly 38  total revenues  up from 31  in the previous quarter  The loss of exclusivity hurt volumes by 450 basis points driven almost entirely by Cialis U S  revenues grew 7  to  3 66 billion and ex U S  revenues rose 1  to  2 77 billion Despite the significant headwind from the loss of exclusivity of Cialis in the U S   Pharmaceutical revenues rose 5  in the quarter driven by volume growth  U S  Pharma revenues increased 6   while in Europe  pharma revenues rose 3   excluding currency impact  In Japan  pharma revenues rose 1   excluding currency impact  Pharma revenues in the rest of the world increased 10  Established products that recorded growth during the quarter included Strattera  up 9  to  107 2 million  and Alimta  up 6  to  556 9 million   Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter Forteo sales declined 15  to  437 1 million  Cymbalta sales declined 4  to  184 5 million  Humalog sales dropped 2  to  770 4 million  Zyprexa sales were down 27  to  110 8 million  Erbitux sales declined 5  to  159 8 million  Humulin sales declined 7  to  337 4 million Cialis sales declined 41  to  350 7 million as U S  sales were hurt by entry of generic competition  Outside U S  sales were hurt by loss of exclusivity in Europe Among the new products  Trulicity generated revenues  924 7 million  up 42  over year driven by higher demand in the United States and higher volumes and realized prices in ex U S  markets Cyramza revenues were  220 6 million  up 8  year over year driven by higher sales in both U S  and international markets Jardiance sales surged 35  to  193 2 million  driven by increased demand trends within the SGLT2 class of diabetes medicines in the United States and increased volume outside the United States which offset the negative impact of currency Basaglar recorded revenues of  232 2 million  up 51  year over year  In the United States  sales rose 59   benefiting from higher demand  which offset the impact of lower realized prices  due to increased volume in Medicare Part D  Taltz brought in sales of  307 0 million  up 78  year over year as U S  sales gained from higher demand and the impact of specialty pharmacy and wholesaler buying patterns  which made up for lower realized prices  Ex U S  sales were driven by increased volume from new launches  Taltz was launched for the second indication of psoriatic arthritis in late 2017 early 2018 in both the United States and Europe  which contributed to sales growth in the quarter Lartruvo generated revenues of  83 5 million in the quarter  higher than  76 9 million in the previous quarter  Though the failure of the ANNOUNCE confirmatory study on Lartruvo did not have any impact on fourth quarter results  Lilly is suspending promotion of Lartruvo and sales of the drug should decline sharply in 2019 Olumiant generated sales of  70 1 million in the quarter backed by launch uptake in new European markets  compared with  55 6 million in the previous quarter  In the United States  Olumiant recorded sales of  4 2 million  higher than  0 8 million in the previous quarter Verzenio  launched in the Unites States in late 2017  generated sales of  83 1 million in the quarter  which was less than  84 5 million in the previous quarter  This is because increased demand was more than offset by the negative impact of wholesaler buying patterns and lower realized prices in the United States  Meanwhile  the CDK4 6 inhibitors market is gradually slowing down  Verzenio was launched in several international markets in the fourth quarter of 2018 and generated ex U S  revenues of  6 6 million Emgality generated U S  revenues of  4 9 million in the fourth quarter Animal Health segment sales rose 3  to  816 5 million as higher prices and higher volume offset currency headwinds Gross Margin   Operating Income Adjusted gross margin of 76 6  in the quarter rose 50 basis points driven by manufacturing efficiencies  which offset the negative impact of lower prices  Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold  gross margin declined about 25 basis points Operating income increased 15  year over year to  1 62 billion on higher revenues and lower operating costs  Total operating expenses  including research and development and marketing  selling and administrative expenses   as a percent of revenues  declined 190 basis points in the quarter to 51 1   This is because the company s cost saving efforts offset the impact of higher marketing costs to support Emgality s launch While marketing  selling and administrative expenses rose 3   R D expense declined 2  in the quarter Adjusted effective tax rate was 15 8   lower than 20 2  in the year ago quarter  driven primarily by the impact of U S  tax reform 2018 ResultsFull year 2018 sales rose 7  to  24 56 billion  marginally beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  24 46 billion  Revenues were slightly above the guided range of  24 3 billion to  24 5 billion Adjusted earnings for 2018 were  5 55 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 58 but up 30  year over year  Earnings came in at the lower end of the guided range of  5 55 to  5 60 per share 2019 Guidance LoweredLilly lowered its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2019 to account for the costs related to the pending acquisition of Loxo and the study failure for Lartruvo The earnings forecast was reduced from a range of  5 90 to  6 00 to  5 55 to  5 65 per share  The earnings guidance continues to include a reduction of approximately 8 cents per share to reflect the non controlling interest portion of Elanco profits in 2019 Lilly now expects revenues to be between  25 1 billion and  25 6 billion in 2019  down from the prior expectations of  25 3 billion and  25 8 billion Gross margin is expected to be approximately 76 5   Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 15  Marketing  selling and administrative expense are expected to be in a range of  6 4 billion to  6 7 billion  Research and development expense is expected to be in the range of  5 8 billion to  6 0 billion In 2019  revenue growth is expected to be driven by higher demand for its newer medicines including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio as well Emgality as some older drugs like Cialis lose patent exclusivity Lilly expects U S  regulatory action for nasal glucagon for hypoglycemia and lasmiditan for acute migraine in 2019 as well as line extension approvals for several medicines  which could drive revenue growth in 2019  Loxo s newly approved marketed drug Vitrakvi should also support the top line However  generic competition for several drugs including Cialis  rising pricing pressure in the United States and some international markets  currency headwinds and the impact of the failed Lartruvo study are expected to put pressure on the top line

Full Year Result
For 2018  Aduro generated revenues of  15 1 million  down 12 2  on a year over year basis  The company suffered net loss of  1 21 per share in 2018

Aduro has a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis   NYSE NVS   for developing its lead STING Activator candidate  ADU S100 
Earlier this month  Aduro dosed the first patient in a phase I study  evaluating ADU S100 in combination with Bristol Myers    NYSE BMY   Yervoy  ipilimumab  for the treatment of relapsed refractory melanoma

Meanwhile  Aduro s LADD platform includes candidates  such as ADU 623  phase I   glioblastoma   ADU 741  phase I   metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  and ADU 214  phase I   metastatic non small cell lung cancer   Aduro has a research and license deal with Janssen  a subsidiary of Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  for developing ADU 214 and ADU 741

171721,393237,LLY,Incyte  INCY  Q4 Earnings Miss Estimates  Revenues Beat,opinion,"Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   reported mixed results for the fourth quarter of 2018  wherein earnings missed expectations while revenues beat the same  The company reported earnings of 40 cents per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents but was up from 2 cents reported in the year ago quarter

Pipeline Update
Incyte recently suffered a setback when the FDA extended the review period of the supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for Jakafi to treat patients with acute graft versus host disease  GVHD  who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids  The sNDA was submitted in August 2018  and the FDA granted it both Priority Review status and Breakthrough Therapy designation  
However  the FDA extended the action date by three months to review additional data submitted by Incyte in response to the FDA s information requests  The additional data have been determined by the FDA to constitute a major amendment to the sNDA  Hence  the new Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  target action date is May 24  2019 
Nonetheless  Jakafi is also being evaluated in patients with acute and chronic steroid refractory GVHD who have an inadequate response to corticosteroids in the REACH2 and REACH3 clinical studies  respectively  Results are expected in the second half of 2019  Meanwhile  the global phase III GRAVITAS 301 trial on itacitinib as a treatment for patients with steroid na ve acute GVHD is ongoing  Results from the study are expected in 2019 
The FDA has recently granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to pipeline candidate pemigatinib  FGFR  for the treatment of previously treated  advanced metastatic or unresectable FGFR2 translocated cholangiocarcinoma  Incyte expects to submit an NDA for pemigatinib for the second line treatment of patients with FGFR2 translocated cholangiocarcinoma in the third quarter of 2019 
A phase III trial on the cream formulation of Jakafi in patients with atopic dermatitis was initiated in December 2018  Data from the randomized phase II trial on Jakafi cream in patients with vitiligo are expected in 2019 
Incyte and partner Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   announced positive top line data from two late stage studies  evaluating their oral JAK inhibitor  Olumiant  baricitinib  as monotherapy for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis   AD    a type of eczema  Data from the phase III studies   BREEZE AD1 and BREEZE AD2   showed that the candidate met the primary endpoints of statistically significant improvements in patients compared to placebo  as measured by Investigator s Global Assessment for AD   IGA   score after treatment of 16 weeks  Full results are expected later in 2019 
Our Take
Incyte s performance in the fourth quarter was mixed  Nevertheless  Jakafi sales continue to be impressive 
However  Incyte s stock has lost 23 8  in the past six months compared with the  s 11 7  decline 

 
Pipeline setbacks continue to be a concern  The FDA s extension of the review period of the sNDA for the label expansion of Jakafi to treat acute GVHD was disappointing  Earlier  the company suffered a huge setback with the failure of the phase III study  ECHO 301  as it was one of the most promising candidates for Incyte  evaluating epacadostat in combination with Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda

171722,393238,LLY,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Eli Lilly  LLY  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Eli Lilly in Focus
Headquartered in Indianapolis  Eli Lilly  LLY  is a Medical stock that has seen a price change of 4 35  so far this year  The drugmaker is paying out a dividend of  0 56 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 14  compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield of 2 77  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 92  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 58 is up 14 7  from last year  In the past five year period  Eli Lilly has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 3 08   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Lilly s current payout ratio is 40   This means it paid out 40  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
LLY is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 59 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 0 72  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  LLY is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-02-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-eli-lilly-lly-could-be-a-great-choice-200388823,200388823

171737,393253,LLY,Incyte Down As FDA Extends Review Period Of Jakafi For GVHD,opinion,"Shares of Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   declined 1 9  after the FDA extended the review period of the supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for Jakafi to treat patients with acute graft versus host disease  GVHD  who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids 
The sNDA for the treatment of patients with acute GVHD was submitted in August 2018  and the FDA granted it both Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation 
However  the FDA extended the action date by three months to review additional data submitted by Incyte in response to the FDA s information requests  The additional data has been determined by the FDA to constitute a major amendment to the sNDA 
Hence  the new Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  target action date is May 24  2019 
The news comes as a disappointment for the company  as a label expansion of the drug would have boosted sales 
We remind investors that Jakafi  a first in class JAK1 JAK2 inhibitor  is already approved by the FDA for the treatment of people with polycythemiavera  PV  who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea  Jakafi is also indicated for the treatment of people with intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis  MF   including primary MF  post polycythemiavera MF and post essential thrombocythemia MF 
The drug is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis   NYSE NVS   as Jakavi outside the United States 
Meanwhile  Jakafi is also being evaluated in patients with acute and chronic GVHD who have an inadequate response to corticosteroids in the REACH2 and REACH3 clinical studies  respectively  Both the studies are expected to be completed in 2019  and could support additional regulatory submissions in 2020 
Earlier in the week  Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   and Incyte Corporation announced positive top line data from two late stage studies  evaluating their oral JAK inhibitor  Olumiant  baricitinib  as monotherapy for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis   AD    a type of eczema  Data from the phase III studies   BREEZE AD1 and BREEZE AD2   showed that the candidate met the primary endpoints of statistically significant improvements in patients compared to placebo  as measured by Investigator s Global Assessment for AD   IGA   score after treatment of 16 weeks 
Incyte s stock has lost 5 5  in the past year compared with the  s 16 5  decline  We remind investors that the company suffered a huge setback with the failure of the phase III study  ECHO 301  as it was one of the most promising candidates for Incyte  evaluating epacadostat in combination with Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda

171788,393304,LLY,Eli Lilly  LLY  Q4 Earnings Coming Up  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   will report fourth quarter and full year 2018 results on Feb 6  before market open  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 46  Lilly s shares have risen 43 6  in the past year against the  s decline of 21 9    Lilly s earnings performance has been pretty impressive  Its earnings beat expectations in each of the last four quarters  with the average positive surprise being 10 03   Eli Lilly and Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
  
   Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter Factors to ConsiderIn the fourth quarter  the company expects earnings in the range of  1 33    1 38 per share  This represents a sequential decline from third quarter levels due to U S  generic competition for key drug Cialis in September  higher R D costs in the fourth quarter  and launch costs for its newly launched CGRP antibody Emgality  Also  backing out the non controlling interest portion of Elanco profits is expected to have 2 to 3 cents negative impact on earnings in the fourth quarter  Lilly divested its Elanco animal health unit as an independent publicly traded company   Elanco Animal Health Incorporated   NYSE ELAN     via an initial public offering  IPO  of a minority stake in 2018 Like the previous couple of quarters  strong uptake trends of new products like Trulicity  Taltz  Basaglar  Cyramza  Jardiance and Verzenio are likely to make up for the decline in sales of established products like Strattera  Cialis  Effient and others due to loss of exclusivity The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Trulicity  Basalgar  Taltz  Jardiance and Cyramza s fourth quarter revenues is  928 million   208 million   300 million   191 million and  206 million  respectively Investors will be keen to know the sales numbers of new products like rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant  baricitinib  and advanced breast cancer treatment  Verzenio  Olumiant was launched in select European countries and in Japan in 2017 and in the United States  only for the lower dose  in June 2019  Verzenio was launched in the Unites States in the fourth quarter of 2017 Verzenio  so far  has generated impressive sales  In February  Verzenio gained FDA approval in the first line setting while the drug was approved in Europe and Japan in the third quarter  These line extensions could prove to be significant growth drivers for the drug in the fourth quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Verzenio fourth quarter sales is  110 million Olumiant is doing well in Europe backed by launch uptake in new markets  However  in United States  sales have been unimpressive  We expect the trend to continue in the fourth quarter Investor focus will also be on management s comments on the initial launch uptake of Emgality which gained FDA approval in September and could emerge as a significant contributor to long term growth However  the loss of exclusivity in some countries for Cialis  Effient  Strattera  Zyprexa  Cymbalta and Evista will hurt volumes  In September  Teva Pharmaceuticals  TEVA  announced the launch of a generic version of Cialis  which is expected to result in rapid erosion of sales of the branded drug in the fourth quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter Cialis sales is  258 million Other older drugs like Forteo  Zyprexa and Erbitux might also record lower sales Earlier this month  Lilly announced that Lartruvo  which had won conditional approval two years back  failed to improve

171789,393305,LLY,Lilly  LLY  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Eli Lilly and  LLY   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7 7  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  120 14 in the previous session  Eli Lilly and has gained 3 6  since the start of the year compared to the 5 6  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the  0 5  return for the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on November 6  2018  Lilly reported EPS of  1 39 versus consensus estimate of  1 37 
For the current fiscal year  Lilly is expected to post earnings of  5 87 per share on  24 46 billion in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  6 73 per share on  25 53 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 5 17  and 4 38   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Lilly may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Lilly has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and F  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 20 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 21 6X versus its peer group s average of 12 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 83  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Lilly currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Lilly fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Lilly shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Lilly Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Lilly have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   H Lundbeck A S  HLUYY   and Celgene  CELG   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for Lilly  Still  the fundamentals for Lilly are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2019-01-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lilly-lly-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200382628,200382628

171813,393329,LLY,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Lilly  LLY  Now,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Eli Lilly  LLY  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this drugmaker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Lilly is 9 1   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 5 2  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 5 1  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Lilly has an S TA ratio of 0 55  which means that the company gets  0 55 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 49  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Lilly is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 4 4  this year versus the industry average of 3 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Lilly  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Lilly a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Lilly well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-is-why-growth-investors-should-buy-lilly-lly-now-200377119,200377119

Exparel also achieved statistical significance for reduction in pain intensity through 72 hours  Shares of the company have declined 4 9  in the past year compared with the  s decline of 19 8  

We remind investors that Exparel is a liposome injection of bupivacaine  which is indicated for single dose administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia  In June 2018  the FDA also approved Exparel label to include administration via nerve block for prolonged regional analgesia  With this approval  Exparel is the first long acting  single dose nerve block available for patients undergoing upper extremity surgeries  such as total shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair 
The study also achieved statistical significance for relevant additional endpoints pre specified in the statistical analysis plan to better characterize the clinical benefit of the opioid reduction  includingtotal opioid consumption at one and two weeks  following C section and percentage of opioid spared patients  which was the composite endpoint In the study  patients undergoing elective C section and given spinal anesthesia were randomized to receive Exparel or the active comparator bupivacaine HCl  Patients in the Exparel arm were administered a transversus abdominis plane  TAP  field block with 10 mL Exparel admixed with 10 mL 0 25  bupivacaine HCl and 10 mL normal sterile saline injected bilaterally  Patients in the active comparator arm received a TAP field block with 10 mL 0 25  bupivacaine HCl admixed with 20 mL normal sterile saline injected bilaterally 
The study showed that when added to the standard of care  an Exparel TAP block provided a superior long acting field block that not only adequately controlled patients  pain following C section  but also greatly reduced their need for opioids The company is also conducting a phase IV study of Exparel in spinal fusion surgery  The company is also launching a series of phase IV studies in soft tissue procedures  These studies will assess Exparel as part of its multimodal protocol for colon cancer and breast reconstruction surgery

171819,393335,LLY,Lilly Stops Lartruvo Promotion As Confirmatory Study Fails,opinion,"Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   announced that a phase III study  evaluating Lartruvo  olaratumab  in combination with doxorubicin for treating metastatic soft tissue sarcoma  STS   failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival  OS   The phase III ANNOUNCE study examining Lartruvo plus doxorubicin   standard of care chemotherapy   compared with doxorubicin alone  was unable to confirm the clinical benefit of OS within full study population as well as in leiomyosarcoma  LMS  sub population  In both study arms  there was no difference in survival rate for either population 
Shares of Lilly were down 2 16  following the news  However  the stock has surged 36 5  in the past year against the  decline of 0 7  

 
We would like to remind investors that in October 2016  the FDA granted an approval to Lartruvo combined with doxorubicin for treating adult patients with advanced STS  Back then  the Lartruvo combo showed an OS benefit  which led to accelerated approval in the United States and a conditional marketing authorization in the EU  which was contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study 
However  data from this confirmatory ANNOUNCE analysis failed to validate clinical benefit  Consequently  Lilly decided to suspend the promotion of Lartruvo while in discussion with global regulators to determine the next steps for the drug 
The company plans to present data from this study at an upcoming medical conference and publish the results in a medical journal 
Following this unexpected development  Lilly has decided to book a pre tax charge in the  70 90 million range with regard to Lartruvo during first quarter 2019  This in turn  will leave an impact on Lilly s 2019 earnings per share  EPS  guidance by  0 17  EPS for 2019 is expected in the band of  5 52  5 62 on a reported basis and  5 90  6 on a non GAAP basis  Lilly is scheduled to announce fourth quarter and 2018 earnings on Feb 13  2019 
In the first nine months of 2018  Lartruvo generated sales of 221 2 million  soaring 53 6  year over year  Lartruvo is also being probed under phase II study in combination with gemcitabine and docetaxel for the treatment of advance STS

core competencies in the areas of health care and agriculture Bayer is facing generic threats competition for many of its products  including the Yaz franchise  oral contraceptives   The genericization of key drugs would negatively impact revenues  We expect the declining Yaz sales trend to persist  Continued weak performance of key drugs could impact the company s top line and pull down the stock Bayer is expecting several pipeline and regulatory related news in the coming quarters  Any adverse pipeline related news has the potential to impact the stock adversely In August 2018  Bayer and partner Johnson and Johnson   NYSE JNJ   announced data from two late stage studies  wherein blood thinner drug  Xarelto failed to show statistical benefits  These studies were being evaluated to expand the drug s eligible patient population  Data from the two phase III studies   MARINER and COMMANDER HF   showed no significant difference between Xarelto and placebo for the primary efficacy endpoints  The MARINER and COMMANDER HF studies are part of Xarelto s large clinical development program EXPLORER  which evaluates the potential role of Xarelto in treating a wide range of critical medical needs Bayer s dependence on its pharmaceutical segment for growth is a concern  Bayer s stock has declined 44 8  year to date  against the  s growth of 1 8  Last month  the

this business  The decision to exit this business comes as part of the company s plan to focus on its core businesses of Pharmaceuticals  Consumer Health and Crop Science The company is making efforts to revive its Consumer Health division to target market growth in the coming years and improve profitability  The measures include a planned exit from product categories  which were not suiting the company s business model  In addition to the previously announced divestment of prescription dermatology products  Bayer will review its strategic options in the coming months  and most likely exit its sun care  Coppertone  and foot care  Dr  Scholl s  product lines  The company intends to focus on driving growth in its core Consumer Health categories Bayer is also planning to divest its 60  interest in German site services provider Currenta  as this business does not align with its existing model anymore  given the carve out of Covestro Bayer expects annual savings of  2 6 billion by

job cuts will be in Germany However  the company has also received some new approvals  lately  The company also received new approvals for its candidates  In November  the company received approval by

171878,393394,LLY,Forget J J  Buy These 3 Big Drug Stocks Instead In 2019,opinion,Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   stock has declined more than 14  since Reuters reported that the pharma giant knew for decades that its baby powders contained asbestos J J faces thousands of lawsuits related to its baby powders in the United States  These allege that its talc based products  including its baby powders  contain asbestos  which causes its users to develop ovarian cancer The Reuters article informed that a scrutiny of J J s internal reports and other confidential documents showed that from 1971 to early 2000s  its raw talc and finished powders at times tested positive for trace amounts of asbestos In response  J J issued a statement wherein it called the reports by Reuters  one sided  false  and inflammatory   In an interview to CNBC  J J s chief executive officer  CEO   Alex Gorsky  said that the company  unequivocally  believes that its talc baby products do not contain asbestos  a fact demonstrated in thousands of tests and studies conducted over decades on nearly 100k patients  Meanwhile  J J also got ads published in leading newspapers  which stressed that the company has scientific evidence that its talc is safe It has been suggested that a link between talc and cancer may be due to the fact that talc and asbestos often occur together in deposits and get inadvertently mixed J J is in big trouble now after losing several billion in market capitalization since the article was published  Though the company might be able to put the issue behind it  as it has more than  30 billion of cash and baby products comprise only 2  of its sales  it will take some time for the stock to recover after the massive sell off In such a scenario  it is a good idea for near term investors to avoid this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock  Moreover  so far this year  the stock has declined 9 3   underperforming the industry s decline of 1 2   Its earnings estimates for 2019 have gone down by 0 2  over the past 60 days   You can see   Instead  investors can focus on three large drug stocks that may prove to be good buys  All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and have seen their share price and earnings estimates rise this year  Moreover  the industry features among the top 32  of the 257 Zacks ranked industriesA chart showing the share price movement of the three stocks this year so far is given below   Eli Lilly   Company   NYSE LLY  Lilly s earnings estimates have increased almost 3  for 2019 over the past 90 days  The company s shares have increased 31 5  this year so far Lilly s new products like Trulicity  Taltz  Basaglar  Cyramza  Jardiance  Lartruvo and Verzenio are driving sales growth   The company is also on a strong footing in terms of its pipeline with several positive late stage data readouts this year along with various regulatory approvals  A key regulatory success for Lilly was the FDA approval of Emgality galcanezumab  a calcitonin gene related peptide  CGRP  antibody for migraine prevention  which could emerge as a significant contributor to long term growth Several key regulatory and pipeline events are expected in 2019  Any positive outcome will push up share price further This year  Lilly also added promising new assets through business development deals including pancreatic cancer candidate  pegilodecakin  which was added with the acquisition of ARMO Biosciences  Meanwhile  the separation of its animal health unit  Elanco  via an IPO  is a prudent decision in our viewas the unit was underperforming Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK  Shares of Merck have also risen 31 5  this year so far  Merck s earnings estimates for 2019 have moved up 1 7  in the past 90 days Strong performance and positive regulatory updates related to its PD 1 inhibitor  Keytruda aided the company  In a very short span of time Keytruda has become Merck s largest product  It is already approved for use in 12 indications across eight different tumor types in the United States  In fact  the Keytruda development program is also progressing rapidly  Several regulatory decisions for new indications in the United States as well as in Europe are due in 2019  which  if approved  can further boost sales Key recent drug approvals for Merck include Steglatro and its fixed dose combinations for type II diabetes  two new HIV drugs   Pifeltro and Delstrigo   containing doravirine and Prevymis  letermovir  for cytomegalovirus  CVM  infection  Merck also gained several label expansion approvals for Keytruda and another cancer drug  Lynparza  which it markets in partnership with AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN   All these new drugs and line extension approvals can boost the company s pharmaceuticals sales in the future quarters Merck s animal health and vaccine products are also performing strongly and remain core growth drivers for Merck Merck also announced positive data from several late stage studies  mainly evaluating Keytruda for further line extensions  Merck also signed a co development deal with Japan s Eisai Co   Ltd for the latter s tyrosine kinase inhibitor  Lenvima  It also agreed to buy Viralytics Limited  an Australian pharmaceutical company that develops oncolytic immunotherapies for a range of cancers  which should strengthen its oncology portfolio Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   Shares of Novartis have risen 1  this year so far  Merck s earnings estimates for 2019 have gone up 0 5  in the past 60 days Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio  which continues to boost sales  The

Trade Idea 4  Buy the February 105 120 bull Risk Reversal  84 cents 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which with one trading day left in the year sees equity markets putting in a strong case for a reversal this week  They are still a long way from confirming a bottom though and not just a bear flag build 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its uptrend while Crude Oil may possibly pause in the downtrend  The US Dollar Index continues to consolidate sideways while US Treasuries pause in their uptrend  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets continue to show an easier path to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   IWM and QQQ  Their charts showed a strong bounce during the week but not enough to do anything to alter the current downtrends  Very short term uptrends are beginning  but it is too soon to declare a bottom  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

171906,393422,LLY,Incyte  INCY  Collaborates With Innovent For 3 Candidates,opinion,"Incyte   NASDAQ INCY   announced that it entered into a collaboration agreement with China based Innovent Biologics  Inc 
Both the companies have entered into the agreement through their respective subsidiaries  for the development of three clinical stage product candidates   pemigatinib  FGFR1 2 3 inhibitor   itacitinib  JAK1 inhibitor  and parsaclisib  PI3K  inhibitor   All the three candidates were discovered and developed by Incyte 
Financial Terms of the Agreement
Per the terms  Innovent will pay Incyte  40 million in cash  up front  In addition  Incyte is eligible to receive an additional  20 million in connection with the first investigational new drug  IND  application by Innovent in China  expected in 2019   In exchange  Innovent will receive the rights to develop and commercialize the three candidates in hematology and oncology in Mainland China  Hong Kong  Macau and Taiwan 
Moreover  Incyte will be eligible to receive up to  129 million in potential development and regulatory milestones  and up to  202 5 million in milestone achievements  Further  Incyte is eligible to receive tiered royalties from the high teens to the low twenties on future sales of products resulting from the collaboration  Meanwhile  Incyte retains an option to assist in the promotion of the three product candidates in China 
Strategic Value of the Transaction
Incyte expects Innovent s experienced leadership team and sizeable clinical network to expand the clinical program for itacitinib  pemigatinib and parsaclisib  A successful development of these candidates will strengthen Incyte s portfolio 
Our Take
The deal will provide Incyte with an influx of funds to further develop its pipeline  The company suffered a couple of pipeline setbacks  and hence is looking to strengthen the same 
The company suffered a huge setback with the failure of the phase III study  ECHO 301  as it was one of the most promising candidates for Incyte  evaluating epacadostat in combination with Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda  Further  the approval of the 4mg dose of baricitinib  which the company is co developing with Eli Lilly   NYSE LLY    is also doubtful 
Incyte s stock has lost 30 4  in the year so far compared with the  s 20  decline 

 
Incyte s lead drug Jakafi continues to maintain momentum for the company as the underlying patient demand for the drug remains strong  Incyte s sNDA  seeking a label expansion of Jakafi for the treatment of steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease  GVHD   has been accepted for Priority Review by the FDA 
The agency has set a target action date of Feb 24  2019  An approval will further boost sales  Meanwhile  the REACH2 and REACH3 studies  evaluating steroid refractory acute and steroid refractory chronic GVHD  respectively  are ongoing in collaboration with Novartis   NYSE NVS    Incyte plans to enroll more than 300 patients in each of these studies  Data from these studies are expected in 2019 
However  Incyte s dependence on Jakafi is a concern

171907,393423,LLY,Merck To Acquire Europe s Antelliq Group For  2 4 Billion,opinion,"Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of French animal health company Antelliq Group for a reported 2 1 billion euros   2 38 billion  in cash  Merck will also bear Antelliq s debt of 1 15 billion euros   1 30 billion   which will be repaid upon closure of this transaction 
The takeover is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019  subject to customary closing conditions and the clearance by antitrust and competition law authorities 
Antelliq is a leading provider of digital animal identification  traceability and monitoring services to the animal health industry  The company generated sales of 360 million euros during the 12 month period ending September 30 
The acquisition is a good strategic fit for Merck as this will help it gain an access to a broader customer base and strengthen its Animal Health segment 
Shares of Merck have rallied 35 9  so far this year  outperforming the  increase of 5  

Over the years  Merck has seen consistent growth in its Animal Health segment and the buyout of Antelliq will complement the same to generate long term growth  Merck s Animal Health products have contributed almost 10  to its total revenues 
During the first nine months of 2018  Merck s Animal Health segment generated sales of  3 17 billion  reflecting an increase of 9 7  year over year  This upside was driven by high sales of Merck s companion animal products and livestock products  particularly ruminant and poultry products 
Merck is actively seeking acquisitions to build its long term portfolio  The company inked several licensing deals in the past few years and targets to snap up more such collaborations in the future  The June 2018 takeover of Australian company Viralytics Limited added Cavatak  the latter s experimental oncolytic immunotherapy  to Merck s cancer pipeline 
Meanwhile  in July 2017  Merck signed a profit sharing contract with AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN    which added two key assets  Lynparza selumetinib  to its oncology pipeline  Similarly  in March 2018  Merck struck a deal with Japan s Eisai to co develop and commercialize the latter s tyrosine kinase inhibitor  Lenvima  for several types of cancer

171958,393474,LLY,4 Big Pharma Stocks To Add To Your Portfolio In December  ,opinion,"The performance of the drug biotech space has been mixed this year so far  The Zacks  industry  comprising some of the biggest drugmakers in the world  has gained 7 7  compared with the S P 500 s increase of 0 3  However  the riskier Zacks industry  which includes large as well as small biotech companies  has underperformed the S P 500  The biotech sector has declined 18 1  against the S P 500 s increase of 0 3   probably due to some pipeline setbacks faced by the industry  
Large  Cap Pharma and Biomed Genetics Versus S P 500  The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry features among the top 30  of the 255 Zacks ranked industries We believe that strong quarterly results  consistent increases in full year sales and earnings guidance  new product sales ramp up with rising demand  successful innovation and product line extensions  strong clinical study results  and frequent FDA approvals have helped these big drug giants to consistently do well this year despite broader macro issues as well as the industry s own challenges  Moreover  it is likely to perform well even if the global economy slows down next year  This is because it is a defensive growth sector  which is almost insulated from broader macroeconomic factors Importantly  mergers and acquisition activity is gaining momentum with the tax reform in place   Key acquisitions so far this year include Sanofi s   NYSE SNY   multi billion dollar buyouts of Ablynx and Bioverativ  Novartis    NYSE NVS   acquisition of AveXis and Roche s purchase of Foundation Medicine  Also  Glaxo s   NYSE GSK   buyout of Novartis  36 5  stake in their consumer health care joint venture was given a heads up by the investor community However  the sector faces its share of headwinds like government scrutiny of high drug prices  pricing and competitive pressure  generic competition for blockbuster treatments  slowdown in sales of some of the most high profile older drugs and major pipeline setbacks Drug pricing controversy was back in news this month after a Wall Street report stated that Pfizer   NYSE PFE   plans to increase the list prices of its 41 prescription drugs next year  The drug giant had put off such increases earlier this year as it faced criticism from President Donald Trump Nonetheless  we believe pipeline success  cost cutting  share buybacks  product launches  increased M A and collaboration activity and appropriate utilization of cash should keep the sector afloat through the rest of this year and next In this scenario  investing in stocks with a large market cap is a prudent move given the fact that they control a large portion of an industry  Given this backdrop  it makes sense to invest in some of the bigshot drugmakers Here we have highlighted four stocks that may prove to be good buys  All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and have seen their share price and earnings estimates rise this year  You can see  A chart showing the share price movement of all the four stocks this year so far is given below   Eli Lilly   Company   NYSE LLY  Lilly s earnings estimates have increased 2  for 2018 and 1  for 2019 over the past 60 days  The company s shares have increased 36 8  this year so far Lilly s new products like Trulicity  Taltz  Basaglar  Cyramza  Jardiance  Lartruvo and Verzenioare driving sales growth   The company is also on a strong footing in terms of its pipeline with several positive late stage data readouts this year along with various regulatory approvals  A key regulatory success for Lilly was the FDA approval of Emgality galcanezumab  a calcitonin gene related peptide  CGRP  antibody for migraine prevention  which could emerge as a significant contributor to long term growth Several key regulatory and pipeline events are expected in 2019  Any positive outcome will push up share price further This year  Lilly also added promising new assets through business development deals including pancreatic cancer candidate  pegilodecakin  which was added with the acquisition of ARMO Biosciences  Meanwhile  the separation of its animal health unit  Elanco  via an IPO  is a prudent decision in our viewas the unit was underperforming Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK  Shares of Merck have risen 37 3  this year so far  Merck s earnings estimates for 2018 have gone up 1 6  while that for 2019 have moved up by 1 7  in the past 60 days Strong performance and positive regulatory updates related to its PD 1 inhibitor  Keytruda aided the company  In a very short span of time Keytruda has become Merck s largest product  It is already approved for use in 12 indications across eight different tumor types in the United States  In fact  the Keytruda development program is also progressing rapidly  Several regulatory decisions for new indications in the United States as well as in Europe are due in 2019  which  if approved  can further boost sales Key recent approvals for Merck include Steglatro and its fixed dose combinations for type II diabetes  two new HIV drugs   Pifeltro and Delstrigo   containing doravirine and Prevymis  letermovir  for cytomegalovirus  CVM  infection  Merck also gained several label expansion approvals for Keytruda and another cancer drug Lynparza  which it markets in partnership with AstraZeneca  AZN  All these new drugs and line extension approvals can boost the company s pharmaceuticals sales in the future quarters Merck s animal health and vaccine products are also performing strongly and remain core growth drivers for Merck Merck also announced positive data from several late stage studies  mainly evaluating Keytruda for further line extensions  Merck also signed a co development deal with Japan s Eisai Co   Ltd for the latter s tyrosine kinase inhibitor  Lenvima It also agreed to buy Viralytics Limited  an Australian pharmaceutical company that develops oncolytic immunotherapies for a range of cancers which should strengthen its oncology portfolio GlaxoSmithKline plcGlaxo s shares have risen 16 2  year to date  Glaxo s earnings estimates for 2018 have gone up 1 4  while that for 2019 have moved up by 1 3  in the past 60 days We think Glaxo possesses one of the stronger late stage pipelines in large cap pharma and the U K  based giant has made significant progress with its late stage pipeline this year  Data from several of the late state pipeline programs are expected in 2019  The performance of Glaxo s new products has been encouraging  The three newest products   Trelegy Ellipta  Shingrix and Juluca   are doing well  particularly Shingrix  These three products coupled with buyout of Novartis  stake in the Consumer Healthcare JV have strengthened Glaxo s competitive position Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ  J J s shares have risen 4 9  this year  Its earnings estimates for 2018 have gone up 0 2  while that for 2019 have moved up by 0 6  in the past 60 days J J s Pharma segment is performing better than the market in 2018 despite the impact of biosimilars on sales of its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis medicine  Remicade  Also  the Medical Devices and Consumer units are seeing improving organic growth trends J J has also raised its full year organic sales growth outlook thrice this year  Though quite a few key products in J J s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition  we believe that new products in all segments  successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions will continue to drive top line growth  J J enjoys a robust multi year pipeline of new drugs and line extensions  Share buybacks and restructuring initiatives

171962,393478,LLY,Incyte  INCY  Announces Positive Data On Jakafi For GVHD,opinion,"Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   announced updated results from a pivotal phase II REACH1 study on lead drug Jakafi at the American Society of Hematology  ASH  Annual Meeting 2018 in San Diego  California 
The study evaluated Jakafi in combination with corticosteroids as a treatment for patients with acute graft versus host disease  GVHD  who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids 
In the trial  68  of patients had Grade III or Grade IV disease at baseline  illustrative of an at risk patient population  The updated data show that responses were observed irrespective of grade or steroid refractory  SR  criteria  Responses to Jakafi were rapid and durable  The median time to response was seven days and the median duration of response  DOR  for patients who had a minimum of six months of follow up was 345 days 
The study had earlier met its primary endpoint  demonstrating an overall response rate  ORR  of 55   n 39 71  at Day 28 along with a best overall response rate  BORR    patients achieving a response at any time point during the study   of 73   n 52 71  
The updated results further reinforce the potential of Jakafi as a therapeutic option in GVHD and specifically reinforce the durability of responses seen in acute GVHD patients treated with Jakafi 
Incyte had already submitted a supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  to the FDA on the basis of data from the REACH1 study  The FDA assigned priority review to the sNDA and set a target action date of Feb 24  2019 
Jakafi became the first FDA approved JAK inhibitor for any indication  It is also the first and the only product approved by the FDA for the treatment of rare blood cancers like myelofibrosis  November 2011  and polycythemia vera  December 2014  
Its label has been updated several times since approval  It was updated in June 2013 to include information on a new recommended dosing guidance for patients with low platelet count 
Incyte expects Jakafi revenues of  1 370  1 400 million in 2018  which is more than 20  growth in 2017 
The company is working to further expand Jakafi s label  Meanwhile  REACH2 and REACH3 studies  evaluating steroid refractory acute and steroid refractory chronic graft versus host disease  respectively  are ongoing in collaboration with Novartis   NYSE NVS    Incyte plans to enroll more than 300 patients in each of these studies  Data from these studies are expected in 2019 
Data from the phase II trial on the cream formulation of Jakafi in adult patients with atopic dermatitis were encouraging  Hence  Incyte is planning to initiate a global  pivotal phase III trial for this indication  Data from the randomized phase II trial on Jakafi cream in patients with vitiligo are expected in 2019 
Approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Incyte  In June 2018  Incyte and partner Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   announced that the FDA has approved the 2 mg dose of Olumiant  baricitinib   a once daily oral medication  for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis  RA  who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor  TNF  inhibitor therapies 
Incyte s stock has lost 29  in the year so far compared with the  s 13 8  decline 

 
The company suffered a huge setback with the failure of the phase III study  ECHO 301  as it was one of the most promising candidates for Incyte  evaluating epacadostat in combination with Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda  Further  the approval of the 4mg dose of baricitinib is also doubtful

171963,393479,LLY,Eli Lilly  LLY  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Eli Lilly  LLY   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Eli Lilly currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for LLY that show why this drugmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For LLY  shares are up 5 11  over the past week while the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is up 3 85  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 10 03  compares favorably with the industry s 3 59  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Eli Lilly have increased 10 3  over the past quarter  and have gained 35 39  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  6 21  and 4 36   respectively 
Investors should also take note of LLY s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  LLY is averaging 4 456 462 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with LLY 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost LLY s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 47 to  5 58 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that LLY is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Eli Lilly on your short list ",2018-12-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eli-lilly-lly-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200365266,200365266

Trulicity generated revenues of  816 2 million  up 55  year over year driven by higher demand in the United States and higher volumes in ex U S  markets Cyramza revenues were  198 4 million  up 1

revenues decreased 4  driven by lower realized prices Jardiance sales surged 31  to  166 9 million  driven by increased demand trends within the SGLT2 class of diabetes medicines in the United States and increased volume outside the United States Basaglar recorded revenues of  201 2 million  up 38  year over year  In the United States  sales rose 37   benefiting from higher demand  which offset the impact of lower realized prices  due to increased volume in Medicare Part D and  and unfavorable changes to estimates for rebates and discounts Taltz brought in sales of  263 9 million compared with  220 1 million in the previous quarter as U S  sales gained from higher demand  which made up for lower realized prices while ex U S  sales were driven by increased volume from new launches  Taltz was launched for the second indication of psoriatic arthritis in late 2017 early 2018 in both the United States and Europe  which contributed to sales growth in the quarter Lartruvo  olaratumab

growth of the CDK4 6 market though Verzenio gained market share in the quarter Animal Health segment sales rose 4  to  772 7 million as higher prices and higher volume offset currency headwinds Gross

costs  Total operating expenses  including research and development and marketing  selling and administrative expenses   as a percent of revenues  declined 270 basis points in the quarter to 48 8  due to the company s cost saving efforts While marketing  selling and administrative expenses rose 2   R D expense was flat in the quarter Adjusted effective tax rate was 15 1   lower than 18 9  in the

the mid point of the range  the guidance represents an increase of 30  over 2017 versus 27  previously In the fourth quarter  the company expects earnings in the range of  1 33    1 38  This represents a sequential decline from third quarter levels due to U S  generic competition for Cialis in September  higher R D costs in the fourth quarter  and launch costs for Emgality  Also  backing out the non controlling interest portion of Elanco profits is expected to have a 2 to 3 cents negative impact on earnings in the fourth quarter The lower range of the revenue guidance for 2018 was slightly upped to  24 3 billion to  24 5 billion from  24 0 billion to  24 5 billion expected previously The sales guidance increase was due to strong performance of pharmaceuticals products

171968,393484,LLY,Mallinckrodt  MNK  To Separate Generics   Branded Businesses,opinion,"Mallinckrodt plc   NYSE MNK   announced that it intends to spin off its Specialty Generics Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients business and Amitiza into a new company 
The company expects to create two independent  appropriately capitalized  and publicly traded companies   one focused on innovative specialty pharmaceutical brands  and the other primarily on niche specialty generic products and API manufacturing  The spin off is expected to be completed by the second half of 2019 
Generic Business as New Company
The new generic business company is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE   and will assume the Mallinckrodt name and ticker symbol  while the independent Specialty Pharmaceutical Brands company will be renamed later 
The separation is planned to be executed through a pro rata distribution of common stock to the shareholders that is generally tax free for U S  federal income tax purposes 
Given the decline in sales  Mallinckrodt has been exploring a range of strategic alternatives for its Specialty Generics business from 2016  The company believes that operating independently will allow this new company to more rapidly capitalize on its growth opportunities  Sales from the new Specialty Generics company exceeded  850 million on a reported basis  inclusive of the Amitiza product since Feb 14  2018  
Headquartered in St  Louis  MO  the company will have roughly 1 600 employees  The portfolio includes a leading acetaminophen business  a portfolio of both API and generic finished dose forms of controlled substances and other drugs  a niche specialty generics development portfolio  and a strong U S  manufacturing footprint along with Amitiza  The company expects to launch as many as five new products in 2019 
Profile of The Specialty Pharmaceutical Brands Company
Following the spin off  ordinary shares of the renamed Specialty Pharmaceutical Brands company will continue to trade on the NYSE  The company will maintain its global headquarters in Staines upon Thames  United Kingdom  and its principal U S  office 
This company includes H P  Acthar Gel  Inomax  Ofirmev and the Therakos immunotherapy platform along with a robust pipeline 
Top line results from both the completed rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial and multiple sclerosis registry for H P  Acthar Gel are expected by the first half of 2019  The company expects to complete enrollment in phase IV trials for uveitis and lupus on the drug  and in the phase II trial on Acthar in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the second half of 2019  
Top line results from the company s development program for CPP 1X sulindac are anticipated in the first quarter of 2019  and trial results for both StrataGraft viable engineered skin tissue and terlipressin are expected to be available in the second half 2019 
Our Take
The spin off of the generic business appears to be a step in the right direction as this will enable Mallinckrodt to focus better on the branded business  which promises potential 
Mallinckrodt has streamlined its business of late to focus better on its innovative medicines and therapies  The company has been involved in quite a few lawsuits for its alleged role in the current opioid epidemic in the United States through its marketing and promotion practices

171992,393508,LLY,Zafgen  ZFGN  Plunges As FDA Puts Hold On Diabetes Drug Trial,opinion,"Shares of clinical stage biopharmaceutical company Zafgen  Inc    NASDAQ ZFGN   slumped 40 5  after the company announced that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on the Investigational New Drug Application  IND  for its first U S  clinical trial of ZGN 1061 
ZGN 1061  the company s second generation  investigational MetAP2 inhibitor  is currently being evaluated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
The company received a letter from the FDA last week mentioning the clinical hold  citing the possibility of cardiovascular  CV  safety risk as seen in the company s prior compound 
The agency has outlined multiple potential paths for moving forward  including nonclinical or clinical options  to address these concerns in the ongoing development of the candidate 
As a result  Zafgen plans to assess these options and request a Type A meeting with the FDA to discuss further actions that can be taken regarding the program 
Meanwhile  Zafgen continues to advance its ongoing phase II trial of ZGN 1061 outside the United States  which includes a 1 8 mg dose cohort  Dosing in this trial was recently completed and no CV safety signals have been observed to date  Top line data from the trial are expected early 2019 
Previously  results from 12 weeks showed that ZGN 1061 met all primary endpoints  demonstrating proof of concept efficacy with robust A1C lowering effects  and a favorable safety and tolerability profile generally comparable to placebo 
Zafgen now expects the cash runway to extend through calendar year 2020  given the delay of additional clinical development for the candidate 
Zafgen s shares have gained 17 1  in the year so far  compared with the  decline of 7 7  

 
It has been a bumpy ride for the company of late  Earlier in 2016  the company terminated the development of its lead candidate  beloranib  which was in phase III development for the treatment of hyperphagia and obesity in patients with Prader Willi syndrome and phase II development for the treatment of obesity in patients with hypothalamic injury associated obesity 
We note that CV disease is the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes mellitus and quite a few of diabetes drugs are linked to adverse CV events  Hence  there has been a lot of emphasis on drugs with a better CV profile 
In 2017  the FDA expanded Novo Nordisk s   NYSE NVO   diabetes drug Victoza s label to reduce the risk of major adverse CV events  like heart attack  stroke and CV death  in adults with type 2 diabetes and established CV disease  Eli Lilly s   NYSE LLY   Jardiance is also indicated to reduce the risk of CV death in adults with type 2 diabetes

172039,393555,LLY,Eli Lilly Earnings Preview  New Drugs And New LOEs,opinion,"Judging by the stock s performance in 2018  investors seem to be happy with Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  CEO David Ricks  progress on restructuring and delivering growth  Shares are up just over 26  year to date  beating the S P 500 s  SPX  1  increase and the S P Healthcare Select Sector s  IXV  6 7  climb 
The next update for investors and analysts is LLY s third quarter earnings  scheduled for before market open on Tuesday  Nov  6 
For Q3  LLY is expected to report adjusted EPS of  1 35 on revenue of  6 1 billion  according to third party consensus analyst estimates  In the same quarter last year  the company reported adjusted EPS of  1 05 on revenue of  5 66 billion  LLY has met or beat earnings estimates in the past six quarters  with the company beating by the widest margins in its two latest reports 
Analysts and investors are again likely to be looking for ongoing progress in CEO Ricks  progress on increasing manufacturing efficiencies and cutting costs  In Q2  operating expenses decreased 1  to  2 99 billion 
Within those costs  the company said it had cut marketing  selling and administrative expenses by 4   while research and development expenses were up 5   so management is clearly shifting focus to developing new drugs 
Pipeline and New Drugs
In Q2 2018  LLY s newer drugs Trulicity  Basaglar  Taltz and Verzenio were the main drivers of growth  As it takes time for newer drugs to ramp up  analysts and investors are likely to be looking to see how these drugs have continued to perform 
Just this morning  LLY announced that Trulicity  a type 2 diabetes treatment  demonstrated superiority in the reduction of cardiovascular events in its REWIND study  As many saw the results from this trial as a short term risk for the company  and a potential driver for Trulicity sales  management is likely to provide some more information about this study on tomorrow s call 
Trulicity has been the company s best selling drug lately and generated sales of  780 million in Q2 2018  up 62  year over year  Many of the LLY s other new drugs are designed to address different aspects of diabetes  Basaglar  a long acting insulin  had  201 8 million in sales  a 133  year over year increase  Jardiance s  another diabetes related drug  growth slowed down in the second quarter  up 43  year over year to  147 million 
Immunology has been another area of medicine LLY has said it s committed to  LLY s blockbuster drug within this category is Taltz  which treats plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis  Sales of this drug increased 59  year over year in Q2 2018  to  220 million  Management said it plans to run head to head trials with competitor Johnson   Johnson s  JNJ  Tremfya to try to demonstrate superiority  If it succeeds  that would be one factor that would help sway doctors when writing prescriptions 
Loss of Exclusivity on Cialis
Loss of exclusivity  LOE  has always been a concern for drug makers and LLY has had a series of drugs that have lost protections in recent years  In Q2 2018  the LOE for Effient  Strattera  Cymbalta  Zyprexa  Evista and Axiron negatively impacted volume growth by 4 5   according to the company 
Cialis is one of the latest of LLY s blockbuster drugs that is currently looking at more competition  Management had attributed some loss of sales to Teva s  TEVA  generic sildenafil coming on the market in December 2017  That loss of sales is a trend the company expects to continue as generic tadalafil  the same compound as Cialis  was launched at the end of September by TEVA 
With very little time between TEVA s launch and the end of the quarter  analysts have indicated they aren t expecting a significant impact at this time  However  they might be looking for more information from management now that they ve seen a few weeks of sales 
In 2017  LLY reported that Cialis generated  2 32 billion in sales  roughly 10  of the company s revenue and its second highest selling drug at the time  In the first half of 2018  Cialis sales declined 11  year over year to  1 03 billion 
Elanco IPO
Tomorrow s report will be the first one since LLY spun off its animal health unit Elanco  ELAN   The IPO has been one factor for analysts  positivity towards LLY lately  ELAN was initially priced at  24 per share in its IPO and shares are now trading around  33  LLY sold 20  of its stake in ELAN in the offering  and management said it plans to divest the rest of it over time 
Originally  they had indicated they might look to divest the stake as early as 2019  so analysts are likely to be looking for more information about how LLY plans to go about exiting that business 

2018 Break Out  After trading sideways for several years  LLY has had a big breakout in 2018 and is up 26  year to date  The stock is sitting close to  104  a level of support the stock has been bouncing off of since the end of August 2018  LLY is compared to the S P Healthcare Select Sector Index  IXV  teal line  and the S P 500  SPX  purple line   Chart source  thinkorswim  by TD Ameritrade  Not a recommendation  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Eli Lilly Options Trading Activity
LLY has had a big run in 2018  The stock went from a February low of  73 69 to hit a new all time high of  116 61 at the start of October  Shares were up  4 early on today after the company announced study results this morning  putting the stock about  6 away from its all time high 
Around tomorrow s earnings release  options traders have priced in a 3  stock move in either direction  according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim  platform  Implied volatility was at the 76th percentile as of this morning

Looking at the Dec  21 monthly expiration  both the 110 and 115 strike price on the call side have been more active  while the 105 strike has seen the heaviest trading on the put side

U S  stocks moved modestly higher in morning trading Tuesday  the same day millions of citizens are heading to the polls to cast votes in the midterm elections 
Wall Street appears to be handicapping a Democratic shift in the House of Representatives  as most opinion polls are calling for the party to take control of the chamber  Those same polls are also predicting that the Republicans will retain their lead in the Senate  meaning we could soon have a split Congress 
Interestingly enough  stocks have historically performed better during periods of Congressional gridlock  and if anything  investors will be happy to move past the uncertainty of the elections themselves  Plus  many of the same fundamental tailwinds and headwinds affecting equity prices will remain  regardless of the federal government s s partisan makeup 
And as the votes roll in  so too are the Q3 earnings reports  This morning was a busy session for pre market reports in the broader medical space  with the likes of CVS   NYSE CVS    Eli Lilly   NYSE LLY    and Regeneron   NASDAQ REGN   filing before the bell 
Results from these companies were relatively positive  although mixed in some areas  CVS topped estimates on both lines and said its merger with Aetna  NYSE AET  would be complete by Thanksgiving  Eli Lilly surpassed EPS projections  and Regeneron crushed profit expectations but missed revenue estimates 
Ryan covers all of these reports and gives his perspective on how Wall Street is feeling about the midterms on today s show 
Later  he checks in with Dave Bartosiak to continue chatting about the near term outlook for stocks after the midterms  Dave starts by showing an interesting technical trend that has developed in the Nasdaq   where bulls and bears have battled to keep the stock above and below certain moving averages and indicators 
Dave also suggests that part of this battle has to do with the event risk of the midterms  so he explains how and why Wall Street prices in risk when facing these uncertainties 
Finally  Dave highlights Turtle Beach   NASDAQ HEAR    which is scheduled to announce its latest quarterly results after the bell  He touches on the sentiment surrounding the stock and recommends a specific options play for those who are optimistic about the gaming headset maker  Make sure to check out the show to hear more

172121,393637,LLY,Pfizer  Can Pfizer Grow To Targets With LOE Headwinds Ahead ,opinion,"Can Pfizer  NYSE PFE  Grow with Several Upcoming Revenue Headwinds 
The key topic for Pfizer is whether the company will be able to grow revenue in the mid single digits going into the early 2020s  The company faces between  7 billion to  9 billion in loss of exclusivity  LOE  revenue headwinds from now until 2025  Notable headwinds include LOEs from Enbrel and Lyrica  and recent supply issues in its sterile injectables 
Management believes they can achieve mid single digit revenue growth  or more  starting in 2020  when the LOE headwinds begin to subside  Given Pfizer s broad portfolio  the company will need a number of existing drugs to outperform  and help from the pipeline  Several key drugs should generate higher than average company growth  but will likely need some of its label expansion efforts to work out to provide more upside  Consensus estimates suggests analysts do not expect the company to hit mid single digit growth rates currently 

Headwinds include Lyrica  Enbrel  and Sterile Injectables
Analysts are skeptical given the sizable headwinds ahead for the company  The company will face LOEs in Lyrica and Enbrel  and is still resolving sterile injectable manufacturing issues 
Lyrica  Lyrica is used to treat several indications  including epilepsy  neuropathic pain  and generalized anxiety disorder  The drug made up roughly 10  of total sales in 2017 despite having lost product exclusivity in European markets in 2014  The company will lose US patent protection at the end of 2018  and management expects a generic to come to market by mid 2019  As a result  analysts model a significant sales erosion in 2019  Lyrica is expected to represent a significant portion of the total LOE headwind  although management is hopeful that they will be able to return to growth once they annualize the Lyrica generic launch in 2020 
Enbrel  Enbrel is a blockbuster drug that treats a number of indications for arthritis and psoriasis  Drug sales have seen double digit declines outside of the US as biosimilar generics in Europe have grown over time  Analysts expect Enbrel to continue to decline  putting pressure on the Inflammation and Immunology segment  I I  for several years  Xeljanz  another drug in the I I segment  detailed later in this article   could potentially offset declines here and turn the segment positive if the drug is able to achieve management s expectations 

Sterile Injectables  Pfizer s sterile injectables have been another source of revenue headwind for the company  Hospira faced manufacturing issues and lost roughly  500 million in sales in 2017  In 2018  these issues have persisted  and the segment declined a further 11  in 1Q18  Management has a remediation plan in place to upgrade its facilities and to bring on additional supply in 2019  They expect further declines in 2Q18 before turning to growth in the second half of the year  bringing the full year to flattish growth  If management is able to completely resolve these issues  the sterile injectables business could turn to growth beyond 2018 

Ibrance  Xtandi  Xeljanz  and Biosimilars Could Drive Upside to Estimates
Given the revenue headwinds  Pfizer will likely need to execute on a number of label expansions for key drugs to hit targets  Biosimilar success and the pipeline also represent areas of upside 
Ibrance  Ibrance is a oral combination treatment for women with a specific kind of metastatic breast cancer  There are about 150 000 women in the US with metastatic breast cancer  Within that group  about 60  have the subtype that Ibrance works with  HR   HER2    Ibrance is used in combination with hormone therapy to treat metastatic breast cancer 
Ibrance should continue to see strong growth in the coming years  with analysts expecting growth of up to  7 billion in sales by 2022  from 2017 sales of  3 billion  

One of the primary drivers of growth  and potential sources of upside  is the expansion of the market for CDK4 6 inhibitor treatment on metastatic breast cancer  The CDK4 6 inhibitor market is roughly  10 billion in size  and is expected to grow significantly  Ibrance was the first CDK4 6 inhibitor with its approval in 2015  There are two other CDK4 6 inhibitors on the market   Eli Lilly s  NYSE LLY  Verzenio and Novartis   NYSE NVS  Kisqali  both approved in 2017  CDK4 6 inhibitor treatment is still in its early to mid stages of adoption  Currently  only about 60  of newly diagnosed HR   HER2  patients will receive a CDK inhibitor agent for first line usage  Given the strength of data  oncologists believe penetration will continue to grow as physicians become more aware of the drugs 
International expansion should also drive near term growth  Ibrance sales in the US has tapered over the last several quarters  and management believes that new launches in the EU and Japan should fuel growth moving forward 

A significant longer term driver  and potential source of upside  is the potential expansion into earlier stage breast cancer  The company currently has several trials  PALLAS and PENELOPE B  that are expected to produce readouts some time in 2020  The patient population size here is significantly larger than in late stage breast cancer and therefore could meaningfully expand Ibrance sales  Furthermore  the company has several other trials looking into other areas of expansion  including neoadjuvant breast cancer  readout expected in the fall of 2018  and HER2   Note that Pfizer recently announced that Ibrance  narrowly  missed its secondary overall survival  OS  endpoint in its PALOMA 3 trial  However  investors do not view this as a significant setback 
Xtandi  Xtandi is used to treat advanced prostrate cancer  While the drug has done well for Pfizer  there are some concerns around upcoming sales for several reasons  First  Xtandi sales recently missed consensus estimates in the last quarter  Second  investors now see increased competition on the horizon with a potential Zytiga generic launch in 4Q18 and Johnson and Johnson s Erleada launch  as the drug was approved earlier this year  
However  management expects the drug to continue to grow in the face of these headwinds  Management cites Xtandi s competitive advantage over the competition   its ability to be dosed without steroids 
Additionally  the company is pursuing a number of line extensions  In February  Pfizer released PROSPER trial results for non metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  nmCRPC  in February that showed strong results   Pfizer noted that the median metastasis free survival was 36 6 months compared to 14 7 months for ADT alone  The company has a PDUFA date coming up in July  and investors now widely expect Xtandi to receive approval for nmCRPC and launch in 2H18 
Longer term  Pfizer is also pursuing the hormone sensitive prostrate cancer indications  Pfizer expects metastatic hormone sensitive results in early 2020 and non metastatic hormone sensitive results in early 2021  Receiving approval for these adjacent indications will be key to driving upside to Xtandi consensus estimates  and investors will therefore be on the lookout for positive progress 
Xeljanz  Xeljanz is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis  Xeljanz sales has ramped at a slower than expected rate  but has eventually grown to a sizable  1 3 billion in 2017  Like Xtandi and Ibrance  sales were recently slowed in 1Q18 due to supply issues 
Looking ahead  management believes the company is still on track to hit its full year targets  The drug recently won approval for ulcerative colitis  a chronic inflammatory bowel disease  and management believes this can add an additional  1 billion in sales  Investors will be watching for signs of outperformance within this indication 

Biosimilars  While biosimilars represent a smaller portion of Pfizer sales  the area represents a potential longer term growth opportunity for the company  Key biosimilars include Inflectra  Nivestim  and Retacrit  Inflectra in particular has been slow to gain share from Johnson   Johnson s  NYSE JNJ  Remicade since its launch  as share still sits in the single digits  However  the estimated price discount is now much higher since launch  and analysts believe share gains could accelerate 
Beyond Inflectra  management plans to launch an additional five biosimilars within the next two years  Of note  Pfizer received a CRL on Herceptin in April due to technical issues  and believes the issues can be resolved in time to meet its original launch expectations 
Pipeline  While this article focused primarily on existing drugs  the pipeline represents an obvious additional area of potential upside  In May  the company noted that they had 96 projects in the pipeline  with 28 in phase 3 and 12 in registration  Of the 96 projects  management believes that potentially 25 30 of these could receive approvals through 2022  with up to 15 having blockbuster potential  One key drug to watch is Tafamidis  which management highlighted as the most risky asset  The company will need to execute on this front in order to increase the odds that sales grow in the mid single digits after 2020 

A Quick Note on Pricing
Trump recently threatened to stop pharmaceutical companies from pursuing price increases  and has even singled out Pfizer for its recent pricing actions  While his call out received media attention and a Pfizer response to not raise pricing  investors were already discounting the back and forth as an optical PR move  The weighted average pricing net of rebates  because rebates also grow each year  grew by 3  last year and was flat in 1Q18  according to Pfizer  Pfizer stock is largely flattish since Trump s tweet on July 9th ",2018-07-11,The Non-Consensus,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pfizer-can-pfizer-grow-to-targets-with-loe-headwinds-ahead-200330236,200330236
172122,393638,LLY,Why Pfizer s Q2 Earnings Results Might Be Weaker Than You d Like,opinion,"Don t get your hopes up for a blowout second quarter from the big pharma company 
When Pfizer  NYSE PFE  reported its first quarter results in May  there were things to like    but things to dislike  too  The big pharma company s earnings soared and topped Wall Street expectations  Revenue  however  came in lower than the consensus analysts  estimate 
What should investors expect when Pfizer announces its second quarter earnings results on July 31  I suspect the drugmaker s numbers might be weaker than you d like them to be  Here are three reasons why 
1  Same old headwinds will still be blowing
Pfizer s biggest challenges in the first quarter came from declining sales of products that have lost exclusivity and continued product shortages with its sterile injectables business  Don t count on improvement on either of these fronts 
It wouldn t surprise me if these headwinds hurt Pfizer even more in Q2 than they did in Q1 because of Viagra  Last year  the erectile dysfunction drug made more revenue in the second quarter than it did in the first quarter  Pfizer reported a 45  year over year decline in sales in its last quarter following Viagra s loss of exclusivity at the end of 2017  I think the year over year drop could look even worse when the company announces its Q2 results 
Those sterile injectables product shortages probably won t get any better  either  In Pfizer s Q1 conference call  COO Albert Bourla said that the company expected sales to fall again in the second quarter 
2  Question marks for key blockbusters
The top three growth engines for Pfizer right now are Ibrance  Eliquis  and Xeljanz  However  in the first quarter  sales growth for both Ibrance and Xeljanz was slower than analysts projected  The big question for Pfizer in Q2 is whether these blockbuster drugs will deliver growth at expected levels 
When asked about the relative underperformance in Q1 for Ibrance  Pfizer CEO Ian Read replied that the company thought that it was due to  inventory movements   In his introductory comments during the Q1 conference call  Read said that revenue for both Ibrance and Xeljanz were negatively impacted by  customer buying patterns   I believe these explanations are correct and could be lesser issues in the second quarter 
At the same time  though  I wouldn t discount the possibility that Pfizer s growth could be affected by competition from newer products on the market  Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY   for example  recently reported Q2 sales of nearly  58 million for breast cancer drug Verzenio  Novartis  NYSE NVS  announced that its breast cancer drug Kisquali generated sales of  59 million in the second quarter  Both Verzenio and Kisquali compete directly against Ibrance 
3  Fewer one time boosts than in Q1
There s one area where Pfizer is almost guaranteed to see a worse performance in the second quarter than it did in Q1  The company s other income in the first quarter was around  320 million  but Pfizer projects total other income in 2018 of  400 million  It s a mathematical certainty that Q2 other income will be lower if Pfizer s full year estimate is accurate 
This large amount of other income in the first quarter stemmed primarily from one time milestone payments of around  115 million and  110 million in unrealized gains on equity securities  In the second quarter of 2017  Pfizer had  66 million in other income  Unless the company records nearly all of the remaining other income it expects for the rest of 2018 in Q2  both year over year and quarter over quarter comparisons will be negative 
This isn t a huge deal  However  a few million here and a few million there can add up  With continued challenges from sinking sales for drugs that have lost exclusivity and sterile injectables product shortages  along with uncertainties for Ibrance and Xeljanz  fewer one time boosts could make a difference in whether Pfizer meets or misses Q2 estimates 
But better days lie ahead
It might sound like I m down on Pfizer  but I m not  I think the company could announce disappointing second quarter results    although there s at least an outside chance of a pleasant upside surprise  However  whatever Pfizer reports in Q2 probably won t matter much in the big scheme of things 
What really matters for Pfizer is its long term prospects  I d argue that the big pharma company looks pretty good on that score  The negative issues that Pfizer faces right now should become less of a drag over the next few years  The company s pipeline is probably more promising than it s ever been  In the meantime  Pfizer continues to generate strong cash flow and keeps on paying a dividend that should bring smiles to investors  faces 
Sure  there are things to dislike about Pfizer  Some of those things will likely be quite evident when the company provides its second quarter update  But I think there s a lot more to like about this stock over the long run than there is to dislike ",2018-07-30,Keith Speights,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-pfizers-q2-earnings-results-might-be-weaker-than-youd-like-200334461,200334461

 These clinical trial results are unprecedented  and the impressive blood glucose and weight reductions seen may lead to a new treatment option for people with diabetes   explained Juan Frias of the National Research Institute 
Looking at the LLY chart below  with regard to its market cycles  we see the stock as beginning the rising phase of its current  minor  cycle  It is still early in the cycle and so we see a bit more potential upside 
However  this stock has been a runaway train  and so we believe a pullback is likely  Given its positive momentum  a drop to near  106 would likely be a buying opportunity

172125,393641,LLY,The Pharmaceuticals Industry Stock Outlook  A Steady Path Ahead,opinion,The Zacks industry comprises some of the largest global companies that develop multi million dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas such as neuroscience  cardiovascular and metabolism  rare diseases immunology and oncology  Some of these companies also make vaccines  animal health  medical devices and consumer related healthcare products  All these companies invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines as well as line extensions of their already marketed drugs  Here are the three major themes in the industry Demand driven growth in sales of new products  successful innovation and product line expansion  strong clinical study results  frequent FDA approvals  continued strong performance of key products  growing demand for drugs  especially for rare to treat diseases  an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors driving this industry s growth  A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations  which are escalating costs and slowing down innovation  are the other positives  Mergers and acquisitions  M A  activity is on the rise following the tax reform  Big players are on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines technology  Meanwhile  in licensing deals continue to be popular with several big companies collaborating with smaller and mid sized players with promising mid to late stage pipeline candidates or interesting technology  These deals make sense for both the larger companies and the smaller ones  While the large companies are able to boost their pipelines with promising candidates  the smaller ones gain access to a non dilutive source of funds that allows them to continue investing in their pipelines  Headwinds for the industry include government scrutiny of high drug prices  pricing pressure  increasing competition  rising competition related to biosimilar and generic  a slowdown in growth of legacy products and major pipeline setbacks Overall  we believe that pipeline success  cost cutting  share buybacks  product launches  increased M A and collaboration activities should keep the sector afloat  going forward Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group s  is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  76  which places it at the top 30  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  In the past year  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 5 5  while it is up 3 1  for 2019 Before we present a few large drug stocks that are well positioned to outperform the market

invest in new technologies  increase investments in personalized medicines and seek external partners and collabora tors for complementary strengths The sector may face some volatility due to the drug pricing issue  pricing re imbursement pressure  increasing competition  slowdown in legacy product sales  loss of patent exclusivity of some key drugs and pipeline related setbacks However  pipeline success in innovative and important therapeutic areas  cost cutting  share buybacks  product launches  increased M A activity and appropriate utilization of cash should keep the sector on a strong

172303,393819,LLY,Is Eli Lilly And Company  LLY  Stock A Good Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lilly has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Lilly s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Lilly has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lilly stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lilly has a P S ratio of about 3 6  This is marginally higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Nonetheless  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Also  LLY is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lilly currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Lilly a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Lilly is just 1 5  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Lilly might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B  This gives LLY a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen nine upward and one downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 5 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 3 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus    Even though Lilly has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLilly is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 18   should boost investor confidence However over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Lilly The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s

several drugs also contributed 2  to sales growth in the quarter  Foreign exchange rate also had a favorable impact of 1  New products drove 12  of volume growth and generated over  1 4 billion in revenues  representing nearly 23  total revenues  up from 22  in the previous quarter  On the other hand  the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta  Strattera  Effient  Axiron  Zyprexa and Evista hurt volumes by 540 basis points While U S  revenues grew 6  to  3 42 billion  ex U S  revenues rose 8  to  2 74 billion Pharmaceutical revenues rose 9  in the quarter  However  worldwide competitive

 up 6  to  192 8 million  and Erbitux  up 10  to  168 9 million   Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter Humalog sales declined 5  to  782 2 million due to lower realized prices in the United States Alimta sales declined 3  to  525 2 million  reflecting lower demand in ex U S  markets due to competitive pressure and loss of exclusivity in certain countries  However  sales of Alimta increased 1  in the United States due to increased volume  partially offset by lower realized prices Zyprexa sales declined 1  to  152 2 million due to loss of exclusivity in Japan Cialis sales declined 12  to  597 4 million hurt by worldwide lower demand Strattera sales declined 60  to  98 3 million  Effient sales declined 56  to  62 3 million in the quarter  Both the drugs saw

declined 6  to  790 9 million as worldwide competitive pressure continued to hurt sales in the segment Food animal products revenues declined 8  hurt by market access pressure and competitive pressure

retain the business Gross Margin   Operating IncomeAdjusted gross margin of 76 5  in the quarter decreased 90 basis points as manufacturing efficiencies and higher realized prices were offset by

130 bps Operating income increased 20  year over year to  1 46 billion due to lower operating costs  Total operating expenses  including research and development and marketing  selling and

Lartruvo  Verzenio and Olumiant are expected to drive revenues  In 2018  Animal Health revenues are expected to be flat to slightly up versus 2017  After being slightly negative in the first half  Animal Health revenues are expected to improve in the second half supported by new product launches Expected Impact of U S  Tax ReformAs a result of the new tax laws  Lilly anticipates paying taxes on overseas cash and earnings of approximately  3 6 billion  With increased access to foreign cash following the U S  tax reforms  Lilly believes now it will have more than  9 billion of extra funds across its global operations  which it does not intend to hold for a long time  Over 2018 and 2019  Lilly plans to use this cash first to support its products pipeline  then for business development via in licensing or acquisition and finally to return to shareholders via dividend and share buybacks  It also plans to use roughly  2 billion of repatriated cash to reduce its gross debt level

Per the company s press release  the incidence of bladder cancer in Japan is anticipated to increase over time  Approximately  66 000 patients are detected with bladder cancer in the country with 21 000 new cases diagnosed in 2015  Hence  the market opportunity for Keytruda is fairly wide in the country 
Keytruda fetched in global sales of  2 5 billion in the first nine months of 2017  up 173  year over year  Sales continue to be driven by the launch of new indications globally  Keytruda sales in the United States gained particularly from a strong momentum in the new indication of the first line therapy of lung cancer  Outside the United States  Keytruda sales were primarily driven by the melanoma indication

172416,393932,LLY,Pfizer Reports Updated Data From Phase III Study On Ibrance,opinion,"Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   announced encouraging new data of a post hoc analysis from a phase III study  evaluating the combination of its breast cancer drug  Ibrance  palbociclib   with Novartis    NYSE NVS   Femara  letrozole  for the first line treatment of ER   HER2  metastatic breast cancer 
Notably  data from the study will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium  SABCS  on Dec 8 
Ibrance is approved in the United States for treating HR  HER2  advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as an initial endocrine based therapy in postmenopausal women  It is also approved to be used with AstraZeneca s   NYSE AZN   Faslodex in women with disease progression following the endocrine therapy  Presently  Ibrance is approved in more than 75 countries 
Pfizer s shares are up 9 9  so far this year  comparing unfavorably with the  s return of 16 5  

 
In the PALOMA 2 study  it was seen that a combination of Ibrance and Femara led to an improvement in progression free survival  PFS  or the time before recurrence of tumor growth by more than a year compared with Femara plus placebo  In other words  the study showed that the median PFS for women treated with Ibrance plus Femara was 27 6 months compared with 14 5 months for the Femara placebo combination arm  thereby indicating a 44  reduction in the risk of disease progression 
PALOMA 2 had enrolled 666 women in all from 186 global sites across 17 countries  The updated results and the safety profile from the post hoc analysis are consistent with the primary data from the PALOMA 2 study  reported last November 
We remind investors that Ibrance in combination with Femara was cleared in the United States under an accelerated approval in February 2015 for treatment of HR  HER2  advanced or metastatic breast cancer  In April  Pfizer received a regular approval for the drug based on data from the PALOMA 2 trial  Also  around the same time  Ibrance s label was expanded covering a few more indications to be used in combination with any aromatase inhibitor and not just Femara 
Pfizer is exploring the possibility of expanding Ibrance into recurrent and subsequent early breast cancer as well as several non breast cancer indications like pancreatic and head and neck cancers 
Ibrance has been generating strong sales as a key driver of the company s top line  The drug logged sales of  2 41 billion in the first nine months of 2017  up 61  year over year  On successful label expansion  the drug should reap in more revenues 
However  in the breast cancer market  competition for Ibrance has increased with recent launches for Eli Lilly s   NYSE LLY   Verzenio and Novartis  Kisqali Pfizer  Inc  Price

172431,393947,LLY,Merck  MRK  Q3 Earnings Top  Sales Lag  Keytruda Stays Strong,opinion,"Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   reported third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of  1 11 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 03 by 7 8   Earnings rose 3 7  year over year 
Among other items  adjusted earnings exclude a charge related to its new oncology collaboration with Britain s AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN   
Revenues for the quarter declined 2  year over year to  10 33 billion  Sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  10 51 billion  Currency movement positively impacted revenues by 1   Excluding currency impact  sales declined 3  year over year 
Lost sales in some markets due to a network cyber attack in June hurt the top line in the quarter  Meanwhile  unfavorable comparisons with the third quarter of last year hurt sales 
Quarter in Detail
The Pharmaceutical segment generated revenues of  9 2 billion  down 3   down 4  excluding Fx impact  year over year as continued strong sales of PD 1 inhibitor  Keytruda were offset by lower sales of key products like diabetes drug Januvia and HPV vaccine Gardasil Gardasil 9  As in the previous quarters  loss of market exclusivity for several drugs also hurt the top line 
Keytruda brought in sales of  1 05 billion in third quarter 2017  up 21  sequentially and 194  year over year  Sales continued to be driven by the launch of new indications globally  Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the indication of first line lung cancer 
Keytruda is already approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer  melanoma  head and neck cancer  classical Hodgkin s lymphoma and bladder cancer 
Meanwhile  the Keytruda development program significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and an additional indication in Europe  Key recent approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer  advanced microsatellite instability high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly s   NYSE LLY   cancer drug Alimta  pemetrexed  and carboplatin  pem carbo  in lung cancer 
The new approvals have expanded the patient population  which we believe drove sales in the third quarter 
Zepatier brought in sales of  468 million  down from  517 million in the previous quarter 
Bridion  sugammadex  Injection generated sales of  185 million in the quarter  up 33  year over year  driven by the strong uptake following its launch in the United States 
Meanwhile  combined sales of Remicade  lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region   Cubicin  lost patent protection in the United States in June 2016   Zetia  lost market exclusivity in the United States in December 2016  and Vytorin  lost U S  exclusivity in April 2017  declined  800 million in the quarter 
Remicade sales declined 31  to  214 million in the quarter  Merck markets the branded version of Remicade outside the United States while Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   markets the rheumatoid arthritis drug within the country 
Cubicin sales plunged 71  to  91 million in the quarter  The Zetia Vytorin franchise recorded sales of  462 million  down 51  due to loss of exclusivity for both Zetia and Vytorin 
Sales of Isentress and the Januvia Janumet  diabetes  franchise also declined in the quarter  The Januvia Janumet franchise recorded sales of  1 53 billion in the quarter  down 2  from the year ago quarter due to continued pricing pressure 
Isentress sales declined 17  in the quarter to 310 million  Lower volumes demand due to competitive pressure hurt sales of Isentress 
Gardasil Gardasil 9 sales declined 22  to  675 million  The production shutdown following the cyber attack resulted in supply constraints  which adversely impacted sales in the United States  However sales rose in Europe  boosted by the addition of sales from the terminated vaccine joint venture with Sanofi   NYSE SNY   and in Asia Pacific backed by strong demand 
Merck s Animal Health segment generated revenues of  1 billion  up 16   up 14  excluding Fx impact  from the year ago quarter  primarily driven by higher sales of companion animal products  primarily Bravecto  companion animal vaccines and contribution from the Vall e acquisition 
Gross Margins   Costs Rise                                                   
Adjusted gross margin came in at 76   up 70 basis points  bps  from the year ago quarter   attributable to favorable effects of product mix  which offset the costs related to the cyber attack 
Marketing and administrative  M A  expenses increased 1  to  2 4 billion in the reported quarter  Research and development  R D  spend increased 8  to  1 8 billion in the quarter 
2017 Guidance
Merck raised its previously issued adjusted earnings guidance while raising its sales guidance marginally   for the second time this year  The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of  3 91  3 97 compared with  3 76  3 88 expected earlier  The adjusted earnings guidance includes less than 1  negative impact from currency fluctuation  comparing favorably with approximately 1  previously 
Revenues are expected in the range of  40 0 billion    40 5 billion compared with the earlier forecast of  39 4 billion    40 4 billion  including negative currency impact of less than 1    versus approximately 1  previously  
Operating expenses are still expected to increase year over year at a mid single digit rate  The increased costs are attributable to increased investments behind the ongoing launches  remediation expenses related to the cyber attack  as well as additional R D costs associated with the new oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca 
Our Take
Merck s third quarter results were mixed as the company beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales  Despite a relatively weaker sales performance  Merck raised its previously issued adjusted earnings guidance for 2017 and also upped its sales guidance marginally 
Shares were down 2  in pre market trading in response to lower sales of Merck s multiple medicines  This year so far  Merck s shares have underperformed the   Merck s shares have risen 5 3  this year comparing unfavorably with a 16 1  increase for the industry 

All eyes were on the performance of Keytruda  which is being touted as a key long term growth driver for Merck  The drug continued its strong performance with sales crossing the  1 billion mark this quarter 
However  the company has suffered some notable pipeline setbacks this year  Earlier this month  Merck decided not to seek approval for its CETP inhibitor anacetrapib for cholesterol management as its clinical profile was not strong enough to support regulatory filings  Last month  Merck discontinued development of two of its HCV programs saying that the HCV market is becoming extremely crowded  Also  three combination studies of Keytruda for multiple myeloma were placed on clinical hold following reports of death in the Keytruda groups in July

172439,393955,LLY,J J Presents Positive New Data For Diabetes Drug Invokana,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   presented new data from a large CANVAS outcomes program on its type II diabetes drug  Invokana  SGLT2 inhibitor   demonstrating an improved renal outcome  The data was presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in California and published in the Circulation 
So far this year  Johnson   Johnson s share price has increased 21 1   comparing favorably with the 14 4  rally of the  it belongs to 

This new analysis of CANVAS showed a reduction in the risk of the composite renal endpoint in both patient groups   with a history of CV disease  secondary prevention  and those with only risk factors for CV disease  primary prevention   Also  Invokana demonstrated reduction in the risk of hospitalization due to heart failure  HHF  in both patient groups  No new adverse events were reported during this additional analysis 
We remind investors that in June  the company reported data from the CANVAS program  which demonstrated that Invokana was successful in reducing the risks of cardiovascular  CV  outcomes in type II diabetes patients  who have established cardiovascular  CV  disease or are at a risk for CV disease  Invokana reduced major adverse CV events or MACE by 14  compared with placebo  MACE is a composite endpoint of CV death  non fatal myocardial infarction or non fatal stroke  However  the study also showed that the drug increased the risk of amputations 
Last month  J J submitted a supplemental new drug application  sNDA  to the FDA for the label expansion of Invokana to include the cardiovascular indication based on the data from the CANVAS program 
Many pharma companies are working hard to get the labels of their diabetes medicines updated to include the cardiovascular benefits  With death from cardiovascular diseases being significantly higher in adults with diabetes compared with those without it  the addition of positive CV outcomes on labels of diabetes drugs can give sales a shot in the arm 
Eli Lilly   Company   NYSE LLY   received both FDA and EU approvals last year to include the CV risk reduction data from the EMPA REG OUTCOME study on the label of Jardiance  Additionally  in August  Novo Nordisk s   NYSE NVO   Victoza  liraglutide  was approved by the FDA for a new indication to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular  CV  events in adults with type II diabetes and established CV disease 
However  in May  Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   was denied an approval by the FDA to include cardiovascular outcomes data from the TECOS trial on the labels of its DPP IV inhibitor  Januvia  sitagliptin  and other medicines containing Januvia 
AstraZeneca s Bydureon also failed to reduce the cardiovascular risk in a phase IIIb IV cardiovascular outcomes study  EXSCEL Johnson   Johnson Price

172468,393984,LLY,What To Expect From Big Pharmas After J J s Solid Q3 Results ,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   was the first large cap pharma stock to report its earnings results for this season on Oct 17  J J beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in the third quarter and also raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook  Shares of J J were up more than 3  on Tuesday 
J J s sales growth accelerated in the third quarter leading the company to post its first positive sales surprise after almost a year  Higher sales in the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from the Actelion deal pulled up the top line in the quarter  J J acquired Swiss biotech Actelion in June this year for  30 billion 
Overall  the pharma sector has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year 
After declining 5 2  last year  the industry has risen 18 2  this year so far  outpacing 14 2  gain for the S P 500 in the same time frame 
New product sales ramp up with rising demand  successful innovation and product line expansion  strong clinical study results  more frequent FDA approvals  11 new drugs approved in Q3 alone  and continued strong performance of legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year 
These factors are likely to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next despite challenges like rising competition  pipeline setbacks  slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs 
J J s better than expected results  especially the strong performance of its Pharmaceuticals segment  have raised optimism for another strong quarterly performance by the pharma sector  mainly the large cap companies 
Let s have a closer look at what to expect from six big pharma stocks when they report this month early next month  Five out of the six companies are expected to deliver earnings beat this quarter 
Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE  
Pfizer is scheduled to announce third quarter results on Oct 31 before the market opens  With a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and of  1 04   the chances of the stock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter is high  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
New products like Xeljanz  rheumatoid arthritis  and Ibrance  breast cancer  as well as older products like Lyrica  neuropathic pain  and Eliquis  blood thinner  are expected to contribute to Pfizer s top line meaningfully  However  the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq Vfend  Zyvox and Celebrex and the expiration of a few co promotion agreements will continue to hamper top line growth  Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales will continue to be soft in the quarter due to biosimilar competition 
Pfizer surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  as shown in the chart below Pfizer  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY  
Bristol Myers is scheduled to release results on Oct 26 before the market opens  Similar to Pfizer  our quantitative model indicates an earnings beat for Bristol Myers  This Zacks Rank  3 stock has an Earnings ESP of  1 05  
You can see  
Bristol Myers  high profile immuno oncology drug  Opdivo  is likely to drive the company s top line in the to be reported quarter  Opdivo s U S  sales are driven by the melanoma  second line non small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma indications 
Recent label expansions into the classical Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck cancer indications will also boost the drug s sales 
Bristol Myers outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  as reflected in the chart below Bristol Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise

   Merck   Company  Inc    NYSE MRK  
Merck is scheduled to release results on Oct 27 before the market opens  With a Zacks Rank  3 and Earnings ESP of  0 61   the chances of the stock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter is high 
Merck s new products like Keytruda  cancer   Zepatier  HCV  and Bridion  sugammadex  Injection will likely drive revenues this quarter as well  Keytruda sales in the United States are gaining  particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first line lung cancer  The Keytruda development program significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and an additional indication in Europe  The new approvals expand the patient population and are expected to drive sales further 
However  genericization and increasing competition will likely remain overhangs 
Merck outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  as reflected in the chart below Merck   Company  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   GlaxoSmithKline plc   NYSE GSK  
Brentford  UK based GlaxoSmithKline is expected to report results on Oct 25  GlaxoSmithKline is also expected to outperform in the third quarter due to its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and Earnings ESP of  1 80  
Glaxo s Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business segments are expected to perform well  Glaxo s Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to continue being driven by strong sales of new HIV products  Tivicay and Triumeq 
However  many of Glaxo s key drugs like Lovaza and Avodart are facing declining sales due to generic competition  Moreover  sluggish sales growth in the Consumer Healthcare segment due to a slowdown in market conditions and the impact of divestures may negatively impact the top line in the third quarter 
Notably  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  as shown in the chart below GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise

   Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY  
Eli Lillyis slated to announce third quarter results on Oct 24 before the market opens  With a Zacks Rank  3 and Earnings ESP of  0 07   the chances of an earnings beat in the to be reported quarter is high 
Continuing the trend of the past few quarters  new products like Trulicity  Cyramza  Taltz and Jardiance are likely to support the top line in the reported quarter 
However  sluggish performance of Alimta  Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to continue in the third quarter due to the loss of exclusivity 
Notably  Eli Lilly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  as shown in the chart below Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise

   Novartis AG   NYSE NVS  
Swiss company   is scheduled to report its results on Oct 24  before market opens  Novartis is not expected to beat estimates in the third quarter due its Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  0 40  
The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis  given the potential in the CAR T therapy space  Moreover  new products like Cosentyx and Entresto are expected to boost the top line  Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market share from rivals like AbbVie s Humira and Amgen s Enbrel  Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016 
However  a weak Alcon business and generic competition for several of its key drugs is expected to hurt revenues in this quarter 
Notably  Novartis outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  as reflected in the chart below Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise

172491,394007,LLY,Merck Will Not Seek Approval For CETP Inhibitor Anacetrapib,opinion,"Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   announced that it is not going ahead with filing the regulatory applications seeking approval for anacetrapib  a cholesteryl ester transfer protein  CETP  inhibitor that it had developed for cholesterol management 
The stock was down more than 1  on Wednesday  Merck s shares have risen 8 3  this year so far compared with an 18 3  increase for the  

 
Detailed data from a large phase III cardiovascular outcomes study  REVEAL  announced in August showed that anacetrapib and a statin reduced the risk of major coronary events  composite of coronary death  myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization  by 9  relative to placebo in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease who are already receiving an effective cholesterol treatment 
While anacetrapib reduced the risk to 10 8   the same was 11 8  for patients on a placebo and a statin  However  no significant benefit was observed in reducing the risk of ischemic stroke 
Top line data from the study was announced in June 2017 wherein the company said that the study had met the primary endpoint  It was also said that anacetrapib s safety profile was in line with that observed in previous studies with the most significant side effect being the accumulation of anacetrapib in adipose or fat tissue for years after taking the drug 
Merck had clearly said then that it was not sure whether the data was strong enough to seek approval  Merck said it will consider whether to file regulatory applications with the FDA and other agencies after reviewing the results with external experts  It was apprehended by investors that the accumulation of anacetrapib in fat tissues could get in the way of regulatory approval 
Following a thorough evaluation of data and discussions with external experts  Merck decided not to seek approval for anacetrapib as its clinical profile did not support regulatory filings 
We remind investors that three previous experimental CETP inhibitors had failed in their respective studies  CETP inhibitors are designed to raise HDL cholesterol levels or what is known as  good  cholesterol 
In 2015  Eli Lilly   NYSE LLY    terminated the development of its late stage CETP inhibitor  evacetrapib based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee  which suggested that chances of meeting the primary endpoint were low  Back in 2006  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   suspended the late stage development of its CETP inhibitor  torceptrapib  due to safety issues  In 2012  Roche   OTC RHHBY   discontinued the development of its CETP inhibitor  dalcetrapib  due to lack of efficacy

The company s blockbuster drug  Diovan  is facing stiff generic competition in the United States  EU and Japan  Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016  The company also lost patent protection for the drug in EU in December 2016 leading to generic competition  The loss of patent protection for these top selling drugs continue to hurt sales 
Of late  the performance of the Alcon business has been quite disappointing due to lower surgical equipments sales as a result of competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases  Despite the restructuring initiatives of the company  the segment s performance remains dismal  In particular  the surgical business is taking longer to turnaround 
Hence  Novartis is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business to separation via capital transactions such as a spin off or an initial public offering  The company will throw light on its plans for Alcon later in 2017

172530,394046,LLY,Choosing Wisely  Aytu BioScience  AYTUD  Stock vs  Lipocine  Inc   LPCN ,opinion,"Both Aytu BioScience and Lipocine  Inc  are advancing novel testosterone replacement therapies  but when placed side by side  which stock may make investors pumped for joy 
As of today  the testosterone replacement therapy market is a hot sector  with companies focused on grabbing as much of the estimated  2 billion market as they can 
Two emerging companies  in particular  are focused on delivering shareholders both near and long term value propositions by advancing their unique TRT products  one of which has recently hit the market  And  while several large pharmaceuticals are well entrenched in the TRT market already  their products  like AndroGel  AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV    Axiron  Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY    and Fortesta  Endo International PLC  NASDAQ ENDP    are plagued with the most severe of FDA warnings  the dreaded  
Thus  with the market opportunity open to treatments that may provide a better solution without the known risks of currently marketed TRT products  let s place two peer competitors side by side to determine the chances of either of the two taking a bite out of the current market potential 
Is Aytu BioScience The  Wise Choice  
Although Aytu  OTC AYTUD  has experienced a tough month in August  likely attributable to the recent capital raise  the company has never been stronger from a clinical and marketing perspective  Now  that the split is old news and with shares trading above  3 70 per share  the distractions of the past month may soon get replaced with investor optimism about the company s lead TRT product  Natesto 
Natesto has the potential to become a game changer in the TRT market  Although AYTU is marketing with a much smaller budget than those with already approved therapies on the market  at some point investors believe that wisdom will soon replace big pharma muscle  making Natesto the TRT of choice for prescribing physicians 
And  when looking at published clinical data  the case for a market leading Natesto should not be cast off as pure fodder  In fact  when comparing Natesto to Lipocine s pipeline TRT  Tlando  as well as to a host of other big name drugs  Natesto has demonstrated statistically better efficacy and appears to be a safer and more effective treatment than most all TRT products currently on the market 
Keeping the focus only on both company s TRT products  other promising AYTU pipeline products won t get considered  However  investors should not discount the value inherent to the AYTU pipeline consisting of a male infertility product MiOXSYS and a female sexual wellness product Fiera  and like Natesto may offer significant and compelling market advantages  Okay  so what about Natesto s bid to be best in class 
First off  Natesto is the only nasally administered TRT on the market  And  while some investors may not understand the significance of that issue  users of the product will  Being nasally administered helps to alleviate inadvertent transfer of testosterone  provides consistent and efficient dosing  and offers significant convenience over topically applied products 
Because of these advantages  Natesto is the only currently marketed FDA approved topical TRT product not labeled with the severe FDA required Black Box warning  However  those safety and convenience issues are just the tip of the iceberg in the advantages column  there is more to Natesto to justify its place in the  2 billion TRT market 
It s no accident that Natesto has been called the potential best in class therapy on the market  Coming off of its recent spike of over 300  in new prescription volume  Natesto is grabbing the attention of physicians due to the proven effectiveness of the product  which also leaves behind the severe side effects for patients 
The differentiating factors are apparent  Natesto reduces or eliminates the potential for accidental transfer and does not require a man taking the product to quarantine himself from a female or child to quarantine while the product is applied  Additionally  being a hand s free application  Natesto offers consistent dosing in a measured treatment  and that s an important issue since excessive intake of testosterone is not necessarily a good thing for patients 
Of perhaps higher importance  though  is that Natesto does not significantly reduce levels of LH and FSH hormones in the body  which has caused side effects in patients  including reducing sperm count and decreasing testicle size  that use products like AndroGel  Axiron  Fortesta  and injectable products  Not only does Natesto maintain proper hormone levels in patients  but Natesto also eliminates the potential for users getting hooked on testosterone treatments to maintain healthy testosterone levels 
Natesto excels in other areas of concern as well  demonstrating a better safety profile over long acting gels and injections that have been shown to increase hematocrit concentrations in the patient  That is  the treatments make the patient s blood thicker  which may lead to stroke and cardiac related complications in patients  From a safety perspective  Natesto is best in class  but what about the efficacy 
The safety profile is significant  but it s how Natesto performs that is the real story  Marketed as  testosterone in seconds   Natesto is now the first and only FDA approved intranasal TRT on the market  In a clinical trial  the majority of patients achieved statistically significant improvement in each of the five domains of erectile function  In most cases  the effect on normalizing erectile function occurred within the first thirty days of treatment 
In addition to the benefits mentioned  70  of men in the Natesto pivotal trial said they would switch from their current TRT to treatment with Natesto  Thus  no surprise that Natesto has seen a sharp trend higher in new prescription rates  with new authorizations for the product doubling since May of 2017  Also  90  of men taking Natesto get their testosterone levels back to  normal   which is higher than other TRTs 
Most men taking Natesto see their moods improve as soon as thirty days from starting treatment  The market is estimated to stand at approximately  2 billion currently  and if AYTU maintains the current trend  even a 10  market penetration can return over  200 million in new revenues 
Now that AYTU has roughly only four million shares outstanding  a revenue spike of that magnitude would most likely cause a disproportionate rise higher in company market cap  which currently reflects anemic value considering this potentially game changing product  Adding in the potential of Aytu s other marketed products  the company may be a very wise choice for investors seeking long term value and probability for share price appreciation 
Is Lipocine  Inc  The  Wise Choice  
Lipocine Inc   NASDAQ LPCN  is developing a testosterone product called Tlando  Although the product is not yet on the market  LPCN is the closest peer to Aytu from a market perspective 
LPCN is taking a different approach for Tlando  testing an orally administered dose of testosterone  which the company plans to submit to the FDA for approval in the coming months  Importantly  investors need to know that the FDA has already denied the application for Tlando once  but LPCN is preparing to try for approval once again  relying on similar data from the original rejected application 
A potential drawback for the oral administration of Tlando  is that patients will be required to keep a consistent diet  maintaining certain fat content and calorie intake  And  this is the case for each dosing  If patients fail to adhere to specific dietary requirements  patients are unlikely to see a meaningful rise in testosterone levels  which would be a huge problem and a potential marketing nightmare for the product 
A significantly more adverse scenario is that during the company s FDA studies  a handful of men reached testosterone levels of over 2500 ng dl  which is both extremely high and dangerous 
In addition to potential FDA problems looming for Tlando  the company itself said in a press release that LPCN 1021  Tlando  only  generally met  the pre specified per dose secondary endpoints for twice daily oral administration  In layman s terms  the product either meets the endpoint  or it doesn t  and when the company itself publishes mixed messages  investors should pay close attention 
Also important to note is that the FDA will be highly unappeased if men being treated by Tlando exceed the 2500 ng dl level  making the chances for approval unlikely  And to add insult to potential misery  as far as the FDA is concerned  when endpoints are  generally met   product support is unlikely  Their word s  not mine 
The biggest issue for Tlando compared to Natesto  though  is that when placed side by side  Tlando does not get as many men to normal testosterone levels  Company sponsored studies demonstrate a significant edge in benefit from Natesto  with 90  of males reaching normal testosterone levels  compared to just 70  of patients reaching normal testosterone levels when using Tlando 
The FDA has made it known that at least 75  of men taking the testosterone product must reach normal T levels  so it is difficult to understand how the FDA would even approve Tlando  Additionally  with Tlando known to produce dangerously high testosterone concentrations in some men  the road to approval may be far tougher than even the most optimistic investor may be willing to admit 
The  Wisest Choice  
Comparing the two  AYTU emerges as a clear  wise choice  for investors wanting exposure to the multi billion dollar TRT market  Interestingly  LPCN has a current market cap of roughly  75 million compared to Aytu s approximately  15 million market cap  From both a product and valuation standpoint  the opportunity for growth is substantial in the Aytu BioScience camp  particularly when you consider that there is no regulatory risk for Ayu  The product is already on the market and growing rapidly  Although a slim chance exists for approval for Tlando  the product would most likely get met with considerable marketing difficulties  Conversely  with Aytu s Natesto already approved and marketed  the promise again lay squarely in the Aytu potential 
Now that the TRT comparisons are noted  it s fair to factor in both AYTU s and LPCN s additional pipeline opportunities  While a slight opportunity may have existed for LPCN to present itself in a better light  the company is yet to produce an impressive clinical statistic  Thus  the clear advantages still weigh heavily in Aytu s favor  solidifying their position as the better of the two  With a pipeline focused on making use of a combined market opportunity of more than  11 million dollars in the bank following their recent capital raise  in this case  Aytu BioScience is the superior choice for investors looking to  choose wisely ",2017-09-06,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/choosing-wisely-aytu-bioscience-aytud-stock-vs-lipocine-inc-lpcn-200211654,200211654

172546,394062,LLY,Nektar s  NKTR  Shares Fall Post Wider Q2 Loss  Revenues Lag ,opinion,"Nektar Therapeutics    NASDAQ NKTR   shares have declined almost 9  since Aug 8 after the company reported second quarter results  The biotech reported a wider than expected loss while sales missed estimates 
Nektar s second quarter 2017 loss of 39 cents per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 35 cents  This reported loss was also wider than the year ago loss of 36 cents per share 
Nektar s shares have significantly outperformed the so far this year  The company s shares have surged 46 3  while the industry has registered a decrease of 4 1  

Quarterly revenues rose 5 5  to  34 6 million from the year ago quarter  This increase in revenues can mainly be attributed to the rise in product sales and royalty revenues  However  the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  36 million 
Quarter in Detail
The top line comprised product sales  royalty revenues  non cash royalty revenues  license  collaboration and other revenues 
In the second quarter  product sales increased 21 7  to  15 7 million from  12 9 million a year ago  However  non cash royalty revenues decreased 18 5  to  6 6 million 
The company reported royalty revenues of  7 4 million  registering a huge improvement of 111 4  in the second quarter compared with  3 5 million in the year ago quarter  This was mainly thanks to royalty revenues from Movantik sales 
License  collaboration and other revenues came in at  4 8 million  down 42 2  compared with  8 3 million a year ago  This fall in revenues can mainly be attributed to the recognition of  3 2 million  received from Daiichi Sankyo for the sublicense of Onzeald  formerly known as NKTR 102  in Europe in second quarter 2016 
Research and development  R D  expenses climbed 15 1  to  60 3 million  primarily due to investments in pipeline  including key candidates  NKTR 358 and NKTR 181 
General and administrative  G A  expenses were up 45 5  to  16 million  This massive jump can mainly be attributed to a payment of  7 million for settlement of a litigation regarding a cross license agreement with Enzon  Inc   a Florida based pharma company 
Pipeline Update
The most advanced candidate in the company s portfolio is Onzeald  currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treatment of adults with advanced breast cancer  having brain metastases  However  the company was informed last month by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  that it had adopted a negative opinion for the conditional marketing application for the candidate in the EU  Subsequently  in the same month  the company filed a request for examining the opinion adopted by the CHMP 
Apart from Onzeald  another candidate in the company s immuno oncology portfolio is NKTR 214  A phase I II study evaluating NKTR 214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol Myers Squibb s   NYSE BMY   Opdivo is underway  During the second quarter  Nektar announced that it has started dosing patients in the trial and plans to enroll up to 260 patients in eight target cancer indications  The company expects to report initial data from the dose escalation part of the study soon 
Notably  in May  Nektar announced a research collaboration agreement with Japanese pharma company  Takeda Pharmaceuticals  to explore the combination of NKTR 214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda s cancer portfolio 
Last month  Nektar announced that it has entered into a strategic collaboration contract with Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   to co develop NKTR 358  phase I study ongoing  for treatment of a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions 
2017 Outlook Updated
Nektar raised its revenue outlook for 2017 to account for a  150 million upfront payment it expects to receive from Lilly  The company now estimates revenue in the range of  215  225 million compared with  145  155 million  projected previously 
Driven by the same reason  Nektar also raised its expected cash position for the year ending 2017 with approximately  350 million compared with  225 million  estimated previously Nektar Therapeutics Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Nektar currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A better ranked stock in the health care sector is Enzo Biochem  Inc    NYSE ENZ    carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Enzo Biochem s loss per share estimates narrowed from 12 cents to 7 cents for 2017 and from 11 cents to 3 cents for 2018 over the last 60 days  The company came up with a positive earnings surprise in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 55 83   The stock surged 58 3  so far this year

172580,394096,LLY,Merck s Biosimilar Insulin Gets Tentative FDA Approval ,opinion,"Merck   NYSE MRK   announced that the FDA has granted a tentative approval to Lusduna Nexvue  the company s biosimilar version of Sanofi s   NYSE SNY   Lantus  insulin glargine  for treatment of people with type I and type II diabetes  Lusduna Nexvue delivers insulin in a pre filled dosing device 
Note that the candidate was formerly known as MK 1293  The FDA has granted a provisional approval to its trade name Lusduna Nexvue  to be used once the product is made available in the U S 
Merck s shares have underperformed the  so far this year  The stock has gained 6 9  compared with the broader industry s increase of 13 2  

Though Lusduna met all the regulatory safety and efficacy standards  the approval is tentative due to an ongoing litigation with Sanofi  PA SASY   The final approval of Lusduna is subject to a resolution of the Sanofi litigation 
In September last year  Sanofi sued Merck for patent infringement on Lantus  The litigation automatically invoked a stay on the final FDA approval of Lusduna for up to 30 months  or in the event  a court rules in favor of Merck  whichever is sooner  Notably  Lantus has been a major contributor to the Sanofi s top line having accounted for 14 1  of the total sales in 2016 
However  the company considers the conditional approval as a significant milestone as it is advancing the candidate another step closer to the market 
We remind investors that Merck is developing Lusduna in collaboration with Samsung  KS 005930  Bioepis  Under the agreement terms  Merck is responsible for clinical development  manufacturing and commercialization  while Bioepis is partially funding the development 
Currently  an application for regulatory approval of Lusduna for treatment of patients with type I and type II diabetes is under review in the EU 
We remind investors that Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   is already marketing a  follow on  insulin glargine product  Basalgar  since Dec 2016

strong sales  We believe that both Lemtrada and Aubagio possess significant commercial potential Key Drug Approvals this YearImportant drugs of Sanofi and AstraZeneca were approved launched this year  Sanofi s Rheumatoid arthritis  RA  drug Kevzara was approved in the U S   Canada and the EU this year  Meanwhile  Dupixent dupilumab was approved by the FDA for treating atopic dermatitis in Mar 2017 and is now available to adult patients in the U S  The drug is under review in the EU for the same indication  Soliqua  a once daily titratable fixed ratio combination of Lantus and Lyxumia  was launched in the U S  in Jan 2017 and is expected to be launched in Europe later this year These new drugs have the potential to boost Sanofi s sales in the next few years  Particularly  weare optimistic on sales prospects of Dupixent  which could prove to be an important growth driver for the company  Dupixent is being evaluated for several other indications like asthma and nasal polyposis For AstraZeneca  key pipeline candidate  Imfinzi  durvalumab  was approved in the U S  for treatment experienced urothelial carcinoma  UC  in May 2017  Meanwhile  Imfinzi  durvalumab  is being evaluated for multiple cancers  either alone or in combination with other regimens   including phase III trials in first line urothelial cancer  NSCLC  small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  HNSCC  among others  Imfinzi is expected to be a key top line growth driver for AstraZeneca in the long term Pipeline MattersFor any pharma or biotech company  the pipeline is of utmost importance and plays an important role in investment decisions  So  it always makes sense to take a look at a company s pipeline Sanofi is focusing its R D efforts on key technologies and diseases  which hold greater commercial potential  At the end of Apr 2017  Sanofi s pipeline comprised 46 pharmaceutical new molecular entities and vaccine candidates in development  of which 13 were in phase III studies or under regulatory review  Promising candidates include sotagliflozin  SGLT 1 and SGLT 2 inhibitor for diabetes  and isatuximab  multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia  Promising candidates in AstraZeneca s pipeline or under regulatory review include benralizumab  asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD   ZS 9  hyperkalemia  tralokinumab  asthma   anifrolumab  systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis   roxadustat  anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease  and AZD3293  Alzheimer s disease   AstraZeneca is working on strengthening its oncology product portfolio and has several candidates in its pipeline  The company s target is to launch at least six new oncology medicines between 2014 and 2020  Immuno oncology  a therapeutic area  is presently attracting a lot of interest and represents huge commercial potential Meanwhile both the companies have been streamlining their business by pursuing regular accretive business development deals  Sanofi has collaboration agreements with companies like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   while AstraZeneca is pursuing co development deals with companies like Nektar  Eli Lilly   Company   NYSE LLY   and others to boost its pipeline  The companies have also made strategic acquisitions  both big and small  from time to time Meanwhile  both the companies are working on reducing the impact of genericization on key products by trimming their cost structure to drive operational efficiency Share Price  Estimate Revisions and ValuationIn terms of share price  both stocks have moved more or less in tandem and therefore it is difficult to single out a winner  As discussed  both stocks have risen so far this year  This comes after share price declines witnessed in 2016 Shares of AstraZeneca have risen 25  so far this year  outperforming a gain of 12 1  for the Zacks classified  industry Sanofi has risen 18 2  this year  also outperforming the Large Cap Pharma sector Sanofi s earnings estimates for 2017 have gone up 3 3  while that for 2018 have moved up 1 2  in the past 60 days  Sanofi s earnings performance has also been pretty impressive  with steady positive surprises  The average earnings beat for the last four quarters is 5 10  AstraZeneca s earnings estimates for 2017 went up 0 5  while that for 2018 moved up 3 3  in the past 60 days  Its earnings performance has also been pretty impressive  with consistent positive surprises  The average earnings beat for the last four quarters is 142 6  However  when we compare the stocks  valuation on a P E basis  Sanofi holds an edge A study of AstraZeneca s forward P E  F12M basis  multiple reflects that the stock is quite overvalued  The multiple currently stands at 18 23  stretched when compared to its own range  median of 18 20   Comparison with the Zacks categorized Large Cap Pharma industry is unfavorable as the current P E  F12M basis  for the industry is 15 96 for the last three months Sanofi  on the other hand  is trading at a discount using the same forward P E  F12M basis  multiples  The multiple currently stands at 14 76 for Sanofi  representing a discount to that of the Large Cap Pharma industry  The stock is also attractively valued when compared to its own range  median of 15 10  AstraZeneca is also overvalued when compared with the S P 500 P E  F12M basis  multiple of 17 88 while Sanofi is undervalued compared to the same A Neck and Neck Contest Without doubt  both Sanofi and AstraZeneca have delivered the goods this year and choosing between the two is a tall order  Both have their share of strengths and weaknesses  Both Sanofi and AstraZeneca are facing generic competition and pricing pressure for some products  The diabetes businesses of both the companies are having a tough time due to competitive pressure  They have also bitter experiences in the form of pipeline and regulatory setbacks  So we can say that the two companies stand on an equal footing to take on the second half Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock

172617,394133,LLY,Merck s CETP Inhibitor Reduces CV Risk In Phase III Study,opinion,"Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   announced that a large late stage cardiovascular outcomes study  REVEAL  evaluating anacetrapib  a cholesterol lowering medicine  met the primary endpoint by reducing cardiovascular  CV  risk 
Top line data from the phase III study showed that anacetrapib  a cholesteryl ester transfer protein  CETP  inhibitor  led to significant reduction in major coronary events  composite of coronary death  myocardial infarction  and coronary revascularization  versus placebo in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events who are already receiving an effective cholesterol treatment  Anacetrapib s safety profile was in line with that observed in previous studies with the most significant side effect being the accumulation of anacetrapib in adipose or fat tissue for years after taking the drug 
Merck s shares are up 11 3  year to date  comparing unfavorably with an increase of 14 9  witnessed by the Zacks classified  industry 

The company funded REVEAL study was conducted in approximately 30 000 patients who were taking atorvastatin   a common medicine for lowering  bad  cholesterol  or LDL   for a median duration of at least four years 
Detailed results from the study are expected to be presented at a medical conference in Europe in August  Merck is not sure whether the data are strong enough to seek approval and plans to review the results with external experts  The company will then consider whether to file regulatory applications with the FDA and other agencies 
The positive results from the REVEAL study were a surprise because three previous experimental CETP inhibitors had failed  CETP inhibitors are designed to raise HDL cholesterol levels or what is known as  good  cholesterol 
 In 2015  Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   terminated the development of its late stage CETP inhibitor  evacetrapib based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee  which suggested that chances of meeting the primary endpoint were low  Back in 2006  Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE   had suspended the late stage development of its CETP inhibitor  torceptrapib  due to safety issues  Then in 2012  Roche   OTC RHHBY   discontinued the development of its CETP inhibitor  dalcetrapib  due to lack of efficacy 
However  uncertainty regarding whether or not the company will actually file the data with regulators has raised investor concern  It is apprehended that the accumulation of anacetrapib in fat tissues could get in the way of regulatory approval

172730,394246,LLY,5 Reasons Why Merck  MRK  Is A Good Stock To Buy Now ,opinion,Kenilworth  NJ based Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   is a research driven pharmaceutical company  which is a global leader in the discovery and development of vaccines and pharmaceutical drugs  The company currently makes noteworthy treatments or vaccines for HPV  type 2 diabetes  cancer  and HIV  among others  It looks like a great stock to buy now  Here are some reasons for the same Favorable Rank  Rising Estimates   Share Price  Merck carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Merck s earnings estimates for 2017 as well as 2018 went up by 0 3  in the past 7 days following its strong earnings and raised outlook  In fact  Merck s earnings performance has been pretty impressive  with the company exceeding earnings expectations consistently  The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 4 36  Share price of the company has risen 16 6  in the past one year while the Zacks classified  industry registered an increase of 4 5  Strong Q1 Results  Merck beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the first quarter of 2017 and also raised its 2017 guidance Merck s Pharmaceutical segment revenues rose 1  year over year as strong performance of new products like Keytruda  Bridion and Zepatier and higher sales of vaccines and animal health franchises offset lower sales of the Januvia Janumet franchise and loss of market exclusivity for many drugs Successful New Products  Merck s new products like Keytruda and Zepatier should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line   In the first quarter of 2017  Keytruda sales rose 20 9  sequentially and 134 5  year over year while Zepatier sales rose 65  sequentially Keytruda is the first anti PD 1 therapy to gain FDA approval  Keytruda sales received a boost with the approval in the first line lung cancer setting  In fact  Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally  In Mar Apr 2017  Keytruda received FDA and EU approval for refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma  cHL    the first Keytruda approval for hematologic malignancy indication  In May  Merck got a boost with the FDA granting accelerated approval to Keytruda for use in combination with Eli Lilly   Company s   NYSE LLY   cancer drug Alimta  pemetrexed  and carboplatin  pem carbo   a commonly used chemo regimen  for the first line treatment of metastatic non squamous non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   irrespective of PD L1 expression  Note that this is the first FDA approval for Keytruda as combination therapy Keytruda uptake in first line lung cancer indication and potential label expansion   with FDA action pending on multiple regulatory applications   are catalysts for the stock in 2017 Deep Pipeline  Merck has also made significant progress with its pipeline and is working on bringing new products to the market Merck has more than 10 candidates in phase III development  The company has prioritized its pipeline so that the candidates with the highest potential get the required support  Some of the important pipeline candidates include MK 0859  anacetrapib   cholesterol management   verubecestat  prodromal Alzheimer s disease   MK 8228 letermovir  cytomegalovirus  CVM  infections  and MK 8835 ertugliflozin  type II diabetes   in partnership with Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE    Meanwhile  Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer Merck  in order to build its long term portfolio  is tapping external sources as well  The company entered into several licensing deals in the last couple of years with expectation of more such deals in the future Aggressive Cost Cutting Initiatives  Merck will continue to focus on cost cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line  Merck has a global restructuring program in progress  which is aimed at reducing the cost structure and increasing efficiency  It intends to reduce the number of manufacturing sites  including animal health sites  and consolidate other facilities  The company expects annual savings of about  4 0  4 6 billion once the restructuring program is completed Merck also divested segments like the Consumer Care business to Germany s Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY   in 2014 so that it can focus on its core areas of expertise  The company is also returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends ConclusionMerck has its share of headwinds  Like many of its peers  Merck is facing headwinds in the form of generic competition for several key products  Pricing pressure and rising competition in the immuno oncology market is also a significant concernHowever  we believe the new drug approvals  a solid pipeline and aggressive savings will pave the way for growth this year Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating

172731,394247,LLY,Endocyte  ECYT  Focused On Two Lead Pipeline Candidates,opinion,"We issued an updated report on Endocyte  Inc    NASDAQ ECYT   on May 17 
Endocyte s share price has increased 10 2  year to date  while the Zacks classified  industry gained 4 9  

Currently  the company is focused on the development of two candidates  EC1456 and EC1169  both of which are in phase I 
Endocyte is focusing on the development of its second generation folate targeted agent  EC1456  as second line treatment for non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   identified by the companion imaging agent etarfolatide  It has already initiated the expansion phase of the study on EC1456 in select folate receptor positive NSCLC cancer patients  A dose of 6 0 mg m2 has been established as the maximum twice a week dose and is being used in the expansion phase of the study 
Patients included in this expansion phase of the trial are expected to receive first line chemotherapy and may also be treated with anti PD 1 therapy  Initially  anti tumor response of the single agent will be evaluated  Notably  positive results would lead to its evaluation as combination therapies in indications such as triple negative breast cancer  ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer 
Although several companies are aggressively working on bringing new cancer treatments to market  demand for improved and targeted therapies makes this a space with high commercial potential  In fact  Endocyte uses its proprietary technology platform to develop various new small molecule drug conjugates  SMDCs  for a range of diseases  Each SMDC consists of three modules  a targeting ligand  a linker and a drug payload 
Also  the company is working on generating a pipeline of SMDC candidates though this modular approach  including EC1456 and EC1169  advanced metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer mCRPC   phase I ongoing   among others  Moving ahead  successful development of targeted SMDCs that are able to penetrate deep into dense solid tumors and have a shorter half life might help Endocyte gain an edge over existing therapies 
Apart from these candidates  Endocyte is working on the development of companion imaging agents  These agents utilize the same modular structure as the SMDCs to replace the drug payload with an imaging agent 
The companion imaging agents facilitate the identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from Endocyte s SMDC treatment  This should help in expanding the market for SMDCs  thereby boosting growth at the company  Currently  the company is evaluating EC1169 in a phase I study for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  mCRPC  
Patients are being scanned with its companion imaging agent  EC0652 to identify the presence of prostate specific membrane antigen  The first part of the phase I study has been completed  and the company has started the second part  confirming 6 5 mg m2 once a week as the maximum clinical dose  In this expansion phase of the study  two cohorts of mCRPC patients  be evaluated 
The company is also nearing completion of preclinical work required to file an Investigational New Drug  IND  application for EC2629  which is its first candidate to target disease cells and simultaneously impact the tumor micro environment by shutting down tumors associated with macrophages  Moving ahead  Endocyte expects to file an IND for EC2629 by mid 2017 
However  the company has very few candidates in its pipeline with all of them in the early or mid stages of development  Unfavorable results from any of these studies may lead to their postponement or discontinuation  thereby impacting shares adversely 
Endocyte s products are expected to face intense competition in the market from both large pharma companies and small and mid sized companies  Several companies are either pursuing the development of or marketing drugs that target NSCLC  prostate cancer  ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer  or other oncology pathways on which Endocyte focuses 
Furthermore  the market for lung cancer therapies is already crowded with treatments like Pfizer Inc  s   NYSE PFE   Xalkori and Eli Lilly and Company s   NYSE LLY   Alimta and Cyramza  and AstraZeneca Plc s   NYSE AZN   Tagrisso among others Endocyte  Inc  Price and Consensus

DetailQuarterly revenues grew 7  to  5 76 billion  Sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 55 billion by 3 8   Excluding the impact of foreign exchange  worldwide revenues grew 6   The top line was primarily driven by strong performance in the key diabetes franchise  Lilly s new products contributed more than 700 million to sales this quarter with Trulicity and Cyramza doing well  At the conference call  Lilly said it expects to launch three new products by the end of 2018 Higher volumes and a slightly favorable impact of foreign currency  1   were partially offset by lower realized prices Volumes rose 8  as higher volumes of new products like Trulicity  Cyramza  Taltz and Jardiance and older products like Humalog Humulin as well as the Animal Health division was offset by lower volumes of established products like Zyprexa  Alimta and Cymbalta U S  revenues grew 14  to  3 22 billion  reflecting higher volume of products like Trulicity  Humalog  Taltz and Jardiance as well as companion animal products  Higher realized prices also propelled U S  sales Ex U S  revenues declined 1  to  2 54 billion mainly due to lower volumes and realized prices  Higher volumes of newer products like Cyramza  Jardiance and Trulicity were partially offset by lower volumes of Zyprexa  Cymbalta and Alimta due to the loss of exclusivity  Cymbalta has lost exclusivity in Europe and Canada  Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries Products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo  up 12  to  422 5 million   Humalog  up 3  to  819 8 million   Strattera  up 10  to  243 2 million  and Cialis  up 6  to  676 3 million  Alimta sales  however  declined 14  to  541 6 million  reflecting lower demand in the U S  due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno oncology agents  Outside the U S   sales of Alimta were hurt by loss of exclusivity in several countries Zyprexa sales declined 33  to  153 million due to loss of exclusivity Humulin sales decreased 1  in the quarter as higher sales in the U S  were offset by lower volumes in outside U S  markets Erbitux sales declined 13  to  153 7 million in the quarter Lilly s Animal Health segment sales increased 3  to  837 6 million  Favorable wholesaler buying patterns for companion animal products in the U S   and higher food animal products  sales in ex U S  markets drove segment sales Among new products  Trulicity generated revenues of  337 million  almost double from last year s fourth quarter  with U S  revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP 1 market and market share gains  Cyramza revenues were  177 1 million  up 51  year over year backed mainly by higher outside U S  revenues  Cyramza s ex U S  revenues benefited from strong uptake in the gastric cancer indication in Japan  However  U S  revenues declined  being hurt by competition in the non small cell lung cancer indication Jardiance sales   76 1 million  were driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class  In Dec 2016  the FDA approved Jardiance for the CV indication while the American Diabetes Association updated its diabetes treatment guidelines  Management believes that both these factors will drive growth of Jardiance and the SGLT 2 class Basaglar recorded revenues of  39 5 million  Basaglar was launched in the U S  in mid Dec 2016 where it generated revenues of  15 8 million largely due to initial

In addition  the European Commission also approved Keytruda for the first line treatment of non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  in adults whose tumors have high PD L1 expression  tumor proportion score of 50  or more  with no EGFR or ALK positive tumor mutations  Keytruda sales gained from launches in new indications like first line lung cancer  approved in Oct 2016   and recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer  approved in Aug 2016  in the U S   and second line NSCLC across the world 
Januvia Janumet franchise recorded sales of  1 3 billion in the quarter  down 5  from the year ago due to the timing of customer purchases in the U S 
Gardasil Gardasil 9 sales climbed 41  to  532 million 
Zepatier brought in sales of  378 million  up from  229 million in the fourth quarter of 2016  due to ongoing launches 
Meanwhile  combined sales of Remicade  lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region   Nasonex  generic version launched in the U S  in Mar 2016   Cubicin  lost patent protection in the U S  in Jun 2016  and Zetia  lost market exclusivity in the U S  in Dec 2016  declined by  686 million in the quarter 
Sales of Remicade  marketed in partnership with Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ    continue to be dampened by biosimilar competition with biosimilars benefiting from increased new patient starts as well as patient switching  In this regard  note that Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   launched its Inflectra injection  a biosimilar version of Remicade  in the U S  in late Nov 2016 
Merck s Animal Health segment posted revenues of  939 million  up 13  from the year ago quarter  primarily driven by higher sales of companion animal products 
Adjusted gross margins came in at 77 8  compared to 77  in the year ago quarter  Marketing and administrative  M A  expenses increased 3  to  2 4 billion in the reported quarter  Research and development  R D  spend increased 14  to  1 8 billion in the quarter  due to the timing of customer purchases in the United States 
2017 Guidance
Merck updated its 2017 earnings and revenues guidance  The company now expects adjusted earnings in the range of  3 76  3 88  an increase from the earlier figure of  3 72  3 87 per share  including approximately 1 5  negative foreign exchange impact  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was  3 83 per share 
Merck now expects revenues in the range of  39 1  40 3 billion  compared to the earlier forecast of  38 6 billion  40 1 billion  including negative currency impact of approximately 1 5   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  39 7 billion was well within the updated guidance 

Merck   Company  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Our TakeMerck s first quarter earnings were encouraging as the company beat both on sales and earnings driven by Keytruda sales along with upside from vaccines and animal health franchises  The growth in Keytruda more than offset the decline in sales from Zetia  Januvia  and Remicade among others  We expect investors to focus on the upcoming PDUFA dates for Keytruda for the treatment of patients with metastatic or advanced NSCLC regardless of PD L1 expression  May 10  and for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer  Jun 14  Another pharma giant Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   is also facing loss of exclusivity for many of its key drugs in the emerging markets Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ",2017-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/merck-(mrk)-beats-on-q1-earnings---sales,-ups-annual-view-200186546",200186546

172786,394302,LLY,Novartis  NVS  In Licenses Ophthalmic Drug From Lubris LLC,opinion,"Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   recently announced that it has exercised an option to in license ECF843 for ophthalmic indications worldwide  outside Europe  from Lubris LLC 

A look at Novartis  share price movement over the past one year shows that the stock has underperformed the Zacks classified  industry  Novartis  stock decreased 1 9  during this period  while the industry gained 1 9  
The company did not provide any financial details  The closing of the deal is subject to customary closing conditions that includes regulatory approvals 
We note that ECF843 is a recombinant human lubricin  rh Lubricin  protein  developed by Lubris  ECF843 demonstrated the potential to provide immediate improvement of symptoms by increasing lubrication across various eye and tear surfaces as well as an improvement in signs of dry eye within 28 days without reporting treatment related adverse events 
We note that Novartis has a diverse portfolio in ophthalmology and dry eye treatments with a global portfolio of artificial tear products that includes Systane  Tears Naturale and Genteal 
In Dec 2016  the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Encore Vision  Inc   a privately held company focused on the development of a novel treatment for presbyopia to strengthen its ophthalmology portfolio  The transaction will add Encore Vision s lead candidate  EV06  a first in class disease modifying topical treatment for presbyopia to the company s ophthalmology pipeline  Financial details of the transaction were  however  not disclosed 
We note that Novartis combined its retina medicines business with the Alcon pharmaceuticals business in 2016 which is now operating as one ophthalmology franchise under Novartis Pharmaceuticals 
The performance of the Alcon business has been disappointing due to lower surgical equipments sales owing to competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases  Novartis is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business to separation via a capital markets transaction such as a spin off or an initial public offering 
We remind investors that Novartis broadened its oncology portfolio by acquiring GlaxoSmithKline plc s   NYSE GSK   certain oncology products and pipeline compounds in Mar 2015 after having divested its Animal Health Division to Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY    In Oct 2015  it acquired a portfolio of cancer immunotherapies through the acquisition of Admune Therapeutics and added bispecific antibodies through a collaboration with Xencor  Inc    NASDAQ XNCR   in Jun 2016 
Going forward  we expect approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones to bode well for Novartis  Also  strong performance of growth products should be able to offset the impact of generic competition for Gleevec

172790,394306,LLY,Infinity Pharmaceuticals Focuses On Lead Candidate IPI 549,opinion,"We issued an updated report on Infinity Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ INFI   on Apr 7 
Infinity s share price shows that the company has outperformed the Zacks classified  industry year to date  The stock rose 79 3  compared with the industry s gain of 0 2  

The company is currently focused on the development of its lead immuno oncology candidate  IPI 549  In Nov 2016  it had entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   to evaluate IPI 549 in combination with the latter s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo in patients with advanced solid tumors  Once the dose escalation phase on the combination is complete  an expansion phase will evaluate the combination in patients with selected solid tumors  including non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  SCCHN  in the second half of 2017  In 2017  Infinity plans to report phase I data from the monotherapy dose escalation phase and the IPI 549 plus Opdivo dose escalation phase 
In fact  Infinity s progress with IPI 549 has been impressive  Moreover  clinical trial collaboration with Bristol Myers has provided the company with a strong partner with expertise in the field of immuno oncology  In addition  it is likely to allow Infinity to expedite the development of IPI 549 
In Oct 2016  the company entered into a license agreement with Verastem under which it granted exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize its oncology candidate duvelisib to the latter  The agreement will see Infinity receiving up to  28 million across two milestone payments    6 million upon positive data  currently anticipated in the first half of 2017  from the randomized monotherapy phase III DUO study in patients with relapsed refractory CLL and  22 million upon the first regulatory approval of duvelisib inside or outside of the U S  In addition  Infinity is eligible to receive tiered mid to high single digit royalties on net sales of duvelisib  subject to approval  It will also be responsible for the royalties on net sales of duvelisib owed by the company to Mundipharma International Corporation and Purdue Pharmaceutical  Overall  we are optimistic about the deal as it is expected to provide Infinity with much needed funds 
In fact  Infinity has undergone a total of four restructuring drives since Jun 2016  This  in turn  has led to reduction of its employee headcount by an aggregate of 174 positions  representing approximately 79  from the Dec 31  2015  The company also announced that it will grant the rights to develop and commercialize duvelisib to Verastem  The company is also evaluating its current facility leases 
But besides IPI 549  Infinity has no approved product in its portfolio at the moment  This has led the company to totally depend on this particular candidate for growth  Consequently  too much focus on the successful development and approval of only one candidate might result in regulatory setbacks related to IPI 549 
Currently  Infinity faces stiff competition in the fields of immuno oncology from companies like Bristol Myers  AstraZeneca Plc   NYSE AZN    Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   Merck  NYSE MRK   Novartis  Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Roche and Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   among others

Analysis   conclusion  The health care sector has been written about previously  here and   Our positions haven t changed with a sector underweight  and the largest single position being Pfizer  NYSE PFE   which looks due for a bounce  Biotech is technically in good shape  but stopped rallying a few days after the election 
Health Care could become a victim of the  relative value  or  relative earnings growth  syndome  as one sector that has been a leader in the weaker  low return markets of the last few years  it could be that investors are rotating out of Health Care into sectors like Financials and Basic Materials  as these sectors will benefit directly from specific growth initiatives of the new President and Administration 
The fact is Health Care has more defensive characteristics  and with a full on economic growth agenda being planned  that consistent  stable earnings growth may not be as valued as it was in a no growth environment 
The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  NASDAQ IBB  remains technically intact while the iShares US Pharmaceuticals Fund  NYSE IHE  looks to be in better shape than the VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical Fund  NASDAQ PPH   although the PPH ETF will be given more time  A heavy volume trade through and close below  50  and the PPH would likely be sold

172858,394374,LLY,How Tweets from Bernie Sanders Lowered Eli Lilly Stock Prices,opinion,"On his Twitter feed  Senator Bernie Sanders has highlighted a variety of news topics ranging from Native Americans to the Dakota Access Pipeline and the AT T Inc  NYSE T  Time Warner Inc  NYSE TWX  merger  However  his comments on pharmaceutical prices in general and the cost of insulin in particular have drawn the biggest reaction  On October 30 and 31  2016  he blasted Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   the makers of EpiPen  and stated that  the entire pharmaceutical industry is out of control   Sanders then posted several infographics showing disparities between the prices of popular pharmaceuticals  such as Crestor  Abilify and Celebrex  in the United States and Canada 
On November 1  Sanders singled out Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY   Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb  and other companies that manufacture insulin  Health care analysts have reported that the prices of some insulin products have increased by 700 percent since 1997  A vial of Lilly s Humalog that used to cost less than  20 now costs nearly  140  He also criticized Sanofi  PA SASY  s insulin product Lantus Solostar  which costs  70 in France and  450 in America 
Following the controversial tweets  Eli Lilly stock prices slumped by as much as 2 7 percent falling to  71 per share  Just a few weeks earlier  the company s stock topped  83  a price that was close to its 2016 high in January  The October rise was due to an announcement that Lilly s subsidiary would acquire Boehringer Ingelheim s rabies vaccine portfolio  However  year to date figures show that Eli Lilly stock prices are down by more than 13 percent

	Revenues for the quarter grew 1  to  9 8 billion  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Currency movement negatively impacted revenues by 2  The Quarter in Detail
	Merck s Pharmaceutical segment posted revenues of  8 7 billion  up 2   Products like Keytruda  Cubicin and ProQuad performed well  New product  Keytruda  brought in sales of  314 million in the second quarter of 2016  up from  249 million in the first quarter of 2016  Sales continue to be driven by new indications and geographical expansion  Zetia Vytorin sales grew 4  to  994 million reflecting the impact of price increases for Zetia in the U S

	Merck s second quarter earnings were better than expected  while revenues were in line  The top line will remain under pressure mainly due to increased competition as well as generic competition  Merck will continue to look toward cost cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line 

	We are encouraged by the company s efforts to expand its pipeline and focus on core areas of expertise  The company has made significant progress with its pipeline and is working on bringing new products to market  New products like Keytruda should contribute meaningfully to the top line

On the other hand  shares of Bristol Myers rival Merck   NYSE MRK   are surging more than 10  because its drug Keytruda  which competes with Opdivo  was more successful in a similar trial recently  Bristol Myers did open its study to a wider patient population  exposing itself to more risk  but it looks like investors are willing to call this a win for Merck right now

With Bristol Myers being such a massive entity in the pharmaceutical industry  today s news is incredibly important for the market  The stock is now down about 8  on the year  and it makes sense that investors may be looking a different direction 
Luckily  the Zacks Rank indicates that a couple of other stocks in the large cap pharmaceutical industry might be better options right now  The first one we ll look at is Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ    which is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
In comparison to an industry that has remained relatively flat in 2016  shares of Johnson   Johnson have gained a little over 20  year to date  The company has a ridiculous track record of beating earnings expectations  consistently outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate for nearly a decade  Johnson   Johnson has also seen ten positive estimate revisions for its full year earnings within the past 30 days 
Another stock to note right now is Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY    another Zacks Rank  2  Buy   While Eli Lily and Co  has struggled throughout the year  shares have bounced back  gaining nearly 8 5  over the last 12 weeks  In its most recent earnings report  the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  and analysts have been busy revising estimates for the remainder of the year 
In the past 30 days  we ve seen three positive estimate revisions for the company s current quarter earnings versus just one negative revision  In that same timeframe  we ve seen four positive revisions for Eli Lilly and Co  s full year earnings  In just the past week  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s earnings has gone up by a penny 
Despite the negative news from Bristol Myers today  pharma investors can see that estimate revision activity points to other stocks right now ",2016-08-05,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/bristol-myers-tanks,-buy-these-two-large-cap-pharma-stocks-instead-200146452",200146452

172904,394420,LLY,Eli Lilly s Future Is Changing,opinion,"Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY  is a blue chip stock that has paid a consistent dividend since the early 1970s 
The company s total dividends paid have increased from 4 55 cents per share in 1972 to a projected  2 04 per share in fiscal year 2016 
However  the company s dividend growth rate has materially slowed  and the dividend payout ratio is now over 80  
Should investors be concerned that Eli Lilly could be poised for years of flat dividends or possibly even a cut to the dividend 
Let s take a look at the business Business AnalysisEli Lilly is a global pharmaceutical company with an operating history that dates back to the late 1800s  In 2015  they generated sales of nearly  20 billion  which is down from the recent peak of  24 3 billion in 2011 
In general  the pharmaceutical industry can be a pretty good space to invest in for dividend investors seeking a stable dividend income over time 
Dividend investors do not have to worry about economic cycles or cyclical end markets leading to an unanticipated dividend cut when investing in this recession resistant industry 
Besides analyzing all the usual important financial ratios  dividend investors instead need to pay attention to the quality of the product portfolio and pipeline of new products along with any significant legal issues the company could have outstanding 
Eli Lilly operates the business through two business segments   human pharmaceutical products  84  of sales  and animal health products  16   
The Human Pharmaceutical Products business produces therapeutics targeting areas including endocrine  neuroscience  oncology  and cardiovascular  Their key drugs targeting these markets are Humalog  diabetes   Alimta  cancer   Forteo  osteoporosis   Cialis  cardiovascular   and Cymbalta  depression   They have 6 different billion dollar revenue drugs  and their top ten drugs add up to nearly 70  of sales 
The Animal Health Products business produces drugs for companion animals as well as farm animals  In January 2015  they completed the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health for  5 3 billion dollars to improve their competitive position within the market  particularly within companion animal and swine markets 
Like many other large pharmaceutical companies  Eli Lilly recently transitioned through a difficult time with a patent expiration in many key drugs  They lost patent protection on Zyprexa  2010 revenue of  5 billion   Cymbalta  2012 revenue of  5 billion   and Humalog  2012 revenue  2 4 billion  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
However  they are not completely out of the woods yet  Over the next few years they face patent expiration in key markets for large products including Alimta  13  of sales   Cialis  11    Forteo  7    Cymbalta  4    Zyprexa  4    Strattera  3    and Effient  2   
Thankfully  Eli Lilly invests around 20  of sales in research and development  above peers who average in the mid teens 
These investments have resulted in a rather robust pipeline of new products in their late stage pipeline and even a few recent introductions to the market 
The major therapeutics investors need to keep an eye on are Jardiance  Type 2 diabetes   Baricitinib  Rheumatoid arthritis   Taltz  Psoriasis   and Solanezumab  Alzheimer s  
The revenue potential from these products is expected to be quite significant  Jardiance has already been launched and is expected to be a multibillion dollar product  While Baricitinib and Taltz aren t expected to have the same sales potential as Jardiance  they are both expected to be billion dollar plus selling drugs 
The real question mark in Eli Lilly s late stage pipeline is Solanezumab  which is used to treat Alzheimer s 
The benefits to patients and sales potential from this therapeutic could be substantial  but to date no pharmaceutical company has been approved for a treatment that has proven to slow Alzheimer s effects  In other words  Solanezumab remains a long shot 
When the entire pipeline and recent launches are considered  Eli Lilly is positioned to have the potential to launch 20 new products in 10 years  2014 through 2023   This gives the management team confidence in their projections for at least 5  annual revenue growth through the rest of the decade despite key drugs coming off patent protection 
Furthermore  shareholders should benefit from improved margins at the company  The management team has committed to an OPEX to revenue ratio of 50  or less in 2018  This would represent an improvement from a GAAP OPEX to revenue ratio of nearly 58  in 2015 
Clearly if management is able to execute on this margin improvement from increased efficiency in R D and marketing  selling  and administrative costs  it would be a great achievement and would allow for significant dividend increases Dividend Safety Analysis  Eli LillyWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Eli Lilly s dividend and fundamental data charts can all be seen by  
Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  A score of 50 is average  75 or higher is considered excellent  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Investors can learn more about our Dividend Safety Scores and view their track record  
Eli Lilly s Dividend Safety Score is 59  which indicates that the dividend is somewhat safer than the average stock in the market and unlikely to be cut 
If Eli Lilly is able to execute on their strategy and the recent drug launches meet expectations  the company s dividend safety will continue to rise 
The company expects 2016 non GAAP EPS of  3 50  3 60 with the major difference between GAAP and non GAAP being amortization of intangible assets from recent acquisitions  As dividend investors  we feel comfortable with this adjustment as this is a non cash charge 
If the company maintains the  0 51 per share quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter of 2016 like we expect  then the company s payout ratio would be around 57  for 2016 
This is much healthier than the 88  payout ratio the company reported in 2014 and 2015 and puts the company closer to its historical payout ratio in the 45 65  range over the past decade Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Let s take a closer look at some of the other important drivers of the Dividend Safety Score 
As of the end of the second quarter 2016  Eli Lilly had  9 3 billion dollars of debt of which  646 million is due within a year  This debt is offset by cash of  3 2 billion dollars  making total net debt  6 1 billion 
This is a very comfortable amount of debt for the company as illustrated by a net debt to EBIT ratio of just 1 6x 
Furthermore  the company s EBIT Interest expense ratio is very healthy at over 20x  Dividend investors can feel comfortable that the company isn t over leveraged  Eli Lilly also maintains healthy investment grade credit ratings with the major agencies Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The company has also been a consistent free cash flow generator over time  which is what we would expect from this recession proof business Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The main reason for the decrease in free cash flow in 2015 was due to non core business reasons  change in deferred income taxes and payments for interest rate swaps  rather than a deterioration in the business 
Thus  dividend investors should not worry about the greater than 100  free cash flow payout ratio in 2015 Source  Simply Safe Dividends Dividend Growth AnalysisOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Eli Lilly s Divided Growth Score is only 29  which indicates that the company s dividend growth potential is below average 
However  Eli Lilly s management has announced that they plan to return to annual dividend increases for shareholders after keeping the dividend relatively constant since 2009 at  1 96 per share 
The company did a slight dividend increase in 2015 and is on track to do the same in 2016  but these were not major payout raises  roughly 2    As seen below  dividend growth has steadily decelerated over the last 20 years Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Management s confidence for publicly committing to annual dividend increases comes from their conviction in the pipeline and recently launched products 
Chairman  President   CEO John Lechleiter said it best himself of the  
 Finally with the strength of our current business and pipeline  we plan to return to annual dividend increases to our shareholders beginning in December of this year  and to return excess cash via share repurchases  
In terms of the magnitude of the expected dividend increases  the company is in the same boat as investors   they really aren t sure  Here is John Lechleiter with some more commentary from the second quarter 2016 call 
  So with those caveats  I think that we feel very comfortable providing that as a framework for investors thinking about Lilly in the next five years with all these potential scenarios  a number of which could provide upside above this number and then coupled with the guidance we ve given about not only our operating  or OpEx to sales  but this morning reaffirming our belief that we could also improve our gross margin as a percentage of sales over this period as well  
While we don t expect Eli Lilly to increase their yearly dividend payments in the double digits  we feel comfortable forecasting low  to mid single digit dividend increases as long as the new product launches are successful and the pipeline meets exceptions ValuationEli Lilly currently trades at nearly 22x 2016 earnings estimates and offers a dividend yield of 2 6  
Assuming that management can execute on their strategy  sales should grow in the mid single digits with additional growth in free cash flow coming from margin expansion  This should lead to earnings growth in the high single to low double digits over the next five years 
While this certainly appears bullish for the stock  investors are paying a premium for those future earnings today 
Thus  we would expect the P E multiple to come down overtime so expected annual returns from investing in Eli Lilly are probably closer to 7  than to the higher expected earnings growth rate ConclusionEli Lilly is emerging from a very difficult time period due to large patent expirations over the last five years 
Furthermore  the company is not completely out of the woods yet due to some major drugs losing patent exclusivity over the next two years  It is a testament to the business model and management team that the company didn t have to cut their dividend during this difficult stretch 
Conversely  if new therapeutic introductions meet expectations  the promising pipeline proves itself out  and management executes on margin expansion plans  then investors look poised to reapyears of predictable dividend increases 
At a current valuation of nearly 22x this year s expected earnings  investors seem to be giving the company credit for their pipeline and new product introductions 
While we are not opposed to investing in pharmaceutical companies  we would prefer to invest in a company that has its expected growth coming from products that are more proven 
This is especially the case when we are paying a valuation premium and only generating a 2 6  dividend yield  which isn t really enough dividend income for retirement living 
Thus  for now we are keeping our capital invested in the current companies in our  instead ",2016-08-29,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eli-lilly's-future-is-changing-200150653,200150653

172954,394470,LLY,Incyte Gains On Jakafi s Breakthrough Status For Acute GVHD,opinion,"Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy status to Jakafi  outside the U S   Jakavi  for the treatment of patients suffering from acute graft versus host disease  GVHD   Incyte s shares gained 4  on the news 
We note that the FDA usually grants Breakthrough Therapy status to expedite the development and review of drugs for the treatment of serious or life threatening conditions  and to help ensure that people have access to them through FDA approval as soon as possible  In order to obtain this status  preliminary clinical evidence is required demonstrating that the drug may have clinically significant improvement over available therapy 
We are encouraged by the FDA granting Breakthrough Therapy status to Jakafi for acute GVHD  Currently  there are no approved treatments for patients with acute GVHD 
Incyte expects to initiate a pivotal development program on Jakafi for GVHD in the second half of 2016 
We remind investors that Incyte and Eli Lilly and Co    NYSE LLY   agreed to amend their license  development and commercialization agreement in Mar 2016 to enable the former to independently develop and commercialize Jakafi for GVHD 
Subsequently in Apr 2016  Incyte and Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   also agreed to amend their collaboration and license agreement granting the latter the rights to research  develop and commercialize Jakafi for GVHD outside the U S 
We note that Jakafi is approved in the U S  for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea  It is also approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis  MF   including primary MF  post polycythemia vera MF  and post essential thrombocythemia MF  While Incyte markets the drug in the U S   it is marketed by Novartis outside the country

172971,394487,LLY,Crude Oil Continues To Descend While Dollar Jumps,opinion,"After yesterday s sharp nosedive on global growth concerns and a flare up in the Middle East  investors today were treated to a tumultuous session  as the clear uncertainty supplied the markets sizable swings back and forth across the flatline  only to finish mixed and nearly where they began  Treasuries were far less volatile  but finishing mixed amid the insecurity  while crude oil prices continued to descend  gold was modestly higher and the U S  dollar jumped  News on the equity front was headlined by lackluster December sales figures from the automakers 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  rose 10 points  0 1   to 17 159  the S P 500 Index gained 4 points  0 2   to 2 017  but the Nasdaq Composite fell 12 points  0 2   to 4 891  In moderate volume  864 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 9 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq  WTI crude oil fell  0 79 to  35 97 per barrel  but wholesale gasoline lost  0 03 to  1 29 per gallon  while the Bloomberg gold spot price increased  4 00 to  1 078 61 per ounce  Elsewhere  the dollar index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was 0 5  higher at 99 37 
The major automakers reported U S  December sales today  with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV s  N FCAU  9  Chrysler brand posting adjusted sales growth of 4 5  year over year  y y   compared to the 11 3  gain estimated by FactSet  The figures are being adjusted to account for two more selling days this year compared to the same period a year ago  Ford Motor Co   N F  14  posted an adjusted 0 7  y y rise in sales  below the forecasted 4 9  gain  while General Motors Co s  N GM  32  sales declined 1 8   compared to the projected 3 8  growth  FCAU was slightly higher  while F and GM were both lower 
Eli Lilly and Co   N LLY  84  traded higher after the company reaffirmed its full year 2015 guidance  but it issued a full year 2016 outlook that missed expectations 
Smith   Wesson Holding Corp   O SWHC  26  rallied after the firearm manufacturer raised its 3Q and full year guidance  due to a stronger than expected sell through rate of its products and data for the month of December indicating  strong growth  versus the same period a year ago 
Treasuries mixed in midst of uneasy global markets 
Treasuries finished higher  while the U S  economic calendar was void of any major releases today  Bond yields declined yesterday courtesy of the global equity market selloff centered on Chinese growth concerns following another dose of disappointing manufacturing data  as well as elevated tensions in the Middle East that flared up over the weekend  The yield on the 2 year note declined 2 basis points  bps  to 1 02   the yield on the 10 year note was flat at 2 25   while the 30 year bond rate gained 2 bps to 3 01  
Tomorrow s domestic economic calendar will be robust  with ADP s private sector payroll report expected to show 198 000 jobs were gained in December  the trade balance forecasted to show the deficit widened slightly to  44 0 billion in November  and factory orders projected to show a 0 2  month over month dip  However  the headlining releases will likely be the ISM and Markit s services sector reads  expected to show expansion for the sector accelerated slightly in December  while the day will culminate with the Federal Reserve s December meeting minutes  after which the Central Bank hiked rates for the first time since before the financial crisis 
In contrast to a weakening manufacturing sector  the services side of the economy  representing 88  of U S  activity  remained healthy throughout 2015 and looks to continue that performance entering 2016  Also  the Fed has bent over backwards to soothe concerns by noting its desire to move gradually  allowing for the economy and markets to adjust  Slow rate hiking cycles have typically been positive for stocks  A key determinant of the pace at which the Fed continues to raise rates is likely to center around the U S  dollar  with continued strength likely slowing the pace  while any sustained countertrend moves in the dollar  commodity prices or inflation could trigger a faster pace  We believe this will remain a focus by investors in 2016  and is likely to contribute to some of the volatility we believe will persist across the equity and fixed income markets 
Europe recovers somewhat from yesterday s drop  Asia mostly lower in volatile action  European equities finished higher  recovering some of yesterday s selloff that was the worst start to a year ever for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index  per Bloomberg  as data caused a flare up in Chinese economic growth concerns and tensions in the Middle East escalated  Stocks in the region may have found some support from a drop in the euro versus the U S  dollar  as well as reports of a plethora of measures from Chinese authorities to try to stabilize the markets  Bond yields in the region traded lower  while economic reports showed German unemployment fell more than expected in December  and the eurozone consumer price inflation estimate rose by a smaller amount than anticipated for last month 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly to the downside in volatile action in the wake of yesterday s global selloff that came amid economic growth concerns following disappointing Chinese data and escalated tensions in the Middle East  Mainland Chinese and stocks in Hong Kong declined modestly  as the markets recovered somewhat on signs that Chinese authorities stepped in to try to stabilize the markets  China s central bank conducted the biggest liquidity injection into the markets since September  after it intervened to support the yuan  which has fallen sharply as of late to exacerbate sentiment 
Also  Chinese state controlled funds were said to have bought equities and the country s securities regulator signaled that a selling ban on major investors will remain beyond this week s expiration date  per Bloomberg  which cited people familiar with the matter 
Japanese securities declined as well  extending yesterday s drop which was the worst start to a year since 2008  per Bloomberg  with the yen remaining near a two month high following yesterday s rally on the uneasy global sentiment  Meanwhile  Australian equities fell markedly amid broad based weakness  led by oil and gas issues as oil prices continued to slide despite the heightened geopolitical concerns  Rounding out the day  markets in India declined  while South Korean listings bucked the trend  finishing higher with the won showing some weakness 
Tomorrow s international economic calendar will be dominated by the Services and Composite PMIs from Markit across Europe  while investors will also get employment figures from Italy  PPI data from the eurozone and housing prices from the U K

Celldex Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ CLDX  is coming along nicely  On Tuesday  it was up 25 cents to 25 73  or 1   on 1 2 million shares  When the base was forming in early 2014  a swing was put on it  it broke out in early 2015  and worked its way up very nicely in a 5 wave advance  Since then it s had many 5 wave declines  or consolidations  that have lasted for the last three and a half months  So  it looks like this stock is getting ready for something  It s been moving up  the volume has increased a little  and it s right underneath resistance at the 50 day moving average at 25 87  and closed about 14 cents underneath that  If it gets a punch through here  and takes out the recent highs around 26 84  look for it to head up towards the short term target at 30  then 32 1 2  and then 36 
Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY  has been doing great  During the last year and a half  it has gone from the 47 range all the way up to Tuesday s high at 88 78  After the big run up in June  it spiked on heavy volume  formed a nice  bullish falling wedge  popped  broke out  but there was no follow through  It then had another 3 day pullback on low volume  and was followed by the last four up days in a row  On Tuesday  it broke out  and popped out of the wedge  up 2 38 to 88 73  or 2 76   on 6 9 million shares  It appears this stock wants to go to the low to mid 90 s  Look for 95 6 as its target 
Radius Health  Inc   NASDAQ RDUS  swing trade is acting great as well  It had a breakout mid June  a swing was put on it  it popped  pulled back  and is now in a rising wedge  which is sometimes very bullish in an uptrend  If it maintains volume and breaks out above the 17 1 2 range in the next couple days  it could run to 80  and then near 100 
TG Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ TGTX  is a swing trade that appears to be setting up nicely  It formed a little head and shoulders  popped through the neckline  then pulled back from resistance  and formed a nice little flag  On Tuesday  it broke out  up only 35 cents to 17 47  or 2   but volume is pushing up to nearly a million shares  If it can get through this zone  which it looks like it s going to do  look for it to move up towards 20  and beyond 20 to the mid 20 s

172993,394509,LLY,Sell This Pharma Stock Before It Goes Limp  LLY,opinion,"Would you take a drug that caused side effects such as headaches  muscle pain  dizziness  vomiting  uncontrollable flatulence  intestinal bleeding  blindness  or gynecomastia  man boobs  
I bet you re shouting   No  
But if the benefits of the drug far outweighed the risks   and the risks themselves weren t inherently great   you might change your mind 
Similarly  when deciding whether to make an investment  we need to assess the risks and potential reward 
Of course  this isn t a perfect analogy  Unlike the probability of adverse effects from drugs  investment risks tend to vary significantly over time  In particular  many healthcare stocks have dramatically different risk profiles than they did in the past 
Yet  few investors have seemed to notice 
That s partly because the  does have a lot to offer  Conservative investors have been drawn to the defensive qualities of the drug and medical device producers  while more aggressive traders and investors have gravitated towards high growth biotechnology stocks 
Accordingly  the healthcare sector has been a stellar performer over the past five years  The Health Care Select Sector SPDR  N XLV  has produced a total return of 142 3  compared with a 90 3  return for the SPDR S P 500  N SPY  
But that sort of outperformance has significantly altered the risk return prospects for many healthcare stocks 
Eli Lilly and Company  N LLY   a major pharmaceutical company  is perhaps the best example  Not many people found Eli Lilly attractive in late 2010 because its stock wasn t going up  Ironically  the stock has been on a tear ever since  gaining 159  on a total return basis  Plain and simple  LLY is in a sector that caught fire  and it became a momentum stock 
As a result  Eli Lilly s valuation is now sky high  The following chart shows Eli Lilly s enterprise value to EBITDA multiple and price to sales ratio over the past 10 years 

Here  the effects of the healthcare biotech boom are clearly evident as the company s valuation has reached a stratospheric level in 2015 
However  we can t lose sight of the underlying fundamentals of the company when risk appetites in the market are so high  The following table compares various metrics for Eli Lilly to their levels at the end of 2010 

Eli Lilly s revenue has actually declined over the past five years  in large part due to expiring patents  Operating profit has shrunk from  6 5 billion all the way down to  2 3 billion 
Meanwhile  Eli Lilly s profit margin has been cut nearly in half  It ll be very challenging to return margins to their prior levels for a variety of reasons  For example  the patent on Cialis  a high margin erectile dysfunction drug  expires in 2017  Also  there s been increased scrutiny on drug pricing in the media and on the Presidential campaign trail 
It seems as though Eli Lilly will need a few drugs from its internal development pipeline to become blockbusters just to prevent revenues and margins from deteriorating even further 
On top of all that  the company s net debt  debt minus cash  has soared 
Because of these negative trends and slow growth prospects  Eli Lilly s ridiculous valuation isn t warranted  LLY isn t a growth stock  but it is trading at growth stock multiples 
Unsurprisingly  most large caps with such high valuations   even those with higher growth   perform poorly  So  even if your heart is healthy enough for stock market activity  it s best to stay away 
To drive this point home  I ran a backtest  Let s just say someone went off their anti psychotic medication and decided they were only going to own ultra expensive  large cap dividend payers 
The following chart shows the performance of dividend paying stocks  ex financials  with market caps greater than  10 billion and EV EBITDA multiples greater than 20 times 

Over the past 10 years  you would have actually lost money if you followed a strategy of buying these richly valued stocks and equally weighting them in a portfolio every quarter  The S P 500 had far better results 
Thus  if you hold LLY   or any overvalued dividend payer   for more than four hours  please seek medical attention immediately ",2015-10-21,Alan Gula,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sell-this-pharma-stock-before-it-goes-limp-268806,268806

Conclusion
Neutral  Price to book of 1 9  In three Phase 1 clinical trials  Shareholders may buy  15mm
CALA is currently conducting three Phase 1 clinical trials of CB 839 in the United States in patients with solid tumors  leukemias  lymphomas and multiple myeloma  To put the conclusions and observations in context  the following is reorganized  edited and summarized from the full S 1 referenced above 
Business  CALA is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs directed against tumor metabolism and tumor immunology targets for the treatment of cancer 
Tumor metabolism and tumor immunology have emerged as promising new fields for cancer drug discovery  and recent clinical successes with therapeutic agents in each field have demonstrated the potential to create fundamentally new therapies for cancer patients 
CALA s lead product candidate  CB 839  is an internally discovered  first in class inhibitor of glutaminase  a critical enzyme in tumor metabolism 
CALA is currently evaluating CB 839 in three Phase 1 clinical trials in solid and hematological tumors  CALA s lead preclinical program in tumor immunology is directed at developing inhibitors of the enzyme arginase and may provide a first in class therapeutic agent for this novel target 
CALA s ongoing research efforts are focused on discovering additional product candidates against novel tumor metabolism and immunology targets 
The field of tumor metabolism seeks to exploit the unique ways in which cancer cells take up and utilize nutrients in order to grow and survive  It is now recognized that cancer cells rely on certain metabolic processes  or pathways  to a much greater extent than normal cells 
The enhanced use of these pathways by cancer cells often results in a dependence on  or  addiction  to  these pathways that is not observed in normal cells  This creates an opportunity to selectively suppress the growth of cancer cells with therapeutic agents that specifically target these metabolic pathways 
CALA s lead product candidate in tumor metabolism  CB 839  takes advantage of the pronounced dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival  CB 839 inhibits glutaminase  an enzyme required by cancer cells to utilize glutamine effectively  In preclinical studies  CB 839 demonstrated broad antitumor activity in tumor cell lines  inhibited the growth of human tumors in animal models and was well tolerated in toxicity studies 
CB 839 was also synergistic with several approved cancer therapeutics that are part of the current standard of care 
CALA is currently conducting three Phase 1 clinical trials of CB 839 in the United States in patients with solid tumors  leukemias  lymphomas and multiple myeloma 
The purpose of these trials is to evaluate the safety of CB 839 both as a single agent and in combination with approved therapies and to seek preliminary evidence of efficacy 
CALA anticipates completing the ongoing single agent dose escalation stage of these trials by the end of 2014 
CALA then plans to enroll patient cohorts in select tumor types predicted to be sensitive to CB 839 based on results from its preclinical studies 
CB 839 will be tested in these tumor types either as a single agent or in combination with approved therapies 
CALA expects data to be available from its single agent trials in mid 2015 and from its combination trials in late 2015 
Pending input from the U S  Food and Drug Administration  or the FDA  on the results of CALA s Phase 1 trials and its Phase 2 trial protocols  CALA plans to initiate in late 2015 or early 2016 one or more Phase 2 clinical trials to study CB 839 as a single agent or in combination with approved therapies 
CALA believes CB 839 has the potential to be an important new therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of a broad range of cancers and is the only selective glutaminase inhibitor currently in clinical trials 
CALA s clinical program seeks to identify cancers that will be most sensitive to CB 839 to allow the greatest benefit for patients and to pursue the most efficient path to regulatory approval 
CALA currently retains all commercial rights to CB 839 and have been granted a U S  patent which includes composition of matter coverage for CB 839 through 2032 
Intellectual property As of June 30  2014  the intellectual property portfolio for CALA s tumor metabolism program  which includes CB 839  consists of one issued U S  patent directed to composition of matter for CB 839  which expires in 2032 
CALA also has six pending U S  patent applications and 17 corresponding pending PCT and foreign patent applications directed to compositions of matter for CB 839 and related chemical compounds  as well as methods of using these compounds 
These pending patent applications also include one pending U S  patent application relating to methods for measuring various biomarkers in cancer patients to identify patients suitable for treatment with glutaminase inhibitors 
With respect to CALA s tumor immunology program  which includes the preclinical development of its arginase inhibitor  CALA considers trade secrets and know how to be CALA primary intellectual property 
Trade secrets and know how can be difficult to protect  Despite CALA s efforts to protect its trade secrets  its competitors may discover its trade secrets  either through breach of its confidentiality agreements  independent development  or publication of information including its trade secrets 
Competition CALA s principal competitors in the field of tumor metabolism include Advanced Cancer Therapeutics  LLC  Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ AGIO   Astrazeneca Plc  NYSE AZN   Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals  Inc   Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY   Forma Therapeutics Holdings  LLC  Glaxosmithkline plc  NYSE GSK   Novartis International AG  OTC NVSEF   Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE     3 V Biosciences  Inc   and Roche Holding Ltd  OTC RHHBY   and its subsidiary Genentech Inc

173035,394551,LLY,Eli Lilly s Cyramza Misses Primary Goal In Liver Cancer Study,opinion,"Eli Lilly s  NYSE LLY  oncology treatment  Cyramza  failed to meet the primary endpoint in a global  randomized  double blind study  REACH  conducted in hepatocellular  liver  cancer patients 
Cyramza plus best supportive care was compared to placebo plus best supportive care for the second line treatment of patients who have been treated with Nexavar  sorafenib  in the first line setting  Although overall survival favored the Cyramza arm  results were not statistically significant 
Meanwhile  meaningful improvements in key secondary endpoints like progression free survival  overall response rate and time to progression were observed with single agent Cyramza  Safety data was in line with that seen in previous studies conducted with single agent Cyramza 
Eli Lilly intends to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss the overall efficacy especially that seen in specific subpopulations 
The results are disappointing as Cyramza s label expansion would increase the commercial potential of the treatment significantly  Eli Lilly has faced a setback with Cyramza earlier too when it failed to achieve the primary endpoint in a phase III breast cancer study 
Eli Lilly has orphan drug status for Cyramza for liver cancer in the U S  as well as the EU  Liver cancer  once it advances  is very difficult to treat   surgery is no longer an option and with no approved treatments in the second line setting  patients depend on supportive care 
Cyramza is currently approved as a single agent for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in patients whose disease has progressed after treatment with fluoropyrimidine  or platinum containing chemotherapy  Eli Lilly is evaluating Cyramza for second line non small cell lung cancer  regulatory filing scheduled this year  as well as colorectal cancer  phase III data due later this year  
Eli Lilly  which is facing generic competition for drugs like the Zyprexa  Cymbalta and Evista  needs to bring new products to market to help make up for the loss of revenues to genericization
