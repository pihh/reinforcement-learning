118441,339956,FSLR,Best Returns of the Year Lure  Believers  to Clean Energy ETFs,news," Bloomberg     Exchange traded fund investors are finally paying attention to clean energy stocks thanks to a market beating year 
The  439 million Invesco Solar ETF  known by its ticker TAN  has returned 58  this year  outperforming all other unleveraged ETFs in the U S   according to data compiled by Bloomberg  That s spurred the most demand for the fund in five years  with more than  60 million flowing in last quarter 
Despite a recent bout of weakness  clean energy stocks have been on a tear as tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on imported solar equipment gradually decline  Meanwhile  the outlook for greater use of renewables has also improved  further burnishing the appeal of companies like  First Solar Inc   NASDAQ FSLR    one of TAN s largest holdings 
 It s finally gaining some believers   Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said of the ETF 
Two other clean energy funds are also among the year s top 10 performers through Sept  30  The Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF  NYSE XLE  and  State Street  Corp  NYSE STT   s SPDR S P Kensho Clean Power ETF both returned 38  
But price gains aren t solely responsible for investor interest  Renewables have become a mainstream energy source  supplying more power to America s grid than coal for the first time ever in April  Solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of power in two thirds of the world  Meanwhile  the Solar Energy Industries Association recently said the U S  pipeline for utility scale projects had reached 37 9 gigawatts  a record 
In fact  newcomers to clean energy missed much of the sector s advance this year  with TAN s performance in the first half of 2019 significantly outpacing its return in the third quarter 
However  it s easy to understand buyers  caution when you look at the fund s history  Despite this year s advance  TAN has lost 85  since it began trading in April 2008 
 Because there s some maturation of the industry  that could reduce some of the volatility going forward   said Todd Rosenbluth  director of ETF research at CFRA Research   While we think prospects for many of these companies are favorable  these products are not for the faint of heart  ",2019-10-01,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/best-returns-of-the-year-lure-believersto-cleanenergy-etfs-1990381,1990381
118442,339957,FSLR,Judge blocks higher White House tariffs on imported solar panels,news,By Jonathan Stempel  Reuters    A U S  judge overseeing trade issues temporarily blocked the Trump administration on Thursday from reimposing tariffs on some imported double sided solar panels  a defeat for domestic manufacturers that caused shares of some to fall  Judge Gary Katzmann of the U S  Court of International Trade in Manhattan said it was in the public interest to block trade officials from enforcing their decision to eliminate an exemption for so called bifacial solar panels from the tariffs  while opponents challenge it in court  Katzmann s preliminary injunction is a victory for solar farm developers  including Chicago based Invenergy Renewables LLC  that favored the exemption  The office of U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer did not respond to requests for comment  In Thursday trading  shares of  First Solar Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  closed down 4 5   while SunPower Corp fell 3 9   The United States in January 2018 imposed duties on solar panel imports beginning at 30  and expected to drop to 15  by 2021  It exempted bifacial panels on June 12 but yanked the exemption on Oct  4  projecting  significant  increases in imports  Invenergy sued on Oct  22   The court has adopted nearly all of our arguments   Invenergy said in a statement   We are reviewing the order and preparing for the next steps   Bifacial technology is a small but growing part of the solar panel market  costing more but capable of producing greater power than traditional panels  Consumers and importers said higher tariffs would boost their costs and were unnecessary because domestic producers did not make the panels and faced no harm from imports  Domestic producers countered that solar farm developers could use monofacial or bifacial panels  and higher tariffs were needed to protect domestic production  In his 55 page decision  Katzmann said tariff opponents would likely show it was  arbitrary and capricious  to withdraw the exemption   The facts on which USTR relied to implement the withdrawal remain unknown to all but USTR   Katzmann wrote   The public interest is served by ensuring that governmental bodies comply with the law   The Solar Energy Industries Association on Tuesday said tariffs from 2017 to 2021 on imported solar cells and modules would cut private sector investment by  19 billion and cost 62 000 U S  jobs through layoffs or a lack of hiring  SEIA President Abigail Ross Hopper said the trade group would  continue to make the case that the    bifacial exclusion was a fair and reasonable solution to the problem of domestic module supply shortages  ,2019-12-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/judge-blocks-higher-white-house-tariffs-on-imported-solar-panels-2035134,2035134

118456,339971,FSLR,Why First Solar Stock Just Dropped 10 ,news,"What happened
The stock of First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  was flaming out on Wednesday  down 9 8  as of 11 45 a m  EST  and you can blame Barclays Capital 
This morning  the British investment bank threw major shade at this solar stock  Once bullish on the shares  Barclays reversed course today and downgraded First Solar two notches    all the way from overweight to underweight  assigning a target price of  49   

So what
What prompted the downgrade  To date  First Solar has demonstrated  an impressive ability  to book shipments of its Series 6 photovoltaic modules years ahead  Barclays said  Regardless  a review of industry data on 5 000 solar projects in the works or already completed tells the analyst that First Solar s business is now  in trouble  
Specifically  Barclays says the company s systems business has lost 80  of its U S  market share  TheFly com reports  as competitors NextEra Energy  Electricite de France  and Invenergy steal away First Solar s utility scale business  Although First Solar s module production business appears to be doing fine  the analyst thinks this  rapidly declining share  of the solar project market is reason enough to downgrade the stock over the near and medium term 
Now what
What s bad news for First Solar  however  isn t necessarily bad news for the entire U S  solar industry    much less renewable energy stocks in general  In fact  Barclays took pains to explain that  this is not a bear call on U S  solar  but simply a shift in who s winning within the industry right now  
And right now  that s not First Solar ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pig73,2060296
118476,339991,FSLR,First Solar  FSLR  To Report Q3 Results  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  solar company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  96 3  
Revenues are expected to be  990 14 million  up 46 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for First Solar 
For First Solar  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that First Solar will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that First Solar would post earnings of  0 02 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 18  delivering a surprise of  1 000  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
First Solar doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-solar-fslr-to-report-q3-results-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200474637,200474637

118478,339993,FSLR,Bear Of The Day  First Solar  FSLR ,opinion,"Most of the developed world agrees that an eventual transformation toward renewable energy sources is both inevitable and beneficial  Reducing our reliance on fossil fuel energy will lower harmful emissions  slow the pace of destructive climate change and provide clean  reliable sources of energy to power the world economy going forward 
No responsible world citizen would root against the proliferation of solar energy sources as a replacement for fossil fuel energy generation  Solar power is cheaper and more efficient than ever and it will almost certainly play a big part in providing the energy needs of consumers and businesses for a long time to come 
Unfortunately  the short term trend for solar manufacturers like First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   is not quite as positive 
First Solar s stated goal of providing solar electricity  at cost levels that compete on a non subsidized basis with the price of retail electricity in key parts of the world  is a laudable goal  but over a shorter time frame  the accomplishment of that goal depends on the market prices of fossil fuels   which have been trending downward 
Coal gets a lot of bad press as a relatively  dirty  form of fuel for producing electricity  but it s really natural gas that constitutes the biggest threat to the widespread renewable energy  Advances in extraction technology have reduced the cost of natural gas to multi year lows  This is by no means a permanent situation  but for the foreseeable future  it s going to be difficult for the price of solar technology to keep pace 
Source  US Energy Information Administration  eia gov
The current spot price of approximately  2 30 million BTUs is roughly the same price natural gas was trading in 2002 
Despite the fact that they make some of the most efficient and cost effective solar equipment available  it s simply not a fair fight when First Solar products have to compete against rock bottom lows in gas prices  and earnings have suffered as a result 
The last two quarters have featured huge misses of the Zacks consensus Earnings Estimate and the forecast when they report quarterly results on Thursday night has fallen 13  in the past 90 days   from  1 22 share to  1 06 
Based on recent periods  it would seem that the chances of a positive surprise are smaller than those of a significant disappointment 
It s way too early in the game for investors to give up on solar energy  but it might be rough sledding for a while  JinkoSolar  and Sunnova Energy   both Zacks Rank  2  BUY   are better bets than First Solar  but it also might be a good time to go light on solar investment and wait to see how the cards fall over the next several quarters

118479,339994,FSLR,First Solar  FSLR  Lags Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 29 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 06 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 54 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  72 64   A quarter ago  it was expected that this largest U S  solar company would post earnings of  0 02 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 18  delivering a surprise of  1 000  
Over the last four quarters  the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates 
First Solar  which belongs to the Zacks Solar industry  posted revenues of  546 81 million for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 44 78   This compares to year ago revenues of  676 22 million  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
First Solar shares have added about 30 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for First Solar 
While First Solar has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for First Solar was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 05 on  1 44 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 36 on  3 54 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Solar is currently in the top 39  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-solar-fslr-lags-q3-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200477994,200477994

118481,339996,FSLR,Billions in U S  solar projects shelved after Trump panel tariff,news,"By Nichola Groom  Reuters    President Donald Trump s tariff on imported solar panels has led U S  renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than  2 5 billion in large installation projects  along with thousands of jobs  the developers told Reuters  That s more than double the about  1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U S  solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports  The tariff s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition  Trump s steel and aluminum tariffs  for instance  have hurt manufacturers of U S  farm equipment made with steel  such as tractors and grain bins  along with the farmers buying them at higher prices  White House officials did not respond to a request for comment  Trump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America s fastest growing sectors  Solar developers completed utility scale installations costing a total of  6 8 billion last year  according to the Solar Energy Industries Association  Those investments were driven by U S  tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels  mostly from China  which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal  The U S  solar industry employs more than 250 000 people   about three times more than the coal industry   with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration   Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off   said Zoe Hanes  chief executive of Charlotte  North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables  GTM Research  a clean energy research firm  recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent  respectively  citing the levies  Officials at Suniva   a Chinese owned  U S  based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff   did not respond to requests for comment  Companies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy  Solar giant SunPower Corp  O SPWR  opposes the tariff that will help its U S  panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business  along with its overseas manufacturing operations   There could be substantially more employment without a tariff   said Chief Executive Tom Werner  For a related graphic  click  LOST PROFITS  JOBS The 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years  decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time  Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent  Leading utility scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze  1 5 billion in projects   mostly in the Carolinas  Texas and Colorado   because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete  spokesman Jeff McKay said  That amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation  he said  The projects accounted for a fifth of the company s overall pipeline  Developer Southern Current has made similar decisions on about  1 billion of projects  mainly in South Carolina  said Bret Sowers  the company s vice president of development and strategy   Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money   Sowers said  Neither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel  They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later  Both are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility scale projects from the tariffs  The office of the U S  Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests  Other companies are having similar problems  Scott Canada  senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies  said his company had planned to employ about 1 200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff  Pine Gate  meanwhile  will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees  Hanes said  The company also withdrew an 80 megawatt project that would have cost up to  150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by  Southern Co   N SO  utility Georgia Power  It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff   It was just not feasible   Hanes said  STOCKPILING PANELS For some developers  the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations  That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election  South Bend  Indiana based developer Inovateus Solar LLC  for example  had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan  But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts  where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable  chairman T J  Kanczuzewski said  Other developers are forging ahead  keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30 percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020   Some firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump s announcement  174 Power Global  the development arm of Korea s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January  The company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next  but is moving forward on construction  according to Larry Greene  who heads the firm s development in the U S  West  Intersect Power  a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low cost power to the Texas capital city  is also pushing ahead  said CEO Sheldon Kimber  But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels  The 150 megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020  Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff s 5 percent annual reductions  he said    A LOT OF ROBOTS  Trump s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended  which over time could significantly raise U S  panel production and reduce prices  Panel manufacturers First Solar  O FSLR  and JinkoSolar  N JKS   for example  have announced plans to spend  800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff  creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida  Just last week  Korea s Hanwha Q CELLS  O HQCL  joined them  saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year  though it did not detail job creation  SunPower Corp  meanwhile  purchased U S  manufacturer SolarWorld s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced  saving that facility s 280 jobs  The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations  without specifying how many  But SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs  Jobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation  industry experts said  Heliene   a Canadian company in the process of opening a U S  facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year   said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota  
 The factories are highly automated   said Martin Pochtaruk  president of Heliene   You don t employ too many humans  There are a lot of robots  ",2018-06-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/billions-in-us-solar-projects-shelved-after-trump-panel-tariff-1483661,1483661

118512,340027,FSLR,CSIQ Or FSLR  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Solar sector might want to consider either Canadian Solar  CSIQ  or First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Canadian Solar and First Solar are sporting Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CSIQ is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CSIQ currently has a forward P E ratio of 6 15  while FSLR has a forward P E of 26 39  We also note that CSIQ has a PEG ratio of 0 19  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  FSLR currently has a PEG ratio of 1 13 
Another notable valuation metric for CSIQ is its P B ratio of 0 90  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  FSLR has a P B of 1 28 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CSIQ s Value grade of A and FSLR s Value grade of C 
CSIQ is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that CSIQ is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-09-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csiq-or-fslr-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200468782,200468782

118518,340033,FSLR,In Trump s first year  U S  agency doubles solar investments abroad,news,"By Nichola Groom
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    The United States government doubled its financial support for solar power projects overseas last year under a climate friendly investment policy written in the last days of the Obama administration  according to a Reuters review of government documents 
The growing U S  support for foreign solar projects comes despite an ongoing federal investigation into past U S  solar loans abroad  It also deepens confusion about President Donald Trump s position on government support for renewable energy as his administration downplays the global warming threat and aggressively promotes fossil fuel development 
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation  the government s international finance institution  loaned more than  630 million to foreign energy projects in 2017  90 percent of which were solar  wind  or other low carbon ventures  according to investment documents 
That compares to  797 million in total OPIC energy financing in 2016  61 percent of which went to clean energy 
The agency s lending to solar projects doubled to more than  250 million in 2017  supporting ventures in India  Africa and Latin America  according to the records 
 For a graphic detailing OPIC energy investments over time  see    
White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to requests for comment 
OPIC is a self funded government agency whose website says it aims to advance  U S  foreign policy and national security priorities  by investing in ventures abroad  For 40 years  it has operated at no net cost to U S  tax payers 
The agency formalized its preference for climate friendly energy in an environmental and social policy statement adopted days before Trump s inauguration  The document says the agency aims to support reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and promote low  and no carbon fuels and technologies  efficiency and conservation 
That dovetails with former President Barack Obama s effort to fight climate change but clashes with the current administration s energy priorities 
Since taking office  Trump has rolled back regulation limiting carbon dioxide emissions to help coal and oil firms  signed an executive order requiring government agencies to reduce the influence of climate considerations in decisions  and announced the withdrawal of the United States from an international pact to combat global warming 
That might seem to suggest the administration would oppose continuing generous government support for solar   a leading climate friendly competitor to fossil fuels   but the administration has never made that clear 
Trump has never proposed repealing the billions of dollars worth of federal incentives for renewable energy  which were preserved by a Republican controlled Congress in December tax legislation  But Trump has expressed skepticism about the viability of solar and wind  calling both  very  very expensive  
In January  Trump slapped tariffs on solar panel imports  saying the move would help domestic manufacturers  But what helps manufacturers may hurt solar installers that have relied on lower cost imported panels  often from China 
OPIC spokeswoman Andrea Orr said the agency adheres to the Obama enacted low carbon policy and that its portfolio is  demand driven    reflecting the shift globally toward lower carbon energy sources 
But policy  does not prohibit OPIC from considering the full spectrum of energy projects   she said  including in impoverished nations where fossil fuels are the most feasible option  OPIC s financing last year  for example  included  50 million for a power plant in the West African nation of Guinea that will run on fuel oil 
Last year  Trump sought to eliminate OPIC as part of his 2018 budget proposal  to reduce unnecessary federal interventions that distort the free market    but Congress rejected the idea 
Trump has since appointed Texas businessman Ray Washburne to lead the agency  Washburne has said he would focus OPIC on two goals  empowering women in the developing world  and serving U S  strategic national security interests 
Washburne was not available for an interview  Orr said 
 NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE 
Renewable energy projects that received OPIC funding last year include a Honduras geothermal plant sponsored by Ormat Technologies  a solar array in Zambia backed by  First Solar Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  and solar facilities in Jordan and El Salvador by power plant owner AES Corp 
Orb Energy  an Indian solar company backed by U S  venture capital fund Acumen Fund Inc  secured  10 million in OPIC financing last year for commercial rooftop projects  Such funding would not be available from India s conservative banking sector  the company said 
 Donald Trump does not go out of his way to support solar or renewables  so we were concerned   Orb Chief Executive Damian Miller said in an interview 
But he was told there was  no fundamental change  in its priorities for selecting projects  he said 
Since 2011  more than three quarters of energy generation projects that have received OPIC funding were for solar  wind or other non hydroelectric forms of renewable power 
That approach has been a boon for renewable energy developers  but has not always gone well for OPIC  the agency is currently under investigation by a federal watchdog over nearly  1 billion of loans to solar farms and a hydroelectric project in Chile that got into financial trouble when power prices in that nation plummeted 
At issue is whether OPIC properly stress tested the projects adequately before offering loans  The agency s losses on the deals could exceed  160 million  sources told Reuters last year  OPIC has said it is confident it will recover the loans over the coming decades 
AES   which received up to  89 5 million for its projects in Jordan and El Salvador in 2017   said it has tapped OPIC financing for more than a decade  The shift in the priorities matches the evolution over time at AES  which now invests more in renewable energy and natural gas and less in oil and coal

The Invesco Solar ETF   LON TAN   is the best performing ETF of 2019  up about 60   and the Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF  has gained about 35  
Enphase Energy   NASDAQ ENPH   and SolarEdge Technologies   NASDAQ SEDG   the largest holdings in these ETFs have skyrocketed 580  and 124  respectively this year  Are the gains sustainable 
These ETFs are usually quite volatile since their fortunes are tied to government subsidies and oil prices  Is there a correlation between oil prices and clean energy stocks 
The cost of renewable energy generation has been falling in recent years with continued technological innovation  and that has started changing the competitive balance between clean and traditional energy 
According to the investment firm   wind power is now less expensive to produce than coal or natural gas power  and utility scale solar plants have become competitive with gas and cheaper than coal 
Why should investors consider solar and clean energy ETFs 
TAN is the only pure play solar ETF  About 52  of its portfolio is invested in US companies  Top three holdings   Enphase Energy  ENPH   SolarEdge  SEDG  and First Solar   NASDAQ FSLR    account for almost 30  of the portfolio 
PBW holds companies involved in renewable energy generation or conservation  in almost equal weights  Enphase Energy  ENPH   SolarEdge  SEDG  and SunPower   NASDAQ SPWR   are among its top holdings

118550,340065,FSLR,Solid Renewable Energy Stocks Worth Watching In September,opinion,Renewable energy stocks have underperformed for quite some time  Anxieties about solar panel tariffs in the United States and China s decision to slow down renewable power development have affected the broader renewable power industry  Meanwhile  several clean energy companies are vying against each other for opportunities  eventually affecting returns  In the process  many of these companies have inserted immense pressure on their balance sheets  dragging share prices down But  things are now looking up for renewable energy stocks  The organizers of the 2020 Olympic Summer Games  to be held in Tokyo  are looking to use 100  renewable energy  something that bodes well for the related stocks  The press facilities  international broadcasting center and athletes  villages will also be powered primarily by solar and wind energy In fact  the U S  Department of Energy expects solar energy to outshine the other renewable sources by 2030  when the country will lean toward solar alone to generate at least 30  of its electricity  And let s admit that the United States had already sourced 15  of its electricity from solar panels  wind farms and hydroelectric dams last year  a trend that is expected to continue this year Thus  investors should keep an eye on well managed renewable energy businesses this September  First Solar  Inc    NASDAQ FSLR    Enviva Partners  LP   NYSE EVA    Renewable Energy Group  Inc    NASDAQ REGI   and TerraForm Power Inc   NASDAQ TERP   are good places for a start  Here is why  Premier Solar Panel MakerFirst Solar has quite successfully differentiated itself from competitors  While its peers focus on building low cost silicon based panels  First Solar invests a lot in manufacturing better and more efficient thin film solar panels  Such innovative products have boosted its profit margins Needless to say  the company s move to continuously innovate products has set it apart from competitors  Last year  First Solar introduced the Series 6 module by investing nearly  1 billion  which is more efficient than the earlier Series 4 panel  Nonetheless  First Solar s constant product innovation efforts will continue to attract customers and expand its revenue stream The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its next quarter earnings has risen 19 5  over the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth for the current year is 74 3   way more than the  industry s projected rally of 21 2   In fact  shares of First Solar have gained an impressive 47 1  so far this year  Can t Ignore a Superb Dividend PlayerProducer and supplier of utility grade wood pellets  Enviva Partners  has secured an array of long term contracts  the average length of which is almost 9 4 years  This has more or less ensured a steady stream of revenues over the next decade  What s more interesting is that the company now needs to increase production by 53  to meet contract requirements  So  there is plenty of room for growth in the near future At the same time  it s hard to overlook Enviva Partners with an 8 5  dividend yield  compared to the  industry which hardly pays out any dividend  Needless to say  a dividend player boasts a large customer base  sustainable business model  long track of profitability and strong liquidity  The company s expected

include  First Solar  Inc    NASDAQ FSLR    Enviva Partners  LP   NYSE EVA    Renewable Energy Group  Inc    NASDAQ REGI   and TerraForm Power Inc    NASDAQ TERP   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Solid Renewable Energy Stocks Worth Watching in SeptemberRenewable energy stocks have underperformed for quite some time  Anxieties about solar panel tariffs in the United States and China s decision to slow down renewable power development have affected the broader renewable power industry  Meanwhile  several clean energy companies are vying against each other for opportunities  eventually affecting returns  In the process  many of these companies have inserted immense pressure on their balance sheets  dragging share prices down But  things are now looking up for renewable energy stocks  The organizers of the 2020 Olympic Summer Games  to be held in Tokyo  are looking to use 100  renewable energy  something that bodes well for the related stocks  The press facilities  international broadcasting center and athletes  villages will also be powered primarily by solar and wind energy In fact  the U S  Department of Energy expects solar energy to outshine the other renewable sources by 2030  when the country will lean toward solar alone to generate at least 30  of its electricity  And let s admit that the United States had already sourced 15  of its electricity from solar panels  wind farms and hydroelectric dams last year  a trend that is expected to continue this year Thus  investors should keep an eye on well managed renewable energy businesses this September  First Solar  Inc   Enviva Partners  LP  Renewable Energy Group  Inc  and TerraForm Power Inc  are good places for a start  Here is why  Premier Solar Panel MakerFirst Solar has quite successfully differentiated itself from competitors  While its peers focus on building low cost silicon based panels  First Solar invests a lot in manufacturing better and more efficient thin film solar panels  Such innovative products have boosted its profit margins Needless to say  the company s move to continuously innovate products has set it apart from competitors  Last year  First Solar introduced the Series 6 module by investing nearly  1 billion  which is more efficient than the earlier Series 4 panel  Nonetheless  First Solar s constant product innovation efforts will continue to attract customers and expand its revenue stream The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its next quarter earnings has risen 19 5  over the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth for the current year is 74 3   way more than the  industry s projected rally of 21 2   In fact  shares of First Solar have gained an impressive 47 1  so far this year Can t Ignore a Superb Dividend PlayerProducer and supplier of utility grade wood pellets  Enviva Partners  has secured an array of long term contracts  the average length of which is almost 9 4 years  This has more or less ensured a steady stream of revenues over the next decade  What s more interesting is that the company now needs to increase production by 53  to meet contract requirements  So  there is plenty of room for growth in the near future At the same time  it s hard to overlook Enviva Partners with an 8 5  dividend yield  compared to the  industry which hardly pays out any dividend  Needless to say  a dividend player boasts a large customer base  sustainable business model  long track of profitability and strong liquidity The company s expected earnings growth for the next year is 160 8   way more than the industry s projected rally of 24   The stock also flaunts a  of A and has outperformed the industry on a year to date basis   12 5  vs  19 4   Simple Yet AttractiveRenewable Energy Group basically turns animal

118583,340098,FSLR,CSIQ Vs  FSLR  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Solar sector might want to consider either Canadian Solar  CSIQ  or First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Canadian Solar and First Solar are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CSIQ is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CSIQ currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 10  while FSLR has a forward P E of 27 72  We also note that CSIQ has a PEG ratio of 0 28  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  FSLR currently has a PEG ratio of 1 19 
Another notable valuation metric for CSIQ is its P B ratio of 1 02  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  FSLR has a P B of 1 37 
These metrics  and several others  help CSIQ earn a Value grade of A  while FSLR has been given a Value grade of C 
CSIQ sticks out from FSLR in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that CSIQ is the better option right now ",2019-07-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csiq-vs-fslr-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200437673,200437673
118584,340099,FSLR,First Solar  FSLR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  solar company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 02 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  104 4  
Revenues are expected to be  689 41 million  up 122 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 53  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for First Solar 
For First Solar  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  319 99  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that First Solar will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that First Solar would post a loss of  0 13 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 64  delivering a surprise of  392 31  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
First Solar appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-solar-fslr-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-q2-release-200441468,200441468

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
First Solar shares have added about 51 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 9  
What s Next for First Solar 
While First Solar has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for First Solar was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

118623,340138,FSLR,CSIQ Vs  FSLR  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Solar stocks have likely encountered both Canadian Solar  CSIQ  and First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Canadian Solar has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while First Solar has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that CSIQ has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
CSIQ currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 21  while FSLR has a forward P E of 26 04  We also note that CSIQ has a PEG ratio of 0 29  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  FSLR currently has a PEG ratio of 1 12 
Another notable valuation metric for CSIQ is its P B ratio of 1 02  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  FSLR has a P B of 1 29

118641,340156,FSLR,Prospect of Trump tariff casts pall over U S  solar industry,news,"By Nichola Groom LOS ANGELES  Reuters    U S  solar companies are snapping up cheap imported solar panels ahead of a trade decision by the Trump administration that could drive up costs and cloud the fortunes of one of the economy s brightest stars  Domestic consumers and businesses have been embracing solar energy at a furious pace   thanks to a big assist from China  Low cost photovoltaic cells and panels made in China and other Asian countries have helped drive down costs by around 70  since 2010  enabling more Americans to go solar  Installations in the United States last year hit a record  Jobs are mushrooming too  The domestic industry now employs more than 260 000 people  according to The Solar Foundation  most of them construction workers hammering panels on rooftops and erecting utility scale solar plants in the nation s blistering deserts  But signs of a chill are already visible as the industry waits to see how President Donald Trump responds to a recent trade complaint lodged by a Georgia manufacturer named Suniva  The company has asked the administration effectively to double the price of imported solar panels so that U S  factories can compete  About 95  of cells and panels sold in the U S  last year were made abroad  with most coming from China  Malaysia and the Philippines  according to SPV Market Research  Trump has wide latitude to levy tariffs to protect domestic firms  His actions could determine whether sun powered electricity can compete with fossil fuels to light the nation s homes and businesses   The White House would not comment on the solar trade case  But the administration has vowed to protect steelmakers and other U S  manufacturers by penalizing  unfair  imports  That has the solar industry bracing for the worst  Panic buying has sent spot prices for solar panels up as much as 20 percent in recent weeks as installers rush to lock up supplies ahead of potential tariffs  Skittish U S  energy customers are putting some solar projects on hold  Manufacturers are eyeing other markets to develop  And some investors are running for cover  Funding for large U S  solar deals fell to  1 4 billion in the second quarter  down from  3 2 billion in the first quarter and  1 7 billion a year earlier  primarily due to concerns about the trade case  according to research firm Mercom Capital Group  Developers of solar farms that provide utilities and big companies with energy are particularly vulnerable  panels account for as much as half of the cost of their projects  A steep rise in panel prices  could be huge and disastrous for large scale solar   said Tom Werner  chief executive of San Jose based SunPower Corp  O SPWR   a top U S  solar company that is majority owned by France s  Total   PA TOTF    Developers are alarmed and planning   Solar firms that cater to homeowners are nervous too  A spike in panel prices could slow residential installations and all the jobs that come with them   For a look at the booming U S  solar sector  see   Ed Fenster  chairman of San Francisco based Sunrun  O RUN   said moves by Trump to punish foreign manufacturers could harm American blue collar workers he has vowed to help  The solar industry employs more than five times as many workers as the coal mining industry that Trump has championed   A solar panel tax imperils what our country needs most  well paying jobs that can t be exported or automated   Fenster said  SEEKING RELIEF The solar spat is just the latest example of global trade that has been hard on U S  factories but delivered huge cost savings for consumers  The United States invented photovoltaic technology and accounted for more than a quarter of global solar manufacturing as recently as 2001  But its share has dropped to less than 2 percent due mainly to China  now the world s top producer  Competitors have long complained that Chinese companies use government subsidies and illegal dumping to capture market share  The United States in 2012 slapped duties averaging around 40 percent on firms from China  and in 2014 imposed average duties of about 20 percent on producers from Taiwan  according to GTM Research  Those levies are still in effect  But Suniva  which filed for bankruptcy protection in April  is looking for more  Less than two weeks after its Chapter 11 filing  it lodged a rare form of trade complaint with the U S  International Trade Commission  ITC   In its petition  Suniva said previous tariffs weren t working because China and Taiwan were just shifting production to other low wage countries to avoid the duties  It asked the government to establish a minimum price of 78 cents a watt on panels produced anywhere outside the U S  to keep companies from circumventing the penalties  That s more than double the average of 35 cents a watt that prevailed before the recent price run up  Ironically  Suniva since 2015 has been majority owned by a Chinese firm  In May  SolarWorld Americas Inc   the U S  division of Germany s  SolarWorld AG   DE SWVKk   joined Suniva as a co petitioner on the case  Suniva is looking to give American producers  the opportunity to succeed   the firm s attorney Christian Hudson told Reuters in an emailed statement   If U S  based solar manufacturing disappears  then developers and installers will ultimately face greater volatility  as the manufacturing industry will ultimately come from one sector of the world   Hudson wrote  The ITC has said it will decide by September 22 whether imports have harmed domestic producers  If it finds serious injury  the commission by November 13 will recommend remedies to the president  who is free to implement ITC s advice or do something different  What Trump might do is anyone s guess  He has been largely dismissive of renewable energy until recently  when he suggested putting solar panels on his proposed border wall with Mexico  China is all but certain to retaliate if he takes action  It responded to the 2012 tariffs by imposing its own duties on U S  made polysilicon  the raw material used in solar cells  BRACING FOR THE WORST Solar players are already changing their business practices  Korea based Hanwha Q CELLS Co Ltd  O HQCL  has inserted a clause into its contracts allowing the panel maker to cancel or suspend U S  shipments if Trump imposes new trade remedies  SunPower  which manufactures panels in the United States and the Philippines and is also a major U S  project developer  would  without question  look abroad for more business if the U S  industry is hobbled by tariffs  Werner  its CEO  said  Southern Current LLC  a South Carolina based solar company that builds utility scale and residential projects  has been purchasing modules and warehousing them for future use  Normally the company waits until a deal is financed  according to Bret Sowers  vice president of development and strategy   We are putting money at risk to buy panels because we are worried that we won t be able to get them   he said  In Texas  utility Austin Energy warned that one of its solar power plants could be delayed if tariffs are imposed  it said in an emailed statement  St  Louis based McCarthy Building Companies  which constructs large solar farms  recently had a project shelved due to all the uncertainty  said Scott Canada  senior vice president of renewable energy  But at least one company is benefiting  Tempe  Arizona based  First Solar Inc   O FSLR   First Solar s panels are made from cadmium telluride  not the crystalline silicon that dominates the market and is the target of the trade case  The company s shares have gained more than 50 percent since Suniva filed its petition  First Solar declined to comment  saying it was in a  quiet period  ahead of releasing its quarterly results on July 27

118667,340182,FSLR,Exclusive  U S  aid agency under scrutiny for loans in Chile,news,"By Gram Slattery SANTIAGO  Reuters    The U S  government is auditing a foreign aid program that loaned almost  1 billion to renewable energy projects in Chile   including solar farms in such deep financial trouble that the loans may never be fully repaid  according to people familiar with the matter   The Office of Inspector General for the U S  Agency for International Development  USAID OIG  is examining approximately  890 million of loans approved by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation  OPIC   it confirmed in an emailed statement after inquiries by Reuters  The audit  which began in 2016 and has not been previously reported  is centered on OPIC s decision to fund five Chilean solar farms and a hydroelectric project in 2013 and 2014  OPIC  which aims to advance U S  interests by lending to overseas business ventures  has come under fire from critics who say private banks are best suited to make investment decisions and that it places too much emphasis on renewable energy  U S  President Donald Trump proposed cutting funding for any new OPIC projects in his 2018 budget outline released last week   If OPIC s funding is cut  it will be due in part to questions about investments such as its loans to the Chilean solar projects  At least three of its five solar projects have started restructuring their debt  according to two people familiar with the projects  finances  They said OPIC s losses on the solar deals are likely to exceed  160 million  OPIC in a statement said it was confident it would recover the loans over the coming decades  but acknowledged its original timeline for repayments had changed  The agency  which emphasized that most of its worldwide projects are on firm financial footing  added that it would assess the OIG s recommendations once the audit is complete   Such audits of specific OPIC investments are relatively rare   the last was issued in 2015   and can stem from a number of considerations such as  the level of U S  funding involved  and  reported concerns over the management or performance of a program   the OIG said  The Chile audit  which will result in a public report  will examine  the factors OPIC used to assess and approve its energy projects in Chile   among several other issues  the OIG said  It expects to finish the audit later this year   Development banks get the ball rolling in the industry   Carlos St  James  senior renewable energy advisor at Wood Group  said of OPIC s investments in Chile   Unfortunately  they bet on the wrong kind of projects   A BIG BET In 2013 and 2014  according to public OPIC reports  the agency loaned about  2 5 billion to 32 projects throughout Latin America  with over a third of those funds going to Chilean energy projects   That included loans to five solar farms  four of which were constructed within 70 miles  113 km  of one another in the Atacama Desert  Three of those  known as Salvador  Luz del Norte and San Andres  are now facing severe financial issues  according to interviews with eight people involved in the loans and internal documents viewed by Reuters  OPIC approved  449 million in loans to the projects despite their reliance on an unusual income structure  one that had never been tried on such a large scale  Instead of contracting to provide power to a third party at a fixed price  the typical arrangement  the projects inject at least half their power into the public grid at the going market rate  which changes hourly  While several commercial banks examined financing the projects  according to two sources  they largely deemed the so called merchant pricing scheme too risky   But OPIC s internal analysts considered the merchant market a manageable hazard  according to three internal reports from 2013 and 2014 obtained by Reuters  as well as two people involved in the projects  OPIC expected local power prices of over  100 per megawatt hour  the people said  a rate that would be more than twice average U S  power prices  OPIC declined to comment on their expectations  That view has proven too optimistic  By the middle of 2015  falling demand from nearby mines and slow construction of transmission lines  among other factors  began to severely depress prices   For a graphic see   When OPIC s solar projects  along with several others  began producing electricity  they further depressed prices by flooding the local market with power  This spring  prices have regularly touched zero during daylight hours  according to grid data  OPIC said it expected power prices to rise in the coming years and that the loans were structured to ensure solvency in the long term  But most analysts are forecasting prices well below the original assumptions made by OPIC  In a November filing  Etrion Corp  ST ETRN   a Swiss company that owns the Salvador solar plant  said it was expecting long term power prices of  38 per megawatt hour  Etrion also said in its fourth quarter results that the value of Salvador s  fixed assets pledged as collateral  to OPIC had almost halved to  87 9 million in 2016 from  166 2 million in 2015  It added that it has reached a restructuring agreement with OPIC  delaying all repayments for a year and leaving open the possibility of further delays  Etrion Chief Executive Marco Northland did not respond to questions about loan repayments and the audit  but said he was confident market conditions would improve  The Luz del Norte project  owned by  First Solar Inc    O FSLR   and the San Andres project  now owned by private equity firm Ameris Capital  are also being restructured  according to two sources with knowledge of the process  Javier Contreras  the CEO of Ameris Capital  declined to comment on the audit  but said if both parties remained committed to the projects  the loans would likely be repaid in full  First Solar declined to comment  Two sources with direct knowledge of the projects  financing said OPIC would likely need to forgive 40 to 60 percent of the loans given to the three solar projects  That would result in OPIC forfeiting roughly  160 million to  240 million  
The other OPIC projects being audited in Chile are the Maria Elena solar park  constructed by SunEdison Inc  PK SUNEQ   and the Amanecer solar park owned by Terraform Power Inc  O TERP   The OIG is also auditing the Alto Maipo hydroelectric project controlled by AES Gener  SN ASG   In a statement  AES said the  auditors had the opportunity to see the physical works  access to documentary material and elements that  in the opinion of Alto Maipo  demonstrate a positive balance for the project s implementation   Terraform Power declined to comment  Now bankrupt SunEdison did not respond to requests for comment ",2017-05-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-u.s.-aid-agency-under-scrutiny-for-loans-in-chile-489502,489502
118668,340183,FSLR, Green  mutual funds bounce back after Trump induced retreat,news,"By Ross Kerber BOSTON  Reuters    After U S  President Donald Trump s election last November  investors pulled nearly  68 million from so called  green  mutual funds  reflecting fear that his pro coal agenda would hurt renewable energy firms  But now investors are pouring money back in  boosting net deposits in 22 green funds to nearly  83 million in the first four months of 2017  according to data from Thomson Reuters  Lipper unit  Investors  renewed faith in the funds reflects a growing belief the president will not succeed in reviving the coal industry and will not target the government subsidies that underpin renewable power  which have bipartisan support    For a graphic on  green  funds drawing new investor cash click    It also sends a positive sign for the wind  solar and energy efficiency firms and make up a large portion of the green fund portfolios  The coal industry faces problems in the marketplace that are too big for any government to solve  said Murray Rosenblith  a portfolio manager for the  209 million New Alternatives Fund  among the U S  green funds seeing investor inflows   Trump can t bring back coal   he said   There s nothing that can bring it back   A Reuters survey of some 32 utilities in Republican states last month showed that none plan to increase coal use as a result of Trump s policies  Many planned to continue a shift to cheaper and cleaner alternatives  including wind and solar  A White House official did not respond to a request for comment about the administration s efforts to boost coal or its position on wind and solar subsidies  Lipper classifies  green  funds as those with screening or investment strategies that are based solely on environmental criteria  Many make it a point to avoid purchasing shares of traditional oil  gas or mining companies  For a graphic showing the turnaround in green fund investments  see   The funds  while still an investment niche  have become increasingly popular over the past decade amid rising worries about climate change  They tend to draw younger and more environmentally minded investors who see profits in the burgeoning renewable power industry   Solar and wind power are creating a lot of jobs  There is a long term secular trend taking place   said Joe Keefe  Chief Executive of Pax World Management LLC  whose  418 million Pax Global Environmental Markets fund is one of the biggest in the green fund sector  Solar firms employed about 374 000 workers in 2016  while the wind industry employed 101 738  Combined  they produced job growth of about 25 percent over 2015  according to the U S  Department of Energy  The average fund among the group of 22 green funds tracked by Lipper posted a six month return of 9 37 percent  That lagged the S P 500 index s 12 14 percent  excluding dividends  over the same period through April 30  but beat the S P s oil and gas index  along with several major coal companies which have slumped since the election  The growth helped boost the group s combined assets under management to  2 4 billion by the end of April  up from  2 1 billion in November  according to the data  Tom Roseen  Lipper s head of research  said the inflows into green funds could reflect value shopping after the election triggered an initial sell off in the solar and wind energy sectors  He cited solar module maker  First Solar Inc   NASDAQ FSLR   a popular stock among green funds  trading at about  39 50 a share  far off the highs above  70 it reached last year but up more than 35 percent from a drop it suffered after the election  TRUMP SKEPTICS Trump campaigned on a promise to revive the ailing oil and coal industries  in part by dismantling former President Barack Obama s environmental regulations aimed at cutting carbon dioxide emissions  He also vowed to pull the United States out of a global pact to fight climate change  a promise White House officials said Trump is now reconsidering  under pressure from lawmakers  global allies  and scores of major oil  coal and other companies  Trump s more conservative supporters   including the man who led his transition at the Environmental Protection Agency  Myron Ebell   have complained about the slow pace of progress in dismantling Obama era climate initiatives  While many drilling and mining companies have applauded Trump s efforts  some investors are skeptical that repealing climate regulation will provide a big boost to fossil fuels  The government subsidies that are crucial for growth of wind and solar power  meanwhile  seem to enjoy bipartisan support in Congress  Existing tax credits for solar and wind projects were extended for five years at the end of 2015 by

118698,340213,FSLR,First Solar  FSLR  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  solar company is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 03 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  103 9  
Revenues are expected to be  636 24 million  up 12 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10 1  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for First Solar 
For First Solar  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 55  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that First Solar will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that First Solar would post earnings of  0 64 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 49  delivering a surprise of  23 44  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
First Solar appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-solar-fslr-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200408366,200408366

118722,340237,FSLR,First Solar  FSLR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 21  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  solar company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  356  
Revenues are expected to be  803 50 million  up 136 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for First Solar 
For First Solar  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that First Solar will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that First Solar would post earnings of  0 45 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 54  delivering a surprise of  20  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
First Solar doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-solar-fslr-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200388215,200388215
118723,340238,FSLR,First Solar  FSLR  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Miss Estimates,opinion,"First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 49 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 64 per share  This compares to loss of  0 25 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  23 44   A quarter ago  it was expected that this largest U S  solar company would post earnings of  0 45 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 54  delivering a surprise of 20  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
First Solar  which belongs to the Zacks Solar industry  posted revenues of  691 24 million for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 97   This compares to year ago revenues of  339 18 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
First Solar shares have added about 21 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 11 1  
What s Next for First Solar 
While First Solar has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for First Solar was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 12 on  639 43 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 45 on  3 25 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Solar is currently in the top 19  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-02-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-solar-fslr-q4-earnings-and-revenues-miss-estimates-200391164,200391164

118731,340246,FSLR,Solar  wind industries hope years courting Republicans pays off under Trump,news,"By Nichola Groom LOS ANGELES  Reuters    U S  wind and solar companies for the first time gave more money to Republicans than Democrats during the 2016 election cycle  according to federal campaign disclosures  part of a years long effort to expand renewable energy s appeal beyond liberal environmentalists  The industry is now hoping its strategy of reaching across the political divide will pay off in the form of Congressional support as Republican Donald Trump  a climate change skeptic who has expressed doubts about the role of clean energy  takes the White House in January   We re not starting from ground zero   said Isaac Brown  a principal at 38 North Solutions  which lobbies on behalf of clean energy clients  The U S  wind and solar industries employ over 300 000 people  making clean energy an important political constituency that is about five times bigger than the coal sector for jobs  thanks to years of rapid growth fueled by government incentives and declines in the cost of their technologies   They have also fought to win over a new breed of backer  conservatives skeptical of climate change but interested in supporting homegrown energy alternatives that increase national security  boost competition  and create well paying blue collar jobs  But Trump s upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov  8 presidential election has cast doubt on the future of a federal tax break for renewable energy seen critical to the industry s continued growth   Trump has never specifically called for those credits to end  but has expressed skepticism about the role of solar and wind in the U S  energy landscape  calling both  so expensive  and blaming wind turbines for killing birds and ruining picturesque landscapes  During his campaign  Trump also called global warming a hoax and promised to quit a global accord to cut greenhouse gas emissions  though he has since softened his stance and said he is keeping an  open mind  about the deal  The renewable energy industry got a boost last year when Congress approved a five year extension of tax credits for new power projects fueled by solar panels and wind turbines  and the industry s main concern in Washington is to ensure they are not withdrawn in Trump s first term  or allowed to expire should he win a second   A Trump official did not respond to a request for comment about how he will approach renewables as president  But one of Trump s potential picks for Energy Secretary  Oklahoma oil and gas drilling mogul Harold Hamm  has been a vocal opponent of subsidies for renewable energy   Renewable stocks took a beating immediately after Trump s election but have since mostly recovered  MONEY AND LOBBYING During the 2016 cycle  the wind and solar industry s political action committees contributed more than  225 000 to Republican candidates for office  compared with  185 000 for Democrats  The numbers are not large by the standards of political donations but they mark the first time the industry has tilted its contributions toward Republicans  according to federal records   In 2012  Democrats got about two thirds of the industry s contributions  Recipients this year included 34 House Republicans and 19 Senate Republicans  U S  Senator Dean Heller from Nevada  New York Representative Tom Reed and North Carolina U S  Senator Richard Burr   all vocal proponents of renewables   together accounted for more than 40 percent of the Solar Energy Industries Association PAC s total federal campaign donations   It is reassuring that we have those relationships already developed  and we have a really strong business case for the policies that have been implemented   said Brown of 38 North Solutions  Industry executives like SunPower Chief Executive Tom Werner and  First Solar Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  CEO Mark Widmar have acknowledged the uncertainty around federal support for renewables  But they have sought to assuage investors  saying current policies are likely to remain due to the cost competitiveness of their technologies and the number of jobs they represent  The industry has also tried to get its message out to Trump  The Solar Energy Industries Association  before the election  provided Trump staffers with information about the investment tax credit and its impact on jobs and the economy   The American Wind Energy Association would not say what interactions it has had with Trump s team  but twice during the campaign it published posts on its blog to counter his statements on the cost of wind energy and its impact on birds   The hope is to partner with and educate new appointees  in Trump s administration  and point out the facts  and then we ll see   said SunPower s Werner   Though Democrats have historically been viewed as the strongest supporters of renewable energy  utility scale wind farms and solar installations are found throughout the nation   including in Republican leaning states like Arizona  North Carolina  Oklahoma and North Dakota   and enjoy bipartisan support among Americans  A Pew Research Center poll from October found 83 percent of conservative Republicans favor more solar installations  and 75 percent favor more wind farms  Those figures were 97 percent and 93 percent for

118780,340295,FSLR,U S  on verge of lifting 40 year oil export ban,news,"By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States appears on the brink of ending a four decade ban on most exports of crude oil  which would end a years long fight brought about by a boom in domestic shale output that contributed to a supply glut and depressed prices  The measure is part of a sprawling deal wrapped up by congressional leaders late on Tuesday to keep the U S  government open through September  The  1 15 trillion spending bill  negotiated in secret talks over the last two weeks  would be difficult for President Barack Obama to veto despite his opposition to ending the oil export ban   In a partial victory to Obama and other Democrats  the spending bill also includes granting tax incentives to boost wind and solar development  according to lawmakers involved in the talks  Shares of solar companies rose sharply  Republican and Democratic lawmakers will meet separately on Wednesday to discuss the bill and hope to vote on it as soon as Friday  Allowing oil exports would be a win for the U S  oil industry and Republicans  who had argued the ban was a relic of the 1970s Arab oil embargo  Exploration and production companies  many saddled with billions in debt and struggling to avoid bankruptcy after a 60 percent slide in oil prices forced them to halt most new drilling  had viewed exports as a lifeline of sorts  But with U S  output now falling as oil prices slump to seven year lows  traders say foreign buyers may not materialize in a glutted global market   The S P Energy Index  was down over 1 percent in early afternoon trading on Wednesday  Some Democrats in the Senate say lifting the ban would put oil refining jobs at risk and that more drilling would harm the environment  though Democratic Sen  Heidi Heitkamp  from the No  2 oil state North Dakota  has supported its repeal  The drop in oil prices  now below  40 a barrel  has helped ease worries about higher gasoline prices for consumers  Producers say eliminating the ban would help revive a U S  drilling boom by closing the years long gap between cheaper domestic crude prices and higher global rates  The move would also give U S  allies alternatives to Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for their supplies    Lifting the oil export ban is very important to our industry to enable them to compete on a global basis   said Senator John Hoeven  The Republican from oil producing North Dakota has pressured Congress to axe the trade restriction   Chief executive officers of U S  oil producers  from integrated global majors  Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM  to frackers like  Continental Resources Inc   N CLR   had urged the ban be lifted   Gregory Hill  president of U S  oil independent  Hess Corp   N HES   said this month that ending the prohibition would boost domestic crude prices by about  3 a barrel  or about 8 percent  from around  36  Refiners have been divided on the issue  as exports of crude would increase their costs after a bounty of cheap domestic oil brought several years of surging profits  Four U S  independent refiners  three of which operate on the East Coast  have opposed exporting domestic crude  Their so called CRUDE Coalition says lifting the ban will lead to higher pump prices when once landlocked domestic crude commands higher prices in global markets   PBF Energy Inc  N PBF   Philadelphia Energy Solutions LLC   Alon USA Energy Inc   N ALJ  and Delta Air Lines  N DAL  unit Monroe Energy also say the ban protects national security and supports economic growth by keeping energy prices low for manufacturers  Other refiners  including  Valero Energy  Corp  N VLO   Marathon Petroleum Corp  N MPC  and Phillips 66  N PSX   have expressed support for free markets or said they would not oppose the ban s repeal  Some pipeline and terminal companies have already started adding infrastructure along the U S  Gulf Coast to handle potential crude exports  augmenting systems geared toward imports   Republicans made lifting the ban a priority and swapped it for measures Democrats wanted to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment  For the solar industry  the deal marks its second big recent victory since a global agreement to curb carbon emissions and encourage investment in renewable energy  reached in Paris on Saturday   SolarCity Corp   O SCTY    First Solar Inc   O FSLR    Abengoa  SA  MC ABG   SunEdison Inc  N SUNE  and Sunrun  O RUN   as well as the industry s trade group  have spent more than  2 million lobbying Congress this year  according to public records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics  They pushed hard this month to safeguard the Investment Tax Credit for the industry  which they say has underpinned an annual growth rate of 76 percent in solar installations over the last decade   SolarCity shares jumped 26 percent  First Solar rose 9 percent  SunEdison was up 19 percent  and Sunrun gained 21 percent

118781,340296,FSLR,SunEdison setback may delay Modi s  ultra mega  solar drive in India,news,"By Krishna N  Das MUMBAI  Reuters    The likely collapse of SunEdison Inc s  N SUNE  solar project in India  the first of 32 planned  ultra mega  complexes  could delay Prime Minister Narendra Modi s goal to increase renewable energy fivefold by several years and probably cost consumers more  As the U S  solar giant fights to stave off bankruptcy  the 500 megawatt project in Andhra Pradesh state it won last November lies idle with ground yet to be broken  The other projects are still to be bid on  It s doubtful any rival will pick up the project at the aggressive power pricing promised by SunEdison  which beat out 29 other bidders with a record low tariff of 4 63 rupees  7 U S  cents  per kilowatt hour  That will force Indian officials to tighten auction rules to ensure that only serious  bankable bidders show up  industry sources said  India plans to auction more of the  ultra mega  projects   those which generate at least 500 MW   in the current fiscal year through to March 2017   There is always a tradeoff   Upendra Tripathy  secretary at the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy  told Reuters of the renewable energy auctions   There can be a relaxed condition so that more people can participate and there is another where you can make sure fly by night operators can t come in  It s an ongoing process and we are open to suggestions   Tightening auction rules could slow the pace at which projects are awarded and built  pushing back Modi s goal of expanding solar capacity to 100 gigawatts by 2020 to the middle of the decade  say officials and industry players  Tripathy  however  said India will for now stick to its goal  set by Modi soon after taking office in 2014  and that it has planned for SunEdison like bumps in the road with a strong project pipeline  Modi is banking on India s 300 days a year of sunshine to help fight climate change rather than committing to emission cuts like China  But he has also pushed firms to provide cheap power  which risks leaving too little profit on the table  Heavily indebted SunEdison  which according to one of its publicly listed units could soon file for bankruptcy protection  drew criticism from analysts for its low winning bid for the Andhra project  The company is now exploring a sale of its Indian assets of around 1 GW or seeking partners for them  sources said  and has drawn preliminary interest from billionaire Gautam Adani s fast expanding Adani Group  Apart from the Andhra project  SunEdison has several other small plants under construction across India  POSSIBLE RE BID A person close to Adani said the low tariff agreed for the Andhra plant will make any deal with SunEdison difficult for Indian firms  which have a relatively high cost of capital  If no buyer is found  the project could be re bid  the industry sources said  SunEdison did not respond to multiple requests for comment   The tariffs are a tad aggressive and that may not be healthy for developers themselves and also for others in the ecosystem     manufacturers and financiers   said Santosh Kamath  head of renewables at consultancy KPMG India   That might be a warning signal for the industry   SunEdison s troubles notwithstanding  India has attracted deep pocketed investors to its  100 billion solar energy program   the biggest in the world  Japan s Softbank Corp  T 9984   Taiwan s Foxconn  TW 2354  and India s Bharti Enterprises have separately pledged to invest a total of about  20 billion in India s renewable sector  Global solar giants like  First Solar Inc   O FSLR    Trina Solar Ltd   N TSL  and Finland s state controlled utility  Fortum  Oyj  HE FUM1V  are also expanding their presence   India wants the share of non fossil fuel in total installed power capacity to jump to 40 percent by 2030 from 30 percent currently  Challenges include the weak finances of state distribution companies forced to sell subsidized power  difficulties hooking up solar projects to grids  and access to affordable capital  Land acquisition is also an issue that Modi s government has been unable to fix   a 500 MW solar project needs on average 2 000 acres  800 hectares    Given the energy deficit  need for energy security and sustained economic growth  the potential clearly exists for 100 GW of solar  energy  in India   said Sujoy Ghosh  country head of First Solar   The question would be on the timelines in which the goal is achieved   The Indian government is trying to persuade state banks to extend loans to solar projects  but most lenders are saddled with bad loans and unlikely to risk getting exposed to renewable projects with low rates of return  To avoid projects getting stuck for a lack of backing  India should make it mandatory for solar bidders to get funding assurances from banks at the beginning of an auction to ensure only serious players take part  analysts said  Tripathy  the government secretary  said he could consider the suggestion   We ll have to take care that projects don t become unviable   KPMG s Kamath said   If some projects become unviable then banks will stop lending to new projects and then they get stranded  like we have seen in the power and road sectors in the past

They have flexibility to bend rules and guidelines as they dynamically read the situation and can change on the fly during the trade   He also concludes saying   In order to improve your trade performance you need to do hundreds of trades   Or study hundreds of past patterns  

 has a nice explanation of the advantages of rules based trading 

Setting rules allow you to be more discipline and it emotion when you you are analysing a trade setup 
Having rules allows you to formulate methodology based on preset criteria and to evaluate trading method 
It eliminate random trade entries and you know when exactly to buy or sell 
Trading with predefined rules  keeps you in a trade longer  no unnecessary trade stop out because you are able to determine the trade direction more accurately 
Rules eliminate stress and gives confidence especially beginner traders 

Dr  Brett Steenbarger explains other techniques that traders can use  
He comes up with three techniques to kill the fear of failure  1  Being mindful of our breathing to keep us grounded in the present  2  Reassessing the severity of the threat of failure  and 3  Directing our Attention outward 
And finally  do our models always follow the rules  We discussed this a bit in a prior Stock Exchange  How Long Was Your Learning Curve  At NewArc  our models follow specific trading strategies that have been well tested  Our human trading team nearly always executes the indicated trades  but there is some discretion  Humans are the final arbiters  responsible for spotting anomalies 
Model Performance 
Per reader feedback  we re continuing to share the performance of our trading models  Our trading models have shown excellent performances over the last weeks as you can see below 

We find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
And for these reasons  I am changing the  Trade with Jeff  offer at Seeking Alpha to include a 50 50 split between Holmes and Athena  Current participants have already agreed to this  Since our costs on Athena are lower  we have also lowered the fees for the combination

Expert Picks from The Models 
In this week s Stock Exchange  we are delighted to have guest expert  of Trinity Asset Management 
Holmes  I bought FireEye  NASDAQ FEYE  today  As a  dip buyer   I expect some upside to the stock in the coming weeks 

Brian  Let s look at its fundamental chart from FAST Graphs as well  FireEye  FEYE  has been consolidating on the charts for two years now  and has built a solid technical base  despite losing money every year for shareholders  However  2018 will see a slight profit and earnings per share for FEYE shareholders  and EPS growth is expected to be robust in the next few years  Fair value or intrinsic value estimates vary between  15 to  18 per share FEYE  so my guess is the Street is waiting for some strong guidance before turning more bullish on the stock 
FEYE is in a desirable space right now within Tech software  i e  cyber security  and after coming public and trading up to  80 per share  the stock had a tough 3 years  losing almost 80  of its market value  The technicals have improved  but FEYE needs to deliver on sustainable revenue and earnings growth 

Holmes  Though I don t get it fully  it s still nice to hear good comments from you on my stock pick this week 
Brian  Roadrunner  do you have any picks this week 
Roadrunner  Nothing new  but several candidates are close 
Felix  I sold my Hertz  NYSE HTZ  stock this week  I had bought these shares on 7 17 17 for  15 69 and they were sold for a profit at  17 01 this week  While my typical holding period is 66 weeks  even my early sale was a little too late to maximize the gain 

Brian  Hertz  HTZ  is another stock that has had a tough few years  trading down from  150 in mid 2014 to  17 today  Forward earnings estimates  while showing growth  are also still seeing negative revisions  and more importantly so are HTZ s forward revenue estimates  The Felix portfolio sold HTZ this week  and that was probably a smart move 
Felix  Looks like my move was all right this week 

Felix  I am also sharing my ranking of the top 20 stocks in the Russell 2000 index 

Oscar  This week  I ranked my top 20 ETFs from among our Diverse ETFs universe 

Brian  The NYSE TAN ETF undoubtedly got a boost from the news that new homes in California will have to be solar powered or have some solar power capability  First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  is 8  of the ETF and TAN s largest position and has also gotten a boost from the California regulation  Given the weight that California carries in annual housing start data  single family residential construction  the California regulation favoring solar should be a plus for the sector 
Conclusion 
While it is also always good to follow good trading rules and have a distinct trading strategy  sometimes it is also prudent to make trading decisions based on our long experience and our knowledge of how the markets are expected to react and the likely stock movements  This comes out of our years of expertise in trading and deep understanding of the markets and our models

118795,340310,FSLR,Why Is First Solar  FSLR  Down 8 9  Since Its Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for First Solar  Inc    NASDAQ FSLR    Shares have lost about 8 9  in that time frame

118797,340312,FSLR,Trade Wars And Tariffs Can t Stop These Solar Stocks,opinion,"Caught between the egos of politicians and trade war shenanigans  the solar industry is once again plagued with headaches 
Back in 2006  when I first started covering the solar industry and making a decent chunk of change with companies like First Solar  NASDAQ  NASDAQ FSLR  and SunPower Corporation  NASDAQ SPWR  the industry s biggest obstacles were dinosaur energy analysts who hadn t yet received the memo that solar was quickly becoming a legitimate  and profitable  addition to the global energy economy 
Those analysts have since changed their tunes or retired  while the solar industry has chugged along quite aggressively  But now  a new obstacle faces the solar industry  leaving solar investors wondering how to proceed 
Despite the threat of import controls and frivolous lawsuits that really only benefit lawyers and accountants  there are still some solid opportunities for investors looking to profit from the continued development of the solar industry 
There s Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital  NYSE HASI   which is a REIT holding both solar and wind assets  This stock doesn t tend to rise and fall with every new solar tariff announcement 
There s also Vivint Solar Inc  NYSE VSLR   which has also fared pretty well this year in defiance of trade wars and tariffs  This is a company that operates as a solar installer  but also provides home battery solutions and electric car charging portals 
Now both of these companies operate primarily in the United States mainland  but the solar industry is a global one  so solar investors should definitely look to capitalize on what s going on in other parts of the world  too 
Take Puerto Rico  for instance 
Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello recently announced that he s moving to privatize the assets of the island s electric company 
Following Hurricane Maria  residents of Puerto Rico are still without power  The entire place is in shambles  and Rossello thinks privatization is the solution 
Truth be told  I love the concept of privatization  but the governor is trying to unload a system that is severely damaged and sitting atop a mountain of debt  I can t honestly see how any company would take on such a mess  The cost to get this thing back up and running plus the debt that s still on the books  about  9 billion worth  is so massive  it would serve as a major liability for any company that has the ability to take on such a project  And there aren t many 
I suspect the governor is fed up at this point and wants action  And he s going to get it  but not in the way he wants right now 
I have been following developments in Puerto Rico for a long time now  and I m convinced that the Feds are going to take everything over  rebuild the island s infrastructure  and then unload it  But they can t do it alone  and have been actively working with a few companies that can provide the necessary infrastructure development to get the island s grid back in working order 
One of those companies is called Greenbriar Capital Corp  V GRB   which includes among its many projects a 100MW solar farm in Puerto Rico  known as the Montalva Solar Project 
This project was approved a few years back  but after a major scandal was discovered within the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority  PREPA   PREPA tried to back out 
This was a major speed bump for Greenbriar  but the law was on its side  And last month  Greenbriar filed an action against PREPA  as requested by the U S  Federal Court  for  951 million  To give you an idea of what this means for shareholders  for information only purposes   this amount translates into  US951 million X 1 28 CDN FX    1 217 028 000   22 Million shares out    55 33 CDN per share for shareholders 
Right now  Greenbriar is trading for about  1 23 
This is Critical
On page 20 of the Federal Court filing made on May 29  2018  the company is asserting in its claim a distinct action against PREPA for Criminal Racketeering under Federal RICO statues  And this claim is in addition to the U S  Federal Oversight and Management Board recommending the company s 100MW Montalva Solar Project be deemed a Critical Project to rebuild the power infrastructure 
This board was established by Congress to recommend and expedite critical energy and infrastructure projects  and on April 25  it announced that Greenbriar s Montalva Solar Farm had been approved to proceed to the next stage of the process  which is review by the appropriate government agencies 
Here s the bottom line  The Feds know they have to take this operation over  and it looks like Greenbriar is on the short list  Which should come as no surprise when you consider what Greenbriar brings to the table 
In addition to the fact that PREPA is unlikely to win the case brought forth by Greenbriar  the company also already has the necessary  305 million financing in place to construct the 100 MW solar farm  It s coming to the table without needing a handout  This puts Greenbriar in the front of the line 
As well  this project is already well underway in terms of pre construction and has already crossed every possible hurdle 

There s already an existing PREPA 115 kV line traversing the Guanica Site for ease of possible 115 kV on site interconnection of the project 
If required to interconnect to an existing PREPA substation  there is existing space on a 115 kV bus available at PREPA s Guanica Substation for Montalva interconnection 
There s already 18 months of one minute solar data available for compliance analysis to meet operating guidelines 
Municipality mayors and senators from Ponce and Mayaguez are on board and support the project 
The project can also be expanded to 150 MW if desired  lowering capital cost per unit  A permit has been filed for 130 MW 

Now the CEO of Greenbriar is a guy by the name of Jeff Ciachurski  Jeff created Western Wind Energy in 2002 with  250k in startup capital  and sold the company in 2013 for  420 million to Brookfield Asset Management  which is a  281 billion Canadian asset manager  Shareholders  many of whom were early members of my Green Chip Stocks community  made a small fortune from that deal 
Interestingly  however  today  Greenbriar has greater value contracts than Western Wind  but with only 18 million shares outstanding  instead of 77 million it had with Western Wind 
Greenbriar has actually been in our Green Chip Ventures portfolio for a while  because when I first added it  the risk level was a bit higher  But a lot has changed since then 

PREPA is backed up against a wall in terms of honoring its deal with Greenbriar 
Greenbriar s lawsuit is solid  and survives bankruptcy  The Feds are also a counterparty by default as they are looking after the financial affairs of PREPA 
The necessary funding is already in place for Greenbriar s solar project 
The U S  Federal Oversight and Management Board has recommended to Congress that Greenbriar s solar project be deemed a  critical project to rebuild the island s electric infrastructure  
As you read this  the Feds are drafting legislation to federalize the utility 

My take on this is simple  When all is said and done  the Feds are going to take over  and they re bringing Greenbriar s 100MW solar project with them  This is pretty much a no brainer  not just for solar investors  but for any investor looking to make a few bucks

118821,340336,FSLR,Solar is having a great year  except on Wall Street,news,By Nichola Groom LOS ANGELES  Reuters    By almost any measure  the U S  solar market is on fire  Installations of solar panels are expected to soar by a third this year  the price of solar power is now cheap enough to compete neck and neck with gas and coal fired power in places like California  and the fledgling industry received a vote of confidence last week when U S  President Barack Obama announced a groundbreaking plan to curb power plant emissions  Even China s currency devaluation could cut panel costs for U S  solar installers   Wall Street  however  has been dumping solar shares this year  largely on concern  which investors say is misplaced  that tumbling oil prices will sap demand for alternative energy  even though oil isn t used to generate power  Stock prices are also suffering from an oversupply of new equity issues by companies raising capital to fund their rapid growth and concern an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve could curb the appeal of their so called yieldco units  The carnage has intensified in the last two weeks  The MAC Global Solar Energy index has dropped 36 percent since its 2015 high in April  with industry bellwether SunEdison Inc having lost 55 percent of its value since July 20  SunRun Inc  one of the top residential solar installers  went public last week at  14 a share and closed Thursday at  10 12  Hood River Capital Management of Portland began shedding its stake in SunEdison earlier this year  according to regulatory filings  and kept selling last month after the company announced a deal to buy rooftop solar installer Vivint Solar Inc   its third acquisition this year  Investors are concerned that the company is doing too much too fast  that its capital requirements could be too high  and that project development margins would be squeezed  Hood River Capital Principal Brian Smoluch said   I agree with that perspective at  30  but at  14 I feel like it s more than baked in   Smoluch said  adding that at current levels he is buying SunEdison again  Though solar is becoming mainstream  investors still view it as risky  It remains more expensive in most places than conventional power  so must rely on government subsidies and mandates that come and go    There are only so many buyers for these types of companies out there   said Robert W  Baird analyst Ben Kallo  GONE PUBLIC In the past year  six solar companies have gone public in the United States  raising a combined  1 85 billion  according to IPO ETF manager Renaissance Capital  The most recent two   SunRun and TerraForm Global Inc   are both trading more than 20 percent below their IPO prices  Much of the new issuance has come from  yieldcos    bundles of solar  wind or other power plants with long term utility contracts that are spun off by developers into a dividend paying public entity  Several yieldcos   NRG Yield  Abengoa Yield and Terraform Power Inc   have completed secondary offerings in the last year  Yieldcos have surged in popularity over the last two years because they provide stable  fat yields and a less risky way to invest in solar   But investors said a likely a rise in U S  interest rates would temper that enthusiasm as government debt becomes more attractive  Toronto based AGF Investments Inc pared back its stakes in SunEdison and First Solar   two owners of yieldcos   earlier this year   We felt there would be a short term correction around rate fears   said Martin Grosskopf  who manages AGF s  350 million sustainable investing strategy   But it s gone way beyond that in terms of the decline we ve seen   South Texas Money Management Ltd in San Antonio  which manages  2 7 billion  holds No  1 U S  panel maker  First Solar Inc   NASDAQ FSLR   but isn t using the latest weakness in solar stocks to add shares or pick up others  First Solar is down about 30 percent from a 52 week high set in September of last year   That one s enough heartburn for us   said Christian Ledoux  the firm s director of equity research   Believe it or not we actually have a profit in it   Some are buying   albeit cautiously  Zevin Asset Management LLC  a Boston based firm  has added small amounts to its positions in First Solar and SunPower Corp   We wouldn t buy huge amounts  but because we are long term investors we can be opportunistic   said Amber Fairbanks  a portfolio manager with the firm  Chris Georgandellis of Exchange Capital Management in Ann Arbor  Michigan  said his firm s investment in First Solar is underpinned by the idea that solar will only become cheaper and more efficient over the long term as fossil fuel development and production become more expensive  For now  he is waiting for concern about low oil prices to blow over   Attractive fundamentals are often powerless in the face of the arbitrary preferences of the crowd   he said

118829,340344,FSLR,US China Trade War Dissipates  3 Solar Stocks In Focus,opinion,The U S  stock market took a hit last week as chances of a possible trade war between America and China were rife  However  on Mar 26  possible talks between the United States and China over tariffs and trade imbalances started making the rounds  This helped the Wall Street gain some lost ground What Led to the Possible Trade War President Trump s latest announcement of a possible imposition of a  60 billion tariff on  the products imported from China dealt a huge blow to Wall Street last week  Subsequently  China announced to impose an import tariff worth  3 billion on U S  goods  Per The Washington Post  owing to such formidable announcements  the stock market witnessed one of the worst weeks in years Trade relations between the two nations have failed to remain cordial  thanks to Trump s latest policies  He pledged to reduce the U S  trade deficit with China and demanded that China must cut the same by  100 billion  In addition to steel and aluminium  tariffs have also been imposed on imported washing machines and solar panels  These are likely to affect China s economy adversely Analysts are of the opinion that Trump s decisions will not go down well with China and the nation in retaliation may impose tariffs on import of American aircraft as well as U S  crops since it is one of the biggest buyers of U S  crops  Given these developments  two of the world s key economies were almost at the brink of a trade war Current ScenarioFollowing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s announcement that the two nations have decided to enter into negotiation talks to avert the trade war  the stock market opened on a fairly upbeat note on Monday  According to a report by The Wall Street Journal  China and America have started arbitration to improve United States  access to markets in China  which cover wide areas like financial services and manufacturing Trump s  letter to China s economic czar Liu late last week requested for a reduction of Chinese tariffs on U S  automobiles  more Chinese purchases of U S  semiconductors and greater access to China s financial sector by American companies  The news came as a breather to investors as a possible aversion of the trade war seemed to be in the cards  Evidently  the S P 500 rose 2 7   Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 2 8  and Nasdaq moved up 3 3  Implication of the 30  Tariff on the Solar IndustryIn January 2018  Trump administration announced a new import tariff on solar panels and modules  per which  30  tariff will be levied on solar panel components  In four years  time the tax rate is expected to come down to 15   Initially U S  solar stocks moved up on hopes that such trade restriction will create jobs for the Americans  However  with the passage of time the solar industry s growth did not sustain as investors became skeptical over the long term success of the tariff This is exactly what the U S  solar industry advocates feared  The U S  Solar Energy Industries Association predicted that the tariff may cut forecasted solar installations this year by nearly 20   to 9 gigawatts from 11 gigawatts  and lead to the loss of 23 000 jobs in the United States  the world s fourth largest solar market after China  Japan and Germany This is because the U S  solar market depends largely on imported panels  According to a report by GTM research  87  of U S  solar installations used foreign produced panels  in 2016  primarily from China  So levying a tax on these imports is unlikely to benefit solar stocks Per the latest Solar Market Insight Report  solar installations between 2018 and 2022 will be 13  lower than the original forecast  primarily due to U S  tariffs on panel imports  In fact  U S  solar installations are unlikely to reach the peak level of 2016  15 2 gigawatts  until 2023 Thus  despite the growing demand for solar panels  the prospects of the U S  solar industry seem to be bleak due to the tariffs  However  with the United States and China now willing to enter into talks for improving trade relationship  there remains a possibility that the two nations might arrive at a mid way solution for solar energy Stocks in Focus   The recent thaw in the two countries hostile relationship is likely to lead to new trade policies for solar panel imports  Thus  we have zeroed in three U S  solar stocks that investors might want to retain in their watch list  These stocks not only carry a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  but also boast a solid earnings surprise history   You can see  These stocks have also managed to outperform the broader market over a year and flaunt a solid long term earnings growth rate  thereby reflecting their inert

118831,340346,FSLR,Alternative Energy Stock Outlook   April 2018,opinion,"There is broad global consensus that the overuse of fossil fuels  which emits hazardous carbon dioxide and has expedited the process of climate change  Realizing the need for a cleaner energy environment  consumers have rapidly increased the adoption of alternative energy sources  nay renewables  over the last decade 
The outlook for the renewable energy industry is favorable  as utilities and corporations are increasingly shifting to renewables    owing to declining costs of solar and wind technologies  and rising demand for more carbon constrained practices  Evidently  renewable energy sources are set to represent almost three quarters of the  10 2 trillion the world will invest in new power generating technology by 2040  according to Bloomberg New Energy Outlook  
Stocks in the Alternative Energy industry have put on an impressive show in the past year  handily outperforming the broader market  as a reflection of this positive backdrop  The Zacks Alternative Energy industry has rallied 23 1  in the past year  surpassing the S P 500 index s 13 2  gain 
U S  Renewable Trends
The U S  renewable energy industry has witnessed significant growth over the last several years  with a number of important decisions in 2015 by both state and federal governments really helping the space  The U S  renewable energy industry cheered Republicans  maintaining of key tax credits in the December 2017 tax legislation  which were at a risk of being removed  This has boosted analysts  confidence in the industry s prospects 
According to the U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA    total renewables used in the electric power sector was 15  in 2016  which rose to 17  in 2017  Electricity generation from hydropower accounted for more than 7  in 2017 and is expected to fall below 7  in 2018 and 2019  Generation from renewables other than hydropower is expected to rise from below 10  in 2017 to 10  in 2018 and nearly 11  in 2019 
A comprehensive study by the Department of Energy s National Renewable Energy Laboratory  NREL  shows that renewables will contribute more than 80  of total electricity generation in the United States by 2050  compared with the present 30  
The main drivers for the U S  renewable industry are new onshore wind and solar capacities  such as multi year federal tax incentives combined with renewable portfolio standards as well as state level policies for distributed solar PV  Moreover  the nation is increasing its offshore wind capacities as majority of the electricity demand comes from coastal areas 
However  uncertainty over international trade and energy policies may impede the expansion of renewables  In particular  Trump s signing of an order to repeal the Clean Power Plan and decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement may deal a severe blow to the clean energy space 
Apart from being the largest solar installer globally  China has successfully expanded its realms in other alternative energy sources like wind and hydro  posing a competitive threat to the U S  alternative energy industry 
Here  we discuss some of the major alternative energy sources 
Solar
A key area in the renewable space is solar energy  Per an EIA report  solar electricity generation in 2017 was 211 gigawatt hour day  GWh d   which is likely to increase to 246 GWh d in 2018 and 294 GWh d in 2019  In spite of the rapid uptake  solar contributed just 1 3  of the total U S  utility scale generation in 2017  indicating immense scope for growth 
Over the past few years  utility scale solar represented almost two thirds of the market  and this trend will likely continue in the near term  given the huge pipeline of projects under construction  According to an EIA report  nearly 4 7 GW of utility scale solar PV systems were added in the U S  in 2017 
As per the latest U S  Solar Market Insight report  the U S  installed 10 6 GW of solar PV capacity in 2017 to reach the total capacity to 53 3 GW  enough to power 10 1 million homes  This shows a 30  decline from a record breaking 2016 but a 40  improvement over the 2015 level  Moreover  total installed U S  PV capacity is expected to more than double over the next five years and more than 15 GW of PV capacity will be installed annually by 2023 
However  Trump s recent imposition of a 30  tariff on import of crystalline silicon solar cells and modules is expected to drive solar installations  Following this  GTM Research issued a revised report that shows that the U S  solar market will see a net reduction in installations of around 11  as a result of the latest tariffs 
Utility PV continues to hold the largest share of annual installations in the U S  solar market  Notably  voluntary procurement  rather than state mandated Renewable Portfolio Standards  will continue to be the primary driver of new utility PV demand  which is anticipated to drive one third of utility build out in 2018 
Hydro
As one of the first technologies used to generate electricity  hydro has been the largest source of renewable electricity in the United States  Hydro generation is typically highest in the spring when precipitation and melting snow pack increase water runoff 
Notably  hydro provided 7 4  of total utility scale generation in 2017  courtesy of a relatively wet year for the United States  However  based on projections of water runoff  the EIA projects hydroelectricity generation to be slightly lower at 6 5  of total utility scale generation in 2018 and 6 6  in 2019 
It goes without saying that hydroelectricity has immense prospects in the Unites States  Evidently  the U S  Department of Energy s Hydropower Vision analysis finds that U S  hydropower can rise from 101 GW of capacity in 2015 to nearly 150 GW by 2050   The analysis further predicts that this hydropower growth can save  209 billion by avoiding global damages from greenhouse gas emissions through 2050  With this level of deployment  more than 35 million average U S  homes might be powered with hydroelectricity by 2050 
Wind
A recent EIA report shows that wind power generation will surpass hydroelectricity in 2018  Although changes in weather patterns affect wind generation  the forecast for wind power output is more dependent on the capacity and timing of new wind turbines coming online 
In this line  the EIA expects significant levels of new wind capacity to come online in 2018 and 2019  keeping with the latest trend  The EIA expects wind capacity to increase by 8 3 GW in 2018 and 8 GW in 2019  If these new generating units come online as scheduled  they would add 9  to U S  utility scale wind capacity by the end of 2018 and another 8  by the end of 2019 
As a result  it is expected that wind generation will account for 6 4  and 6 9  of total utility scale electricity generation in the United States in 2018 and 2019  respectively  up from 6 3  in 2017  Further  EIA estimates that wind generated on average 697 GWh d in 2017  which will rise to 722 GWh d in 2018 and 778 GWh d in 2019 
The American Wind Energy Association   AWEA   reported that 4 125 MW of wind capacity was installed in the United States during the fourth quarter of 2017  reaching the full year s installed capacity to 7 017 MW  Wind capacity of 13 332 MW is currently under construction  while another 15 336 MW is in the advanced stage of development  The total capacity thus comes to 28 668 MW  reflecting 34  year over year growth  Project developers declared 4 054 MW in new construction activity and 1 338 MW in new advanced development activity during the fourth quarter  a combined 5 393 MW 
During the fourth quarter  16 states commissioned 29 new wind projects  Texas led with 1 179 MW  followed by Oklahoma  851 MW   Iowa  334 MW   Illinois  306 MW  and Missouri  300 MW   Presently  there are 89 077 MW of installed wind capacity in the United States  with more than 54 000 wind turbines operating in 41 states  plus Guam and Puerto Rico

Bottom Line
From this discussion  it is clear that demand for renewables is expanding at an accelerating rate as the world aims to transform into a carbon free space  While policy uncertainties under current administration remain a headwind  big global corporations are investing substantially to cash in on the bountiful prospects of renewables 
Moreover  rise of China as a strong player in renewables  particularly solar  may also threaten the United States  expansion  in the light of the recent import tax implementation  Nevertheless  technological advancements leading to rapid expansion of newfound renewables like offshore wind technologies should keep the U S  alternative energy stocks afloat

Review 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question   Were You Stopped Out   We reviewed the dangers of using stop orders to limit risks  and discussed ideas for minimizing the chances of getting stopped out near the bottom only to miss out on the subsequent rebound  If you missed it  a glance at your news feed will show that the key points remain relevant 
This Week  Are You Out of Your Comfort Zone 
Traders often get comfortable with  what works   until all of a sudden it doesn t work anymore  For example  by historical standards  anticipated market volatility isn t very high right now  but it is still twice as high as it was just last month  as measured by the VIX 

If you don t know  the VIX is a market volatility measure  often referred to as the market  fear gauge   and we just did a write up about it earlier this week  What Investors Should Know About VIX  However  even though  fear   anticipated volatility  isn t exorbitantly high by historical market standards  the recent increase has taken investors outside of their comfort zone  Specifically  they got comfortable trading in a certain market environment  i e  extremely low volatility  and now that that has changed  some traders have been taken way outside of their comfort zone  In the words of famous baseball player Yogi Berra   The future ain t what it used to be  
This is relevant because there are a few important lessons to be learned  or at least reminded of  about how when traders can should stick to their setups and plans  For example  Dr  Brett Steenbarger has a brilliant write up titled    which delves into the psychological problem of learning something so well that it becomes automatic  The problem is that when your environment changes  the conditioned behaviors you ve developed become irrelevant and often even harmful 
Returning to our discussion of the VIX  many traders had become comfortable shorting volatility  And that trade was working great until volatility increased  For example  here is a look at what happened to the inverse VIX  XIV  security earlier this month when volatility finally increased 

A trade that had been working very well for many months  all of a sudden turned into an enormous loss  And our suspicion is that the recent spat of increased volatility caught many traders off guard  Whether they were over leveraged  or just too comfortable with risk  the market changed and they were not ready  And now they are outside their comfort zone in the new environment  According to Dr  Steenbarger 

Visualizing old ways of thinking  feeling  and acting that now bring us pain and allowing ourselves to fully feel all the disgust  guilt  remorse  and anger associated with the consequences of those patterns completely changes our trading psychology  We no longer fall into comfortable habits  because we no longer feel comfortable with those habits  We have turned them into enemies  That is powerful 
 Source  Brett Steenbarger s Trading Psychology Resource Center

Knowing how to adjust for different trading environments is important to us  And one way we ve built this into our trading programs is to adjust our defined trading rules and systems based on market volatility levels  This allows the humans to stay out of the way while the trading models do what they are supposed to do in different market environments  Our human execution of the models trades provides an additional check that nothing is wrong  but we rarely make changes 
The key takeaway is that when the market takes you outside of your comfort zone  you need to adapt  In this case  when volatility levels change  traders should recognize their once profitable trading programs can quickly turn very destructive  And without adapting  in this case  our models adjust based on volatility levels   your profits can quickly disappear

Expert Picks From The Models 
This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by  
Holmes  This week I bought Arista Networks  NYSE ANET   Are you familiar with this one 
Blue Harbinger  Yes  Holmes I am familiar  Arista supplies cloud networking solutions  Why do you like this stock 
Holmes   Cloud networking solutions   Can you be a little more specific  Blue Harbinger  And I like it for the same reason that I like all of my picks  I am a  dip buyer   and ANET s dip over the last week is the sort of set up I like to see  From the chart below  you can see it is below its 50 day moving average  and it has attractive upside over the next six weeks 

BH  Interesting  Holmes  And yes I can provide a more specific definition of Arista s business even though I know you are a technical model  and you re far more interested in the price action and market conditions than you are in the fundamentals  Nonetheless  Arista pioneers and delivers software driven cloud networking solutions for large data center storage and computing environments  Revenue and Net Income has been growing rapidly for this company over the last few years  but its price to earnings ratio is still fairly high  even after the shares fell last week despite announcing expectation beating revenues and earnings  Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

Holmes  So you re telling me this company is basically growing like wildfire  it has essentially zero long term debt  and it just announced expectation beating earnings  but the shares still just sold off  I like Arista even more now than I did before 
BH  Well  if you must know  Holmes  the reason the shares sold off is because management says growth is slowing  After delivering 50  growth in the last two quarters  Arista s revenues are only expected to grow by 37  this quarter 
Holmes   Only  37   I still like this setup a lot  I usually hold for about six weeks  so check back with me then 
BH  Great  Thanks  Holmes  How about your  Road Runner what have you got for us this week

BH  I see why you bought this stock  Road Runner  I know you like to buy stocks in the lower end of a rising channel  and you typically like to sell them after about four weeks  but this one did not work out perfectly 
RR  I ended up exiting at a lower price than I bought  but I was able to take advantage of a slightly higher price in a period of decline  You can t win them all  but as long as the size of your winners is bigger than the size of your losers  you ll do alright  We ve written about this is previous Stock Exchanges  such as this one  Know When To Fold  Em 
BH  So what you re saying is the price moved outside of your  comfort zone   From a fundamentals standpoint  Whiting announced expectation beating earnings and revenue  as well as forecasting a smaller than previously expected quarterly loss  This is an energy exploration and production company focused primarily in the Rocky Mountain region  And the recent unexpected drop in crude oil inventories will help the business  Here is a look at the Fast Graph  and as you can see Whiting has been struggling since energy prices plummeted in the second half of 2014 

RR  I wasn t out of my comfort zone  I am an objective technical model  and I was created to specifically avoid the  comfort zone  issue you re describing  However  thanks for that information  How about you  Athena what have you got this week 
Athena  I like Twitter  NYSE TWTR  
BH  What do you like about Twitter  Athena 
Athena  I am a momentum trader  Here is a look at the chart 

BH  You certainly are a momentum trader  It takes courage to buy a stock that s just rallied nearly 38  in the last month  You must like that Twitter beat earnings and revenue estimates on February 8th when it announced  correct 
Athena  I like the things you mentioned  but my pick is based more on strong technicals 
BH  Well it s nice to see Twitter finally turning a GAAP profit for the first time  However  I don t think this company is growing fast enough to get excited about  According to the earnings release  fourth quarter revenue grew by only 2  year over year  and net margins are only 12   Plus  it makes me a little uncomfortable that CEO Jack Dorsey is also the CEO of Square  NYSE SQ   I question his focus  And honestly  I like Square s business and growth potential much more  Here is a look at the Fast Graph for Twitter 

Athena  Thanks for the information  but you seem focused on long term growth  My typical holding period is only about 17 weeks 
BH  Well then I ll check back with you on Twitter in about 17 weeks  How about you  Felix what have you got this week 
Felix  This week I like First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  
BH  You like First Solar  this company designs  manufactures and sells photovoltaic   PV   solar modules with a thin film semiconductor technology  First Solar has developed  constructed and currently operates many of the world s largest grid connected PV power plants  Any particular reason you like this company  Felix 
Felix  I am a momentum trader  but unlike the other traders  I hold my position for a longer time period  66 weeks on average 

BH  Then I am assuming you are aware of more of the fundamentals  beyond only the technicals  How do you feel about the 30  tariff that was recently imposed on international  mainly China  suppliers of solar panels to the US 
Felix  The tariff may help First Solar in the near term  although in the longer term tariffs usually result in less efficient trade 
BH  First Solar announced earnings this week  They beat consensus estimates by  0 06 per share  although the company missed on revenue  And worth mentioning  First Solar has a strong balance sheet which will enable it to invest in its business going forward 
Felix  Thanks for that information  but I mainly like this stock because it has momentum and more room to run 
Conclusion 
When market conditions change  it often quickly takes traders outside of their comfort zones  And rather than sticking to a trading regime that was designed specifically for a market environment that no longer exists  it s important for traders to  unlearn  old trading behaviors that used to create profits but now create losses  For example  our technical trading models make adjustments when expected volatility changes 
As famous baseball player Yogi Berra once said   the future ain t what it used to be   In this case  the key takeaway is that when the market changes and takes you outside of your comfort zone  you need to adapt

118856,340371,FSLR,Are Solar Stocks In Free Fall Post Trump s 30  Tariff Slam ,opinion,"It has been more than a month since the Trump administration announced a new import tariff on solar panels and modules at the World Economic Forum  Per the decision  30  tariff has been levied on solar panel components  In four years  time the tax rate is expected to come down to 15   However  the first 2 5 gigawatts of imported solar cells are exempted from this tax 
Following the news  the U S  solar stocks moved up buoyed by hopes that such trade restriction will create jobs for the Americans  However  with the passage of time the solar industry s growth has not sustained as investors seemed to have become skeptical over the long term success of the tariff 
The 30  tariff on solar panels is one of the first unilateral trade restrictions imposed by Trump as part of a broader protectionist agenda to help U S  manufacturers against foreign producers who flood the market with cheaper solar modules 
Trump s 30  Solar Tariff   a Blessing in Disguise 
The U S  administration argued that the Chinese government subsidized solar manufacturers and allowed them to sell products in the United States at less than their fair market value  This led to a three fold increase in solar power generation capacity across the United States during Obama s second term and quintupled imports  As a result prices slumped 60   This resulted in increased price competition among the U S  solar stocks and more than two dozen companies were forced to stall operations   
U S  solar industry advocates  however  have been raising strong objections against the move  The U S  Solar Energy Industries Association predicted that the tariff may cut forecasted solar installations this year by nearly 20   to 9 gigawatts from 11 gigawatts  and lead to the loss of 23 000 jobs in the United States  the world s fourth largest solar market after China  Japan and Germany  
Research firm Wood Mackenzie also estimated that over the next five years the tariffs will reduce U S  solar installation growth by 10 15  
Present Industry Trends
The present industry trends are reflecting what many analysts feared  The new tariff was anticipated to result in several job cuts owing to a hike in price  At least for companies like SunPower it did turn out to be true 
However  companies like Suniva and SolarWorld are likely to benefit from the decision  Both companies requested for a trade relief citing their inability to compete against cheap imports that have resulted in a fall in panel prices more than 30  since 2016  They also requested for an imposition of 50  import tariff on solar components  Also  companies like Sunrun  who took timely measures to counter losses due to price rise in the wake of the tariff  did not suffer 
Let s take a detailed look at the a few stocks to understand how the tariff has impacted the solar industry 
Winners
California based Sunrun Inc    NASDAQ RUN   develops  owns  manages and sells residential solar energy systems across the United States  Since it purchases most of its solar panels from Singapore  South Korea and Canada  the company strongly opposed this tariff fearing it might hurt its core business 
On a brighter note  Sunrun made advanced purchase of panels at tariff free rates  This provided cushion to the company s stock  Moreover  as per the Greentech Media Research  residential PV projects are less sensitive to import tariffs than utility scale PV projects  This may also be a reason why the company did not suffered following the tariff imposition 
Notably  the company s share price has gained 10 2  since Jan 23  when the tariff was announced  It currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  

 
California based Enphase Energy  Inc    NASDAQ ENPH   delivers microinverter technology for the solar industry  which increases productivity and reliability of solar modules  Although  the company produces the microinverters in the United States  these are shipped to manufacturers in Asia to attach to panels before they re sold in the United States  So  technically the products of Enphase Energy are imported by the United States 
The company recently requested for an exemption from the tariff citing that the legislation s intent is to target imported cells and modules  and not inverters  Considering the company s confidence in achieving this exemption  investors remained in favor of its growth  Moreover  after a rather turbulent period  the company returned to profitability per its recently released fourth quarter results  This has also boosted its share price 
Notably  the company s share price surged 66 5  since Jan 23  It currently holds a Zacks Rank  2 

Losers
California based SunPower Corporation   NASDAQ SPWR   designs  develops  manufactures  markets and sells high performance solar electric power technology products  systems and services for residential  commercial and utility scale power plant customers worldwide  The company recently started the process of laying off 150 250 people due to an expected loss of  50 million this year alone due to the 30  solar tariff 
However  we should keep in mind that even in the absence of this tariff  its results were not very impressive  The company suffered a 25  decline in revenues during the fourth quarter 
Considering these factors  the company s share price declined 11 9  since Jan 23  It currently holds a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  

 
Arizona based First Solar  Inc    NASDAQ FSLR   designs  manufactures and sells solar electric power modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology  Impressively the company is already exempted from the tariff because its thin film technology differs from the material used by most companies in Asia 
However  plagued by rapidly dropping silicon prices  First Solar had to cut costs and drive up the efficiency of its panels to remain afloat in the industry  Moreover  the company reported a loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 yet again  owing to a significant rise in expenses resulting from the tax reform passed in December 2017 
As a result  the company s share price fell 6 1  since Jan 23  It currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

 
Bottom Line
The above discussion clearly indicates that the latest tariff has had an adverse impact on manufacturers that depend on module and panel imports  Yet  most of the companies that have lost value in terms of share price cannot be blamed upon the tariff alone  other inherent factors played their part as well  Although the overall industry has dipped 0 4  since the imposition of the tariff  the long term impact of the same remains a wait and watch story

	 Assuming there are no surprises  I believe this will have a longer term bullish effect on the market as it should show the Fed s confidence in the economy  but at the same time confirm that they will take a slow and measured pace when raising rates 
	 Expecting to put this correction consolidation behind us shortly thereafter and begin a whole new leg higher      Kevin Matras

But trading volume continued to be light as investors took a wait and see approach ahead of the European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday and the U S  government s May nonfarm payrolls report on Friday 
 Today s ADP  employment  figures were not enough to provide a direction for Friday s numbers   said Tim Ghriskey  chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills  New York

118915,340430,FSLR,Stock Market Soaring Back To The Edge Of Overbought,opinion,"AT40   69 0  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   63 3  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   9 9Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary Last week  I complained about the stock market s  rubber band  getting stretched  I claimed that AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   had to push into overbought territory  above 70   and or the volatility index  the VIX  had to push to new all time lows to enable a push higher for the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY    The S P 500 made another all time high on Thursday  but AT40 rallied just short of the overbought threshold by closing at 69 0   and the VIX closed with a gain 5 out of the last 6 trading days  AT40 jumped from 63 5  to 69 0  and firmly confirmed Thursday s rally in the stock market 
On the way here  the S P 500 delivered a small bearish divergence on Tuesday that looked like the beginning of a confirmation of my concerns  the S P 500 rallied while AT40 declined   Sure enough  the S P 500 took a dip next  Yet  faithful buyers rallied the index off its low of the day and kept up the pace by creating Thursday s 0 7  gain and new all time high 

The S P 500  SPY  delivered the shortest of hiccups before soaring to a new all time high this week  The index has closed at or above its upper Bollinger Band  BB  6 out of the last 7 trading days 


The NASDAQ is matching the S P 500 stride for stride 

The PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  actually closed just BELOW its upper Bollinger Band  BB  at its fresh all time high 


The volatility index  the VIX  was faded hard on Wednesday  but it looks like it is stabilizing above all time lows 
The brevity and shallowness of the dip is part of a months long pattern  I was amused by the conventional financial media that assigned great weight to the selling and went on expeditions to explain the losses  Most  if not all  of those explanations appear meaningless now 
My short term trading call remains at  cautiously bullish   If AT40 fades from here  I will get a lot MORE cautious and likely even downgrade to no better than neutral  A close for the S P 500 below Wednesday s intraday low would take me quickly to bearish  However  I assume now that the market s momentum will carry it confidently into overbought territory before any bearish signals trigger  I fully recognize that a bearish signal in this context is much less a selling trigger than it is a  stop buying and wait for the next entry  trigger

First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  FSLR is by far my favorite solar stock  so I am kicking myself for not having a fresh position  On Thursday  FSLR achieved a MAJOR breakout to an amazing 6  year high  There was a time not long ago that I thought FSLR might never reach this point  at least not for many more years  It is now time to more aggressively buy the dips

Domino s Pizza Group Plc  NYSE DPZ  In this market  I play the dips where they get served  On Wednesday  the CEO of Dominos announced he will retire mid year  The stock gapped down after the open and bounced back after it traded lower  I rushed in to load up on a call option given the stock s prior strength rallying off the November lows and its 200DMA breakout a week ago  I was rewarded much faster than expected as the call option nearly doubled with the stock ripping to a 4 9  gain  It was like the stock picked up where it left off 
DPZ closed the gap down from October earnings  I locked in profits on this trade  per rule to sell after realizing a quick double   but DPZ is solidly locked into the buy the dip list

My options for this week will  very likely  go out worthless  I bought shares to ride what I think will be an eventual resumption of old momentum  I am also looking to replay call options for the next few weeks  If ULTA closes below its 20DMA  the next stop will be a visit to 50DMA support 
Ulta Beauty  ULTA  was soundly rejected from 200DMA resistance  Disappointed traders quickly took the stock down to 20DMA support from there  However  two hammers at support suggest a rebound is finally in the works

The tariffs will help Whirlpool compete with Asian competitors like Samsung  KS 005930  and LG  although Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  analyst Susan Maklari said that these two competitors already have plans to increase U S  based manufacturing 
 All those producing in the US will now face a similar cost structure  creating a more level playing field   Maklari wrote in a note to clients   That said   Samsung and LG  have commenced construction of U S  based capacity  which is expected to come on line over the next 12 18 months  As such  we expect this decision to become less impactful in time  
Still  Samsung has expressed its disappointment with the decision shortly after the tariff was announced on Monday  In a statement  the South Korean manufacturing giant described the policy as  a great loss for American consumers and workers  
On the other hand  Whirlpool promised to add jobs and increase investments in manufacturing and innovation in the wake of the tariff  The home appliance behemoth said on Monday that it will add 200 full time jobs at a factory in Clyde  Ohio 
The Trump administration s new tariff policy also includes a penalty on imported solar cells  These fees will include a 30  charge on anything after the first 2 5 gigawatts of imported cells  which will fall to a 15  charge by the fourth year 
Shares of several American solar parts makers  including First Solar   NASDAQ FSLR    were in the green during morning trading Tuesday

118955,340470,FSLR,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  DTE Energy  NRG Energy  Amazon  SunPower And First Solar,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 14  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Semiconductors  including DTE Energy Company   NYSE DTE    NRG Energy Inc    NYSE NRG    Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    SunPower Corp    NASDAQ SPWR   and First Solar Inc    NASDAQ FSLR   Industry  Alternative Energy  Part 2Link    Despite the uncertainty related to U S  tax policy or commitment to fight climate change  the momentum achieved by the renewable energy sector is unlikely to subside Contracts from small  to medium sized companies are expected to continue flowing in  even if large corporations choose to tread cautiously  The declining cost of energy storage should also continue to aid the penetration of renewable resources The underlying driver for each of these market trends is significant customer demand for renewables  It is expected that the renewable space will continue to innovate in 2018 to offer consumers clean  affordable renewable energy  This should help stocks in this space maintain their strong momentum in the New Year Stocks in the Zacks Alternative Energy industry  part of the Zacks Oil Energy sector  were up 28 4  in the last year compared with a rally of 23 4  for the Oil Energy sector and 17 8  gain for the S P 500 index  This shows that the Trump administration s less than enthusiastic support hasn t harmed the industry s prospects The major advantage of using renewable energy is that there will be no dearth of supply  Also  renewable energy facilities usually need less maintenance compared with traditional generators  The fact that the fuel is derived from natural and existing resources reduces the cost of operations  Apart from this  there are hardly any waste products generated by renewable energy such as carbon dioxide or other chemical pollutants  Therefore  its negative impact on the environment is minimal Solar and wind   two major alternative energy sources   are gradually transforming the way we produce and consume energy  driving the ongoing global energy transition  Although some better established sources of alternative energy   hydro  wind  biomass and waste  not to mention solar PV   are supported extensively  niche renewable energy sources such as geothermal and concentrated solar power   CSP   are also on the rise  natural conditions permitting Wind and solar are not only essential when it comes to reducing carbon emissions but also have a remarkable contribution in saving lives  This is because these renewable sources edge out fossil fuels and reduce air pollutants in addition to carbon emissions  This leads to improved air quality  with a corresponding drop in premature deaths According to recent reports  renewable energy has surpassed nuclear power as a percentage of U S  energy generation  Declining cost of solar generation is anticipated to be the driving factor behind a dramatic increase in renewable power Again  the extension of key renewable tax credits and reduced solar photovoltaic  PV  capital costs  are expected to drive growth of alternative energy Moreover  former President Obama s  Climate Change Action Plan   which is still valid  has propelled the sector northward  Efforts to restrict carbon emissions are a positive for renewable energy stocks  As per U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   in 2016  CO2 emissions declined 1 6   Energy related CO2 emissions are expected to decline 0 8  in 2017 The plan urged utility providers to gradually shift their mode of power generation to solar  wind and water  Some of these utilities include DTE Energy Company  DTE  and NRG Energy Inc   NRG   While DTE Energy sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   NRG Eenrgy carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  The EIA observes that even if the Trump administration abolishes the Clean Power Plan  the renewable space will continue to grow in the United States albeit at a slower rate  EIA projects U S  renewable generation capacity to grow by an average of 1 9  per year between 2017 and 2050 Apart from this  Francesco Starace  chief executive of Italy based Enel  MI ENEI   the largest European power company  said that investment in renewable energy across the globe  including the United States  will continue to grow regardless of the new U S  administration s full support  He added that Enel has plans to invest  5 2 billion in renewable generation  mainly wind and solar power  both in Europe and the United States over the next three years Realizing growth opportunities in the renewable energy space  companies from other domains have also expressed their interest to invest in solar stocks  In line with this  e commerce giant Amazon  AMZN  plans to bring online five new solar farms  totaling 180 megawatts  MW   to help power its massive cloud data centers  The new solar facilities  located in Virginia  will be connected to the grid by the end of 2017  Amazon also has other renewable projects underway  which will be completed by this year Here we take a look at the alternative energy space and attempt to identify this nascent industry s strengths Extension of ITC  Solar and wind energy got a major boost from the environmental tax credit extension that came as part of the  1 15 trillion federal spending bill in December 2105  which also lifted a 40 year ban on exporting American crude oil  The latest report from EIA also shows that renewable energy will be the fastest growing power source through 2040  accounting for 27  of total U S  generation On Dec 15  2015  Congress passed an extension and modification of federal tax credits for new wind and solar generators  The new environmental tax credit extension allows solar power companies to keep claiming federal Investment Tax Credits   ITC   at 30  of the price of solar energy systems installed by businesses or homeowners  The ITC  which was earlier set to expire at the end of 2016  rushed developers to finish projects  Now they look good through 2019 with the five year extension  However  the credit will start to decline  going down to 10  in 2022 Moreover  the wind power industry benefited significantly from the production tax credit   PTC   extension  The PTC  which had expired in 2014 end due to Congressional gridlock  was extended through 2020  However  the PTC that pays 2 3 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity generated will be gradually reduced over the next four years before being completely phased out The EIA projects that utility scale solar capacity will increase almost 10 gigawatts  GW  between 2017 and 2018 in the United States  given considerable rise in renewables consumption for electricity and heat generation purpose  California  along with North Carolina  Nevada  Texas and Georgia  will account for most of the projected utility scale capacity additions over the period The EIA expects wind energy capacity additions of 14 GW in 2017 2018  With these additions  total wind capacity will reach 96 GW by the end of 2018 Anti Dumping Duties and Solar Trade War  Washington imposed import duties on solar panels and other related products from China and Taiwan  The U S  believes that Chinese manufacturers have benefited from unfair subsidies offered by their government  U S  solar stocks like SunPower Corp  and First Solar Inc  are expected to make the most of the trade conflict between the United States and China The U S  Department of Commerce   DOC    in Dec 2014  set anti dumping duties at about 52  on most module imports from China and at 19 5  on most imports of Taiwanese cells  It also slapped 39  anti subsidy tariffs on most China made panels  The move was intended to stop Chinese companies from using solar cells made in Taiwan to avoid paying higher tariffs Follow us on Twitter   Join us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB    Zacks Investment Research

118957,340472,FSLR,Yingli Green Energy  YGE  Q3 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Ltd    NYSE YGE    also known as Yingli Green Energy  is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Dec 19 
Last quarter  the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 26 83   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
During the second quarter earnings call  Yingli Green Energy stated that it expects significant increase in third quarter shipments  which is estimated at 550 600 megawatts  MW   The estimate reflects an increase of 50 6 64 2  from the year ago quarter s figure  China is expected to comprise a major portion of the total shipment 
In the second quarter  the company s gross margin suffered due to declining average selling price  ASP  of Photovoltaic  PV  modules shipments  To cushion the decelerating prices  Yingli Green Energy has been resorting to cost effective measures  which include reduction of in house cost of PV modules 
However  the drop in cost was slower than the decline of the ASP  since the company is still experiencing a bad restructure  In the yet to be reported quarter  management expects similar trends to continue 
Also  the company s weak operating cash flow figures are expected to be reflected in the third quarter results 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Yingli Green Energy will beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Yingli Green Energy are pegged at a loss of  2 61  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Yingli Green Energy carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  You can see 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited Price and EPS Surprise

This Week  How to Trade with More Perspective 
There are a variety of different valuable perspectives from which you can view your trading opportunities  For example  identifying trend reversals  understanding seasonality impacts  and using a blended approach  between  dip buying  and  trend following   for example  are all different yet valuable perspectives  and we ll cover each of them in more detail later is this report 
Model Performance and Announcement 
Per reader feedback  we ve been including a table summarizing the performance results for our trading models  The following table shows actual client results after commissions and fees 

Importantly  we now have some useful  real time trading for all of the models  This supplements the extensive development and out of sample periods  As I have been reporting  blending a trend following model with a dip buying model provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
For these reasons I am changing the  Trade with Jeff  offer at Seeking Alpha to include a 50 50 split between Holmes and Athena  Current participants have already agreed to this  Since our costs on Athena are lower  we have also lowered the fees for the combination 
If you have been thinking about giving it a try  click through at the bottom of this post for more information 
Trading with More Perspective 
Aside from our  blended approach   whereby we combine multiple models  there are plenty of other sources for gaining perspective as well  For example  according to   spotting  trend reversals  can be an important skill for traders  He explains a useful trick in this recent Q A excerpt 
Q  When trying to spot trend reversals  I like to flip the chart upside down as it helps me identify the reversal better  Is there a way to do this without manually printing the chart out and flipping it 
A  Yes  you can flip any chart upside down at  by adding a hyphen before the ticker symbol  For example  if you use the ticker symbol   SPX this is the chart flipped upside down  It is a nifty trick that sometimes can be useful to see if you re looking at things the correct way especially when evaluating the potential for any counter trend reversals 



Another  perhaps more esoteric  approach for adding perspective can simply be considering your trades under a different light  For example  the following  shows which indexes  sectors  industries and commodities tend to perform best during which calendar months  each bar indicates a buy and sell date based on the optimal holding period  




We are in the strong season for stocks  but some cross currents from tax policies could have an impact 
We are in the strong season for stocks  but some cross currents from tax policies could have an impact 
Viewing your trades from a variety of perspectives can help improve your overall results  In our case we view our aggregate trading portfolio from the perspective of both dip buying a trend following  as well as a variety of other risk controls  as described in the table near the end of this report

RR  Well then  as you know  I like to buy stocks that are at the bottom of a rising channel  And based on the following chart  you can see why I like Restoration Hardware  again 

BH  Restoration Hardware has certainly been an interesting story this year  considering all the shares that have been repurchased  as well as the CEO increasing his shares significantly leading up to its most recent quarterly earnings announcement whereby the company beat expectations and raised guidance  Considering your successful track record trading this stock  I ll be watching closely  Remind us  what is your typical holdings period 

Road Runner  My typical holding period is about 4 weeks

Athena  I like First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  
BH  Interesting  As you know  First Solar designs  manufactures and sells photovoltaic   PV   solar modules with a thin film semiconductor technology  The company operates through two segments  components and systems 
Athena  I did know that  but it s largely irrelevant to my trade  Specifically  I am a momentum trader  and my typical holding period is only about 17 weeks  Based on the following chart  First Solar has a lot of upside price potential 

BH  Well Athena  I see the share price is up significantly this year  but for your information  First Solar had negative net income in 2016  and margins have been thin this year   Here is a look at First Solar s Fast Graph 

Athena  Thanks for that information  but I m a trader  not an investor  and First Solar looks attractive right now

118960,340475,FSLR,Can First Solar  FSLR  Maintain Its Stellar Show In 2018 ,opinion,First Solar Inc    NASDAQ FSLR   has exhibited a solid bull run to date in 2017  The stock has more than quintupled the broader market and returned 112 1   so far this year  compared with S P 500 index s gain of 20 2  When most of the U S  based public solar companies like SunPower Corp   NASDAQ SPWR    8point3 Energy Partners LP   NASDAQ CAFD   and Vivint Solar  Inc    NYSE VSLR   did not gain more than 60  over the year  First Solar s stellar performance underscores the inherent potential in the stock Notably  Trump s walking out of Paris accord this June has been a primary reason behind majority of solar companies in the nations of not recording substantial growth   Realizing that the time is right  First Solar announced plans of taking a loan worth  64 million from Mizuho Bank on Jun 9 to finance its utility scale solar project pipeline in Japan and install solar modules  Since then  the company has accelerated its expansion plans in foreign lands Not only a well planned expansion strategy was instrumental in driving First Solar s growth  few other factors also helped the stock gain momentum  Below we have discussed the factors which have boosted this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company maintain its robust performance throughout 2017  You can see   Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018  Be among the first to see our   Prospects in the Global Solar MarketSolar power has become the viable alternative energy source today  GTM Research s latest  Global Solar Demand Monitor  report states that eight countries will surpass the 1 gigawatts  GW  level of annual Photovoltaic  PV  installations by the end of 2017  By the end of 2018  five more countries will achieve the milestone With China having established itself as the world s largest market for solar panels  First Solar has identified solid growth prospects there  courtesy of its thin film solar modules  Apart from China  the company also boasts a strong footprint in Australia and Japan  Evidently  during third quarter 2017  in Australia  First Solar signed new module supply agreements of 240 megawatts  MW   thereby totaling its contracted delivery pipeline of modules to over 500 MW in the nation In Japan  First Solar booked 21 MW DC systems project  which took the total contracted pipeline in Japan to over 240 MW DC  First Solar has also increased its focus in the growing Indian solar market  It has announced plans to develop solar capacity of 5 GW by 2019 to support India s plan to install 100 GW of solar electricity by 2022  India s goal to ramp up its solar market will likely benefit the company at large  under the Batch 1 phase II of the National Solar Mission Recently  the company set foot in the untapped solar market of Pakistan  by collaborating with Zorlu Holding  for delivering more than 860 000 of thin film modules  The modules will be used to power a 100 MW AC facility The aforementioned discussions clearly reflect the strong growth opportunities First Solar enjoys in the international market  particularly in Australia and Japan  As of Sep 30 2017  the company had  0 5 billion of net PV solar power systems that had been placed in service primarily in international markets Series 6 Module LaunchEarlier this month  First Solar launched its latest product line   Series 6 PV module    at its 2017 Analyst Day as well as issued 2018 guidance  The company projects this product to enter the market with a power rating of 420 445 watts and conversion efficiency of over 17   These modules will provide more watts per lift than comparable crystalline silicon solar panels and can be installed on virtually any ground based PV mounting system First Solar expects to start commercially manufacturing these modules by early second quarter 2018  On being operational  Series 6 will have an annualized output of 600MWdc at full capacity Moreover  First Solar plans to double production capacity of Series 6 modules at its under construction Vietnamese facility  Following this  annualized production capacity at this  when fully operational  will be 2 4GWdc  Cumulatively  from its facilities in Perrysburg and Kulim  Malaysia the company will be able to attain manufacturing capacity of approximately 5 4GWdc by 2020  for Series 6 modules  Toward this end  First Solar aims to invest  1 4 billion Despite the company s 2018 outlook not being impressive on a year over year basis  its share price has surged 7   This reflects investors  optimism toward the launch of its next generation PV module  The increased cost for the production of Series 6 modules have led to the drab outlook We expect the company to gain substantially once production starts at full capacity and positive accretion is realized from the sale of this latest module  If this happens  then First Solar s 2018 outlook can improve Solid Bookings Reflecting Strong DemandFirst Solar enjoys a solid booking across the globe  which in turn reflects strong demand for solar PV modules  On a year to date basis  as of Sep 30  2017   the company reported bookings of 6 7 GW  First Solar expects to eventually increase EPC and O M services which will improve its overall systems bookings number   During the third quarter  the company s bookings of 4 5 GW were geographically diversified  with solid demand witnessed in India  Asia Pacific and Europe  outside the United States In fact  management has described the company s third quarter bookings as a record one  which in turn reflects both the robust market demand for Series 4 and Series 6 module technology and the acceleration of procurement timing by customers What s Ahead for the U S  Solar Industry Although Trump has been intending to revive the coal industry for long  realizing the fact that renewables are our ultimate future  most of the utility providers are continuing with their transition from fossil fuel to alternative fuels  A U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  report projects total renewables used in the electric power sector to increase 41  in 2018 The prospect of solar is still bright in the United States  An EIA report indicates growth in utility scale solar power capacity by almost 41  from 22 GW at the end of 2016  The projected increase will bring the amount of solar capacity to 27 GW at 2017 end and to 31 GW at 2018 end  Solar will still constitute just 1  of total U S  utility scale generation in 2018  indicating immense scope for growth Notably  the U S  market accounted for 83  of First Solar s revenues in 2016  With EIA projecting solar consumption in the country to go up 119  to 0 933 quadrillion British thermal unit in 2018 from 2015  prospect of this company s expansion in the domestic market also remains huge Should You Retain FSLR Stock in Your Portfolio We believe that First Solar is a profitable stock which could be a prudent long term bet for risk averse investors  given its

118992,340507,FSLR,Alternative Energy Stock Outlook   December 2017,opinion,"Reducing dependence on fossil fuels has been a policy goal for a long time  at least since the 1970 s oil shock  Plenty of progress has been made already  limiting the long term appeal of nuclear and carbon capture and sequestration technologies  The industry s stock market performance this year suggests that investors see the space as enjoying enough momentum to offset the less friendly posture from the Trump administration 
Stocks in the Alternative Energy industry have lagged the S P 500 index over the last many years  but the industry put up an impressive showing this year and handily outperformed the broader market  The Zacks Alternative Energy industry has lagged the S P 500 index over the last 2  5 and 10 year periods  but is currently up 30 6  year to date  outperforming the S P 500 index s 19 1  gain 
Driving this performance momentum appears to be the realization that growth in the industry is increasingly resulting from voluntary procurement by utilities and corporations due to declining costs of solar and wind technologies  and anticipation of a more carbon constrained future 
The U S  renewable energy industry has witnessed significant growth over the last several years  with a number of important decisions in 2015 by both state and federal governments really helping the space  This has helped operators successfully battle against energy generated from fossil fuels in power markets and for procuring contracts across the globe 
A U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   report projects total renewables used in the electric power sector to increase 41  in 2018  Electricity generation from hydropower is expected to be relatively unchanged at 7  between 2016 and 2018  Generation from renewables other than hydropower is expected to have risen by 9  in 2017 and 10  in 2018 
Notably  renewable energy significantly benefits the environment as well as the economy  In addition to lowering carbon emissions  alternative sources of energy improve public health  create jobs and provide other economic benefits  Moreover  these sources of energy reduce the requirement of water for power production  offering a major advantage over fossil fuels  Offsetting these positives are the additional costs that are incurred by traditional energy sources to fully account for their environmental externalities 
A comprehensive study by the Department of Energy s National Renewable Energy Laboratory  NREL  shows that renewables will contribute more than 80  of total electricity generation in the United States by 2050  compared with the present level of 30   The need of the hour is the development of an electricity grid to withstand higher volumes of renewable energy and advanced grid planning to maintain reliability 
To this end  governments  businesses and cities around the world are making concerted efforts to speed up the evolution of energy use  With global energy system transformation being the backbone of climate action  the world has come closer under a set of major cooperative initiatives  It is these environmental considerations that are driving demand for alternative energy sources 
While these favorable demand trends have been boosting the growth prospects of this space  the abundant availability of fossil fuels and dearth of adequate investment in solar companies have emerged as key competitive challenges  Although the industry s long term fundamentals remain favorable  the policies of the Trump administration  like signing an order to repeal the Clean Power Plan and its decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement  are expected to hit the clean energy space  Given these challenges  growth in 2017 is expected to slow down 
Here  we discuss some of the major alternative energy sources 
Solar
A major growth area in the renewable space is solar energy  An EIA report indicates growth in utility scale solar power capacity by almost 41  from 22 GW at the end of 2016  The projected increase will bring the amount of solar capacity to 27 GW at 2017 end and to 31 GW at 2018 end  In spite of the rapid uptake  solar will still constitute just 1  of total U S  utility scale generation in 2018  indicating immense scope for growth 
Solar growth has historically been concentrated in customer sited distributed generation installations  The EIA expects utility scale solar capacity to expand in states like California  Nevada  North Carolina  Texas and Georgia 
The solar industry in the United States is booming  The solar Investment Tax Credit   ITC   has gone a long way in providing the industry stability and expansion  In the last 10 years  solar has witnessed a compound annual growth rate of almost 60   with the cost of installation dropping by over 70  
Over the past few years  utility scale solar has represented almost two thirds of the market  and this trend will likely continue in the near term  given the huge pipeline of projects under construction 
In particular  2016 was a record year for the U S  solar industry  The photovoltaic  PV  market grew 97  from 2015 s individual installations of more than 370 000  Although all market segments grew in 2016  the utility sector recorded maximum growth  which more than doubled with installations totaling over 10 gigawatts  GW  
According to GTM Research  12 6 GW of new PV installations will come on line in 2017  reflecting a decline from the record breaking 2016 figure  After completing a record build out in 2016 and 2017  it is projected that new projects will be procured with completion targets in the next decade  By 2021  there will be over 100 GW of solar installed in the United States  with annual total approaching 18 GW in 2022 
GTM Research s latest  Global Solar Demand Monitor  report states that eight countries would surpass the 1 GW level of annual PV installations by the end of 2017  By the end of 2018  five more countries will achieve the milestone  China  United States  Japan and India are expected to remain market leaders while emerging markets such as Brazil  Egypt  Mexico  the Netherlands and Spain are expected to gain further traction  The report also forecasts European solar demand to increase 35  in 2018 
Solar in China  The country has established itself as the world s largest market for solar panels and will likely be home to a quarter of the planet s new energy capacity from solar panels in the years to come  China is constantly adding power generation sources  and solar is just one of them 
The National Energy Administration  NEA  said that the installed renewable power capacity  including wind  hydro  solar and nuclear  will contribute about 50  of total electricity generation by 2020  In 2016  China installed 34 2 GW of new solar power  up 126  from last year s installations  bringing the cumulative solar capacity to 77 42 GW  according to the NEA 
Under China s 13th Five Year Plan  FYP   the country has set a target of attaining 150GW to 200GW of solar PV capacity by 2020  It also intends to shift focus from grid scale expansion to quality and efficiency 
China s solar industry is expected to produce 25  more panels in 2017 compared with 2016  supported by domestic sales and demand from the U S  and emerging markets 
China had a total of 101 8 GW installed solar capacity by June 2017  after adding 24 4 GW in the first six months of 2017  the industry association said  It is anticipated to reach 110 GW in the near term  the target that Beijing had aimed to achieve by 2020 
Some of the leading Chinese solar stocks  such as JinkoSolar Holding Co   Ltd   JKS  and JA Solar Holdings  Inc   JASO   are likely to make the most of the favorable government stimulus 
Ontario  Canada based solar product manufacturer  Canadian Solar Inc   CSIQ  is also well positioned with its diversified manufacturing base and project portfolio in Canada  China  Japan and the United States 
Wind
An EIA report indicates that wind capacity additions will bring total wind capacity to 88 GW by the end of 2017 and to 96 GW by the end of 2018  This reflects an increase of 17  from the electricity generating capacity from wind of 82 GW at the end of 2016  It is expected that wind generation will account for 6  of total generation in 2018 
The American Wind Energy Association   AWEA   reported that 534 MW of wind capacity was installed during the third quarter of 2017  bringing the total year to date installed capacity to 2 892 MW  Wind capacity of 13 759 MW is currently under construction while another 15 875 MW is in advanced stages of development  The total capacity thus comes to 29 634 MW  reflecting 27  year over year growth  Project developers declared 638 MW in new construction activity and 4 248 MW in new advanced development activity during the third quarter  a combined 4 886 MW 
During the third quarter of 2017  four states commissioned a total of 243 turbines across five project phases  Texas led with 402 MW  followed by Indiana  100 MW   New Mexico  30 MW   and California  2 MW   Presently  there are 84 944 MW of installed wind capacity in the United States  with more than 52 000 wind turbines operating in 41 states plus Guam and Puerto Rico 
In the third quarter of 2017  Utilities announced new plans to develop and own 3 040 MW of wind capacity  Project developers announced 1 337 MW of power purchase agreements  PPA  were signed during the quarter  Six corporate customers signed PPAs during the third quarter  accounting for 62  of total project capacity contracted

118993,340508,FSLR,Alternative Energy Shines On Renewed Hopes  Investments,opinion,"Despite the uncertainty related to U S  tax policy or commitment to fight climate change  the momentum achieved by the renewable energy sector is unlikely to subside 
Contracts from small  to medium sized companies are expected to continue flowing in  even if large corporations choose to tread cautiously  The declining cost of energy storage should also continue to aid the penetration of renewable resources 
The underlying driver for each of these market trends is significant customer demand for renewables  It is expected that the renewable space will continue to innovate in 2018 to offer consumers clean  affordable renewable energy  This should help stocks in this space maintain their strong momentum in the New Year 
Stocks in the Zacks Alternative Energy industry  part of the Zacks Oil Energy sector  were up 28 4  in the last year compared with a rally of 23 4  for the Oil Energy sector and 17 8  gain for the S P 500 index  This shows that the Trump administration s less than enthusiastic support hasn t harmed the industry s prospects 
The major advantage of using renewable energy is that there will be no dearth of supply  Also  renewable energy facilities usually need less maintenance compared with traditional generators  The fact that the fuel is derived from natural and existing resources reduces the cost of operations  Apart from this  there are hardly any waste products generated by renewable energy such as carbon dioxide or other chemical pollutants  Therefore  its negative impact on the environment is minimal 
Solar and wind   two major alternative energy sources   are gradually transforming the way we produce and consume energy  driving the ongoing global energy transition  Although some better established sources of alternative energy   hydro  wind  biomass and waste  not to mention solar PV   are supported extensively  niche renewable energy sources such as geothermal and concentrated solar power   CSP   are also on the rise  natural conditions permitting 
Wind and solar are not only essential when it comes to reducing carbon emissions but also have a remarkable contribution in saving lives  This is because these renewable sources edge out fossil fuels and reduce air pollutants in addition to carbon emissions  This leads to improved air quality  with a corresponding drop in premature deaths 
According to recent reports  renewable energy has surpassed nuclear power as a percentage of U S  energy generation  Declining cost of solar generation is anticipated to be the driving factor behind a dramatic increase in renewable power 
Again  the extension of key renewable tax credits and reduced solar photovoltaic  PV  capital costs  are expected to drive growth of alternative energy 
Moreover  former President Obama s  Climate Change Action Plan   which is still valid  has propelled the sector northward  Efforts to restrict carbon emissions are a positive for renewable energy stocks  As per U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   in 2016  CO2 emissions declined 1 6   Energy related CO2 emissions are expected to decline 0 8  in 2017 
The plan urged utility providers to gradually shift their mode of power generation to solar  wind and water  Some of these utilities include DTE Energy Company  NYSE DTE   DTE  and NRG Energy Inc  NYSE NRG    NRG   While DTE Energy sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   NRG Eenrgy carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
The EIA observes that even if the Trump administration abolishes the Clean Power Plan  the renewable space will continue to grow in the United States albeit at a slower rate  EIA projects U S  renewable generation capacity to grow by an average of 1 9  per year between 2017 and 2050 
Apart from this  Francesco Starace  chief executive of Italy based Enel  MI ENEI   the largest European power company  said that investment in renewable energy across the globe  including the United States  will continue to grow regardless of the new U S  administration s full support  He added that Enel has plans to invest  5 2 billion in renewable generation  mainly wind and solar power  both in Europe and the United States over the next three years 
Realizing growth opportunities in the renewable energy space  companies from other domains have also expressed their interest to invest in solar stocks  In line with this  e commerce giant Amazon  AMZN  plans to bring online five new solar farms  totaling 180 megawatts  MW   to help power its massive cloud data centers  The new solar facilities  located in Virginia  will be connected to the grid by the end of 2017  Amazon also has other renewable projects underway  which will be completed by this year 
Here we take a look at the alternative energy space and attempt to identify this nascent industry s strengths 
Extension of ITC  Solar and wind energy got a major boost from the environmental tax credit extension that came as part of the  1 15 trillion federal spending bill in December 2105  which also lifted a 40 year ban on exporting American crude oil  The latest report from EIA also shows that renewable energy will be the fastest growing power source through 2040  accounting for 27  of total U S  generation 
On Dec 15  2015  Congress passed an extension and modification of federal tax credits for new wind and solar generators  The new environmental tax credit extension allows solar power companies to keep claiming federal Investment Tax Credits   ITC   at 30  of the price of solar energy systems installed by businesses or homeowners  The ITC  which was earlier set to expire at the end of 2016  rushed developers to finish projects  Now they look good through 2019 with the five year extension  However  the credit will start to decline  going down to 10  in 2022 
Moreover  the wind power industry benefited significantly from the production tax credit   PTC   extension  The PTC  which had expired in 2014 end due to Congressional gridlock  was extended through 2020  However  the PTC that pays 2 3 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity generated will be gradually reduced over the next four years before being completely phased out 
The EIA projects that utility scale solar capacity will increase almost 10 gigawatts  GW  between 2017 and 2018 in the United States  given considerable rise in renewables consumption for electricity and heat generation purpose  California  along with North Carolina  Nevada  Texas and Georgia  will account for most of the projected utility scale capacity additions over the period 
The EIA expects wind energy capacity additions of 14 GW in 2017 2018  With these additions  total wind capacity will reach 96 GW by the end of 2018 
Anti Dumping Duties and Solar Trade War  Washington imposed import duties on solar panels and other related products from China and Taiwan  The U S  believes that Chinese manufacturers have benefited from unfair subsidies offered by their government  U S  solar stocks like SunPower Corp   SPWR  and First Solar Inc  NASDAQ FSLR    FSLR  are expected to make the most of the trade conflict between the United States and China 
The U S  Department of Commerce   DOC    in Dec 2014  set anti dumping duties at about 52  on most module imports from China and at 19 5  on most imports of Taiwanese cells  It also slapped 39  anti subsidy tariffs on most China made panels  The move was intended to stop Chinese companies from using solar cells made in Taiwan to avoid paying higher tariffs 
Imposition of these anti dumping duties has benefited many U S  alternate energy companies like Vivint Solar  Inc   VSLR   Enphase Energy  Inc   ENPH  and First Solar  all carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
The Sun Is Everywhere  Solar power is generally located at a customer s site due to the universal availability of sunlight  As a result  solar power limits the expense and losses associated with transmission and distribution from large scale electric plants to end users  For most residential consumers seeking an environment friendly power alternative  solar power is currently the only viable choice  Residential solar is undeniably gaining on utility scale solar in the United States in a marked change in industry dynamics 
Among the renewable energy pack  rooftop solar energy systems provider SolarCity Corp  has an innovative game plan  This downstream solar company plays on its strength  providing renewable power lower than the grid price to residential and commercial markets in the United States  California based SolarCity s MyPower loan plan allows its customers to own their solar systems and still pay less for electricity when compared to leasing them through power purchase agreements 
China s Solar Plans  China continues to hold the leading position around the globe in solar power installations  Last year  Chinese overseas investment in renewable energy projects was a record  25 billion  The country s energy agency announced that it will invest  364 0 billion in renewable power generation by 2020 
The National Energy Administration  NEA  said that China has installed a total of 43 GW of solar capacity in the first nine months of 2017  up from 34 5 GW installed in 2016  CCB International Securities Ltd  raised its forecast for China s solar power capacity to 55 GW for 2018 from 40 GW 
The country leads the world in investments in clean energy  already reaching its 2020 goal of producing 110 GW of solar power  China has pledged to get at least 20  of its electricity from non fossil fuel sources by 2030 
NEA revealed that installed renewable power capacity reached 630 GW by the end of September 2017  with solar power at 120 GW 
Per the 13th Five Year Plan  FYP   China has set a target of attaining 150GW to 200GW of solar PV capacity by 2020  It also intends to shift focus from grid scale expansion to quality and efficiency  The FYP also plans to achieve non fossil fuel fired energy consumption of around 15  by 2020 and 20  by 2030 
China s solar industry is expected to produce 25  more panels in 2017 compared with last year  supported by domestic sales and demand from the United States and emerging markets  Again  in the long term  there is great potential for China s solar industry to develop  with the walk out of the United States from the Paris Accord 
India s Solar Initiatives  While China and the United States have led the industry in recent years  other nations are also developing their home grown solar generation capacity as a remedial measure for electricity crisis  The latest to join this list is Asia s third largest economy  India  which has a target of adding 175 GW of solar  wind and other renewable energy by 2022 
India is striving to enhance its solar energy capacity to 100 GW by 2022  which will include 60 GW from grid connected solar projects and 40 GW from rooftop solar  The pace of installation is projected to accelerate rapidly  It is expected that around 1 1 GW of rooftop solar capacity will be added in 2017  up 75  from 2016  This has kindled the interest of global solar players in the Indian market 
At the end of 2016  India boasted a pipeline of around 14 GW of utility scale projects  out of which 7 7 GW is expected to be commissioned this year  It is expected that the country will add a total of 9 4 GW in 2017  This new forecast is higher than the one provided earlier this year  In May  it was projected that India will add 8 8 GW in 2017  which will make it the world s third biggest solar market after China and the United States 
Per a latest report by Bridge to India  the country s PV rooftop installations totaled 1 861 MW as of the end of September  India added new rooftop solar capacity of 840 MW in the 12 months ending September 2017  at an annual growth rate of 82   The report estimates compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 77  for the next four years 
On Dec 4  the largest floating solar power plant in the country was announced in Kerala  The plant  with a capacity of 500 kilowatts   will be constructed using ferrocement technology and consist of 1938 solar panels with 260 watt capacity  a 500 KVA transformer and 17 inverters  The plant will generate seven lakh units per year  The total cost of the project is estimated to be INR 9 25 crore  This project will help in achieving the country s solar target 
Company wise  First Solar and SunEdison Inc  have ample businesses in India and  together with local firms  are investing considerably in the country  In 2016  First Solar connected a 130 MW utility scale solar power to the nation s grid  These plants are part of a 260 MW project portfolio wholly owned by First Solar in India 
China based JA Solar Holdings Co   Ltd  s  JASO  investment plans in India include a 500 MW solar module facility  which will be operational by this year  Another Chinese player  Trina Solar Ltd earlier announced its plan to build solar cells with a capacity of 700 MW and solar modules with a capacity of 500 MW  These are encouraging signs for the industry in India 
Solar in Japan  Japan has been a happy hunting ground for solar companies in search of new markets  The country is going to be a key energy market as the government has set a goal of generating 12  of power from solar PV by fiscal 2030  up from the present level of 4  
Japan witnessed a solar power boom in 2016  Electricity generation from solar PV alone grew to 4 3  last year  up from 2 7  in 2015  Overall  in 2016  renewable energy sources comprised 14 2  of total electricity generation  It has been projected that Japan will install 8 GW of solar PV in 2017 
The government has been trying to increase electricity generation from renewable sources  In fact  following the introduction of feed in tariffs  FIT  in July 2012  solar PV has scaled up fast in Japan  As a result  this nation has recently emerged as a profitable market for high quality solar solution providers 
Recently  Canadian Solar Inc   CSIQ  started constructing two Japanese solar power projects   Shizuoka Project with a capacity of 10 77 megawatt peaks  MWp  and Miyagi Project with a capacity of 2 1 MWp  In August 2017  Canadian Solar declared that its 27 3 MWp solar PV power plant in Tottori Prefecture  Japan  initiated commercial operations  Also  the company successfully activated four solar power plants in the country with a combined capacity of 52 5 MWp of green energy in July 
Summing Up
It is evident that demand for renewables is strengthening at a rapid clip  Moreover  the gradual expansion of the solar markets should bode well for all global players and instill confidence in the industry over the long term  The increased adoption was mainly due to the booming residential PV market and continued realization of the utility sector s double digit GW project pipeline

119020,340535,FSLR,JA Solar  JASO  Signs  362M Agreement  Set To Go Private,opinion,JA Solar Holdings  Co   Ltd    NASDAQ JASO   has signed a merger agreement with JASO Holdings Limited  Holdco   JASO Parent Limited  Parent    a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco   and JASO Acquisition Limited  Merger Sub   a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent Per the agreement  an investor consortium will purchase JA Solar in an all cash transaction  thereby translating into an equity value of approximately  362 1 million Details of the AgreementThe investor group stated that it will pay  1 51 per share in cash without interest to holders of ordinary shares of JA Solar  Holders of the American depositary shares  ADS   which are equivalent to five ordinary shares  will be paid  7 55 in cash without interest On November 17  JA Solar announced that the agreed consideration stands at a premium of 18 2  to the closing price of the company s ADSs on Jun 5  2017   the last trading day before the company revealed its receipt of a revised  going private  proposal  The consideration is also at a premium of 17 2  to the average closing price of JA Solar s ADSs during the three month period before its receipt of a revised  going private  proposal We note that the investor group is headed by JA Solar s chief executive   Baofang Jin   and Jinglong  a British Virgin Islands company of which Jin is the sole director  In addition  Chin Tien Huang  Chi Fung Wong and Pak Wai Wong are the other shareholders  who will roll over their shares in JA Solar in this latest transaction  Jointly  the group and the rollover stockholders hold 25 7  of the voting rights in JA Solar The group intends to fund the merger with a combination of debt and equity  In fact  it has already given an executed debt commitment letter to JA Solar  Per this letter  CSI Finance Limited  Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  AG  Singapore Branch and few other parties will provide a loan facility worth  160 million to fund the alliance  subject to the terms and conditions The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018  The closure will be based on customary closing conditions that comprise the approval of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of shareholders representing at least two thirds of the voting power of the shareholders present and voting Once the transaction is complete  JA Solar will become a privately owned company and its ADSs will no longer be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market Another Peer Had Gone PrivateIn March 2017  another Chinese photovoltaic modules maker  Trina Solar Ltd  officially became private after completing its merger with Red Viburnum Company Limited   a wholly owned subsidiary of Fortune Solar Holdings Limited  Per the agreement  signed on Aug 1  2016  Trina Solar ceased to be a publicly traded company and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Fortune Solar Our ViewChinese government has recently issued guidelines for boosting private investment in manufacturing including enhancement of financial support to private firms  In particular  the government is pushing private firms to invest in infrastructure projects that comprise solar energy products  This factor may have acted as a primary driving force behind JA Solar s decision of becoming a private firm Moreover  a publicly trading company has to bear huge regulatory as well as procedural cost to maintain all the timely filings of financial reports  Therefore  becoming a private firm means less regulatory and procedural costs  which might have been another reason why JA Solar intends to delist itself from the share market Price MovementShares of JA Solar have rallied 56 5  on a year to date basis  outperforming the broader  s gain of 51 1   This could be because the company stands to gain from its geographically advantageous position in spite of China s trade war with the United States  In fact  its focus on widening its geographical customer base has resulted in incremental international sales  Furthermore  JA Solar s performance is in line with other majors in the same space like First Solar Inc    NASDAQ FSLR    which also outperformed the broader industry Zacks Rank and Key PicksJA Solar holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Some other better ranked stocks in the space include SolarEdge Technologies  Inc    NASDAQ SEDG   and SunPower Corporation   NASDAQ SPWR

119022,340537,FSLR,Should Value Investors Consider First Solar  FSLR  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put First Solar  Inc    NASDAQ FSLR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  First Solar has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 8  If we focus on the long term PE trend  First Solar s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 154 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that First Solar has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of  24 5  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  First Solar has a P S ratio of about 2 1  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  First Solar currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes First Solar a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though First Solar might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A  This gives FSLR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen seven up and no down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen to a loss of 23 cents from earnings of 45 cents expected two months back  while the full year estimate has gone up by 21  over last two months  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below First Solar  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineFirst Solar is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 20  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential   In fact  over the past one year  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Hallador Energy sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t

119039,340554,FSLR,Best Performing ETF Areas Of October ,opinion,"The month of October was characterized by a slew of upbeat earnings  especially in the tech sector  Also  renewed Trump trade on hopes of the passage of tax reforms kept enthusiasm alive in Wall Street 
The S P 500 based ETF   AX SPY    Dow Jones Industrial Average based ETF   V DIA   and the Nasdaq 100 based ETF  added about 2 2   4 3  and 4 2   respectively  The U S  dollar ETF PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish ETF  NYSE UUP   gained about 1 6  in the last one month  as of Oct 30  2017  
Against this backdrop  it is important to pin point ETF areas that beat an already charged up market  Let s have a look at it 
Metals
It seems that industrial metals are back with a bang  An uptick in global growth and a relatively moderately stronger greenback have added to the metal s strength  Be it developed economies or the developing ones  all are exhibiting harmonized growth  as   DoubleLine Capital s deputy CIO  He believes that we haven t witnessed  this coordinated growth since  04   05  and  06  
Industrial metals  which have long been in stagnation  are now getting the love of hedge funds too  Reduction in output has finally adjusted excess supplies  leading to higher prices for industrial metals  As a result  a few metal based exchange traded products like iPath Bloomberg Lead SubTR ETN   iPath Pure Beta Industrial Metals ETN  and iPath Bloomberg Nickel SubTR ETN  gained about 17 7   16  and 12 7   respectively in the last one month  as of Oct 30  2017   read    
Solar
Solar stocks have been on a tear lately  One of the prime reasons for this is upbeat third quarter earnings of the U S  solar panel manufacturer First Solar   NASDAQ FSLR    The company beat our estimates for earnings and revenues and raised its earnings outlook for the year  Probably  this acted as a cornerstone for the entire space and gave a boost to Guggenheim Solar ETF   LON TAN    up 11 45  in the last one month  as of Oct 31  2017   In any case  the operating backdrop of the sector is pretty upbeat  read    
India
India ETFs are experiencing high momentum on economic optimism  Decent GDP data defying demonetization  the victory of the pro growth prime minister s party in some state elections  implementation of goods and services tax or GST from July  and still solid inflows from retail investors are driving Indian stocks   
Plus a  indicated that India s fiscal second quarter growth may offer some positive surprise  could be over 7    following three year low growth registered in the first quarter of fiscal 2018  Factors including manufacturing indices  passenger and freight traffic and corporate earnings during the quarter should contribute to stronger growth 
All these factors and hopes boosted India ETFs like Columbia India Infrastructure ETF   up 10 4    VanEck Vectors India Small Cap ETF   up 9 8   and iShares MSCI India Small Cap ETF   LON SMIN    up 7 3   in the last one month  Oct 30  2017   read    
Semiconductor
Semiconductor stocks had every reason to put up a great show in October  Rise in cloud computing  surge of bitcoins and upbeat forecast for electronics sales in the holiday season   all call for greater demand for semiconductors 
So  notable performance by semiconductor ETFs like PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors ETF   TO PSI    up 8 1    First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF   up 8 9  in the last one month  as of Oct 30  and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF   up 7 8   is understandable  read

119050,340565,FSLR,First Solar FSLR Recovery In Progress,opinion,"First Solar  NASDAQ  NASDAQ FSLR  designs and manufactures solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology  The company has developed  financed  engineered  constructed and currently operates many of the world s largest grid connected PV power plants 
First Solar relies almost entirely on utility scale projects which accounts for over half of the U S  solar market and can be affected by the potential solar import tariffs by the Trump administration  However  preparation were already made to avoid such a step back and the company booked 4 5 GW of panel and system sales in the previous quarter  more than it makes in a year 
After last month s better than expected earnings report and the fact that utilities and project developers are booking tariff free panels to lock up supply in 2018 helped First Solar shares to jump over 20  and the technical picture for its stock is looking for more gains in the coming months 
FSLR Monthly Chart
First Solar saw an impressive 1100  rally in the first 19 months after its IPO   20  before it started declining from 2008 peak   317  like the rest of the stock market around that period  The 3 swings decline lasted 4 years and erased all the gains saw previously until the stock found a bottom in May 2012 at  11 43  Up from there  FSLR bounced higher either to start new bullish cycle to the upside or at least to correct the decline toward the 50    61 8  Fibonnacie retracement area  164    200 
FSLR Elliot Wave Weekly Chart
Up from May 2012 low  FSLR rallied in a corrective 7 swing sequence which indicates the stock is still in a correction stage then it did another double three to the downside which ended on April of this year  Afterward  the stock started another rally which still needs to break above 2014 peak to target equal legs area  88    103 as a first step of a larger move 
In the short term  FSLR is looking to reach  69 1   72 5 area where a 3 waves pullback can take place before it can resume the move higher  consequently the stock should remain supported while holding above 45 26 low 
RecapFirst Solar booked most of its production for the next two years  which gives it a tremendous amount of certainty and could present a good investment  Technically the stock is still recovering from the fall since 2008 peak but will it be a fast recovery or a slow sideways bounce  Only time will tell but the overall picture remain in favor of the Solor Energy sector and companies like First Solar or  are have more potential in the future ",2017-11-13,Elliott Wave Forecast,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-solar-fslr-recovery-in-progress-200264436,200264436

119110,340625,FSLR,The Stock Market Is Finally Overbought Again ,opinion,"AT40   70 1  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs    first overbought dayAT200   58 7  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   9 5Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish  one more higher close away from bullish 
Commentary It took 8 months for the stock market to hit overbought again  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their 40 day moving averages  DMAs   closed at 70 1    a hair above the overbought threshold of 70   After one more higher close I will switch the short term trading call to bullish 
The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   is up an incredible 9 2  since the last overbought period ended  it lasted just one day on January 25  2017   This performance is a large outlier  Not only has AT40 rarely spent anything close to 160 trading days under 70   but also only TWO other 70  underperiods have performed as well as this last one did  The chart below shows a projected performance under 5  for a 70  underperiod surviving as long as the the last one 

The last AT40 70  underperiod was an outlier both by duration and performance 
Separately  AT40 has now gone 401 days without trading below the oversold threshold of 20   This duration ties for third longest trading period without an oversold period  The last oversold period ended on February 12  2016 in what I dubbed at the time the     The S P 500 has gained 32  since then  Projected performance suggests that the end of this 20  overperiod might cut this gain almost in half with a heavy caveat given the sparseness of data that comes with such an outlier occurrence 

S P 500 historical performance during the T2108 20  overperiod 
Appropriately  the S P 500  SPY  marked this overdue overbought occasion with a new all time high 

The S P 500  SPY  looks poised to next tag the top its upper Bollinger Band  BB  channel 
The NASDAQ closed flatline and just short of a fresh all time high  The PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ  is still struggling to hold onto its 50DMA support  Assuming AT40 confirms a new bullish phase for the market  I will likely load up on QQQ call options  My swing at individual members of the big cap high tech stocks this week had very mixed results 
The volatility index  the VIX  hit 9 6  within a small fraction of a point of the 24 year closing low set in July and the all time  tracked  closing low of 9 31 on December 22  1993  My last tranche of call options on the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  will expire worthless  and I will reload for hedging against the potential for October to deliver fresh surprises 
STOCK CHART REVIEWS
First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  It looks like I locked in profits on my FSLR call options just in time  FSLR began the week by immediately reversing Friday s breakout and in turn broke 50DMA support  I will not take another swing until unless the company can close above its 50DMA again 

First Solar  FSLR  is pivoting around its 50DMA but flirting with a confirmed breakdown 
Hanging in the balance is the fate and impact of solar panel tariffs 
IHS Markit  NASDAQ INFO 
On Tuesday  INFO gave what seemed to me a reassuring reaffirmation of guidance  The market disagreed  INFO gapped down below its 50DMA support and kept selling off  Like the dip in July  this selling reversed my gains  I will next look for 200DMA support to hold 

Markit  INFO  took a major post earnings blow that likely signals it will top out for a while 
Model N  NYSE MODN   MODN  almost four years ago  I flagged  as a bet on a comeback story  The stock never took off but did deliver a small profit on a rally to the top of what became a very extended trading range  Now  MODN is FINALLY breaking out  and it has my attention again  At  15  MODN sits at a 4 year high  The next earnings report comes around November 6th so there could be a long runway here if the general market remains bullish

119138,340653,FSLR,3 Solar Stocks For The Future,opinion,"Whenever the talk is about electricity and energy efficiency  solar power usually comes up as a viable alternative to fossil fuels  But solar energy has been slow to adopt by many due to its high price and lack of understanding  The United States government has tried to step in with rebates and tax credits to help jumpstart the solar industry to no avail  Regardless of this  there are solar stocks worth investing your money in 
You might be wondering why this is so  given the information I just presented  The reason is that we are on the cusp of a shift in the industry  Thanks to rapid technological advances  solar energy is quickly becoming cheaper and more efficient  It is just a matter of time until more and more people jump on the wagon and start taking advantage of solar energy 
With a handful of solar stocks out there  I narrowed the list down to 3 that I feel have a solid future and can make you some money both in the short and long term  Just understand that since this market is still developing  there will be a large degree of volatility  But with estimates that the solar industry could be worth trillions of dollars  the sky is the limit for these solar stocks 
3 Solar Stocks With A Bright Future

 1  SunPower Corporation  NASDAQ SPWR 

SunPower is the most efficient maker of solar panels out there  Their problem  The cost of their panels are higher than the competition  and with more and more lower priced panels coming from China  the price gap is only widening 
The solution then for SunPower is to reduce costs  And that is exactly what they are working on  They invested heavily in new technology with the goal of driving down production costs  As a result of this investment  earnings took a hit in 2016 
The dust still hasn t settled on this yet with recent earnings per share coming in at a loss of  0 35  However they did beat estimates by  0 09  Revenues came in at  341 million  down 15  from the previous year  But again  they beat guidance by  29 million 
As the dust completely settles  SunPower should be set up nicely for the future  Add in the fact that they can be a complete solar solution for utility companies as well and now might be a perfect time to buy shares of this company 

 2  First Solar Inc   NASDAQ FSLR 

The next of the solar stocks is First Solar  They have been in business for over 25 years  which came as news to me  I didn t realize that solar energy was a thing back then  And think of the costs 
But First Solar is a turnkey solar solution for utilities  They provide complete solutions including installation and maintenance of their panels 
Just like with SunPower  First Solar is in the process of upgrading its manufacturing process  This is very costly with the new technology that is out there  but it should quickly pay off in the years to come 
In fact  First Solar raised full year guidance for 2017  In their most recent earnings release  earnings per share came in at  0 64  beating by  0 60  Revenues were down 38  at  623 million  However this beat estimates by  67 million 
Once First Solar is able to complete its upgrades  you should see earnings per share and revenues spike  and along with them the stock price 

 3  JinkoSolar Holding Company  NYSE JKS 

I mentioned that one issue SunPower is facing is lower priced solar panels from China  Well  JinkoSolar is one of those Chinese solar panel companies  They have a ton of capacity to build panels  but build too many and inventory problems can arise  Luckily this hasn t been the case with JinkoSolar 
Of course  when you offer the lowest price product  you sacrifice on something  and with solar panels this sacrifice is efficiency  But not everyone is willing to pay a high price for the most efficient panel  Some people just want to take advantage of solar energy  As a result  this solar stock has a bright future 
When it comes to earnings  earnings per share was a miss in the recent quarter   0 28 which missed by  0 41  But revenues jumped 31  to  1 17 billion  beating estimates by  172 million 
Final Thoughts
So there are 3 solar stocks to consider investing in  As I noted above  the industry is still in its infancy compared to where it can go  As a result  there will be turbulence on any given day as these companies drastically miss or beat earnings and others consolidate into one 
If you are able to withstand the white knuckle ride  these solar stocks should return you a nice profit over the long term

On Friday  the U S  ITC issued a preliminary ruling regarding cheaply sold  foreign manufactured solar panels and cells  The initial decision  which was determined by a 4 0 vote  stated that less expensive imported solar panels have hurt American solar firms and manufacturers 
The commission   that increased imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells  whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products  are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article  
ITC s ruling came in response to a case brought by two now bankrupt solar equipment manufacturers  Suniva and SolarWorld  The firms argued that an increased amount of cheap solar imports harmed the industry and put U S  solar companies at risk 
The commission is set to hold a public hearing to expand on its findings on Oct  3  Following the hearing  the ITC will recommend a course of action to President Donald Trump by Nov  13 
Since the initial ITC ruling  there has already been a great deal of backlash to any potential tariffs or limitations and restrictions to free trade for solar energy companies  The Solar Energy Industries Association has been one of the most vocal opponents so far  The association stated that they think tariffs will raise overall costs for solar panels and hurt the industry as a whole Today s ITC ruling moves this trade case to a remedy stage  where we must continue to fight for a common sense resolution    Solar Industry   SEIA  As the trade case enters a remedy stage  we urge our partners to stay active and engaged as we keep working to    Solar Industry   SEIA  Manufacturers  conservative groups  military  bipartisan coalition of lawmakers ALL agree the case is a bad deal for America    Solar Industry   SEIA  This administration must consider the 88 000 Americans   their families who will be devastated by significant solar tariffs    Solar Industry   SEIA  Solar Stocks 
Although an official ruling is likely weeks away  it seems that many investors are worried that solar tariffs and trade restrictions could indeed be imposed and that these restrictions would  in fact  harm solar companies  In turn  shares of some of the biggest solar energy manufacturers  including many U S  firms  sunk on Monday 
After experiencing a strong run since the spring  shares of First Solar tanked 8 81   while SunPower Corporation   NASDAQ SPWR   stock fell by 6 94   Shares of Vivint Solar  Inc    NYSE VSLR   plummeted 14 29  
JA Solar   NASDAQ JASO   saw its stock price dip by over 4 50   while shares of solar and renewable energy sector ETFs  the Guggenheim Solar ETF   LON TAN   and the VanEck Vectors Solar Energy ETF  NYSE XLE    dropped by 4 28  and 2 30   respectively

119182,340697,FSLR,Alternative Energy Stock Outlook   August 2017,opinion,"The global growth of renewable energy is increasingly driven by voluntary procurement by utilities and corporations due to declining costs of solar and wind technologies  and anticipation of a more carbon constrained future 
The U S  renewable energy industry has witnessed significant growth over the last several years  The implementation of a number of important decisions in 2015 by both state and federal governments further fueled its growth and continues to drive the sector  Throughout 2016  companies in the renewable energy space successfully battled against energy generated from fossil fuels in power markets and for procuring contracts across the U S  and across the globe 
A U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   report projects total renewables used in the electric power sector to increase 44  in 2018  Electricity generation from hydropower is expected to be relatively unchanged at 7  between 2016 and 2018  Generation from renewables other than hydropower is forecast to rise 9  in 2017 and 10  in 2018 
Notably  renewable energy significantly benefits the environment as well as the economy  In addition to lowering carbon emissions  alternative sources of energy improve public health  create jobs and provide other economic benefits  Moreover  these sources of energy reduce the requirement of water for power production  offering a major advantage over fossil fuels  Offsetting these positives are the additional costs that are incurred by traditional energy sources to fully account for their environmental externalities 
A comprehensive study by the Department of Energy s National Renewable Energy Laboratory  NREL  shows that renewables will contribute more than 80  of total electricity generation in the U S  by 2050  compared with the present level of 30   The need of the hour is the development of an electricity grid to withstand higher volumes of renewable energy and advanced grid planning to maintain reliability 
To this end  governments  businesses and cities around the world are making concerted efforts to speed up the evolution of energy use  With global energy system transformation being the backbone of climate action  the world has come closer under a set of major cooperative initiatives  It is these environmental considerations that are driving demand for alternative energy sources 
While these favorable demand trends have been boosting the growth prospects of this space  the abundant availability of fossil fuels and dearth of adequate investment in solar companies have emerged as key competitive challenges  Although the industry s long term fundamentals remain favorable  the policies of the Trump administration  like signing an order to repeal the Clean Power Plan and its decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement are expected to hit the clean energy space  Given these challenges  growth in 2017 is expected to slow down 
Here  we discuss some of the major alternative energy sources 
Solar
A major growth area in the renewable space is solar energy  An EIA report indicates continued growth in utility scale solar power capacity by almost 44  from 22 GW at the end of 2016  The projected increase will bring the amount of solar capacity to 29 GW at 2017 end and to 32 GW at 2018 end  In spite of the rapid uptake  solar will still constitute just 1  of total U S  utility scale generation in 2018  indicating immense scope for growth 
Solar growth has historically been concentrated in customer sited distributed generation installations  The EIA expects utility scale solar capacity to expand in states like California  Nevada  North Carolina  Texas and Georgia 
The solar industry in the U S  is booming  The solar Investment Tax Credit   ITC   has gone a long way in providing the industry stability and expansion  In the last 10 years  solar has witnessed a compound annual growth rate of almost 60   with the cost of installation dropping by over 70  
Over the past few years  utility scale solar has represented almost two thirds of the market  and this trend will likely continue in the near term  given the huge pipeline of projects under construction 
In particular  year 2016 was a record one for the U S  solar industry  The photovoltaic  PV  market grew 97  from 2015 s individual installations of more than 370 000  Although all market segments grew in 2016  the utility sector recorded maximum growth  which more than doubled with installations totaling over 10 gigawatts  GW  
According to GTM Research  12 6 GW of new PV installations will come on line in 2017  reflecting a decline from the record breaking 2016 figure  After completing a record build out in 2016 and 2017  it is projected that new projects will be procured with completion targets in the next decade  By 2021  there will be over 100 GW of solar installed in the U S   with annual total approaching 18 GW in 2022  
Solar in China  The country has established itself as the world s largest market for solar panels and will likely be home to a quarter of the planet s new energy capacity from solar panels in the years to come  China is speedily adding as much power generation sources as possible  and solar is just one of them 
The National Energy Administration  NEA  said that installed renewable power capacity  including wind  hydro  solar and nuclear  will contribute about 50  of total electricity generation by 2020  In 2016  China installed 34 2 GW of new solar power  up 126  from last year s installations  bringing the cumulative solar capacity to 77 42 GW  according to the NEA 
Under China s 13th Five Year Plan  FYP   the country has set a target of attaining 150GW to 200GW of solar PV capacity by 2020  It also intends to shift focus from grid scale expansion to quality and efficiency 
China s solar industry is expected to produce 25  more panels in 2017 compared with 2016  supported by domestic sales and demand from the U S  and emerging markets 
China had a total of 101 8 GW installed solar capacity by Jun 2017  after adding 24 4 GW in the first six months of 2017  the industry association said  It is anticipated to reach 110 GW in the near term  the target that Beijing had aimed to achieve by 2020 
The following leading Chinese solar stocks are sure to make the most of the favorable government stimulus  JinkoSolar Holding Co   Ltd   JKS   JA Solar Holdings  Inc   JASO  and Trina Solar Ltd 
Ontario  Canada based solar product manufacturer  Canadian Solar Inc   CSIQ  is also well positioned with its diversified manufacturing base and project portfolio in Canada  China  Japan and the U S 
Wind
The American Wind Energy Association   AWEA   reported that the country s wind industry has installed 357 MW during the second quarter of 2017  bringing the total year to date installed capacity to 2 357 MW  Wind capacity of 14 004 MW is currently under construction and 11 815 MW is in advanced stages of development  This adds to a total capacity of 25 819 MW  reflecting 41  year over year growth  Project developers declared 2 495 MW in new construction activity and 1 346 MW in new advanced development activity during the second quarter  a combined 3 841 MW 
During the second quarter of 2017  four states commissioned a total of 143 turbines across six projects  Kansas led with 178 MW  followed by North Dakota  150 MW   Iowa  22 MW   and Nebraska  7 MW   Presently  there are 84 405 MW of installed wind capacity in the U S   with over 52 000 wind turbines operating in 41 states plus Guam and Puerto Rico 
In the second quarter of 2017  1 697 MW of power purchase agreements  PPA  were signed  contributing to a total of 3 443 MW of PPAs signed during 2017  Electric utilities released six requests for proposals  RFPs  for up to 1 450 MW of wind eligible capacity  including the state of Massachusetts  request for a minimum of 400 MW  up to 800 MW  of offshore wind capacity 
Per EIA  wind capacity at the end of 2016 was 81 GW  This is expected to increase to 88 GW by 2017 and to 102 GW by 2018  It is expected that wind generation will account for 6  of total generation in 2018

119183,340698,FSLR,Modi Promotes Solar Alliance At BRICS  3 Stocks In Focus,opinion,"In a bid to strengthen the solar energy agenda  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged leaders of the participating nations to join the International Solar Alliance  ISA  at the ongoing 9th BRICS summit in China 
Notably  following the summit  the first ever bilateral meeting between Modi and the Chinese President Xi Jingping took place  Both parties described the meet as a forward looking and constructive one  Considering the  fruitful  discussions the two leaders had during their one hour meet  many anticipates the solar industry to benefit as a whole  with anticipation of stronger solar energy related ties to develop between the two Asian giants 
A Brief Note on the ISA
The International Solar Alliance  ISA  is a green energy initiative launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015 by the President of France and the Prime Minister of India  The venture was formed to bring together sun rich countries lying fully or partially between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn  to exploit their solar potential 
Financially  the body aims to invest  1 trillion in solar energy by 2030  through joint efforts from the participating nations 
The 121 nation body is expected to become a formally ratified organization this December  With nine countries having signed the ISA Framework Agreement  six more are expected to join by December  which will make the alliance legal and operational 
Solar Industry in China   India
With renewable energy playing a key role in the world s ongoing energy transformation process  wind and solar power have emerged as the most viable renewable sources of generating power  For tropical countries like China and India  tapping sunlight and generating power is thus a prudent move  While other three nations of BRICS   Brazil  Russia and South Africa   are undertaking initiatives to expand their solar power resource  China and India are definitely the forerunners in expanding their base in the solar industry 
To this end  China has established itself as the world s largest market for solar panels  In 2016  China installed 34 2 GW of new solar power  up 126  from last year s installations  bringing the cumulative solar capacity to 77 42 GW  according to the National Energy Administration  NEA   Under China s 13th Five Year Plan  FYP   the country has set a target of attaining 150GW to 200GW of solar PV capacity by 2020 
On the other hand  India is striving to enhance its solar energy capacity to 100 GW by 2022  which will include 60 GW from grid connected solar projects and 40 GW from rooftop solar  It is expected that around 1 1 GW of rooftop solar capacity will be added in 2017  up 75  from 2016 
This has kindled the interest of global solar players in the Indian market  U S  based First Solar  Inc    NASDAQ FSLR   and SunEdison Inc  have ample businesses in India and together with local firms  are investing considerably in the country  Chinese stocks like ReneSola Ltd    NYSE SOL   are also financing solar projects in India  With respect to China  U S  stocks that have notable business operations in the Chinese province are already expanding their base 
Solar Stocks Poised for Growth Post BRICS Summit
With the U S  President Trump walking out of the Paris Agreement this June and his repeated efforts to repeal the Clean Power Energy Act  investors  focus has already shifted toward Chinese solar stocks 
If the bilateral talk between Modi and Jingping post the BRICS summit results in any solar joint venture between the two nations  U S  stocks that have significant operational base in China and India along with the Chinese stocks trading in the United States will witness notable growth  In fact  buoyed by such anticipation  a few solar stocks have already started to scale up the charts  Herein  we have zeroed in three such solar stocks 
JA Solar Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ JASO    Based in China  JA Solar manufactures high performance solar cells  The company serves customers in China  Europe and the United States  It plans to make an investment in solar module facility with a capacity of 500 megawatts in India  which will be operational by the end of this year  The company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 716 67  in the past four quarters

	On July 5  Group 1 announced it would acquire the Beadles Group  which has 7 brands  including Jaguar  Land Rover  Volkswagen  DE VOWG p   Skoda  Toyota  Vauxhall and Kia  across 12 dealerships in the southeastern part of greater London 
	They are expected to generate  330 million in annual revenues 
	With this acquisition  Group 1 will have 43 UK dealerships 
	The Beadles Group has been in business since 1893 so Group 1 is getting an established brand with a reputation for customer service 
	With its 43 dealerships  Group 1 expects to be generating over  2 billion in revenue from the UK Estimates Being Cut
	Even with this latest acquisition  the analysts are still bearish 
	In the United States  auto sales are on the decline for the first time in 8 years as it appears  peak auto  is a real thing 
	Group 1 is expected to announce its second quarter results next week  on July 27 
	But one analyst isn t even waiting for that  1 estimate for the full year has been cut in the last 7 days which has pushed the 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate to  7 26 from  7 78 in the last 90 days 
	That s an earnings decline of 2 1  as Group 1 made  7 42 last year 
	Analysts are loathe to cut estimates just ahead of an earnings report because they don t want to get it wrong  They usually only do it if they have some conviction that they are too optimistic about the quarter Shares in Bear Territory
	Shares of Group 1 have plunged about 20  year to date which puts them in bear market territory

Solar Stocks Climbing as Global Investments Soar

	Shares of First Solar  NASDAQ       are up on Wednesday after a strong analyst upgrade and a string of other positive solar related news that has emerged over the past week 

	Axiom Capital analyst Gordon Johnson     upgraded First Solar from a  Hold  to a  Buy  and upped its price target to  51 per share on Wednesday   Given that we believe First Solar is selling modules at   50 to   60  and we are hearing rumblings that they are sold out through the third quarter of 2018   Johnson told   

	 We believe the company is going to show potentially significant upside to consensus estimates  which have not changed dramatically  

	On the back of this upgrade  First Solar jumped 3 5  in morning trading  The solar energy company hasn t quite reached its 52 week high  but it is now rests at its highest point so far this year  First Solar is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy 

	The company  which builds large scale photovoltaic  PV  power stations  is set to report earnings on August 2 

Bright Future 

	Elsewhere in the solar industry  China invested heavily in solar energy last year and is set to continue this trend going forward  The country installed   and China reportedly added 18 GW of additional solar energy in the second quarter of this year alone 

	On that note  Jinko Solar  NYSE        is one of the biggest solar energy movers so far today  up 9 13  

	Negative estimate revisions have sent the stock down to a Zack Rank  5  Strong Sell   but fresh activity in China could spur new momentum  with shares of Jinko Solar skyrocketing this month 

	All of this solar investment has helped China become the biggest renewable energy investor on the planet  According to a recent    which focused on a massive former Chinese coal mine that is now a lake with 166 000 floating solar panels  the Chinese government has set its sights on spending  360 billion on clean energy by 2020  The push will reportedly help create 13 million new jobs 

	Other Asian powerhouses are getting in on the action too  For example   it is set to debut its first ever solar powered train  which will reportedly save roughly 21 000 liters of diesel fuel every year 

	However  what might prove to be better news for investors in the States is that the U S  has also invested heavily in this sector 

	In the U S   14 6 gigawatts worth of new solar energy projects were installed last year  which proved to be a record setting year   and a massive jump from the 7 5 GW installed in 2015 

	Today  in Miami  Florida it was announced that in South Miami new homes will soon be required to be built with solar panels   the first such mandate in the state  The ordinance will also affect select home renovations as well 

	 Solar reduces the cost of home ownership  it makes houses sell faster  it returns more to a builder  it makes local jobs  and most importantly  it reduces carbon emissions today to help our children and grandchildren have a better future tomorrow   South Miami Mayor Philip Stoddard    

	Canadian Solar  NASDAQ         that four solar power plants in Japan are now using its high efficient MaxPower modules to power the plants  Shares of the company jumped 6 27  on Wednesday after the news broke

Amicus Therapeutics Inc   NASDAQ FOLD  rocketed up 90 cents  or nearly 7   to close at  13 81 on unusually heavy volume of 7 8 million shares traded Tuesday  The move came with news that the company will close the stock offering it opened last week  having successfully raised  258 million to fund future growth  The stock has soared  3 55  or 34   since the FDA s July 11 announcement that it would accept an accelerated approval application for the company s drug migalastat  which would potentially subtract at least three years off the drug s time to market  Thus far  price has held the significant gap created by that jump up  Short interest of 11 4 times its average volume could fuel the move as shorts cover on a rally  Next targets   15 and  18 
First Solar Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  had a great day on Tuesday  jumping  1 30  or 3   to  44 02  on 2 8 million shares traded  Price began its current wave up by breaking out of a bull flag consolidation on July 6 on news of an analyst upgrade announcement from Trefis Research  Adding further fuel to the fire was a July 13 announcement that the company had sold two solar energy projects in Nevada to EDF  Renewable Energy  The stock has gained  13 70  or 45   since May 2  There may well be an extension quickly to take the stock up to the  47  48 zone 
Kemet Corporation  NYSE KEM  reached its highest price in six years  moving up 34 cents  or 2   to close at  16 70 on Tuesday  Nearly 1 1 million shares were traded  The stock appreciated about 90  in the first half of this year and began its present dramatic wave up earlier this month on news of a key product extension by the electronics manufacturer  At the  20 level  price will likely encounter resistance but may eventually reach into the mid  20s 
Nutanix Inc   NASDAQ NTNX  gained 82 cents and closed at  23 57 on 7 7 million shares traded  Price exploded out of a bull wedge consolidation on July 14 after an analyst upgrade statement from Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  that noted the provider of enterprise cloud platform solutions is a  once in a decade tech infrastructure story   The stock  with an initial target of  25  could get to  27  27 50 next  and then perhaps pullback to consolidate in the  22 zone before making a run toward  30 ",2017-07-19,Harry Boxer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-momentum-stocks-to-watch-200202136,200202136
119289,340804,FSLR,Trump Exits Paris Climate Deal  ETFs To Gain   Lose,opinion,Keeping his campaign promise  the American President has taken efforts to revive the downtrodden coal industry  Donald Trump has pulled the country out of the landmark Paris climate change agreement  which was expected to bring an end to the fossil fuel era The agreement was signed by 195 countries in December 2015 to curb global warming to a maximum limit of two degrees Celsius with a goal of lowering it further to about 1 5 degrees as soon as possible  read    Trump cited that the deal would hurt the economy  cost jobs  weaken the American national sovereignty  and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world  Additionally  the accord has blocked the development of clean coal in America while China  India and Europe are allowed to increase their coal production  This led coal jobs to move out of the U S  to foreign countries  putting them at a financial advantage over the U S As per National Economic Research Associates  the Paris treaty would have led to the loss of as many as 2 7 million American jobs by 2025 and is destructive to a number of vital industries by 2040  Notably  the deal would cut production by 12  in paper  23  in cement  38  in iron and steel  86  in coal and 31  in natural gas  This would cost the economy a reduced GDP of  3 trillion and 6 5 million industrial job losses by 2040 while cutting household income by at least  7 000 However  Trump calls for negotiation either to re enter the Paris accord or to have a new agreement  on terms that are fair to the United States  its businesses  its workers  its people  its taxpayers  Trump s withdrawal from Paris Climate Change will hurt solar and renewable energy stocks while boost the

119321,340836,FSLR,Sunny Days Ahead For Solar Power,opinion,"Quick  Name the first country that comes to mind when you think of solar power 
I m willing to bet that more than a few thought of a European country such as Germany or the U K   both of which set up ambitious goals and subsidies for renewable energy years ago  Or maybe  if you re more up to date on your solar knowledge  China sprang to mind  After all  with more than 77 gigawatts of installed capacity  China is currently the world leader in solar energy production 
I m also willing to bet that not that many of you thought of the U S  as a major player in the solar power market  It s understandable  The oil industry has long had a stranglehold on U S  government subsidies  raking in  4 7 billion in subsidies in 2015  according to a report from the Department of the Treasury 
What s more  President Donald Trump s energy policy heavily favors fossil fuels such as crude oil  natural gas and coal and eschews renewable sources like solar energy 
But despite a lack of significant government backing  the American solar power market isn t dying  In fact  it s thriving and it s doing so in the most unlikely of places 
House Of The Rising Sun
Power generated by new solar panel installations surged 50  in 2016  reaching 76 gigawatts compared to the growth of 50 gigawatts in 2015  And the U S  helped to lead that charge  with new solar power growth arriving second only to China  But with solar power still accounting for less than 5  of American energy output  the U S  has a long way to go to catch up to the likes of Germany  the U K  and even China 
But in the heartland of America   a place where oil still provides the lifeblood of many farms and businesses   solar power usage is dawning brightly  According to the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association  NRECA   its members are slated to add roughly 480 megawatts of solar power capacity this year  bringing the total to 873 megawatts  With just 180 megawatts only two years ago and 37 megawatts back in 2010  that s some impressive growth 
 Source  NRECA 
Solar Power
More important than the actual growth of solar power is where this growth is taking place  For instance  Wichita  Kansas recently opened its first utility scale solar energy farm   second largest in the state   with a ceremony presided over by Gov  Sam Brownback 
 You have to plan for 30 years down the line   Brownback said   And in our view the need for carbon reductions will not go away  so we see this as a key part of our portfolio long term   He also noted that he expects 50  of Kansas  energy to come from renewable sources by the end of his term in 2019 
Then there s the 220 acre solar farm planned for mid New York  near the town of Dryden  which would be capable of producing 29 megawatts and providing a solar option for New York State Electric   Gas customers  And there is growing enthusiasm surrounding such rural projects  It would  create local and national jobs  and would be an energy source that is low on the maintenance end   according to Ray Burger  Dryden s director of planning 
Blister In The Sun
Unfortunately for some areas of the U S   the extra sun and lack of rainfall have created a different kind of solar power opportunity  The U S  Southwest was once a bastion of hydroelectric power  championed by the Hoover Dam  And yet  many counties in the area aren t receiving the same power output from the dam as they once did due to a historic drought in the region that lowered the level of Lake Mead and raised the power costs for the region 
The result is that regional utility companies have been forced to look increasingly toward solar and other renewable electricity generation to supplement hydroelectric power  One such company  Lincoln County Power District  is currently working on a solar project to supply 4  of its energy capacity  and if the situation in the Southwest worsens  you can expect more utility companies in the area to follow suit 
Here Comes The Sun
The takeaway here is that there is a multitude of opportunities for investment in the solar sector  And while growth may slow a bit under the current president s administration  it s not going to die out entirely  Even rural energy managers are beginning to see that long term planning via renewable energy offers quite a favorable comparison to traditional fossil fuels 
If you re looking for opportunities  First Solar Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  and SunPower Corp   NASDAQ SPWR  are two top performing American solar companies that stand to gain from continued growth in U S  solar capacity  For a more balanced take on the sector  the Guggenheim Solar ETF  NYSE TAN  offers broader exposure

119323,340838,FSLR,Alternative Energy Stock Outlook   May 2017,opinion,"The U S  renewable energy industry has witnessed significant growth over the last several years  The implementation of a number of important decisions in 2015 by the state and federal governments further fueled its growth and continues to drive the sector 
A U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   report projects total renewables used in the electric power sector to increase 44  in 2018  Electricity generation from hydropower is expected to be relatively unchanged at 7  between 2016 and 2018  Generation from renewables other than hydropower is forecast to rise 9  in 2017 and 10  in 2018 
Notably  renewable energy provides multifold benefits for the climate  health as well as the economy  In addition to lowering carbon emissions  alternative sources of energy improve public health  create jobs and provide other economic benefits  Moreover  these sources of energy reduce the requirement of water for power production  offering a major advantage over fossil fuels  Offsetting these positives are the additional costs that are incurred by traditional energy sources to fully account for their environmental externalities 
A comprehensive study by the Department of Energy s National Renewable Energy Laboratory  NREL  shows that renewables will contribute more than 80  of total electricity generation in the U S  by 2050  compared to the present level of 30   The only need of the hour is the development of an electricity grid to withstand higher volume of renewable energy and advanced grid planning to maintain reliability 
To this end  governments  businesses and cities around the world are making concerted efforts to speed up the evolution of energy use  As the global energy system transformation is the backbone of climate action  the world has come closer under a set of major cooperative initiatives  It is these environmental considerations that are driving the demand for alternative energy sources 
While these favorable demand trends have been boosting the growth prospects of this space  the abundant availability of fossil fuels and dearth of adequate investment in solar companies have emerged as key competitive challenges  Although the industry s long term fundamentals remain favorable  the policies of the new administration will likely remove some  if not all  of the policy shields from this space  Given these challenges  growth in 2017 is expected to slow down 
Here  we discuss some of the major alternative energy sources 
Solar
A major growth area in the renewable space is solar energy  An EIA report indicates continued growth in utility scale solar power capacity  in fact by almost 44  from 21 GW at the end of 2016  The projected increase will bring the amount of solar capacity to 31 GW at 2018 end  In spite of the rapid uptake  solar will still constitute just 1  of total U S  utility scale generation in 2018  indicating immense scope for growth 
Solar growth has historically been concentrated in customer sited distributed generation installations  The EIA expects utility scale solar capacity to expand in states like California  Nevada  North Carolina  Texas and Georgia 
The solar industry in the U S  is booming  The solar Investment Tax Credit   ITC   has gone a long way in providing the industry stability and expansion  In the last 10 years  solar has witnessed a compound annual growth rate of almost 60   with the cost of installation dropping by over 70  
Over the past few years  utility scale solar has represented almost two thirds of the market  and this trend will likely continue in the near term  given the huge pipeline of projects under construction 
In particular  year 2016 was a record one for the U S  solar industry  The photovoltaic  PV  market grew 97  from 2015 s individual installations of more than 370 000  Although all market segments grew in 2016  the utility sector recorded maximum growth  which more than doubled with installations totaling over 10 gigawatts  GW  
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association   SEIA    U S  installed 14 762 megawatts  MW  of solar PV in 2016  reflecting 97  growth in the PV market over 2015  With this  total installed capacity reached 42 4 GW  In 2016  22 states each added over 100 MW of solar PV compared to 13 in 2015 
According to GTM Research  13 2 GW of new PV installations will come on line in 2017  reflecting a 10  decline from a record breaking 2016  Utility PV is forecast to comprise 66  of that new capacity 
Solar in China  Although economic woes in China continue to hurt the market  longer term prospects for solar in the nation remain favorable  The country has established itself as the world s largest market for solar panels and will likely be home to a quarter of the planet s new energy capacity from solar panels in the years to come  China is speedily adding as much power generation as possible  and solar is just one source of the new energy generation coming up in the country 
The National Energy Administration  NEA  said that installed renewable power capacity  including wind  hydro  solar and nuclear  will contribute about 50  of total electricity generation by 2020  In 2016  China installed 34 2 GW of new solar power  up 126  from last year s installations  bringing the cumulative solar capacity to 77 42 GW  according to NEA 
Under China s 13th Five Year Plan  FYP   the country has set a target of attaining 150GW to 200GW of solar PV capacity by 2020  It also intends to shift focus from grid scale expansion to quality and efficiency 
The following leading Chinese solar stocks are sure to make the most of the favorable government stimulus  JinkoSolar Holding Co   Ltd   JKS   JA Solar Holdings  Inc   JASO  and Trina Solar Ltd   TSL  
Ontario  Canada based solar product manufacturer  Canadian Solar Inc   CSIQ  is also well positioned with its diversified manufacturing base and project portfolio in Canada  China  Japan and the U S 
Wind
The American Wind Energy Association   AWEA   reported that the country s wind industry has installed 6 478 MW during the fourth quarter of 2016  bringing the total installed capacity to 82 183 MW  It marked the second strongest quarter of installations  Wind capacity of over 10 432 MW is currently under construction and another 7 913 MW is in advanced stages of development 
During the fourth quarter of 2016  19 states commissioned a total of 47 projects  Texas led the way with 1 790 MW  followed by Oklahoma with 1 192 MW  Presently  there are over 52 000 wind turbines operating in 40 states in addition to Guam and Puerto Rico  In the fourth quarter  the U S  also commissioned its first offshore wind project      the 30 MW Block Island wind project off the coast of Rhode Island 
In 2016  more than 4 000 MW of power purchase agreements  PPA  were signed and electric utilities released 23 wind eligible requests for proposals  RFPs  
As per the EIA  wind capacity at the end of 2016 was 81 GW  This is expected to increase to 95 GW by 2018  It is expected that wind generation will account for 6  of total generation in 2018

119324,340839,FSLR,Will Alternative Energy Stocks Reel Under The Trump Effect ,opinion,"President Trump s plans to shift focus to the traditional energy businesses such as coal  oil and gas and his skepticism around global climate change have cast a shadow over the future of solar companies  Trump has promised to call off the landmark Paris deal and boost coal production  Not only has he called climate change a Chinese hoax  but also pledged to repeal former President Obama s Clean Power Plan 
A comparative analysis of the alternative energy industry s historical EV EBITDA ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture that might be a cause for investor concern  The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 17 38  This level seems unfavorable when compared with what the industry saw in the last 12 months  The ratio is higher than the average level of 15 53 and is near its high end of 17 50 over this period 
Moreover  the industry seems overvalued when compared with its broader industry    Oil Energy sector s EV EBITDA ratio of 8 07 in the same time period  This shows that the industry is overvalued when compared to its broader industry 
While the long term potential of the space is undeniable  the industry is faced with a number of near term challenges that will likely keep these stocks under pressure  We discuss some of these below 
The Trump Effect  The present administration doesn t have a friendly stance toward the space  There is nothing concrete in policy terms  but ideas like closing down the EPA  discarding the Clean Power Plan  and pulling out of the Paris Agreement have been talked about in the past  We will see how the policy landscape evolves  but the focus will likely be on incentivizing the coal and natural gas industries 
Since 2014  as utilities closed a large number of aging coal fired generators  wind and solar have been the two biggest sources of electricity in the U S  The aforementioned policy changes will likely reverse this trend in the coming years 
China Factor  China s solar industry is not immune to the ongoing slowdown in its economy  According to theOrganization for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD   China s economic growth is likely to slow down to 6 5  this year and further decline to 6 3  in 2018 Gross domestic product  or GDP  of the world s second largest economy grew 6 7  in 2016   the weakest in the last 26 years  Considering these numbers  it is clear that the decelerating trend is likely to continue in the near term 
The country s economic situation has sparked apprehensions that the government could shift asset resources away from investments in renewable energy in order to fuel its stock market  One of the most prominent effects of the economic slowdown in China has been relatively weak demand for electricity 
At the end of 2015  China had set a target of installing 150 GW of solar energy by 2020  But in 2016  the figure was cut by 20  to 110 GW  Though the Asia Europe Clean Energy Advisory  AECEA  raised optimism by stating that the figure could exceed the revised target  uncertainties continue to persist 
In fact  despite being the world s largest solar market  China is expected to see solar installations to decline to 17 5 GW in 2017  well below its expected number of more than 30 GW 
Trina Solar Ltd   TSL   the largest Chinese manufacturer  derives about two thirds of its revenues from China  Over the last one year  its share price dropped 99 9   while Yingli Green Energy Holding Co  Ltd   YGE  saw its shares plummet about 26 1   Again  shares of JinkoSolar Holding Co   Ltd   JKS  tumbled 22 6  over the same period 
Fed Rate Hike   On Mar 15  the Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1   Fed lifted the key interest rate for the second time in three months  citing an improving labor market and greater confidence in consumers  Future rate hike expectations scaled higher as well and two additional rate hikes are anticipated this year only  Additionally  the Fed expects key interest rate to be around 1 4  by the end of 2017 
The federal funds rate is a benchmark interest rate that determines the rate for financial institutions to lend to each other  A rise in this rate translates to higher borrowing costs for banks that pass on these raised costs to consumers in the form of higher interest rates on loans  mortgages and other financial products  Since financing is an inherent requirement of the alternate energy sector  rising interest rates are a major growth deterrent for this space 
While companies in this space have been benefiting from a low interest rate environment so far  rate hike makes this industry far less appealing  This is because the resulting increase in cost of capital will increase cost of operations for the alternate energy companies  thereby reducing their profitability 
Subsidy Rollback  While the U S  government provides the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit to support growth of alternate energy  several other large nations are planning to lower subsidies provided to renewable energy operators 
Per recent media reports  China s National Development and Reform Commission has hinted at a cut in Feed in Tariffs  FiT  from the present rates  Though the changes in tariffs are yet to be official  the aim is to reduce FiTs by roughly 3 4  per year so that onshore wind might reach grid parity by 2020 
In Feb 2016  Japan s Ministry of Economy  Trade and Industry  METI  proposed an 11  cut in solar FiT  Recently  Japan announced plans to cut FiT rates annually to reach the level of household electricity rates of 20 5 cents per kilowatt hour   KWh   by 2019  The FiTs in 2017 will be 23 9 cents per KWh  then reduced to 22 2 cents per KWh in 2018 and finally will reach the target set for 2019 
Similarly  in Aug 2015  the UK government had hinted at an 87  reduction in support for domestic solar and an up to 82  cut in FiTs for commercial rooftops  Again  Germany is expected to cap subsidy payments after the generation capacity reaches a certain target 
Rolling back subsidies will lead to an increase in the cost of energy produced by renewable sources  This surely hurts the prospects of renewable energy across the globe 
Anti Dumping Duties  The move from the U S  Department of Commerce   DOC   to impose import duties on solar panels and other related products from China and Taiwan could escalate the U S  China trade conflict 
The decision addresses one of the main charges in a petition brought by SolarWorld Industries America  a German solar manufacturer with major operations in the U S  A complaint lodged by SolarWorld brought to the fore a loophole that the Chinese solar product makers were exploiting to evade duties imposed by the Department of Justice in 2012 
The higher tariffs came at a time when the solar industry was on the whole recovering after a two year supply glut 
The Commerce Department in Dec 2014 set anti dumping duties at about 52  on most module imports from China and at 19 5  on most imports of Taiwanese cells  It has also slapped 39  anti subsidy tariffs on most China made panels 
Imposing of these anti dumping duties has benefited many U S  alternate energy companies like Vivint Solar  Inc   VSLR   Enphase Energy  Inc   ENPH  and First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   Inc   FSLR   While Vivint Solar carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Enphase Energy and First Solar carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
New Emerging Technologies  The alternative energy industry remains an emerging sector with a steady focus on the lowest cost technology  This may prove disastrous for existing companies riding the solar boom should a cheaper alternative emerge  The industry also has to deal with cost competitiveness from traditional means of electricity generation 
Conclusion
Globally  China leads the world in total electricity generation from renewable sources  helped by its increased allegiance in recent times to the alternative path  It is followed closely by the U S   Brazil and Canada 
All leading solar cell manufacturers are looking for opportunities in the emerging markets  These markets primarily comprise the Asia Pacific region with China  India and Japan being the key destination for the global solar giants  The long term outlook on the whole looks bright  This is especially true as global warming and high fuel emission issues have proven how indispensable clean energy sources will be for the future 
However  the global economic turmoil  China s economic slowdown and the consequent subsidy rollback in the prime global solar markets are major headwinds for the renewable energy industry on the whole 
Also  Trump s focus on reviving the coal industry instead of encouraging alternate energy is a serious concern for all renewable energy companies 
Again  if we are to expand renewable manufacturing infrastructure worldwide to fight the climate crisis  the U S  as well as the Chinese manufacturers should try to settle their dispute before the industry at large is damaged  Measures to reduce the inflow of Chinese solar panels may hamper the battle against climate change 
Any increase in interest rates is detrimental for the alternative energy space  The recent rate hike thus makes the future prospect of this space quite uncertain

Unfortunately for many investors  in the markets as in the rest of life  for every overachiever there is often also an underachiever  The U S  equities markets in 2016 were no different in this regard 
While some stocks deserved recognition as top performers of the year  some highly touted  high profile stocks didn t live up to expectations  Below are the four we think were most disappointing  plus a sector that was equally perturbing 


Nike  Inc

Gain Loss    11 67   18 6 

Nike  NYSE NKE  earned its place on this list by being the Dow s worst performer in 2016  While the index rose 13 4  during the calendar year  Nike lost almost 19   Interestingly  it s not that Nike did badly last year  Revenue continued to grow at a 6 95  pace on the year  and net income displayed growth of 7 3   Nike is down because of concerns about the future of the company 
Competitors Adidas  OTC ADDYY  and Under Armour  NYSE UA  are mounting a strong challenge to Nike s position at the top of the athletic apparel heap   More on Under Armour below   Nike s shrinking gross profit margin  from 46 3  to 45 3  in the past year  and three straight quarters of misses in future orders expectations the latest to 7  growth vs 8  expected are clear signs that the future might be cloudy for Nike 
The year ahead  Nike is trading right now at early 2015 prices  and its valuation is attractive compared to its peers  Its P E ratio of 22 is lower than Adidas  29  and its price to free cash flow is also lower  at 39 versus 48  In sum  Nike is a very solid company hampered by future negative expectations  Given its current valuation and the fact that Nike is still a growing company  we expect it to have a much better year in 2017 compared to the one that just passed 



First Solar  Inc

Gain Loss    33 9   51 3 

First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  is the world s leading manufacturer and marketer of solar panels  Its share price in 2016 was hurt badly by a cascade of factors 
Slowing demand for solar panels in China led to an oversupply  which in turn brought prices down  In addition  the company made a strategic decision to aggressively jump ahead with its solar panel manufacturing model  ditching plans to develop a model 5 in favor of a more efficient and cost effective model 6 
This decision will lead to an approximately half billion dollar impairment charge in the short term  though it could have lots of benefits longer term  Add to this President elect Trump s widely covered notion that global warming is nothing more than a Chinese hoax  and FSLR found itself at the center of a vortex of investor fears that the renewable energy sector could be shunted aside in favor of more conventional  more polluting coal energy 
The year ahead  In light of uncertain governmental policies coming out of China and the as yet untested Trump led US administration  renewable energies will continue to be volatile in 2017  However  solar energy should be viewed as a long term play and if you seek to open a position in this industry  First Solar is still your best option  The company holds over  2 billion in cash and equivalent with a  3 3 billion market cap  Its total price to book ratio is 0 56  which is considered very low  In comparison  SunPower  NASDAQ SPWR   the second largest company in the industry  has less than  400M cash on  900M market cap  and a price to book ratio of 0 71 
Though both have respectable fundamentals  the market leader  First Solar  has the more attractive valuation  giving it a major advantage  First Solar s current ratio  sometimes referred to as working capital ratio  is a solid 2 46  while its debt to equity ratio is 0 13 both indicating that the company is not in danger of going under and could potentially absorb more blows  From an investment perspective  First Solar will probably be a longer term ride that may not see much of a pay out in 2017  but its prospects are still the best within the industry 


Under Armour  Inc

Gain Loss    16 47   39 5 

Under Armour s  NYSE UA  story is one of classic failed expectations  Like Nike s situation described above  it s not that the company performed badly  Rather  its performance during 2016 simply didn t live up to anyone s expectations 
The company started the year with a P E ratio of 83 versus an industry average of about 28  clearly signaling that investors were expecting very strong growth in 2016  Unfortunately  Under Armour didn t deliver  Revenue growth peaked in the final quarter of 2015 at 30 7  yoy quarterly growth  but has since declined for three straight quarters  As with any highly valuated company  unfulfilled expectations have a tendency to hammer the share price until it falls to a point where investors believe it s in line with the new reality  The result  as can be seen with UA  is generally not pretty 
The year ahead  Under Armour is still growing its revenue at a 20  pace  but its P E of 56 is currently still very high  indicating that most of the good  if not the best  case scenarios  are already priced in  The battle for market share in the sports apparel segment is heating up as well  That s not a good sign for a company that s expected to continue to grow at a strong pace 
The established leaders in this industry most notably Nike and Adidas have their work cut out for them with Under Armour  which has been providing a breath of fresh air via greater choice and new designs  Still  we don t believe that now is the time for investors to take a new position in UA  Far better would be to wait and see which direction fundamentals take in 2017 


Alphabet  Inc

Gain Loss    12 94   1 7 

As we ve mentioned  this isn t a worst performers list  Rather it s a list of the most disappointing stocks from the past year  In that regard  Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  even with its positive return on the year belongs on this list  With just 1 7  growth in its share price  the second largest company in the world by market cap lags the index it heads up by 8  on the year 
While Alphabet continues to grow strongly  regularly beating earnings expectations  there is some analyst and investor concern regarding lower search volumes alongside the higher cost of traffic acquisition  which may have helped keep the stock in check in 2016  Its share price also fell almost 10  the week after Mr  Trump was elected  in complete divergence from the market s rally over the same time period  because it is unclear exactly how the new U S administration will affect top tech companies 
The year ahead  Alphabet still enjoys a very large competitive moat in the search engine arena  as well as in mobile operating systems since it owns android  Alphabet s P E ratio is 28  which  while on the higher side  is expected to flatten out over the next year to a more realistic 18 7  Nevertheless  Alphabet continues to defy expectations  And the more its product is used  the wider its moat grows  We don t expect Alphabet will lag the market for a second year straight 


Bonus  Pharmaceuticals Sector
It s been a rough 2016 for many companies in the Pharma sector  which has been hurt by increasing competition  multiple scandals including price gouging  price fixing and payoffs  All of this in turn has focused a harsh spotlight on company business models and morals  As a result demands for much stricter regulation have proliferated  And individual companies have suffered  whether rightly or not 
Notable underperformers include  Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   down 29  after the EpiPen pricing controversy  Teva  NYSE TEVA   down 44 7  on bribery allegations  price fixing accusations  and the resignation of top personnel  Valeant  NYSE VRX    85   and Endo  NASDAQ ENDP    73    which  together with Martin Shkreli s Turing Pharmaceuticals  started the whole price gouging fiasco 
It seems that Merck  NYSE MRK    11   and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ    12   were the only companies able to come out ahead  Clearly  2016 was truly a horrible year for the Pharmaceuticals industry 
In our view the jury is still out on how the Pharma industry will perform in 2017  Much will depend on the Trump administration s appetite for government regulation  Nevertheless  we believe most of the fear is already priced in and it s difficult to see how Pharma can have a second year as miserable as this past one ",2017-01-05,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/most-disappointing-stocks-of-2016-200171235,200171235

Another record high for the Dow  S P and NASDAQ  not so much 
91 straight trading days  that is how long the S P has gone without closing lower by 1  or more  The S P 500 ended 1 2  down on Oct  11  more than four months ago  and hasn t clocked out on such a negative note since then 
The result has been a slow  steady slog to record highs  Hardly the stuff of investor euphoria or irrational exuberance  more like climbing a wall of worry  Stocks are expensive by almost any measure  and Mom and Pop investors seem skeptical  but the reality is that they have few good options but to stand on the edge of the cliff 
  Bloomberg polled Wall Street analysts for their full year predictions  The average forecast for 2017 was calling for growth of 5 2 percent  The S P 500 is already up 5 5 percent year to date  The average estimate was 2 364  The index touched 2 366 yesterday 
The Federal Reserve s Federal Open Market Committee held a meeting January 31   February 1  The Fed stood pat at that meeting  and today they released   Policymakers seemed confident that the labor market was strong  and even though there were signs of inflation  that didn t seem to worry them 
Fed officials wrestled with uncertainty on issues ranging from the Trump administration s fiscal stimulus plans to the headwinds a rising dollar may pose  A few participants noted that 

continuing to remove policy accommodation in a timely manner  potentially at an upcoming meeting  would allow the committee greater flexibility in responding to subsequent changes in economic conditions 

The minutes included several references to  downside risks  to the economy  However  the meeting was held before data releases on  and inflation early in February that crushed estimates  The takeaway is that they seem ready to raise rates  fairly soon  
The next policy meeting is March 14 15  and the more likely chance for a rate hike is the policy meeting in June  Still  the Fed is holding to the idea of 3 rate hikes for 2017  so March is on the table 
The National Association of Realtors reports existing home sales jumped 3 3  in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 69 million  January s sales pace is 3 8 percent higher than a year ago  The median existing home price for all housing types in January was  228 900  up 7 1 percent from January 2016 and marks the 59th consecutive month of year over year gains 
Total housing inventory at the end of January rose 2 4 percent to 1 69 million existing homes available for sale  but is still 7 1 percent lower than a year ago  and has fallen year over year for 20 straight months  And of course  tight inventory combined with higher mortgage rates  means less affordable housing 
Not surprising that lower price  or starter homes were a sweet spot for buyers  First time buyers rose slightly to 33  of sales in January  For Phoenix  the median listing price was  307 000  And the average time on market was 66 days  Compared to an average of 50 days nationally 
The U S  has approximately 200 000 unfilled construction jobs  which represents an 81  increase over the last two years  according to estimates from the National Association of Homebuilders  Home builders like Lennar  NYSE LEN  and Toll Brothers have cited a shortage in construction workers as a major reason they ve had to slow down home construction 
Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL  reported quarterly profit of 42 cents per share  7 cents above estimates  while the luxury homebuilder s revenue beat forecasts by a wide margin  However  overall profit was down 3 8 percent from a year ago  impacted by lower average selling prices 
Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plunged by more than 30 percent on Tuesday following a ruling by a U S  appeals court dismissing hedge funds  claims that the government seized Fannie s and Freddie s profits after their taxpayer bailout 
Fannie and Freddie went into conservator ship during the 2008 financial crisis  receiving a nearly  188 billion bailout from the federal government  In return  Fannie and Freddie were required to pay a 10 percent dividend to the government  In 2012  the terms of the bailout were amended   the Third Amendment   forcing Fannie and Freddie to forward all their profits to the U S  Treasury 
On Friday  Fannie and Freddie announced they were sending a combined  10 million in dividends to the U S  Treasury  Fannie reported a  5 billion profit for the fourth quarter  while Freddie reported a  4 8 billion fourth quarter profit  Because Fannie and Freddie s profits have been going to the government  there was nothing left for the investors  who cried foul

Commentary under a divided government  However  you might not beieve that old Wall Street adage based on the 4 8  gain in the S P 500 in just a month s time since Republicans effectively took over the entire Federal government in the wake of the U S  2016 elections  The market has become downright giddy over the prospects of a federal government prepared and able to spend and cut taxes with little resistance 
I paid no attention to the old adage when  

 In these cases where theme based trading and investing first blasts off  it can be tempting to think you can outsmart the market  For example  you might think that the earnings power in some industry cannot possibly meet investor expectations  Or perhaps you look at recent technical history and conclude that a reversion will surely come once the market returns to its  senses   I think differently  The market is telling us that something fundamental has changed about the market s underlying conditions  At this stage  many theories may take months  maybe even a year or two to come to fruition or to fail  In that time  you can miss a LOT of healthy gains This is NOT the time to argue with the market  This is a time to follow it  Buying dips is the safest approach to playing the new themes  

Almost one month later  the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   has surged into overbought territory after a hiatus of 90 trading days and   T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   closed at 72 2  which is above the 70  threshold for overbought trading conditions  The 1 3  gain for the S P 500 printed a fresh all time high as part of a very bullish breakout 

The S P 500  SPY  breaks out to a new all time high  Compare to the similar breakout on July 8th of this year 

The NASDAQ futures is starting to keep pace with the S P 500 in a bullish move that represents broadening participation in the post election rally 
Interestingly  the volatility index  the VIX gained on the day  I interepret this as a move by big money to buy put options to protect gains going into the close of the year or a rush of skeptics betting that the market s breakout represents the final stretch of a rubberband 

The volatility index  VIX  gained recovered from early losses and closed the day nearly reversing all the previous day s loss 
A breakout to a new all time high alongside overbought conditions is a very bullish combination  I am still uneasy with this breakout happening ahead of next week s Federal Reserve meeting  but I am sticking with the bullish short term trading call  I fully expect some turbulence around the Fed meeting and will treat a related dip in the market as a buying opportunity 
Soon after the Fed should be a  Santa rally  and then there is January with a recovery in the stocks unfortunate enough to get caught in the crosshairs of counter trend selling going into year end 
Two potential January effect stocks I have on my list are cybersecurity company Rapid7 Inc  NASDAQ RPD  and solar company SunPower Corporation  NASDAQ SPWR  
I started accumulating shares in RPD after its last earnings report received a  17 8  reception  Since then  RPD has not gone much lower during a period of consolidation  RPD broke out of that range this week and is now angling to reverse its post earnings loss  Overhead resistance looming from the converged 50 and 200DMAs are the biggest technical risks ahead 

Buyers returned to Rapid7  Inc   RPD  in force over the past 4 days  Wednesday s 5 3  gain looks like it confirmed a bottom after a short period of consolidation 
In late September  I sold a 2018 put option on First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  to play what I thought was the pattern of a beaten up stock finally printing a bottom  I turned out to be early  Next up is SunPower  SPWR   Wednesday the stock soared 14 2  on news of job cuts as part of a restructuring  The company also reaffirmed 2017 guidance 
I have put the stock on my radar as it now has the potential to rally well into January  Unlike FSLR  I am treating this as more of a short term play with a very clear stop under the last low  The next earnings announcement will not likely come until February  so I am assuming this trade has some runway ahead of it 

SunPower  SPWR  is finally cleaning house  Is this the signal the market needed to buy into a bottom  The day s rally took SPWR above its 50DMA for the first time since July 
The market s breakout gave me a great start to my seasonal trade on iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  call options  ITB s 2 5  gain was another example of the breadth of the bullishness in the market 

The iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  ITB  broke out to a 3 month high and looks ready to finish reversing the losses from its 50DMA breakdown 
The main blemish on today s market action was the health care sector  In particular  drug companies came under fire yet again  This time it was President elect Donald Trump issuing the bash  In a Time Magazine interview Trump had the following to say   I m going to bring down drug prices I don t like what has happened with drug prices   Trump provided no specifics  but it was enough to bring back the sellers in force in iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB  
The 2 9  loss confirmed a 50 200DMA breakdown for IBB  The irony of the  Trump bash  is that IBB participated in the immediate post election celebration  At the lows of the day  IBB finished a complete reversal of its post election gain  A retest of the November low is now in play 

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  IBB  breaks down again on yet another  bash   IBB remains weighted down by large amounts of political risk 
Going forward  I plan to aggressively play the breakout in the S P 500  I am hoping for an immediate pullback to at least the edge of the upper Bollinger Band  Absent that  I will look for some kind of selling pressure going into or immediately following next week s Federal Reserve meeting  Stay tuned 
As a reminder  here is my chart mapping the historical performance of the S P 500 versus the duration of overbought periods  Recall that the 20 to 23 trading day mark is a key divider between modest gains and a large extended overbought rally  To accomodate the most bullish scenario  I will be targeting shares and January call options

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 79 cents on  987 90 million  10 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  30 million on the top
First Solar had been one of the few standouts in the solar industry but it looks like an industry wide pullback is starting to catch up to them
Advanced stage projects such as the one signed with MCE on Tuesday are expected to drive top line growth for the remainder of 2016
The past few years have been nothing short of a roller coaster ride for the solar industry  All the efforts to promote solar energy and make it more accessible has not translated to financial success  This has only recently started to catch up to First Solar  which had otherwise been a standout in the industry  Shares are down 29  in the past 12 months due to a pronounced slowdown impacting both the top and bottom line  Its widely believed those struggles will carry forward into the third quarter 
Analysts at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of 79 cents  76  lower than the same period last year  That estimate has dropped nearly 20  in the past 3 months when First Solar more recently reported  Revenue for the period is forecasted to drop 21  to  987 90 million  marking the first period of negative growth since the FQ4 2015  Historically shares haven t moved following an earnings report but given the current state of the solar industry  a sell off seems all but inevitable  
Despite some of its recent woes  First Solar has made some impressive strides compared to other industry players like SolarCity  NASDAQ SCTY  and Sunedison  OTC SUNEQ   From a financial perspective  First Solar is one of the only solar companies that hasn t consistently posted a loss  Its primary focus has been on large commercial markets where its competitors have been tied to less profitable residential and small commercial markets 
In the previous earnings call the company revealed that earnings would be lower in the third quarter following restructuring charges in the range of  15 to  20 million  Some of this should be offset by from the sale of large scale utility projects such as the one signed with MCE Tuesday  These advanced stage projects will derive a large portion of revenue for the remainder 2016  First Solar robust pipeline and unique technology gives them the upper hand against its peers but an industry wide pullback doesn t mean it won t suffer

119433,340948,FSLR,Trading The First Presidential Debate  3 Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"Last night s debate was awkwardly entertaining  I must admit I was cringing and laughing as the two candidates went after each other  However  my focus was on the futures markets as I expected the market to move during the debate  While most people around the world watched their TVs  I was watching my trading monitors for an indication on which candidate won 
Going into the debate  it was widely accepted by traders that if Trump continued his momentum after last night  it would be a negative for the markets  It s not that the markets don t like Donald Trump  they just don t like the uncertainty that he brings  Mr  Trump s push in the polls over the last week was attributed to the recent sell off in the market  A debate win could have put him in the lead and done some serious damage to the markets 
The verdict is in before the polls  Clinton Won
Rather then analyze what the candidates said  let s take a look at how futures markets reacted as the debate went on  Before the debates  I watched four different futures contracts to give me clues to who was winning  Gold  S P 500  VIX  and the Mexican Peso  The thought was  if Trump won the debate  markets would go lower and fear would rise  VIX  Gold  
S P Futures  The main indicator of the markets  the S P futures  were actually trading down about 0 40  before the debate  However  after an hour into the debate markets turned 0 50  higher as Clinton seemed to be winning 

Gold Futures  Since last Wednesday  gold was up 2   This was a combination of the Fed holding off on rates and Trumps momentum  I was watching for a spike with a Trump win  but when Trump started to struggle  gold sold off 

VIX Futures   The fear gauge is always a great indicator to look at during big trading events  Before the debate  VIX futures were trading at 16 50  but fell 2  during the debate  to under 16  If the polls stay tight volatility will stay elevated  but if Clinton takes back a big lead  expect the VIX to get smashed 

Mexican Peso  Trump policies would damage the Mexican economy and its currency  As Trump gained momentum  the Peso weakened  Last night  the Peso charged almost 2  higher during the debate  a sign that Clinton had won 

Stocks that will benefit
There wasn t much substance to what was discussed  which makes it very difficult to determine what actually might get done once in the White House  Since Clinton won the debate  let s focus on stocks that will benefit if she wins the election  These stocks could take off today and continue to rise over the next month as a Clinton victory becomes more certain 
The three stocks listed below are all Zacks Ranked  3  Hold   A Clinton victory might force analysts to revise estimates higher so keep an eye on the rank for any improvements 
Infrastructure
Clinton wants to improve the nations crumbling infrastructure  so it s wise to go with a known name that deals in the construction of highways and infrastructure   Martin Marietta Materials  NYSE MLM   MLM  will be an important supplier of the aggregates used to build the roads and bridges that will be included in her budget plan 
Alternative Energy
Clinton s move off of fossil fuels and into renewable alternative energies makes the solar sector appealing  The Guggenheim Solar ETF  TAN  should move higher with a Democrat victory   Clinton s goal to have renewable electricity in every home within 10 years makes First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   FSLR  very attractive at current valuation levels  
Healthcare
Clinton would expand Obamacare if elected  allowing more visits before deductibles and tax credits for out of pocket expenses Hospitals would profit with an expansion of Obamacare as more people would be encouraged to get care when it s needed HCA Holdings  HCA  operates 164 hospitals and 116 freestanding surgery centers that would benefit

119437,340952,FSLR,3 Stocks To Watch After Hillary Clinton s Debate Performance,opinion,Hillary Clinton had an edge over Donald Trump during the first presidential debate which took place at Hofstra University on Monday  This was indicated by early focus groups and polls which underscore the manner in which Clinton put across her views on a wide variety of subjects  The two candidates discussed several issues  including defense and the economy before the debate took on a more personal tone Hillary Had Upper Hand in Round OneAt one point during the debate  Clinton quipped that her opponent was criticizing her for coming well prepared and she had  She went on to claim that she was also better suited for the Presidential office  Media watchers and experts think that at most times  she did  as the candidates squared off on a wide range of issues For instance  Clinton showed a better degree of preparedness on matters of public policy  defense and tax reform  She also put Trump on the wrong foot about his record on several sensitive issues including his track record in business Admittedly  however  Trump did put Clinton on the defensive when he questioned her vacillating stand on trade policy  He chose to focus on how she was opposing the Trans Pacific Partnership after supporting it during the initial phase of negotiations  However  Clinton acquitted herself more gracefully when she chose to admit that she was at fault when the familiar private e mail bogey was raised  Clinton Backs Solar PowerAmidst all the barbs and insinuations  some concrete proposals related to industry were also heard  Nearly all of them came from Clinton  who chose to focus on several familiar areas  Emphasizing the importance of clean and renewable power  she said that this would also help job creation especially in small businesses Questioning Trump s stance on climate change  she said that it was important to come to terms with an impending crisis  The best way to combat the situation  she said  was renewable power  Clinton said  half a billion  solar panels could be set up as well as a new electric transmission grid  Cyber Security and DefenseWhen asked by the moderator about her stance on cyber security  Clinton said that she believes that this would be a major challenge for the next President  This was because cyber attacks were now coming from independent groups as well as other countries  In the case of countries  the threat was no longer commercial but more serious in nature  Questioning Russia s record on this count  she expressed concern about Trump s recent praise of Vladimir Putin Trump confronted Clinton several times about her failure to eliminate ISIS  On her part  Clinton said that she had provided proposals of a plan to tackle this threat and said she estimated that air strikes would have to be stepped up  This would enable U S  allies in the Middle East to finally defeat ISIS  Clinton has already said that she will also confront China over territorial disputes in the South China Sea and this only serves to underline her aggressive stance on defense  Stocks to WatchClinton seems to have won the first honors and at present has a better chance of ultimately getting to the White House  Given her strong stance on several issues  some sectors are likely to do a little better if she comes to office  Lockheed Martin Corporation   NYSE LMT   is likely to benefit from Clinton s stance on defense and her promise to escalate air strikes  For instance  the company s F 35 stealth fighter could enjoy higher sales  Already  the company has a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon   Read   Lockheed Martin has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The company has expected earnings growth of 8 4  for the current year  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 0 5  over the last 30 days First Solar  Inc    NASDAQ FSLR   is a leading provider of PV energy solutions  with the majority situated across North America  The company is likely to gain from Clinton s energy proposals and her strong solar push First Solar is slightly expensive and has a forward price to earnings  P E  ratio for the current financial year  F1  is 8 67  higher than the industry average of 5 19  The stock has a Zacks Rank  3  You can see   Proofpoint  Inc    NASDAQ PFPT   will gain from the renewed focus on cybersecurity following the recent data breach at The World Anti Doping Agency  WADA   This was also the focus of the candidate s debate when they discussed cybersecurity issues   Read   Proofpoint has a Zacks Rank  3  The

Trading the Presidential Debate  3 Stocks to Buy Now

Monday night s debate was awkwardly entertaining  I must admit I was cringing and laughing as the two candidates went after each other  However  my focus was on the futures markets as I expected the market to move during the debate  While most people around the world watched their TVs  I was watching my trading monitors for an indication on which candidate won 

Going into the debate  it was widely accepted by traders that if Trump continued his momentum after last night  it would be a negative for the markets  It s not that the markets don t like Donald Trump  they just don t like the uncertainty that he brings  Mr  Trump s push in the polls over the last week was attributed to the recent sell off in the market  A debate win could have put him in the lead and done some serious damage to the markets 

The verdict is in before the polls  Clinton Won

Rather than analyze what the candidates said  let s take a look at how futures markets reacted as the debate went on  Before the debates  I watched four different futures contracts to give me clues to who was winning  Gold  S P 500  VIX  and the Mexican Peso  The thought was  if Trump won the debate  markets would go lower and fear would rise  VIX  Gold  

S P Futures  The main indicator of the markets  the S P futures  were actually trading down about 0 40  before the debate  However  after an hour into the debate markets turned 0 50  higher as Clinton seemed to be winning 

Gold Futures  Since last Wednesday  gold was up 2   This was a combination of the Fed holding off on rates and Trumps momentum  I was watching for a spike with a Trump win  but when Trump started to struggle  gold sold off 

VIX Futures   The fear gauge is always a great indicator to look at during big trading events  Before the debate  VIX futures were trading at 16 50  but fell 2  during the debate  to under 16  If the polls stay tight volatility will stay elevated  but if Clinton takes back a big lead  expect the VIX to get smashed 

Mexican Peso  Trump policies would damage the Mexican economy and its currency  As Trump gained momentum  the Peso weakened  Last night  the Peso charged almost 2  higher during the debate  a sign that Clinton had won 

Stocks that will benefit

There wasn t much substance to what was discussed  which makes it very difficult to determine what actually might get done once in the White House  Since Clinton won the debate  let s focus on stocks that will benefit if she wins the election  These stocks could take off today and continue to rise over the next month as a Clinton victory becomes more certain 

The three stocks listed below are all Zacks Ranked  3  Hold   A Clinton victory might force analysts to revise estimates higher so keep an eye on the rank for any improvements 

Infrastructure

Clinton wants to improve the nations crumbling infrastructure  so it s wise to go with a known name that deals in the construction of highways and infrastructure  Martin Marietta Materials  NYSE        will be an important supplier of the aggregates used to build the roads and bridges that will be included in her budget plan 

Alternative Energy

Clinton s move off of fossil fuels and into renewable alternative energies makes the solar sector appealing  The Guggenheim Solar ETF  NYSEARCA         should move higher with a Democrat victory  Clinton s goal to have renewable electricity in every home within 10 years makes First Solar  NASDAQ        very attractive at current valuation levels 

Healthcare

Clinton would expand Obamacare if elected  allowing more visits before deductibles and tax credits for out of pocket expenses  Hospitals would profit with an expansion of Obamacare as more people would be encouraged to get care when it s needed  HCA Holdings  NYSE        operates 164 hospitals and 116 freestanding surgery centers that would benefit 

In Summary

By no means is the election over  There are still two more debates and plenty of time until Election Day  Be aware of the market indicators listed above to give insight into which candidate might be improving in the polls  Use these indicators to allocate funds into stocks that will benefit from that candidate winning the White House 

It should be noted that since last night  futures have given back debate gains due to Europe banking fears  While the election is a powerful force in market direction  other issues might temporary stall that direction  The Peso has held on to most of its gains  telling us that other forces then the debate were at work on the selling this morning

	Chicago  IL   September 20  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Alternative Energy  part 2  including  NRG Energy Inc  NYSE NRG       SunPower Corp      First Solar Inc  NASDAQ FSLR       SolarCity Corp       and Trina Solar Ltd     

	Industry  Alternative Energy  part 2

	Link  

	The extension of key renewable tax credits  reduced solar photovoltaic  PV  capital costs and low natural gas prices  along with state level renewable mandates  will be driving the alternative energy space s growth trajectory 

	After months of suffering from collapsing oil prices  green energy companies suddenly seem to be on firmer footing now  The Paris climate change summit gave the renewables sector a shot in the arm last year  while Congress  vote to extend federal subsidies for renewable energy has further perked up the space 

	Solar and wind energy got a major boost from the environmental tax credit extension that came as part of the  1 15 trillion federal spending bill  which also lifted a 40 year ban on exporting American crude oil  The latest report from the U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   also shows that renewable energy will be the fastest growing power source through 2040  accounting for 27  of total U S  generation 

	Solar and wind are gradually transforming the way we produce and consume energy  driving the ongoing global energy transition  Although some better established sources of alternative energy   hydro  wind  biomass and waste  not to mention solar PV   are supported extensively  niche renewable energy sources such as geothermal and concentrated solar power   CSP   are also on the rise  natural conditions permitting 

	Moreover  declining capital costs for technologies are improving their competitiveness  As per Solar Energy Industries Association s   SEIA    national solar PV system pricing fell up to 17  over the course of 2015 

	Here we take a look at the alternative energy space and attempt to identify this nascent industry s growing strengths 

President s Green Energy Plan    Clean energy  has long been the focus of the current administration  President Obama s  Climate Change Action Plan  and the favorable green energy trends have already done a lot in pushing the sector northward 

	On Dec 15  2015  Congress passed an extension and modification of federal tax credits for new wind and solar generators  The new environmental tax credit extension allows solar power companies to keep claiming federal Investment Tax Credits   ITC   at 30  of the price of solar energy systems installed by businesses or homeowners  The ITC  which was earlier set to expire at the end of 2016  was forcing developers to rush to finish projects  Now they look good through 2019 with the five year extension  However  the credit will start to decline  going down to 10  in 2022 

	The wind sector also benefited significantly from the production tax credit   PTC   extension  The PTC  which had expired at 2014 end due to Congressional gridlock  was extended through 2020  However  the PTC that pays 2 3 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity generated will be gradually reduced over the next four years before being completely phased out 

	In addition  the Obama administration s efforts to restrict carbon emissions are a net positive for renewable energy stocks  On Aug 3  2015  the White House revealed the final version of its ambitious climate policy  This Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  program seeks to cut CO2 emissions from the nation s power plants 

	The administration has vowed for CO2 reduction of 28  by 2025 and 32  by 2030  from 2005 levels  This version turns out to be a little stronger than the draft proposal released last summer  wherein the EPA had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29  by 2025 and 30  by 2030 

	The plan sets carbon pollution reduction goals for power plants and requires states to implement plans to meet these goals  States have until this month to submit plans  but all must comply by 2022  of U S  electricity and coal plants are the largest source of carbon emissions in the country  Increasing regulatory mandates to safeguard the environment will be a catalyst for renewable stocks 

	The proposed rule has influenced utility providers like NRG Energy Inc      to gradually shift their mode of power generation to solar  wind and water 

	The EIA projects that utility scale solar capacity will expand by more than 13 3 GW between 2016 and 2017 in the U S   in tandem with considerable consumption growth in renewables for electricity and heat generation purpose  California  along with North Carolina  Nevada  Texas and Georgia  will account for most of the projected utility scale capacity additions over the said period 

Anti Dumping Duties and Solar Trade War   Washington imposed import duties on solar panels and other related products from China and Taiwan  The U S  believes that Chinese manufacturers have benefited from unfair subsidies offered by their government  U S  solar stocks like SunPower Corp     and First Solar Inc      are expected to make the most of the trade conflict between the U S  and China 

	The U S  Department of Commerce   DOC    in Dec 2014  set anti dumping duties at about 52  on most module imports from China and at 19 5  on most imports of Taiwanese cells  It has also slapped 39  anti subsidy tariffs on most China made panels  The move is intended to close a gap in which Chinese companies could use solar cells made in Taiwan to avoid paying higher tariffs 

The Sun Is Everywhere   Solar power is generally located at a customer s site due to the universal availability of sunlight  As a result  solar power limits the expense and losses associated with transmission and distribution from large scale electric plants to the end users  For most residential consumers seeking an environment friendly power alternative  solar power is currently the only viable choice  Residential solar is undeniably gaining on utility scale solar in the U S  in a marked change in industry dynamics 

	Among the renewable energy pack  rooftop solar energy systems provider SolarCity Corp      has an innovative game plan  This downstream solar company plays on its strength  providing renewable power lower than the grid price to residential and commercial markets in the U S  California based SolarCity s MyPower loan plan allows its customers to own their solar systems and still pay less for electricity when compared to leasing them through power purchase agreements 

India s Solar Initiatives   While the U S  and China have been in the forefront in recent years in driving the industry  other nations are also developing their home grown solar generation capacity as a remedial measure to solve the electricity crisis  The latest to join this list is Asia s third largest economy  India  which has committed to generate 40  of its total power capacity from renewable sources by 2030 

	India is striving to enhance its solar energy capacity to 100 GW by 2022  which will include 60 GW from grid connected solar projects and 40 GW from rooftop solar  The pace of installation is projected to accelerate rapidly with a forecast of installing 4 8 GW in 2016  This has kindled the interest of global solar players in the Indian market 

	First Solar and SunEdison Inc  have ample businesses in India and  together with local firms  are investing considerably in the country  Recently  First Solar has connected 130 megawatts   MW   utility scale solar power to the nation s grid  These plants are part of a 260 MW project portfolio wholly owned by First Solar in India 

	Chinese player Trina Solar Ltd     is planning to build 700 MW capacity for solar cells and 500 MW capacity for solar modules in the country  These are encouraging signs of the solar industry s prospects in India

119505,341020,FSLR,First Solar Stock Tanks Even After Strong Earnings,opinion,"First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR 
First Solar is having an incredibly rough day in the market today  and for good reason  Yesterday  after the closing bell  the company reported its earnings for the second quarter  While both earnings per share and revenue blew away expectations  guidance caused concerns  Today  we ll talk about what we saw from the report  how the stock reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from FSLR moving forward 
FSLR Reports Strong Earnings With Poor Guidance
As mentioned above  First Solar is having a rough day as the result of its Q2 report  Here s what we saw from the report 
Earnings Per Share   In terms of earnings per share  FSLR did exceptionally well  During the second quarter  analysts expected that the company would generate earnings in the amount of  0 54 per share  However  the company actually reported second quarter earnings in the amount of  0 87 per share 
Revenue   With the earnings report  FSLR definitely didn t disappoint with regard to revenue either  During the second quarter  analysts expected that the company would generate revenue in the amount of  862 7 million  However  the company actually reported revenue in the amount of  934 4 million 
Guidance   While earnings and revenue proved to be overwhelmingly positive  that wasn t the case with regard to guidance  While the company maintained a revenue outlook for the full year at between  3 8 and  4 0 billion  EPS guidance was reduced  Previously  First Solar expected to generate earnings in the range of  4 10 and  4 50 per share through the full year  However  the company reduced this expectation to between  3 65 and  3 90 per share 
How The Stock Reacted To The News
As investors  one of the first things that we learn is that the news moves the market  Any time positive news is released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the value of the stock associated with the company  Adversely  negative news will lead to declines  While there was positive in the fact that FSLR beat earnings and revenue expectations  investors are concerned with the future growth of the company due to poor guidance  As a result  we re seeing massive declines in the value of the stock today  Currently  3 13   the stock is trading at  43 23 per share after a loss of  6 01 per share or 12 21  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have a relatively mixed expectation of what we can expect to see from First Solar  In the short term  the stock may see further declines as a result of the disappointing guidance  However  with global economic conditions on the downtrend  I m not surprised that earnings will be slightly lower  Nonetheless  in the long run  I believe that FSLR is well positioned for strong growth  The company has a solid product  a solid team  and a solid plan to grow the company  All in all  I believe this one will climb in the long run ",2016-08-05,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-solar-(fslr)-stock-tanks-even-after-strong-earnings-200146222,200146222

119507,341022,FSLR,Why Shares Of SunPower Corp   SPWR  Aren t Shining Too Brightly Today,opinion,"Shares of SunPower Corporation   NASDAQ SPWR   were battered by 30  Wednesday after the company released its second quarter financial results before the markets opened 
The company reported a loss of 33 cents per share  worse than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents  Just last year the company reported earnings of 9 cents per share  Revenues came in higher than expected at  401 8 million  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  341 million by 17 8  and were 6 7  higher than revenues for Q2 last year 
SunPower Corp  also announced that it will be laying off 1 200 employees and take a restructuring charge between  30 million and  45 million  The company lowered its full year guidance for revenue as well  saying it now expects revenue between  2 8 billion and  3 0 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year revenue is currently  3 32 billion  The company also said it expects to lose up to  175 million in 2016  compared to its expectation in May that it d earn up to  50 million 
As a result of the earnings report and lowered outlook for the year  analysts at several banks changed their rating on SunPower s stock  along with lowering their price target  Credit Suisse   TO CS   cut its rating to  neutral  from  outperform   and slashed its price target to  12 from  32  In an analyst note CS said  The cuts are problematic in their own rights  but the bigger issue for the stock from here is management credibility and lack of apparent stability in their core business  
Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  also downgraded SPWR to  hold  from  buy   and cut its price target to  11 from  37 previously  JPMorgan   NYSE JPM    Avondale  and Janney Capital all also cut their ratings on the stock to the equivalent of a  hold   SunPower is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
First Solar   NASDAQ FSLR   was also weighed down by SunPower s drop Wednesday  as shares of the company were down around 6   Solar City was down less than a percent  despite a wider than expected quarterly loss in its earnings report  SunRun Inc    NASDAQ RUN   though too was down more than 4  
Bottom Line
As SunPower CEO Tom Werner put it   Certainly 2017 will be a difficult year in power plants  The power plant market is unlikely to improve in America in the next few quarters  It will in time   If he is right  which it seems like he likely is  those in the industry will likely continue to struggle both financially and in regards to their share prices during the rest of 2016 and well into next year  Only time will tell  but the solar industry may be one to just watch for now   rather than one to buy into until things are start to look up ",2016-08-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-shares-of-sunpower-corp.-(spwr)-aren't-shining-too-brightly-today-200147274,200147274
119508,341023,FSLR,Dark Clouds Over Solar ETFs Post Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Despite hailing in the top 38  of the Zacks Industry Ranks  solar ETFs are down this year by over 25   As a flight to safety was prevalent in the first half  the sectorpaid the price of its high beta high growth characteristics  read    

	Also  though not directly related  the oil market rout had a ripple effect on this alternative energy segment  The common misunderstanding was that consumers dumped solar power and opted for fossil fuels in the wake of an acute plunge in oil prices 

	Even positive developments like higher panel installations  a shift to fossil fuel free energy sources by most countries to protect the environment and the U S  tax credit extension could not help the sector in 1H 

	In such a situation  it is more important to look at how sector players are performing on earnings  A few industry primes including First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR    SunPower  and SolarCity  released their Q2 results this month 

	Let s dig into their earnings in detail below and see what impact the numbers left on solar ETFs 

SunPower reported adjusted loss of  0 33 per share  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  0 31  In the year ago quarter  the company had reported earnings of  0 09  On a GAAP basis  the company incurred a loss of  0 51 per share  In the year ago quarter  it had reported earnings of  0 04 

	During the quarter  SunPower generated revenues of  401 8 million  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  341 million by 17 8   Reported revenues also grew 6 7  from the year ago figure of  376 7 million 

	The solar panel maker  for the year and indicated that it would lay off about 1 200 jobs  which makes up about 15  of its workforce  The company also expressed concerns over  aggressive pricing by new market entrants  that did damage to SunPower s business  The stock plunged over 30  on August 10  post earnings release on August 9 after market close 

SolarCity  the largest U S  residential solar installer  posted an adjusted loss of  2 32 per share  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  2 43  However  the quarterly figure was much wider than the year ago loss of  1 61 per share 

	However  the company fared better on the revenue front with  185 8 million top line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  135 million  On a year over year basis  reported revenues surged 80 7  

	As stated by the company earlier  it expects to install 900 1 000 MW of rooftop solar panels in 2016  down from its prior guidance of 1 000 1 100 MW  The revision was due to lower bookings in the first half of the year 

	Following sluggish results after the closing bell on August 9  shares of SCTY dived 0 7  in the key trading session  The stock shed over 0 5  after hours 

First Solar the U S  solar manufacturer  reported strong Q2 results  on August 3 after market close  that surpassed our estimates on both the top and the bottom lines  Earnings per share of  0 87 strongly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 58 and were well ahead of the year ago earnings of  0 52  Revenues climbed 4 3  year over year to  934 4 millionand edged past our estimate of  904 million 

	First Solar reaffirmed its revenue guidance in the band of  3 8  4 billion  It raised the low end of the gross margin projection to the range of 18 5 19   18 19  guided earlier 

	However  the company lowered the GAAP operating income guidance to    300  370 million projected previously   GAAP full year earnings are now projected in the band of  3 65  3 90 per share   4 10  4 50 estimated previously   Non GAAP operating Income and non GAAP earnings guidance were  310  370 million and  4 20  4 50 

	Also  the company lowered the high end of its operating cash flow guidance to the  500  650 million band from  500  700 million expected earlier  The company reiterated its panel shipment projection of 2 9 3 0 GW

Commentary Art Cashin calls the Brexit bottom 

Tired of the Brexit headlines yet  This week is dedicated to Brexit fallout  The drama should become much less salient as the summer wears on and offers new dramas to captivate the market  For now  Brexit remains a hot topic relative to where it was during the massive run up into the referendum vote 
Over the last 2 days  search interest in Brexit has flattened out but remains higher than interest the day before the referendum 
The stabilization in Brexit interest could be considered a precursor of  turnaround Tuesday s  major relief rally  It was a picture perfect bounce form the  quasi  oversold conditions I described in the last T2108 Update  T2108 jumped from the edge of oversold territory  it got as low as 24 5   and closed at 35 2   the open of Monday s gap down 
The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   reversed all its losses from Monday with a 1 8  gain  Talk about a seesaw and a whiplash  Just like that  the S P 500 flipped from a bearish 200DMA breakdown to a bullish recovery which makes the 2000 level look like support and returns the 200DMA to support status 
The S P 500  SPY  flips the scrip with a major bounce from quasi oversold conditions 

Like the S P 500  the NASDAQ recovers its losses from Monday 
The volatility index  the VIX  took a MAJOR hit  The VIX continued its surprising decline from Monday  It turns out that contrasting weakness was likely the confirming signal that the market was ready to rally Tuesday  While the VIX remains above its 200DMA  it is once again below 20  the level of  elevated fear  
The volatility index  the VIX  suffers another big reversal 

ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  now looks like it is pivoting its way around its 50DMA downward 
With my trading bias firmly rooted in bearishness  this relief rally was just what the doctor ordered to deliver entry points for my list of short candidates  Granted  throughout the day I wondered whether I should instead hop aboard the bull train and assume that Monday s close encounter with oversold conditions delivered a classic wash out of panicked sellers 
A second day of high volume buying confirmed by changing conditions in the currency markets COULD convince me to make a play for a restest of 50DMA resistance  Regardless  my trading call stays at bearish given last week s sharp tumble form the edge of overbought territory  part of   
In the morning  I stuck to my trading plan and set several limit orders to buy put options at discounts from wherever they traded at the open  They all filled one by one throughout the trading day  Interestingly enough  my order for put options on ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO  triggered last 
For the day  I triggered the following bearish positions  short BHP Billiton Ltd  NYSE BHP  to complete the iron ore pairs trade and put options in Splunk Inc  NASDAQ SPLK   HSBC Holdings  LON HSBA  PLC  NYSE HSBC   doubled down on existing position   First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   and even Facebook  NASDAQ FB  
The Facebook puts actually went green for a bit  but I chose to hold on  per my lesson about locking in profits too quickly   I may have to return to flipping quickly out of positions if the market continues gyrating form day to day 

BHP rallies into 200DMA resistance and once again confirms the bottom of the current extended trading range 


Splunk  SPLK  gaps up above 200DMA resistance and rallies right to 50DMA resistance   volume surged 
HSBC gaps up and leaves behind a potential hammer bottom 


First Solar  FSLR  rallies into the top of its downtrend channel 


Facebook  FB  survived the  darling test   Buyers rushed in and defended support at filling the post earnings gap up  The stock is still sitting in a downward trending channel 
If you are bullish on the market  you can probably make a bullish case for many of these charts  The bear bull tug is likely to dominate trading for several weeks going forward 
I also launched a hedged position in Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc C  NASDAQ GOOG   If I were not bearish  I would look at GOOG s chart and declare a hammer bottom good for at least a rebound to converged resistance at the 50 and 200DMAs   similar to HSBC 
On an intraday basis  GOOG managed to lose almost all its gains from the initial gap up before rallying into the close  So  sellers may still have an edge in GOOG 
Alphabet gaps up and leaves behind a potential abandoned baby bottom that traps bears who over extended the hunt downward 
Although the market rallied big time  the Japanese yen did not decline nearly as much as I would have expected  This reluctance forms a minor caution flag for Wednesday  I took the opportunity to load up on more put options on Guggenheim CurrencyShares Japanese Yen  NYSE FXY  
Unfortunately  an implosion of volatility reduced the value of the positions I initiated in the wake of Friday s Brexit fall out  I still think shorting the yen is one of the best hedges against bearishness  there is on going potential for the Bank of Japan to intervene and weaken the yen  and it is hard to imagine stocks rallying much from here if the yen also holds firm 
CurrencyShares Japanese Yen ETF  NYSE FXY  barely budges in the face of turn around Tuesday 
On the bullish side  I bought Ciena Corp  NYSE CIEN  and Cyberark Software Ltd  NASDAQ CYBR  for what I thought made good setups for a rally day  Neither one closed far from its open  and CYBR attracted weak volumes  CIEN even briefly broke support 
Needless to say I was dismayed by these performances especially in light of the beating I took in a few outstanding bearish positions  I am holding both for at least one more day  maybe the rest of the week 


Ciena  CIEN  had to rally off its lows to hold onto 200DMA support for the day 


CyberArk  CYBR  faded from its highs even as the rest of the market rallied away 
I am hoping I had just a bit of bad luck in these choices and look to these stocks out performing during the next market rally day 
I am expecting analysts to trim earnings estimates given the incrementally cloudier outlook for the global economy  So far  nothing major  Indeed  Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  took the initiative by  and assuring investors that the company is ready to handle any Brexit related fallout 

 The Company regularly performs risk assessments as part of the operational planning cycle and has prepared for either outcome of the vote  In the past  the Company has utilized a variety of approaches to manage volatility  including financial hedging  The Company plans to execute a previously announced cost based price increase in the third quarter and expects to continue with strong ongoing cost productivity programs to lower overall costs in the EMEA region 
 As we have done in the past in all markets  we are prepared to take swift actions to offset the negative impact to our EMEA operations We will continue to monitor the situation closely to determine if additional actions may be required   

It was a great day for reassurances as WHR rode the wave to a 4 3  gain and closed just above 200DMA resistance  Still  the stock triggered one of my setups for a bearish trade 
I expect the stock to resume its sell off at some point  the stock gapped down in response to previous earnings and did not quite make it into the gap  I have also noted that WHR has set itself up for disappointing investors in a big way in future 2016 quarters  EMEA will not be the only market under pressure 
Whirlpool  WHR  rallied to reclaim 200DMA support 
In currency markets  the Australian dollar  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  NYSE FXA   is still caught in its downward trending channel versus the Japanese yen  FX   I will be watching this pair closely to gauge sentiment 

AUD JPY still warns of bearish tidings for financial markets

Deutsche Bank cut its rating to  hold  from  buy  and slashed its price target for the stock to  44 from  80  The firm blamed the downgrade on sluggish bookings  a likely upcoming pause in demand  and pricing pressure from competitors in international segments

119617,341132,FSLR,Alternative Energy Stock Outlook   May 2016,opinion,"Last year was historic for the U S  renewable energy sector  with a number of important decisions taken at both the state and federal levels  which will likely play a key role in determining the trajectory of this industry s future growth 
    Governments  businesses and cities around the world are making concerted efforts to speed up the evolution of energy use  As the global energy system transformation is the backbone of climate action  the world has come closer under a set of major cooperative initiatives  It is these environmental considerations that are driving demand for alternative energy sources 

     A U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   report projects that electricity generation from renewable sources will increase by 11 3  in 2016 and 4 4  in 2017 in the U S  Generation from renewables other than hydropower is forecast to grow by 13 3  in 2016 and by 8 6  in 2017  A more comprehensive study by the Department of Energy s National Renewable Energy Laboratory  NREL  shows that the country can generate most of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050 

    These favorable demand growth trends notwithstanding  the abundant availability of fossil fuels and the resultant drop in oil prices have emerged as key competitive challenges for the industry  The industry s long term fundamentals nevertheless remain favorable 

    Below we discuss some of the major alternative energy sources 

 Solar  

    A major growth area in the renewable space is solar energy  An EIA report indicates continued growth in utility scale solar power capacity  which is projected to average almost 13 gigawatt   GW   in the 2015 2017 period  In spite of the rapid uptake  solar will still be just 1 1  of total U S  utility scale generation in 2017  indicating room for immense growth 

    Solar growth has historically been concentrated in customer sited distributed generation installations  The EIA expects utility scale solar capacity to expand over states like California  Nevada  North Carolina  Texas and Georgia 

     Per the latest report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association   SEIA    the U S  trade association of approximately 1 000 companies in the solar energy industry  the U S  solar energy industry reached 7 260 megawatt   MW   DC in 2015  up 16  over 2014  This brought the cumulative PV installations to 25 6 GW DC  the largest annual total ever  buoyed by strong contributions from each of the three segments  utility  non residential and residential  In particular  the residential market grew 66  year over year in 2015  setting a yearly record 

    The SEIA expects the U S  PV market to witness strong growth in 2016 with installations reaching 16 GW DC  representing a staggering 119  increase over 2015 with utility scale installations accounting for 74  of the year s total installations Solar in China  Although Chinese economic woes continue to hit the market  the longer term prospects for solar in China remain intact  China has established itself as the world s largest market for solar panels and will likely be the home to a quarter of the planet s new energy capacity from solar panels in the years to come  China is speedily adding as much power generation as possible  and solar is just one source of the new energy generation coming up in the country 
    In Mar 2016  China released its 13th Five Year Plan that outlined considerable investment in the renewables sector  The country s National Energy Administration  NEA  announced plans to triple capacity over the next five years  to reduce China s carbon emissions and become the world s leader in clean energy  The nation is aiming for 143 GW of capacity by 2020 
    This rise was underlined in 2015  as China  with a 43 2 GW capacity  was ahead of the long time leader Germany  China also supplied 70  of the global output of solar panels in 2015  producing an astounding 43 GW  While outlining its clean energy goals for 2016  the NEA has set a target of 15 GW of new solar PV capacity 
    China had earlier pledged to attain peak carbon emissions by 2030 or earlier if possible  The country had set a daunting target of boosting the share of non fossil fuels to 20  of its energy mix by 2030 

     The following leading Chinese solar stocks are sure to make the most of the favorable government stimulus  JinkoSolar Holding Co   Ltd      JA Solar Holdings  Inc     and Trina Solar Ltd     

     Ontario  Canada based solar product manufacturer Canadian Solar Inc     is also well positioned with its diversified manufacturing base and project portfolio in Canada  China  Japan and the U S 

Wind  

    The American Wind Energy Association   AWEA   reported that the U S  wind industry installed 520 MW during the first quarter of 2016  This is the strongest ever quarter since 2012 bringing the installed wind capacity to 74 512 MW  Wind capacity of over 10 100 MW is currently under construction following the five year extension of the Production Tax Credit  PTC  in Dec 2015 
     As per the EIA  wind capacity grew by 12  in 2015 and it is expected to increase by 9  in 2016 and 10  in 2017 

     The AWEA noted that wind power added more capacity than any other energy source  leading the country with 41  of all new electric generating capacity in 2015  followed by solar at 28 5  and natural gas at 28 1   

 Zacks Industry Rank   Mixed Outlook

     We rank all the 257 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit   

     The way to look at the complete list of 257  industries is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower  is positive  the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  177 and higher  is negative 

     Within the Zacks Industry classification  the Zacks Industry Rank for Solar is  104 out of 257  This corresponds to the middle third of the list  implying a neutral outlook 

     The Zacks Industry Rank for the Other Alternative industry is  100 out of 257  This puts the industry once again in the middle third of all industries 

     The recent losses suffered by some of the fundamentally strong solar stocks can be good buying opportunities for investors with a longer term horizon  The U S  solar market continues to grow with 2015 being the biggest year yet in the solar history  per the SEIA 

     Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks  which is at the core of our Industry Outlook  has an impressive track record going back years  verified by outside auditors  to foretell stock prices  particularly over the short term  1 to 3 months  
    While JinkoSolar Holding holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Yingli Green Energy Holding Co  Ltd      Gevo  Inc     and Ormat Technologies  Inc     hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  

     We remain apprehensive of the Zacks Ranked  4  Sell  stocks Enphase Energy  Inc      SunPower Corp     and FuelCell Energy Inc     EARNINGS TRENDS

    As far as the overall results of the alternative energy industry were concerned  the first quarter of 2016 has been quite mixed so far  It has become even more apparent that although the long term growth story that could change energy is quite solid  the companies responsible for change don t always have a straight path to success 
    As in the case of First Solar Inc  NASDAQ FSLR       the company s first quarter earnings were a reversal of the prior year loss  reflecting higher sales  gross profits  operating income and lower expenses  Yet  the shares dropped surprisingly following the release 
    Then again  Canadian Solar s    first quarter 2016 results exceeded expectations in terms of both revenues and earnings  Solar module shipments for the quarter also surpassed the company s expectations  Consequently  the company raised its full year revenue expectation in anticipation of higher sales of solar plants in the second half of the year 
    Meanwhile  SolarCity Corp      the largest U S  rooftop solar installer  posted a much wider than expected first quarter loss  This can be attributed to the company s rising expenses  Yet  its revenues soared 81 6  year over year and installations were impressive for the quarter  SolarCity shares have depreciated more than 60  year to date 
    SunPower reported weak first quarter results wherein it reported a wider than expected loss  Its gross margin contracted 690 basis points while operating expenses surged over 28   That said  growth in residential and commercial markets continues to gain momentum 
    We expect solar companies to witness impressive growth this year with more emphasis on installations  The companies seem to be channeling most of their revenues into installations backed by the solar and wind tax credit extensions

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  0 91 on  930 07 million in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  21 million below on the top
First Solar is leaps and bounds ahead of its peers from a financial perspective  who continue to turn losses quarter after quarter
The Solar Industry has hit a rocky patch lately but should make some decent strides this year as oil prices are on the rise
What are you expecting for  
The past handful of years have been nothing short of a roller coaster for the solar industry  All the strides to promote solar energy and make it more accessible has not translated to financial success  First Solar has been the true anomaly and is coming off three consecutive quarters of beating on both the top and bottom line  The company has continues to outperform the rest of the solar industry with an effective business model  sound strategy and of course  good earnings 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  0 91 on  930 07 million in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  21 million below on the top  Since its last report  per share estimates have increased 63  with revenue up an additional 5   By comparison  profits are expected to increase 2 5 times while sales are looking to almost double  It s not surprising that the stock tends to move leading up and through earnings season  On average  shares increase as much as 7  30 days ahead of earnings and slowly taper off to 2  in the 5 days following results  Overall though  the stock has been on a slide and is now down 20  on the past 12 months 

First Solar continues to make impressive strides compared to some of its peers including SolarCity Corporation  NASDAQ SCTY  and Sunedison Inc  NYSE SUNE   From a financial perspective  First Solar is one of the few solar companies that hasn t consistently posted a loss  As a result the stock hasn t been hit as hard as the above companies  whose shares are down almost 50  since this time last year  Solar power is likely to get a second chance this year as oil and energy prices continue to climb  This should benefit First Solar as it aggressively pursues projects in emerging markets like India and South Africa  Meanwhile  First Solar s superior balance sheet and a healthy backlog has bolstered its competitive advantage

First Solar  Weekly
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the last week of January saw equity markets which seemed to have found some footing but still having to prove themselves 
Elsewhere looked for gold to move higher in its downtrend while crude oil bounced and will show us if it wants a reversal  The US dollar index was on the edge of a break out higher while US Treasuries were biased lower short term in the move higher  The Shanghai Composite was consolidating in the downtrend while Emerging Markets paused in their move lower 
Volatility looked to remain elevated but drifting lower keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETFs N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  but loosening the vice grip  The ETFs themselves all looked to continue the bounce in their downtrends with some work left to show that the worst is over  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

119680,341195,FSLR,3 Stocks To Watch  ABX  AU  PRMW,opinion,"It was a good day on Wall Street on Tuesday  They did have a follow through rally  closing with a strong  solid session  Since we have a lot of stocks to go over  let s just jump into it and look at both longs and shorts here 
Barrick Gold Corporation  N ABX  is one of the stocks in the gold sector that is acting well  The long term chart shows this stock moving down on the weekly charts ever since it was in the 60s in 2011  It had a massive drop  five waves down  and now the potential turnaround  good action in the last couple days  and a volume of over well over 100 million shares traded in just the last four sessions  On Tuesday it was up 26 cents to 9 29  or 2 8   on 28 5 million shares and has moved up toward the declining topsline  Watch the level between the 10 10 1 2 area  If it gets through that  then it will be a much more substantial move 
AngloGold Ashanti Ltd   N AU   a South African mining company  dropped from the mid 50s down to the 5 1 2 range  a very long drop  over the course of four years  However  it appears that the declining topsline over the last year and a half  or so  got pierced on Tuesday with a breakaway gap  Targets going forward are in the 10 dollar range and then just under 12 
Primo Water Corporation  O PRMW  is a standout stock  In the last couple years this stock has had a phenomenal run  going from under a dollar to nearly ten  a ten fold increase  After a recent run up  it consolidated nicely  and on Tuesday  it was up 56 cents to 9 28  or 6 4   on 330 600  It may very well move higher  and if it does the target is up near 12 00

119681,341196,FSLR,4 Stocks To Watch  FSLR  PLAB  SEDG  XON,opinion,"The 1st of the month and it started off with an interesting day  Although the indices opened lower  the market turned around quickly  despite the fact that oil did not  It s a good sign  I think the markets are being affected by earnings  Let s go over some of the stocks that acted well and made important moves on Monday 
First Solar  Inc   O FSLR   the leader in the soar group  broke through resistance on Monday  up 47 cents to 69 13  on 1 9 million shares  The fact that it broke through indicates that it may test the multi year highs at 71 72  and the secondary target is in the high 70s  near 80 
Photronics Inc   O PLAB  had an interesting day on Monday  up 34 cents to 12 28  or 2 85   on 1 8 million shares  It looks like it wants to try to break out  Watch it on Tuesday at 12 40  because if it does  we may see 13  and then we re off to the races toward 15 
SolarEdge Technologies  Inc   O SEDG   one of our favorite solar stocks  up 30 cents to 28 57  or 1   on 873 800 shares traded on Monday  and ran right up against resistance  If it should take that out  and then 30  If it does  it has a real shot at being a 33  35  and as much as low 40s stock at some point  It has leg 1 and 2 up  and leg 3 is well on its way  It has 3 days to cover 
Intrexon Corporation  N XON  is acting very well  It has a nice surge  a pullback on low volume  and a surge again on big volume  On Monday  it was up 2 43 to 31 57  or 8 3   on 3 6 million shares  If it gets up through 31 57  the range we re looking at is 33 3 4 33 90  and then we re looking at a 40 43 dollar stock

119682,341197,FSLR,3 Stocks To Watch  MXL  PRMW  SWFT,opinion,"The market had a very interesting  but very negative morning  and a very nice  late rally on Tuesday  Does it mean anything  Verdict is still out on that one  but we ll see if they get a follow through  There were a lot of stocks that acted positively  So  we re going to go over some longs  and some shorts that got blasted  although  at this point  there may be some stocks that are over extended to the downside  so there s a need for some kind of backing and filling  or challenging overhead resistance  etc 
MaxLinear  Inc   N MXL  had a nice snapback on Tuesday  up 1 05 to 14 62  or 7 7   on 2 9 million shares  We ve been liking this stock all along  It has four legs up with a 3 wave corrective move  and could get as high as the low 20  But first  before it gets there  it has to take out 16 20  On Tuesday  it only got up to the 50 day moving average  and did back off  It wasn t a great close  but still up on the day  The volume was the best since Nov  So if it begins to move  it may reach 18ish  That s the target 
Primo Water Corporation  O PRMW  has been phenomenal for three years  This stock has moved from under a dollar to 10 dollars  a ten fold increase  and has consolidated now for four months  This base constitutes a good move  Tuesday s action of a pop of 64 cents to 8 82  or 7 8   on 131 100 shares traded  It does need better volume  The target is 9 60 5  and when it gets through that  it could go all the way up to 12 1 2 13 
Swift Transportation Company  N SWFT  had a pretty good day on Tuesday  up 69 cents to 17 26  or 4   on 3 9 million shares  The transportation sector  trucking  railroads  airlines  etc  are really picking it up  and could lead the market higher  Swift has gone from 11 3 4 up into the 16 17 zone and consolidated  If it gets through the 17 3 4 range  it should see 20 1 2 21  and maybe as high as 24 5  Those are the targets on Swift going forward  I like the way it looks  It may end up being a swing trade

119687,341202,FSLR,Power Up Your Investment Portfolio With Solar Energy ,opinion,"For years I have been researching clean energy investments in Lithium ion batteries  nuclear  rare earths and renewables  However  I haven t made a solar investment in years until a few months ago  Over the years  I have been a skeptic on solar as I felt the cell technology was not yet advanced to be competitive economically 
This past year may have been a turning point in solar investments  and the coming 3 5 years could see exceptional growth  especially with the advancement in the Lithium ion battery and power storage  Solar should continue growing while natural gas and coal go extinct like the dinosaurs  California  Arizona and Nevada are definitely leaders in increasing solar capacity  Hopefully my home state of sunny Florida will increase its usage 
A lot of the growth depends on tax credits  which I believe should be supported to wean ourselves off of dirty fossil fuels  The growth of solar is increasing while costs are coming down  I believe strongly that solar will play an increasing role in our future  similar to the growth in Lithium ion batteries  Investors can look at First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  which technically looks like its in a uptrend  First Solar has developed  financed  engineered  constructed  and is operating some of the world s largest and most successful PV power plants in existence 
First Solar is around a  70 stock  so it may be more suitable for conservative investors  However  if you are looking for potential outsized gains you should look at Natcore Technology  OTC NTCXF   which is my first solar investment in many years  The company just got engaged to build a solar facility in Belize  Their research team is working long hours to improve the efficiencies of their patented cells  If this goal is reached  Natcore could partner with manufacturers  as Natcore has a unique product which could be quite exciting for the solar industry 
Natcore has created a solar cell with lasers that eliminates the need for silver and high temperature furnaces  This could bring dramatic cost savings to the industry  Natcore could be on a path to produce the highest efficiency solar cells in history  at the lowest cost 
For many months I have been highlighting the increased investment interest in the clean energy space  There is increasing interest to fund developments in renewables  especially solar technology 
The problem with solar cells is that they need to be made cheaper and have greater output to become more economically viable  Natcore Technology has 59 patents relating to their nanotechnology research  which is focused on improving efficiency and output of solar cells 
According to Natcore s   two of Natcore s technologies for solar cells are close to commercialization  Natcore s technology is quite exciting  as it uses a proprietary process that replaces silver with aluminum  Silver is an expensive component of solar cells 
Solar cell manufacturers are desperate for technology that could improve efficiencies at a lower cost to have a competitive advantage  Natcore could be a situation that gets it noticed by some larger manufacturers who could become strategic partners 
Some important news developments have taken place recently which may be worthy of a rerating and a breakout  as they were selected to develop a solar plant in Belize and they announced commercial efficiency levels that could make them very attractive to a manufacturer 
1  
Brent Borland  Managing Director of Catalyst565 said   Natcore was selected because of the acknowledged expertise of its solar scientists and engineers  
2  
 We have reached performance goals that make us ready to present our case to large manufacturers whose scale and resources can help us reach the ultimate  ultra high efficiency potential that our cells are capable of   said Chuck Provini  President and CEO of Natcore 

The chart looks excellent as the moving average is making a bullish golden crossover  Look for a weekly breakout at   65  From a technical point of view  a confirmed breakout could lead to a measured move to   95 
Disclosure  I own Natcore and the company is a website sponsor of mine  so please do your own due diligence as I have a conflict of interest and could benefit if the share price rises ",2016-03-31,Jeb Handwerger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/power-up-your-investment-portfolio-with-solar-energy-200123422,200123422
119714,341229,FSLR,The Sun Is Shining On 1st Solar,opinion,"First Solar  O FSLR  had a rapid rise from the bottom in 2012  By early 2014 it was trading 6 times higher than that low  But since then it has not done much  moving in a broad range around a midpoint at about 55  That happens to be about where it is now 
But as it sits there the short term prospects are looking bright  The latest iteration in the range saw a pullback to 40 and now a rounded bottom in the price and all the SMA s  Rising out of it  the price broke above falling trend resistance in late October  After a 5 day march higher it pulled back to retest that prior resistance  now acting as support  With a bounce last week it looks like a buy opportunity to at least the top of the range at 64 

The Measured Move takes the stock to 63 and there is now a natural stop at 52 50  Risk  2 50 to make  8  a pretty good reward to risk ratio  The momentum indicators are supporting the continuation to the upside  The RSI is rising and made a Positive RSI Reversal  that targets 63 as well  The MACD is leveling after a fall

119715,341230,FSLR,3 Reasons First Solar  Inc Is A Great Bet,opinion,"There is a strong demand for solar power not only in the United States but also in the developing markets  Being one of the biggest solar companies  First Solar  Inc   NASDAQ O FSLR  is well placed to take advantage of the available opportunities  The company issued its outlook for the next year that was well in line with the Street analysts  expectations  However  some analysts appeared to have expected much more than the company s forecast  and that resulted in hammering the stock  Still  analysts  are upbeat and failed to understand the need to dump the stock after the company s guidance  It was an unfortunate thing that some solar energy shares have to bear the brunt of investors  ire even for slight differences in expectations  Let s look at some of the reasons to believe that this is a good stock to bet for long term 
Strong Bookings
In the current year  demand for solar power would reach 8 5 Giga watts in the United States  That would increase nearly 30  to 11 GWs in the next year  As a leader  First Solar  Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  stands to gain from the expected growth in demand  The optimism for such a strong growth was the result of the federal tax credit that consumers can take advantage of since 30  of the systems  costs were paid as a tax credit  Also  the tax credit would come to an end in the year 2017 for most of the solar panel systems  In the following years  it would drop down to 10  for commercial installations 
At the end of the third quarter  First Solar  Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  indicated that it was able to record 1 7 GW of fresh bookings and that the annual bookings reached 3 1 GW  The company is also planning to close the current year with a minimum shipment of 2 8GW and a maximum of 2 9GW  For the next year  the solar panel maker is projecting a modest  of 3 5  only to 2 9   3 0 GW shipments  That was more due to the company coming under pressure due to the expiry of tax credits in the following year  Therefore  the next year would be a crucial factor for any solar firm  The company enjoys nearly 90  of the utilization rate  Backed by its strong balance sheet  the solar panel maker might boost its guidance for next year since it has the capacity to spend more for growth prospects 
Higher Quality Growth
One of the factors that would help First Solar  Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  was the high quality growth as it was key to  in the solar power industry  Currently  the company appeared to have given a more conservative outlook in respect of the shipments  In fact  that was one of the reasons the stock was hammered recently  There are some companies that provide conservative guidance to be boosted as the year progresses  Solar panels seem to be one such opportunity to grow more than the company estimated currently  It all depends on how the company will close the current year 
If First Solar  Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  managed to ship about 2 9GW in the current year itself  then it can boost its forecast when it announces its fourth quarter results  Analysts have hopes that the company would resort to lifting its outlook from the current levels  Another factor was the average fleet conversion efficiency  The company was consistent in enhancing its efficiency level  In the year 2013  it was 13 2  and this is set to reach 15 5  in the current year and projected to grow to 16 2  in the next year  Aside from that  the company sees its lead line efficiency to be higher than 17  before the next year ends 
Analysts  Remain Upbeat
When First Solar  Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  announced its outlook for the year 2016  investors punished the stock by as much as 10  as it fell short of some of the predictions  However  there are several analysts who were not worried about it and reiterated their positive outlook for the company s  as well as  the industry  They  the possible mix of upcoming projects  as well as  the potential belief that the initial outlook might get a boost as the year progresses  For instance  Janney Montgomery analyst  Michael Gaugler  reaffirmed his rating of  Buy  on the shares of company suggesting that boosting of outlook would not surprise him  In fact  the company s guidance exceeded its estimations and recommended his clients that the pullback only offered buying opportunities 
Also  Stifel Nicolaus analyst  Sven Eenmaa  said that First Solar  Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  s current guidance was  somewhat conservative   He also reiterated his rating of  Buy  pointing out that the forecast might be increased once the company starts getting money from several projects  The analyst also believes that the company was well placed within the industry since it has a number of project wins  However  Stifel has slashed its price objective to  78 from  81 while JPMorgan Chase   Co  maintained its rating of Overweight on the company s shares though it also reduced its price tag to  62 from 64  Credit Suisse has a price target of  65 
Three Reasons To Be Attractive
Investors can place their bet on First Solar  Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  shares for three reasons  One is their leadership position with solid utilization rate  The second reason is the solid demand coming in the next year before the expiry of the tax credits  The third was that the recent dumping of shares could well be a buying opportunity as the company is likely to increase its forecast next year  Most of the analysts retained their rating though the price tag was slashed  That was to give effect to the changed EPS estimations  Once the company revises its projection  the price tag would be boosted 
Conclusion
First Solar  Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  shares could see upside rewards due to the factors mentioned above  The company could also expand its presence beyond the United States as the demand for solar panels is solid throughout the globe  Currently  the company enjoys high quality growth and would continue to maintain it

119739,341254,FSLR,Bullish On Europe  China  HK  Plus Notes On Solar Power And Grid Parity,opinion,"A few months ago we wrote a note outlining the rapidly dropping cost of solar power generation  and observing that it was on track to reach  grid parity  in many locations even without government subsidy   Grid parity simply means the point at which solar will cost the same to ratepayers as electricity from conventional generation   The reason is clear  falling prices for photovoltaic cells and battery storage  driven by technological improvements 
A recent report from the Rocky Mountain Institute analyzed when grid parity will arrive for various markets    both for residential  i e   rooftop  solar and for commercial solar generation  Such projections need to model a variety of scenarios  since we don t know how rapid technological improvement will be  Typically  parity arrives sooner for commercial scale solar than for residential    For commercial solar  the approach of grid parity in several representative regional U S  markets looks like this 


Source  Rocky Mountain Institute
Hawaii is already at grid parity  Under a scenario which includes accelerated technological improvements  and demand side improvements including efficiency gains  commercial scale solar will reach grid parity in New York state in 2019  in Los Angeles in 2020  in Louisville in 2026  and in San Antonio in 2027 
What this tells us is that solar will soon be in the process of passing from a volatile  high growth industry  and settle down into something that more resembles the staid  income producing world of utilities  We have already seen this as solar companies dealing with a glut of PV panels has set up income generating yieldcos to hold their generating assets   
Investment implications
Ironically  the arrival of grid parity may presage not the out performance of solar  but its maturation from growth to income  This does not mean that solar  and potentially other renewables  will not be attractive investments  but that they will find more of a place in income oriented rather than than growth oriented portfolios 
Some solar technology companies have already begun spinning their generation assets out into yieldcos    Sunedison  NYSE SUNE  has spun out TerraForm Power  NASDAQ TERP   SunPower  NASDAQ SPWR  and First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  are both mooting the creation of yieldcos  NRG Energy   NYSE NRG  has spun out a yieldco  NRG Yield  NYSE NYLD  that has both renewable and conventional generating assets  Investors should perform due diligence when considering these companies  the accounting is complex  and performance will be heavily influenced by the regulatory and interest rate environments 
Market Summary
We remain bullish on Europe  where QE and a lower euro are improving corporate profits  exports  and employment  We suggest that investors add to positions at times when Greek news frightens the market 
We remain bullish on China and Hong Kong  as we ve mentioned previously 
India s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a long and difficult struggle ahead of him  as he pursues India s development by trying to encourage manufacturing and foreign direct investment  We read this week about very disappointing actions being taken by India s government to raise tax demands on foreign investors  even worse  the demands may be retroactive for previous years    a practice we had hoped was over in India  While we remain bullish on India s long term prospects  we are watching the progress of Modi s reforms carefully  and will adjust our exposure to Indian markets according to the policy climate we see developing    In our view  Japan continues to be a source of investment opportunity as QE continues and the yen falls  creating rising corporate profits and stock market appreciation    The U S  market is struggling with its old highs  and the question is whether it will break out  We anticipate modest appreciation in the U S  this year  and we own stocks in sectors that are undervalued  Overall  U S  stocks are fairly valued  with some sectors underpriced and others overpriced    We believe that the U S  dollar will continue to rise in coming months  so we are careful to hedge out currency risk when we buy foreign stocks   Gold continues in a trading range  but gold companies are rationalizing operations  cutting costs and mining higher grade areas  As a result  we believe that quality gold mining companies are a better investment than gold futures at this time  Copper is in short supply and world prices are rising ",2015-04-19,Monty Guild,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-note-on-solar-power-and-grid-parity-248887,248887
119740,341255,FSLR,Finally  Consistent Income From Renewable Energy,opinion,"Once upon a time  renewable energy investing was the domain of growth oriented investors  Only those who could handle the industry s stomach churning ups and downs took part 
Today  that s no longer the case 
Conservative investors can now get a piece of the industry  and its growth  through a relatively new class of income producing securities called  yieldcos  
The very first yieldco  NRG Yield  NYSE NYLD   came into being in July 2013  Just two years later  there are more than 20 yieldcos to choose from   and there s even a yieldco ETF yielding close to 3  
What Are Yieldcos 
According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory  a yieldco is a dividend growth oriented public company  created by a parent company  that bundles renewable and or conventional long term contracted operating assets in order to generate predictable cash flows 
Typically  the assets are already producing and providing electricity to customers under long term contracts  Because of their length   contracts can last as long as 30 years   they offer predictable income  Plus  power projects still under development remain in the parent company  not in the yieldco 
There s also a growth component to yieldcos  As they acquire more assets  they ll be able to increase payouts  The acquisition of more power generating assets is funded with monies not distributed to shareholders 
Finally  yieldcos are subject to corporate taxes   but keep in mind that most renewable energy projects don t generate taxable income for many years  Thus  distributions can effectively be considered nontaxable returns of capital to shareholders 
How to Choose a Yieldco
If you wish to purchase an individual yieldco  you should first look to see if there s a strong pipeline of renewable power projects at the parent company  These projects will be the driver of future payout growth 
Next  see if the yieldco has the right of first refusal on projects from the parent  And  perhaps most importantly  determine at what price the yieldco is buying assets from the parent  This is key  since the more money a yieldco pays for assets  the less it has available to distribute to shareholders 
Finally  it s worth seeing whether the yieldco is branching out geographically or technologically  Here are two examples of what I mean 
Sunedison  NYSE SUNE  has already spun out a very successful yieldco  TerraForm Power  NASDAQ TERP   The stock is up 28  year to date  thanks largely to its growth strategy  Now  SunEdison says it will spin off a second yieldco with its emerging market assets 
Another successful yieldco  Abengoa Yield  NASDAQ ABY   came from Spain s Abengoa  NASDAQ ABGB  and is up over 18  year to date  It already has assets in North America  South America  and Europe  and in February announced the purchase of two desalination plants in Algeria 
Another Option  Yieldcos Exchange Traded Fund  ETF 
If you don t want to do all the homework necessary to choose an individual yieldco  there s a great alternative  Global X YieldCo Index ETF  YLCO   a new ETF that came to market in May  Its portfolio consists of 20 securities  with TerraForm Power the top holding at 12 4  
Why only 20 stocks  Because there are still a very limited number of yieldcos listed here in the United States  with another few in London  But this ETF s universe will expand soon with yieldco IPOs coming from First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   SunPower Corporation  NASDAQ SPWR  and others 
The Future Looks Sunny
There s a lot to like about yieldcos  but investors should be aware of a few potential pitfalls 
First  higher interest rates could negatively affect yieldcos  as they will most income instruments  Secondly  yieldcos have built in assumptions about steadily rising electricity prices  If renewable energy is so successful that electricity prices actually drop  that would obviously have a negative impact 
However  that s a very long range concern  and the future looks bright for yieldcos right now 
According to the International Energy Agency  IEA   clean energy will account for 25  of global production in 2018  In 2011  that figure was just 20  
Meanwhile  yieldcos have quickly become a godsend for the industry itself  which had trouble raising funds in the past but now has access to newer and cheaper capital  With renewable energy continuing to ramp up globally  yieldcos should remain the hottest trend in energy finance

119741,341256,FSLR,Commodities Across Board Fall  ASE Has Ugly Reopen,opinion,"Dow   91   17 598SPX   5   2098NAS   12   511510 YR YLD    05   2 15 OIL   1 95   45 17GOLD   9 10   1087 10SILV    30   14 59
This is going to be an extremely busy week  We still have a third of S P 500 companies to report earnings  There s also going to be a plethora of economic activity culminating in the Friday jobs report for July  Oil prices hit a six month low  It s not just oil  Commodities prices across the board are falling thanks to slowing global demand and a rising dollar  All of this makes it very unlikely we ll see a big pickup in inflation any time soon 
The Athens Stock Exchange reopened today and it was ugly  The ASE Stock Index dropped 23  after being closed for five weeks  with banking shares down by as much as 30   The index managed to recover from session lows  but still closed down 16   While local traders are able to buy stocks  bonds  derivatives and warrants under certain conditions  international investors don t face any restrictions  as long as they were active in the markets before they were shuttered 
The selloff shows the scale of the crisis still facing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras as he negotiates a third bailout with creditors after six months that have put unprecedented strain on the Greek economy and its financial system 
As expected  Puerto Rico missed a  58 million debt payment due over the weekend  Because the deadline was Saturday  the PFC technically has until the end of Tuesday to make its missed payment  but it appears unlikely to make a difference  Puerto Rico does not have the money to pay  Puerto Rico faces a grim future  It s operating with a  703 million budget deficit for the fiscal year that began last month  And the commonwealth faces  635 million in debt service payments this month  Many investors are already focusing on broader questions around how Puerto Rico will restructure its  72 billion in debt  what kind of a  haircut  bondholders will need to take and what reverberations will spread to the U S  municipal bond market 
A default is imminent and it will be the largest government debt restructuring in US history  and maybe the messiest  Puerto Rico s indebted central government  municipalities and public corporations cannot file for bankruptcy protection without the OK of the U S  Congress  which leaves them at the mercy of what could be hundreds of lawsuits filed by creditors  Without a referee in the form of a bankruptcy court  it s going to be a mess 
Over the years  mutual fund managers have had an incentive to buy Puerto Rican bonds  because their returns are tax free  And many well known mutual funds have significant exposure to Puerto Rico  including Oppenheimer  NYSE OPY   Franklin  Eaton Vance  NYSE EV   and others  So on one side you have Main Street America  Mom and Pop investors who may or may not have known what they were buying in those mutual funds  On the other side you have Puerto Rican citizens  facing severe cutbacks and added costs for everything from driving on their roads to healthcare  Meanwhile  hedge funds have been swooping in like vultures on a carcass  buying bonds at steep discounts and hoping to force repayment through the courts  The hedge funds issued a report demanding huge budget cuts and privatization  even that is unlikely to get the island out of debt 
Chinese regulators restricted short selling of stocks  freezing out day traders  in their latest step aimed at stabilizing the world s second largest equity market  Investors who borrow shares must now wait one day to pay back the loans  This prevents investors from selling and buying back stocks on the same day  Under the old T 0 rule  you could go short in the morning and cover your shorts before market close the same day and lock in your profit  if your bet is right  Now with T 1  you can t cover your short position in the same day  and have to wait till next day at the earliest  That makes shorting a much more risky venture 
Pacific Rim trade officials failed to clinch a final deal for the Trans Pacific Partnership on Friday following several days of intense talks in Hawaii  Key sticking points  Auto trade between Japan and North America  New Zealand s dairy exports and monopoly periods for next generation drugs  The deadlock may also sink U S  led plans  which aimed to finalize the trade deal by the end of 2015 
President Barack Obama has officially revealed a finalized version of a plan to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that power plants across the country can emit  Obama called the plan  the single most important step that America has ever taken in the fight against climate change   Adding that  there is such a thing as being too late on climate change  
While US power plants have limits on other air born pollutants   like nitrogen and sulfur oxides that cause acid rain   there haven t been limits  until now  on the levels of carbon dioxide emissions that power plants can emit  Power plants that burn fossil fuels  both coal and natural gas  emit carbon dioxide and in turn these greenhouse gases contribute significantly to the warming of the planet 
The Obama administration has turned to the Environmental Protection Agency to use the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from the power industry through the Clean Power Plan  The White House has used the EPA because politically a national carbon emissions reduction plan wouldn t be able to pass through Congress 
States will be allowed to create their own plans to meet the requirements and will have to submit initial versions of their plans by 2016 and final versions by 2018  The most aggressive of the regulations requires that by 2030  the nation s existing power plants must cut emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels  which is an increase from the 30 percent target proposed in the draft regulation  Electric power generation from coal and natural gas plants is responsible for 40  of U S  carbon emissions 
Clearly  the clean power industries  including solar  wind and even smaller sectors like geothermal  will benefit greatly from the plan  States that opt to meet their requirements by investing in clean power projects could be a major boon to these technologies  Solar and wind project developers include SunPower  NASDAQ SPWR   First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   NRG Energy  NYSE NRG   and SunEdison  NYSE SUNE   The natural gas industry will also be a major beneficiary of the plan  The coal industry  of course  is one of the major losers in the plan  One of the leading and most economical ways to reduce carbon emissions from coal plants is to simply shut them down  particularly aging plants  At least one fifth of the coal plants in the U S  have been closed  or are in the process of closing 
The Obama administration says the plan could lead to  30 percent more renewable energy generation in 2030  and  create tens of thousands of jobs   Consumers will collectively be able to save   155 billion from 2020 2030  on energy bills  and  85 a year on an individual energy bill by 2030 
The Institute for Supply Management s manufacturing index fell to 52 7  in July from 53 5  in June  Readings greater than 50 indicate expansion  ISM reported that 11 out of 18 industries reported growth with five reported contractions  The group s employment measure declined from a month earlier and order backlogs slumped  And for some reason  the data was released just a bit earlier than the scheduled 7 00 AM time 
Spending on U S  construction projects rose just 0 1  in June  well below forecast  Spending advanced 0 4  for new houses  condos  apartment buildings and other residential properties  Outlays on nonresidential and commercial projects was flat 
Consumer spending edged up 0 2 percent in June  the poorest showing since a similar increase in February  and the government revised the spending gain in May to 0 7  from 0 9  The largest drop in spending involved big ticket items such as new cars and trucks  according to the Commerce Department  now a quick note here  we also had a report from the car companies saying auto sales were strong in July   more on that in a moment  Even as spending tapered off  incomes continued to rise steadily  Personal income climbed 0 4  in June for the third straight month 
U S  auto sales were stronger than expected in July and kept the industry on pace for its best performance since the turn of the century  Auto sales rose 5 3 percent to 1 51 million vehicles  above the 3 percent rise expected by analysts  according to Autodata Corp  The figures translate to an annualized sales rate for July of 17 55 million vehicles and keeps the auto industry on a pace for its best year since 2000  High margin pickup trucks helped sales of the two market leaders  NYSE GM and Ford  NYSE F   GM had record sales of the Colorado pickup  Ford s F Series sales alone topped those of all Ford and Lincoln brand sedans 
Alpha Natural Resources  NYSE ANR  has filed for bankruptcy in Virginia  The second largest US coal company has lost almost all its market value since 2011  when it bought Massey Energy Co  for about  7 billion  The deal made it the biggest U S  producer of metallurgical coal  used in steelmaking  it also saddled the company with debt  right before prices began their plunge 
Former UBS and Citigroup  NYSE C  trader Tom Hayes  the first person to stand trial for manipulating Libor  was found guilty of eight counts of conspiracy to rig the benchmark rate  Hayes has been sentenced to 14 years  Jurors in London found that Hayes conspired with traders and brokers to manipulate the London interbank offered rate to benefit his own trading positions  After initially cooperating and being admitted into a whistle blower program  Hayes had a change of heart and pleaded not guilty  Throughout the trial  Hayes insisted his managers at UBS and Citigroup had known of his attempts to manipulate Libor and at no point told him he was doing anything wrong  Apparently the defense of  everybody else was doing it  too  is not a particularly strong defense  Now it will be interesting to see if prosecutors will go back and revisit Hayes  earlier claims that rate rigging was systemic  Having followed the trial  it is hard to imagine Hayes was a mastermind ",2015-08-04,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cleaning-up-260421,260421

119743,341258,FSLR,4 Stocks To Watch  CHUY  EFOI  KITE  XXIA,opinion,"The market started off with a bang on Wednesday and ended with a flitter  basically closing mixed after a massive gap run  looking like it was going to be a big day  but it sure took it back in the afternoon  Not necessarily a bad thing  but we ve got some pretty critical areas to break out through and hold support above  For now  let s take a look at some longs that did well on Wednesday 
Chuys Holdings Inc  NASDAQ CHUY   the restaurant chain  had a 5 wave decline  taking it into Dec  it began another move up in Jan  going from about 18 1 2 to 28 00 before Wednesday  when it gapped up and ran 6 39 to 14 22  or 23   on 2 8 million shares  More importantly  not only did it go through the top of the channel and lateral price resistance  but through secondary resistance  It looks like it may make an attempt to test the 36 1 2 range  potentially as early as Thursday  and then 42 43 is the next target 
Energy Focus Inc  NASDAQ EFOI  had a very nice move on Wednesday  up 4 01 to 13 39  or 43   on 681 200 shares traded  This stock had a big drop that lasted for several years  then in 2013 it formed a nice rising channel  It s at a key level right now because recently it had resistance in this level  although it did get above it  Technicals held during the pullback and the 50 day  On Wednesday  it exploded off the channel bottom with a breakaway gap  ran through resistance and the top of the channel  and it may very well be on its way up towards 20 1 2 21  but let s start with a target of about 16 
Kite Pharma  Inc   NASDAQ KITE  is doing very well  up 2 96 to 76 50  or 4   on nearly a million shares on Wednesday  It moved through key resistance  and may very well surge into the high 80 s  There s some resistance at the top of the channel at 81  which could be tested as early as Thursday 
Ixia  NASDAQ XXIA  made a big move on Wednesday  up 2 15 to 15 65  or 16   on 1 3 million shares  It broke out of the top of the channel and lateral resistance with a big breakaway gap on strong volume  It should lead to a test of multiple highs in 2013 up around the 16 1 2 range as early as Thursday  If it gets through that look for a target of 19

Aquinox Pharmaceuticals Inc   NASDAQ AQXP   on positive drug news  had an amazing day  The only reason this one is on the list is because this stock went from 1 65 to 55 75 in two days  which is unheard of  It peaked early in the day on Monday  and then worked its way back down to 17 56  The pattern its developing in after hours  which could mean that it could snapback on Tuesday  So keep an eye on it 
Dynavax Technologies Corporation  NASDAQ DVAX  is acting very well  It based out for three months  ran up in June July  formed a platform  and then it pulled back  snapped back  and jumped 3 69 to 30 74  or 13 6   on 1 3 million shares on Monday  That s the best volume in about three weeks  It looks like it will go quickly to 34 00  which is the short term target 
Comfort Systems USA Inc   NYSE FIX  has been in a wonderful  long term rising channel  It hardly felt any pullback in the market  perhaps Thursday and Friday it pulled back a bit  On Monday  it popped 1 67 to 30 12  or 6   on 814 925 shares traded  That s the best volume all year  There may be more upside in the 32 35 range 
Novavax  Inc   NASDAQ NVAX  snapped back on Monday  up 36 cents to 11 19  and in afterhours it reached 12 1 2  closing at 12 35  up from 11 19  plus it still has 5 6 days to cover  Look for it to move up to test the zone at 12 12 1 2

Second Sight Medical Products   NASDAQ EYES  has had two consecutive big days with big volume  It broke through resistance on Wednesday  up 2 70 to 13 90  or 24   on 9 8 million shares  The next target on EYES if it gets a follow through is 16 16 1 4 1 2  But at some point shortly it s going to get some pullback consolidation 
FireEye   NASDAQ FEYE  was up 1 43 to 45 40  or 31 4   on 15 7 million shares  This stock has had some very nice action after the run up and break out of the base  The pullback has held some four or five days now above the 42 1 2 range  If it can get above the recent spike high at 46 18  it could see 50 51  which is the next target 
TG Therapeutics   NASDAQ TGTX  popped 1 51 to 15 26 or 11   on 1 25 million shares on Wednesday  That s the best volume in two months  The next target on this one should it extend will be up to 15 1 2  and the double top at 18

119799,341314,FSLR,Solar Setups,opinion,"Back in the 2008 time zone  solar stocks hit all time peaks and then crashed magnificently to earth  All supernovas  First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  crumbled from a high of 317 to a low of  11 by the middle of 2012  SunPower  NASDAQ SPWR  went from  164 to a low of  3 71 just a year ago  not even 
So the question I ask is  was that the fake move and are we now embarking on the  real  move  Not sure  but money is chasing this sector right now   How long it will last before they get bored and rotate somewhere else is anyone s guess 
Whatever happens six months or a year from now is an unknown  but here are two names that are setting up bullishly  Personally I think it will go the way of the Betamax  but what do I know 
Stocktwits is all  atwtter  with Sunedison Inc  NYSE SUNE  and with good reason  The chart is setting up beautifully and the underlying technicals are setting up bullishly 
The daily chart is showing a bull flag after the stock broke out with volume last week   Looking for 25 26  then higher 

FSLR is also in a bull flag and is right underneath downtrend line resistance  A move through 70 with volume gives you a target of mid  high 70 s

119807,341322,FSLR,New Solar Stock Spinoff Worth Considering,opinion,"While what s presently happening inside the solar power industry isn t particularly unusual  it is highly profitable  Back in 2006  solar cell manufacturers enjoyed an aggressive rally in prices  They were the darlings of Wall Street  remember 
First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  alone rocketed 1 157  higher  The rally  however  was based solely on potential   and it ultimately collapsed under the weight of unfulfilled expectations and hideous earnings reports  By the spring of 2008  the industry was left for dead  
Well  second chance fortunes aren t uncommon  and now the sector is rallying again  Only this time  the momentum is being driven by real demand   as manufacturing costs of solar panels have dropped 60  to 70  in recent years 
The cost to install solar modules is plummeting  too  How cheap has solar power become   Brace yourself   Solar is starting to outbid traditional fossil fuels in utility deals 
Such a reality is pushing demand for a certain material   one critical to the industry   to its outer limits  Spot prices for solar modules around the world hit  0 63 per watt in the second quarter  marking an all time low  And now  all of the sudden  since the economics of solar make sense  the United States is on pace to install 6 6 gigawatts of solar panels this year  a 39  jump from 2013 
This bull isn t exclusively American  either  as lower costs are wreaking havoc with energy markets around the globe  In fact  the price of solar is now even with the price of conventional electricity in Italy and Germany  Not to be outdone  China is about to break ground on a massive 1 000 megawatt solar plant  super complex  in the middle of the desert 
As you d expect  demand for polysilicon has gone vertical   Polysilicon is critical to the manufacture of solar cells   Analysts project polysilicon demand to rise 25   to 282 000 metric tons this year 
It s all music to the ears of SunEdison  NYSE SUNE   a major player and manufacturer of silicon wafers to the semiconductor industry for use in solar panels  A holder of over 700 patents  the company touts one of the market s hottest stocks  Shares have pushed from  1 82 to nearly  25 in just two years 
Now  I could give you 25 reasons why SunEdison shares will push above  30 by Halloween  But I m not going to do that  Why  Because something even better is cooking  That is  a spinoff of SunEdison 
Inside of the first year  spinoffs outperform their parent companies in every conceivable timeframe  one week  one month  six months  etc  With that in mind  shares of the SunEdison spinoff  TerraForm Power  NASDAQ  TERP   began trading on Friday 
TerraForm is the realization of SunEdison s ambition to bundle its existing solar power plants into a single subsidiary  The deal is  multiple times oversubscribed  and  in great shape   IPO Boutique said in a note before shares hit the market

119808,341323,FSLR,Renewables MMI  Up a Point  Silicon Solar Panel Trade War Not Letting Up,opinion,"The monthly Renewables MMI  registered a value of 66 in August  up a point from July s value  The ongoing trade fight between the US and China over crystalline silicon photovoltaic imports shows no signs of letting up  GTM research estimates the cost of Chinese solar panels could go up 14  as a result of the latest round of import duties on silicon from the US Commerce Department 
Instead of placing tariffs on imports of raw US silicon  so far   Beijing has looked inward to increase incentives for developers to purchase Chinese PVs and to encourage the developers to sell the power the panels generate back to utilities  The Chinese government recently released templates for long term power purchase agreements for large solar power projects 

This template can be used by any project developer looking to sell solar power to state utilities  The government also issued a similar template for wind energy projects 
Under the policies  the National Energy Administration would call for local planners to add more projects in regions where electricity can be distributed to customers living nearby  Shares of Chinese solar manufacturers climbed on the news 
Tempe  Ariz  based First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  also recently agreed to supply cadmium telluride thin film modules to XSOL  a Japanese distributor of solar systems  First Solar says its cadmium telluride thin film solar modules generate up to 8  more energy than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules and provide better energy yield in warmer climates  Success for the thin film modules could significantly change the balance between silicon and cadmium as solar panel raw materials 
The announcement comes after First Solar  which makes solar panels and also builds large scale solar power plants that it later sells  announced plans last year to invest  100 million to develop large solar projects in Japan  First Solar anticipates it could install up to 100 megawatts a year in Japan  and the deal enables First Solar s thin film technology to be supplied to smaller scale projects
The price of Chinese cobalt cathodes rose 10 7 percent to  36 769 per metric ton after falling the previous month  At  871 00 per short ton  the price of US steel plate finished the month 0 6 percent higher  This was the second straight month of declines 
At  63 172 per metric ton  neodymium was down 3 7 percent for the month  Silicon closed the month at  2 268 per metric ton after dropping 1 8 percent  The value of Chinese steel plate weakened by 0 8 percent this month  settling at  583 12 per metric ton 
Last month was consistent for US grain oriented electrical steel  GOES   which did not move from  3 112 per metric ton  The price of Korean steel plate held steady around  871 39 per metric ton last month  Hovering around  739 49 per metric ton for the month  Japanese steel plate remained unchanged

The drop in crude oil prices was due to sluggish consumption growth  the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries   OPEC  decision to maintain production at the current level as well as robust production from North American shale fields  However  demand for solar energy is strengthening at a rapid clip and analysts see no fundamental co relation between the oil plunge and solar share losses  It is important to remember that 39 1  of U S  electricity is coal generated  27 4  comes from natural gas  19  from nuclear  7  hydro  6  renewables and 1  oil  Hence  the recent losses suffered by some of the fundamentally strong solar stocks can be good buying opportunities  The U S  solar market continues to grow as it registered 41  year over year growth in the third quarter 2014  as per the Solar Energy Industries Association and GTM Research  Apart from the recent oil price scenario  other weaknesses that can impact the renewable industry at large are discussed below   Anti Dumping Duties  The latest move from the U S  Department of Commerce   DOC   to impose new import duties on solar panels and other related products from China and Taiwan could escalate the U S  China trade conflict that has already been simmering since 2012  The decision addresses one of the main charges in a petition brought by SolarWorld Industries America  a German solar manufacturer with major operations in the U S  A complaint lodged by SolarWorld brought to the fore a loophole that the Chinese solar product makers were exploiting to evade duties imposed by the Department of Justice in 2012  After suffering from a two year slump given the global supply glut  the solar industry on the whole is now largely recovering  Hence  the additional tariffs if implemented will unfortunately put a hold on the entire U S  solar industry  as prices of solar power on the whole will probably move north given the global dominance of China in the solar panel manufacturing space  According to Boston based GTM Research  panels made in China were used in more than 50  of U S  rooftop installations  Subsidy roll back  Budgetary constraints have caused the prime global solar markets like Germany  U S   Italy  Australia  U K  and Taiwan to roll back a portion of their grants  Earlier  sales of solar players from the above countries witnessed a sharp rise mainly fueled by the rush to complete projects ahead of subsidy roll backs  The alternative energy players may receive another jolt from one of the prime solar markets  Germany is expected to cap subsidy payments after generation capacity reaches a certain target  Germany is consistently evaluating changes to the German Renewable Energy Law  or the EEG  In Apr 2012  an amendment of the EEG came into force that introduced a monthly reduction in feed in tariffs  FiTs  by 1   which can rise or fall depending on solar growth  As of July 2014  feed in tariffs for PV systems range from 12 88 euro cents per kilowatt hour  kWh  for small roof top system  down to 8 92 euro cents per kWh for large utility scaled solar parks  Also  FiTs are restricted to PV system with a maximum capacity of 10 MW 
These FiT changes particularly affected the competitiveness of large scale free field PV systems and modules  Any further policy changes wrought by the German Environment and Economy Ministers and approved by the German Parliament will negatively affect the long term demand and price levels for PV products in Germany  New emerging technologies  The alternative energy industry remains an emerging sector with a steady focus on the lowest cost technology  This may prove disastrous for existing companies ruling the solar roost should a cheaper alternative emerge  The industry also has to deal with cost competitiveness from traditional means of electricity generation Conclusion Globally  China leads the world in total electricity generation from renewable sources  helped by its increased allegiance in recent times to the alternative path  The dragon is followed closely by the U S   Brazil and Canada  On the other hand  European PV markets experienced a slowdown in 2013 due to the declining political support for PV  Notably  Italy witnessed a 70  market decline year over year  Germany also experienced a steep PV market decline of 57   So  all leading solar cell manufacturers are looking for opportunities in the emerging markets  These markets primarily comprise the Asia Pacific region with China  India and Japan being the key destination for the global solar giants  China is targeting to install 70 GW of solar power by 2017  India is aiming to install 20 GW of solar power by 2022  and Japan is stepping up its solar panel installation post the deactivation of its nuclear reactors  The long term outlook on the whole looks bright  This is especially true as global warming and high fuel emission issues are leading to rising popularity of clean energy sources  Though the recent proposal from the DOC  if implemented  will prove to be unfavorable for Chinese solar companies  Malaysia could emerge as a major beneficiary  Malaysia now stands out as the second largest exporter of solar panels to the U S   following China  This Southeast Asian country is a little ahead of Taiwan  The U S   Japanese and Korean solar companies are investing heavily in Malaysia  First Solar Inc is mostly reliant on its facilities in the country to manufacture solar panels  Other companies like SunPower Corporation  NASDAQ SPWR  and Hanwha SolarOne Co Ltd  NASDAQ HSOL  also own facilities there  So  if we are to expand renewable manufacturing infrastructure worldwide to fight the climate crisis  the U S  as well as the Chinese manufacturers should try to settle their dispute before the industry is hurt at large  Measures to reduce the inflow of Chinese solar panels may hamper the battle against climate change ",2015-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-plunging-oil-prices-hurt-renewables-240149,240149

119876,341391,FSLR,Bill Powers  Shale Gas Production To Fall,opinion,Energy pundits sing natural gas  praises  but Bill Powers  author of  Cold  Hungry and in the Dark  Exploding the Natural Gas Supply Myth   isn t buying it  He sees serious flaws in how reserves are reported  and his own research shows steep  across the board production declines in the near future  Nonetheless  he expects a multiyear bull run for the resource  and recommends investors get positioned before scarcity hits just five to seven years from now  Find out which companies Powers is betting on in this interview with The Energy Report   The Energy Report  Numerous experts  including T  Boone Pickens and Porter Stansberry  have said that  thanks to natural gas shale recovery technology  the U S  is set to become energy independent  In your new book   Cold  Hungry and in the Dark  Exploding the Natural Gas Supply Myth   you say that the U S  has only a five  to seven year supply of shale gas rather than the 100 years estimated by the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   What data are you consulting  and why are your conclusions so different from what the EIA projects   Bill Powers  First of all  the EIA has since backtracked on its estimates of shale gas recoveries  At one time it was over 800 trillion cubic feet  800 Tcf   which is approximately a 40 year supply at current consumption rates  Due to reductions in estimated future recoveries in the Marcellus Shale and elsewhere  EIA estimates are now down to 400 500 Tcf  which is closer to a 20 year supply   T  Boone Pickens and Porter Stansberry provide very few facts to support their statements  I use production history from shale plays that are currently in production  For the Barnett Shale  I use production history from the Texas Railroad Commission  For the Fayetteville Shale  I use production history from the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission  I have examined the Department of Natural Resources  production reports for the Haynesville Shale  While there has been a big ramp up in shale gas production  the evidence indicates that current production levels are not sustainable  In my book  I give substantial evidence that there may be 125 150 Tcf gas produced from shales in the future  That is a far cry from a 100 year supply   TER  If the EIA s data are inaccurate  what information sources can investors turn to for reliable data   BP  That s a tough question because it is very difficult to find independent information sources  The oil and gas industry funds a lot of these studies  MIT received money from Hess Corp   Penn State has had controversy over its support from industry  Navigant Consulting has put out an industry funded study  The Potential Gas Committee is also funded by the industry  Petroleum Geologist Art Berman has done some of the best work on shale gas productivity and decline curves I cite him in my book  There are other sources out there  but they re relatively few   Also  I document how the EIA has changed its methodology for collecting production data  The EIA has been substantially wrong it has admitted this in the past  Last  I document the fundamental flaws in a widely cited report the EIA put out in July 2011 that went field by field through the shale gas and shale oil fields  There were numerous mistakes in that report   TER  Your book starts with a warning that we re being set up for a replay of the 1970s gas crisis  but when we interviewed you in November 2012  readers commented on the perceived price manipulation that contributed to gas shortages 40 years ago  Is there more transparency now in reserve numbers and thus less chance of price manipulation   BP  About 40 years ago  prices were set by the Federal Power Commission  FPC   which was the predecessor to the Department of Energy  Prices were not deregulated at the wellhead until the Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989 accelerated the deregulation process that began in 1978  It is unlikely that there was price manipulation by producers  However  the SEC did not begin requiring publicly traded producers to put reserve numbers on their financial statements until 1978  so there was a lot of confusion and opaqueness surrounding industry reserve numbers  There is evidence that the American Gas Association  AGA   which supplied the FPC with the industry s reserve numbers at the time  would underestimate supply numbers  The FPC used the AGA s reserve data to set rates  That was quite a conflict of interest  Now  companies put out their reserve numbers on their financial statements and prices are deregulated   Investors should be aware that reserve numbers are estimates made with incomplete knowledge by humans  and sometimes these reserves can be wildly off the mark  Numerous shale gas companies have taken significant write downs over the last two years  For example  we saw Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK  write down 4 6 Tcf of gas in Q2 12  That s over 20  of all of its reserves at the beginning of 2012  Other companies  such as BP Plc  BP   BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP   Exco Resources Inc   EXCO  and Range Resources Corp   RRC   all have taken write downs   The timeframe over which reserves are expected to be produced is rarely discussed  One of the big surprises to me in researching this book was that companies often book shale gas reserves over a 40 65 year period  Production history does not support this assumption that shale gas wells will produce for multiple decades  In fact  most shale gas wells will produce the majority of their reserves within their first five years of production  Expectations for multi decade reserve life are just unrealistic for shale gas wells   TER  Then what metrics should investors seek to get more accurate production projections   BP  The amount of a company s reserves in its  proven undeveloped  category is important  Here s why  A few years ago  the SEC dramatically increased the ability of companies to book proven undeveloped reserves  This is the result of a change to the Oil and Gas Modernization Act in 2009  which assumed there was homogeneity across shale gas fields  meaning that future wells would be similar to producing wells  The act allowed for multiple offsets from a producing well  which in turn allowed for many companies to increase their proven undeveloped reserves  However  the proven undeveloped reserves are the ones that are most likely to be written down  Be skeptical of companies that have a high ratio of proven undeveloped as a percentage of their total proven  This is the riskiest category of proven reserves  That s a good place for investors to start   Next  look at a company s cash flow statements  See how much it is spending and what it is getting for that spending  For example  how much is it able to grow production  Can it grow with its existing cash flow  or does it have to sell assets  issue new shares or take on debt  These are important indicators that will help you determine if a company s production is sustainable or if it can grow organically   One of the best tools for investors is to see how competitors in the areas where it operates are doing  and therefore how realistic a company s projections are   TER  Other experts  including Bob Moriarty and Marin Katusa  have talked about the end of cheap oil and the opportunities for companies to use technology like fracking to access new sources  even if it s going to cost more  But one of the arguments you make in your book is that higher prices will not trigger increased production  Can you elaborate   BP  It s a question of the hard geological limits  From 1973 1984  the price of gas went up twelvefold  yet production went down more than 15   This was not due to lack of trying  the number of rigs drilling in the United States increased substantially  Also  from 2001 2007  natural gas prices increased by 50   and production went down  Throughout the long history of oil and gas production we ve seen many fields decline despite high prices   If we look at just oil fields  many have had increases in production from the application of technology  For example  when natural gas was injected into Prudhoe Bay  production went up briefly before going back down  When nitrogen was injected into the Cantarell Field in Mexico  production went up substantially before falling  In Kern River  California  when steam was injected into the field  production went up and it s now falling  There are hard limits to what extraction technologies can do   While I do think that higher prices will bring out marginal production  today s level of shale gas production is unsustainable  Several shale gas fields are peaking or are very close to peaking  such as the Barnett  the Fayetteville  the Haynesville  the Arkoma Woodford  All of those fields will probably see production declines even in an environment of rising prices  Rising prices will certainly lead to increased production in younger fields  such as the Marcellus  but in other fields they re not going to make a difference   TER  You talk about the improvements in technology that lead to renewed production in aging fields  Is there any reason to believe that we have exhausted our progress in technology   BP  Absolutely not  There is a lot of technology that can be applied  However  technology advances are not linear  They come in clumps and they come unpredictably  For example  there is potentially a lot of gas underneath the salt weld in the Gulf of Mexico  As of now there are zero wells in the Gulf of Mexico that produce from below the salt weld  Next week  trillions of cubic feet may be unlocked from beneath the salt weld  but it also may be decades before these resources are actually produced  We have just come through a period of very rapid advances in horizontal drilling and fracture technology  and the next phase of that may come a year from now  but it may come decades from now  That s why I m very skeptical that technology advances will just happen to appear at the next price spike or that the next time we have a shortage of natural gas  technology will come to the rescue   TER  Both hedging and production are falling because natural gas prices are below the cost of drilling and operating new wells  Will that lead to higher natural gas prices by the end of 2013   BP  I believe so  Gas has been the best performing commodity in 2013 so far  I believe declining production in some of the bigger producing areas  such as Texas  Louisiana  Wyoming or the Gulf of Mexico  will lead to tightening supplies as well as higher prices later this year  We could easily see prices between  5 7 per thousand cubic feet   5 7 Mcf  before the end of this year  given current storage levels and the demand we continue to see from the electrical power industry  A lot of this will have to do with the weather as well as economic activity  but gas prices have bottomed and they are now in the very early stages of what I believe will be a multi year bull run that will take prices much higher than many people believe   TER  In your January 2012 interview  you told The Energy Report that you expected gas prices to increase substantially  The price then was between  2 50 3 per million British thermal units   2 50 3 MMBtu   and it has just recently broken  4 MMBtu  Is this the rate of increase you expected   BP  I would expect prices to continue to go up  but the rate of their rising is unknowable because so much depends on market perception rather than the availability of supply  The market continues to believe that there will be relatively cheap gas for several more years  This belief is slowly eroding  and the rate at which this erodes will be reflected in the upward movement of gas prices  But the trend is very clear   TER  If increased prices don t make for increased production  how relevant is the natural gas price for investors in the space   BP  It s still very relevant because rising gas prices increase the cash flow gas companies can generate  especially low cost producers  A number of companies are very cheap  some are richly priced  But there are many companies  both Canadian and American  that have good projects that are very cheap on almost every metric by historical standards  These are low cost producers  well managed  There s a great opportunity for investors who believe that gas prices are going to rise   TER  Will large or small companies be better able to make a profit in the future  Do you see any particular companies that are well positioned   BP  It s difficult for companies in the junior space in Canada to profit from some of the rise in gas prices  simply because of the high cost of drilling new wells  Advantage Oil and Gas Ltd   AAV  has a great project and it looks like the company may be doubling its Montney production by 2015  Bellatrix Exploration Ltd   BXE TSX  has good gas production and some interesting projects that it s moving forward  In the United States  Southwestern Energy Co   SWN  has had good success in the Fayetteville and now is having success in the Marcellus  It is a low cost producer that has been able to fund most of its growth through cash flow  Ultra Petroleum Corp   UPL  is cheap by historical standards  and it s a low cost producer  It has good assets in Wyoming as well as in the Marcellus  All four of those companies are big enough to attract institutional investors once the market is confident the price of natural gas will continue its upward movement  Those are at the top of my mind as companies that are best positioned   TER  You warn of a coming a natural gas deliverability crisis and the impact that will have on the economy  leaving people cold  hungry  unemployed and in the dark  How can investors participate in the upside of a possible solution   BP  One of the best ways for investors to mitigate what I believe will be a 1970s style natural gas crisis that will occur sometime in the next few years is to consider companies that have leverage to rising gas prices  and I have mentioned some of those  There also are a number of companies that will profit as the rebound in alternative energy really hits home  There s a cascading effect from higher natural gas prices  Higher prices will raise the cost of electricity and lead to higher home heating bills  Increased gas prices will also lead to higher food prices because of the amount of gas that s used in fertilizers   We will see a rebound in alternative energy companies  People will reconsider nuclear power  especially smaller nuclear plants that can be built modularly and have less safety risk  We will see further gains in solar and in wind  Solar power is coming close to grid parity in areas like California  Even though alternative energy companies have had a very difficult time over the last few years  for investors that really want to dig in  this is an area that is going to rebound and I think the worst is behind it  There s been a big shakeout  For investors who can take a longer term horizon  I think there are some fantastic companies that are very attractively priced   TER  Can you name some companies that you think that could be part of this solution   BP  Babcock   Wilcox Co   BWC  is the leader in smaller nuclear plants  It s had extensive experience in building nuclear plants over the years  In the solar space  given the carnage that has occurred  it s still difficult to see which companies are going to profit  but First Solar Inc   FSLR  has survived  Others will make it through to the next boom in the solar industry  but there are not going to be as many competitors the next time around  I think that keeping an eye on those companies that are likely to survive is a great start for right now   TER  Are some of these solutions riskier than others   BP  Absolutely  Technology is changing very quickly and the price point at which some of these solutions are going to work varies  With that being said  this is what leads to opportunities for investors finding the companies that have the best technology and that are well funded  Those are the companies that will flourish as electricity prices rise and home heating prices rise  But there s still a lot of uncertainty in the alternative energy space as far as who the big winners are going to be the next time around   TER  Bill  I appreciate your time   BP  Thank you very much  It was a pleasure speaking with you   Bill Powers is an independent analyst  private

119913,341428,FSLR,First Solar Stock And Solar ETFs Are Hot,opinion,First Solar stock and solar ETFs are hot and here s how you can participate First Solar  FSLR  stock triggered a solar flare last week on the Nasdaq as circuit breakers were triggered on Tuesday  April 9  The event was caused by a massive amount of short covering in First Solar stock after the company issued impressive 2013 guidance  with full year earnings expected between  4 00 and  4 50 a share on sales of between  3 8 billion and  4 billion  Analysts had been expecting to see earnings guidance of  3 51 a share in 2013 on sales of approximately  3 1 billion  Trading in First Solar stock was halted on the Nasdaq exchange during Tuesday s session  in accordance with the guidelines on triggered circuit breakers  Previous to last week s solar flare  the sector has suffered through some awful growing pains  The financial crisis resulted in reduced subsidies for development in the rapidly advancing photovoltaic power industry  Meanwhile  China increased government financing of its solar industry  having already established a strong presence in the sector with such companies as Suntech Power  STP  and LDK Solar  LDK   With its ramped up  less expensive production capabilities  China began  dumping  its lower priced solar panels in foreign markets   especially the United States   putting many of the American competitors  such as Solyndra  out of business  Eventually the entire solar industry went into a slump  Chinese companies   such as Suntech Power  which was trading in excess of  40 per share in 2009   saw their share prices sink even deeper than those of their American competitors  Things became so bad for Suntech that even with a 17 percent share price surge on April 11  the stock closed at a paltry 87 cents per share  But that was then and this is now  On April 9th  Arizona based First Solar announced the development of new technology that improves the efficiency rate of its solar panels  The panels it manufactured last year could convert 13 percent of the sunlight into electricity  The new panels have improved the efficiency rate to just above 16 percent  First Solar also announced that it had purchased a startup called TetraSun  which was in the process of developing technology to improve solar panel efficiency rate to 21 percent  The news sent First Solar stock skyrocketing from  27 14 at the opening bell to  39 95 at the close This week s action in the solar sector is a continuation of action that began around the beginning of the year  For instance  California based Sun Power  SPWR  has seen its share price skyrocket by over 96 percent since the start of 2013  At the close of trading on April 11  SPWR had advanced 2 50 percent on the day  compared with the 2 41 percent gain by First Solar  Nasdaq FSLR   Another American solar heavyweight is MEMC Electronic Materials  WFR  which has enjoyed an 18 percent increase in its share price during the past week For investors wanting to join in the solar heat via exchange traded funds  there are presently two ETFs focused exclusively on the solar sector Market Vectors Solar Energy ETF  KWT  has a market cap of only  12 million  which is invested in a portfolio of 34 stocks related to the solar industry  The top holding is First Solar  and it accounts for 9 34 percent of the weight  The major drawback to this ETF is that it is thinly traded  averaging about 8 000 shares per day during the past three months The Guggenheim Solar ETF  TAN  has a market cap of  64 million  which is invested in 22 securities from the solar sector  Its top holding is also First Solar  FSLR  and it accounts for 14 percent of the weight  Its average trading volume over the past three months has been a healthy 147 000 shares Another ETF which invests in the solar sector is the PowerShares WilderHill Clean Energy ETF  PBW   Although its holdings are not limited to the solar sector  its most significant holding is SunPower Corporation  SPWR  at 4 96 percent of the weight  Its number three holding is MEMC Electronic Materials  WFR  at 3 42 percent of the weight  PBW s average trading volume is robust at over 400 000 shares per day  Its market cap is  135 million Bottom line  The solar sector finally appears to be emerging from its own Dark Age  With the Obama Administration solidly supporting alternative energy and with new technologies on the horizon  alternative energy and solar ETFs could offer significant growth potential for making hay while the sun is shining Disclaimer  The content included herein is for educational and informational purposes only  and readers agree to Wall Street Sector Selector s     and  before accessing or using this or any other publication by Wall Street Sector Selector or Ridgeline Media Group  LLC ,2013-04-15,John Nyaradi,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-solar-stock-and-solar-etfs-are-hot-162918,162918

120021,341536,FSLR,Solar  Gold Stocks In Bullish Rotation,opinion,As the second quarter earnings season winds down  equity markets are embracing a more bullish tone  Not only are the large cap blue chip averages continuing to grind higher  small cap    stocks along with transports    are now confirming the advance Increased ConfidenceA few weeks ago  the bullish argument centered around expectations for another round of quantitative easing from the Fed  More recently  however  the bulls have flipped the script  with confidence increasing due to moderate improvement in U S  economic data points Of course  this positive data may give the Fed pause to implement new stimulus measures  but for now  traders are focusing on the positives  An absence of disturbing headlines from Europe    and a sense of relief from surviving the Q2 earnings season    is helping to boost sentiment From a technical perspective  there are a number of indicators confirming the bullish action U S  Treasury prices declining    As confidence improves  capital is rotating out of  preservation  mode into growth opportunities  Lower treasury prices of course correspond with a lift in  risk free  interest rates Rotation out of defensive sectors    Long only managers with a mandate to stay fully invested  have loaded up on utilities  consumer staples  stable dividend stocks  Now  institutional investors are scaling out of those positions in favor of cyclical high beta vehicles like homebuilder and tech stocks Low volatility supports  grind higher  environment    A low VIX reading is often associated with a market that is topping  but historically speaking  volatility readings can remain low for an extended period as the  fear indicator  remains low and equities continue to grind higher Ratcheting Up On RiskAs equities continue to advance and the risk of an earnings driven selloff fade  institutional managers are now facing the challenge of keeping up with their benchmarks into year end The problem with underweighting risk assets is that managers who were conservatively positioned heading into earnings season are now behind the ball  And in an industry where positive relative to performance is the difference between employment and a pink slip  there is a strong incentive for portfolio managers to ratchet up their risk in order to charge returns We re heading into the week positioned as cautious bulls    with a growing number of long positions and a number of sectors on our radar for new trade opportunities Below are a few areas we re focusing on this week Solar Stocks Rebounding From Deep Value LevelsThe alternative energy area has been a challenging place for investors to make money for several years  Overcapacity  lower fossil fuel prices and compressed profit margins  to the point of being negative in many cases   have pushed equities lower for years It appears that the industry is finally approaching equilibrium  with under performing companies being taken off line or bought by competitors and the remaining firms enjoying the benefits of a rebound in both oil and natural gas prices Solar energy stocks have traded down to valuation levels that imply little to no growth  along with a high perceived risk of bankruptcy  Value investors are now making the argument that stock prices fully incorporate the risks  but fail to account for the prospects of the industry actually surviving Over the past three weeks  we have seen the broad group move higher and break through key moving average resistance  Last week  we took a starter position in the group As the bullish action continues  we will be looking to add horizontal exposure to the position    branching out into individual equities that offer strong technical setups and a compelling fundamental story Leading Industry HigherFirst Solar Inc   FSLR  is a strong candidate based on the fact that the stock is trading at less than five times projected profits for this year  The company has remained profitable throughout the devastating bear market for the solar industry  and yet it s stock price has fallen dramatically In 2008  the stock peaked at  317  while just 18 months ago  it hit  175 per share  Today  we can pick up shares just above  21  despite the fact that the company will earn more than  4 per share both this year and next From a technical perspective  FSLR is leading the industry higher  having bottomed nearly two months before the industry began turning higher  The stock has cleared an initial resistance area on strong volume  indicating significant buying pressure from both retail and institutional investors A new bullish position with a relatively tight risk point would offer a strong reward to risk scenario  FSLR could easily trade into the mid  40 s before hitting significant technical resistance and still offer a compelling value for long term investors Gold Miners Benefit From Growth ExpectationsAs prospects for economic growth improve  or perception leans more toward a growth scenario   inflation expectations also come into play  Considering the likelihood of additional injections from the Fed    and potential printing from the ECB    the prospects for a gold rally are good Already  we have seen gold and silver prices stabilize and the price action is likely to improve as economists incorporate positive employment and export data points Junior gold and silver miners should offer the best reward to risk trading opportunities as these companies have the most to gain from rising commodity prices and typically have the highest beta in relation to precious metal spot prices Last week  the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miner  GDXJ  ETF confirmed its recent break above the key 50 EMA    this following a basing pattern where a support level between  17 and  18 was tested multiple times We re watching the area closely as a massive capital re allocation into the area could significantly move prices for individual gold miner stocks Explosive PotentialMany of these miners are trading at depressed valuation levels as investors have become disenchanted with spot metal prices  Couple that with institutional investors  need to catch up with their benchmarks and you get an environment that could be explosive for gold mining stocks As investor sentiment improves and traders react to positive macro data  low yields for fixed income investments and blue chip dividend stocks are becoming less attractive Investors are increasingly allocating capital to areas with strong prospective growth  which accounts for the strength in homebuilders  technology stocks and other secular growth areas  You can see the degree to which investors are embracing risk by scanning the Live Feed Trend Tracker As traders  we have to be aware of these capital flows  taking advantage of the best reward to risk scenarios  while respecting the significant risks in play  There are still a number of catalysts that could quickly send this rally into a tailspin A deteriorating environment in Europe where default risk is once again in play A post QE3 depression where traders buy the rumor and sell the news  similar to post partum depression  Renewed concern heading into the Q3 earnings season as lower revenue trends from the past quarter result in lower EPS this time around A Few More WeeksMost of these catalysts would likely come into play in a mid September time window  which leaves equities free to continue the grind higher for a few more weeks We re comfortable holding our modest roster of
