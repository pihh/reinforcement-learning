104262,325777,LBTYA,UK s Labour plans high speed connection to voter hearts with BT nationalization,news,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Paul Sandle LONDON  Reuters    Britain s opposition Labour Party plans to nationalize BT s broadband network to provide free internet for all if it wins power  making a radical election pledge to roll back 35 years of private ownership that caught both the company and its shareholders by surprise   Labour s proposed overhaul of the telecoms infrastructure  an addition to its already broad nationalization plan  would be paid for by raising taxes on tech firms such as Alphabet s Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and using its Green Transformation fund  The announcement by Labour  which is currently lagging Prime Minister Boris Johnson s Conservatives in opinion polls ahead of the Dec  12 election  sent BT s shares down as much as 3 7   wiping nearly half a billion pounds off its market value  The share was down 1 7  at 1410 GMT  Labour plans to nationalize Openreach   the fixed line network arm of the country s biggest broadband and mobile phone provider   as well as parts of BT Technology  BT Enterprise and BT Consumer to create a  British Broadband  public service   A Labour government will make broadband free for everybody   Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a speech   This is core infrastructure for the 21st century  I think it s too important to be left to the corporations    We ll tax the giant corporations fairly   the Facebooks and the Googles   to cover the running costs   said Corbyn  adding the public had been forced to pay far too much for  rip off broadband  and the party would transform the British economy   BT  with roots in an 1846 telegraph company  was once one of Britain s national champions and the flagship of Margaret Thatcher s privatization policy when it was floated by her Conservative government in 1984   Labour s announcement brought into sharp relief the election stakes  Johnson who promises to deliver Brexit in January or Labour which says it wants to be the most radical socialist government in British history  The relatively muted market reaction indicates investors do not expect Labour to win  analysts said  BT also retained the right to show UEFA Champions League soccer games  helping to support shares  Johnson derided Corbyn s plan  saying it would undermine the world s fifth largest economy and cost taxpayers dearly  He has promised to roll out full fiber broadband to all homes by 2025   We are funding a huge program of investment in our roads  in telecoms  gigabyte broadband  unlike the crazed  crazed Communist scheme that was outlined earlier on today   Johnson told Conservative Party activists  The Conservatives said Corbyn s plans would be illegal under EU rules governing state aid  Labour said the cost of nationalizing parts of BT would be set by parliament and paid for by swapping bonds for shares   VERY  VERY AMBITIOUS IDEAS  In what would amount to the biggest shake up in British telecoms since Thatcher s privatizations of the 1980s  Labour said few would lose out while millions would benefit  The national Openreach network is also used by BT s rivals  including Sky  TalKTalk and  Vodafone   LON VOD   to provide broadband to their own customers  Its only competitor with widespread coverage is Virgin Media  owned by Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA   TalkTalk said on Friday a deal to sell its FibreNation business had stalled after Labour s announcement  Labour s second most powerful man  John McDonnell  suggested that the owners of the networks that compete with Openreach  such as Virgin Media s cable network and new fiber providers  could come to an arrangement or be nationalized too    We ll come to an agreement with them  It will either be an agreement of access arrangements  or working alongside us  or if necessary they can come within the ambit of British Broadband itself   McDonnell said  Labour  led by 70 year old socialist Corbyn  has been open about its plans to nationalize the rail  utility and water companies as well as to increase taxes on the wealthy  but has never previously suggested nationalizing BT s assets and the company was taken by surprise    These are very  very ambitious ideas and the Conservative Party have their own ambitious idea for full fiber for everyone by 2025 and how we do it is not straightforward   Chief Executive Philip Jansen told the BBC  BT CRITICIZED Currently  fewer than 10  of British premises have access to full fiber broadband   also called fiber to the premises   where fiber optic cable instead of copper is used to connect homes to the network   BT has been criticized by customers  rivals and the regulator for poor service and a lack of ambition in upgrading its network to fiber  where Britain lags far behind European countries like Spain   Labour said it would roll out the free broadband to all individuals and businesses by 2030  providing it to at least 15 million to 18 million premises within five years  It said the plan would save the average person 30 30 pounds a month  There would be a one off capital cost of 15 3 billion pounds to deliver the full fiber network  on top of the 5 billion already promised by Johnson  the party said  
The Conservatives said the real cost would be over 83 billion pounds over a decade  CEO Jansen said the plan could cost 100 billion pounds ",2019-11-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/uks-labour-vows-free-broadband-for-all-by-renationalizing-some-of-bt-2021198,2021198

LONDON  Reuters    Formula E starts its sixth season in Saudi Arabia on Friday with debutants Porsche and Mercedes hoping to carry their respective success in sports cars and Formula One to a new all electric battleground 
French driver Jean Eric Vergne  the first double champion  is aiming to complete his title hat trick with the Chinese owned DS Techeetah team in a series humming with renewed energy 
The presence of four German giants  with BMW and Audi regulars already  adds luster to a city based championship that has grown steadily since a financially precarious first season in 2014 
Formula E recently reported record revenues and a first ever profit and  burnishing environmentally conscious credentials with an emphasis on sustainability  feels increasingly in tune with the spirit of the times 
Nissan  Jaguar  Citroen  China s Nio and India s Mahindra are also involved 
The learning curve will be steep for the newcomers  in a championship that saw nine different winners in 13 races last season and where success costs a fraction of Formula One s bloated budgets 
 They will have done their homework  They are not starting from scratch  they have a lot of resource and clever people behind them   says Envision Virgin Racing managing director Sylvain Filippi 
 I hope they do really well  because it makes the competition even more exciting  but it s not going to be easy  
For Mercedes  the dominant force in Formula One for the past six years and the only carmaker involved in both  Formula E opens a new chapter in their 125 year racing history 
Their drivers are Belgian ex McLaren F1 racer Stoffel Vandoorne and 2019 F2 champion Nyck de Vries of the Netherlands 
Porsche  part of the Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  Group that includes Audi  have German Andre Lotterer and Swiss racer Neel Jani as their lineup

104264,325779,LBTYA,Sunrise s CEO Swantee  Chairman Kurer quit after failed Liberty Global deal,news,"By John Miller and Edward Taylor
ZURICH FRANKFURT  Reuters    Sunrise Communications  S SRCG  chief executive Olaf Swantee has quit and Chairman Peter Kurer said he will not run for re election after a shareholder uprising blocked the group s  6 3 billion bid for Liberty Global s  O LBTYA  Swiss cable unit 
Sunrise said its Chief Financial Officer Andre Krause  a German national  will immediately succeed Swantee as the new CEO  a step which was welcomed by  Freenet   DE FNTGn   the telecom firm s largest shareholder 
Freenet  a German telecommunications company which holds a 24 56  Sunrise stake  was a vocal opponent of the UPC deal 
Freenet said it did not want to pre empt strategic decisions by Krause but said they had received assurances from the incoming CEO that he sees a stand alone future for Sunrise  Krause had previously backed the UPC combination 
 In the past weeks Freenet has spoken with him about potential changes  and he made it clear that he sees a successful future for Sunrise as a stand alone company  This convinced us   Freenet said of Krause 
 We believe in the future and the potential of the company  The attractive dividend  a great team and a very well managed company are guarantees for a high shareholder return   Freenet said   There is no reason for us to change our position  
Krause declined a request from Reuters for an interview  with a spokeswoman saying he first wants to talk to employees and customers before going public in his new role 
 Management and the board    with the exception of the Freenet representative    were firmly convinced that the takeover of UPC was the best plan  but that does not mean Sunrise cannot be successful on its own  too   the spokeswoman said 
 Sunrise will continue its path as an independent company and Andre Krause  as new CEO  will further strengthen this successful direction  
DISPUTED DEAL
Sunrise shares  which dropped 12  in 2019 during the takeover battle  were up 0 5  by 1210 GMT 
In the months long UPC fight  Swantee and Kurer had become the public faces of the deal  arguing it would have created a more powerful rival to state owned market leader  Swisscom   S SCMN  
Freenet had accused Swantee and Kurer of pursuing a transaction that would have saddled Sunrise with  inferior technology  at an inflated price and terms favorable to Liberty Global  but negative for the Swiss company s own shareholders 
Krause has been at Sunrise since 2011 after a six year stint as CFO of  Telefonica   MC TEF  O2 Germany  and  has been instrumental in its transformation   the group said in its statement 
 As CFO  he drove the company through its successful IPO in 2015  and the subsequent sale of its tower assets  Andre has deep telecom industry expertise  
Sunrise said Vice Chairman Peter Schoepfer would also leave  Like Kurer he declined to stand for another term after the deal for Liberty s UPC Switzerland unit failed in October ",2020-01-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sunrises-ceo-swantee-chairman-kurer-quit-after-failed-liberty-global-deal-2051825,2051825

104306,325821,LBTYA,Swiss telecom Sunrise touts  6 4 billion UPC deal  blasts shareholder as  self serving ,news,"ZURICH  Reuters    Swiss telecommunications company Sunrise Communications  S SRCG  on Thursday escalated its defence of its planned takeover of Liberty Global s  O LBTYA  Swiss unit UPC  touting additional synergies and blasting a shareholder that is fighting the deal 
German telecoms group  Freenet   DE FNTGn   Sunrise s largest shareholder  has called the 6 3 billion Swiss franc   6 41 billion  takeover unfavorable for existing shareholders 
In a broadside calling Freenet  self serving   Sunrise touted updated expectations of 280 million francs in annual synergies from buying Liberty Global s UPC Swiss unit  45 million more than previously announced 
Freenet was not immediately available to comment 
The Swiss company said these benefits  along with improved performance of UPC  would allow it to increase leverage and reduce the size of the 4 1 billion franc rights issue it foresees to pay for the deal by about 1 billion francs 
Sunrise said one off integration costs needed to achieve the higher synergies are expected to increase from 140 150 million to 230 250 million francs  It added Freenet had rejected its proposed changes 
 Sunrise views Freenet as guided by its own short term financial constraints and self serving objectives which it seeks to solve at the expense of Sunrise and its shareholders   Sunrise said  adding its board has decided to exclude Freenet from deliberations on the deal 
Sunrise second quarter net income rose to 27 million francs  from 24 million francs in the year earlier period  the Swiss company said  Revenue fell 1 7  to 455 million francs  which Sunrise said resulted from lower mobile hardware and hubbing sales ",2019-08-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/swiss-telecom-sunrise-touts-64-billion-upc-deal-blasts-shareholder-as-selfserving-1960891,1960891
104307,325822,LBTYA,Freenet led revolt against Sunrise s UPC deal gains allies,news,"By Oliver Hirt and Angelika Gruber
ZURICH  Reuters    Sunrise Communications   S SRCG  proposed takeover of Liberty Global s  O LBTYA  Swiss UPC business faces a revolt with at least two big investors joining top shareholder  Freenet  in opposing the 6 3 billion Swiss franc   6 46 billion  deal  sources said 
A third was also expressing reservations about Switzerland s biggest telecoms acquisition  the sources told Reuters 
Germany s Freenet  DE FNTGn   which owns nearly a quarter of Sunrise  has said it will vote against a 4 1 billion franc rights issue Sunrise has proposed to help finance the purchase 
If Freenet finds enough allies  the capital increase may lack the simple majority needed at an extraordinary shareholder meeting that Sunrise would call after the transaction gets anti trust clearance 
 The deal has to be significantly restructured   one top 10 Sunrise shareholder said on condition of anonymity   We would prefer it did not take place at all  
The dissident shareholders are not convinced by the deal that Sunrise has defended as a path to better compete against Swiss heavyweight  Swisscom   S SCMN  
Sunrise s strength is in mobile  so buying the UPC cable business would bulk up its ability to bundle cell phone  broadband internet  television and landline services as a way to win share in Switzerland s competitive market 
 The deal makes strategic sense  but the price is wrong   said a top 20 shareholder  who said he would vote against the capital increase   The UPC deal hardly creates value while carrying high risks for shareholders  
Such acquisitions rarely produce the envisioned synergies and often cost more than planned  this shareholder said   At the moment we assume the deal in its current form has no chance  
The top 10 investor questioned the strategic logic  noting UPC Switzerland had been shrinking since the end of 2017  In contrast to Sunrise  he did not see a big turnaround soon 
 In our view UPC is still a restructuring case   he said 
Based on valuations for peers like Belgian cable group Telenet  BR TNET   a purchase price of around 4 billion francs would be appropriate  he estimated 
He also said Sunrise had agreed to assume UPC debt with an average interest rate above what Sunrise would have to pay  saddling it with extra costs 
 Is this transaction necessary at all  We are skeptical   he said  suggesting Sunrise was better off as a standalone entity that should focus on rolling out new 5G technology that could one day make cable obsolete 
Another investor displeased with the deal said it saw two scenarios  with Freenet refusing to take part  shareholders approve the capital hike that will pour new shares into the market  or else investors block the plan  forcing Sunrise to pay a 50 million franc break fee 
 In addition there is a high probability that Sunrise management leaves  should the plan it has pushed so hard fail  a representative of this shareholder said 
Sunrise finance chief Andre Krause told Reuters he was  very sure  of winning a majority for the transaction with or without Freenet s backing  Sunrise would meet its top 30 to 50 shareholders over the next three weeks to sound out whether it needed to change the financing plans for the deal  he added 
He said Sunrise was ready to cut the size of the rights issue by at least 1 5 billion francs  Liberty has said it was not prepared to change the agreed sale price 
Top shareholders such as Canadian pension fund CPP  with 5   and Germany s Shareholder Value Management declined comment

Freenet  which owns a quarter of Sunrise  has been joined by some other investors in fighting the transaction on grounds the price is too high  a proposed 4 1 billion franc capital increase would dilute their holdings and the Swiss company would wind up with all the risks while allowing Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  a lucrative and unfettered exit

104354,325869,LBTYA,StockBeat   Winners and Losers from Germany s 5G Auction,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    Europe s second big auction of 5G spectrum is over  and there are only winners   unless you re a maker of network gear 
As far as the stock market is concerned  the biggest winner to emerge from Germany s auction  which started back in March  is the upstart new entrant 1 1  Drillisch   DE DRIG  and its parent   United Internet   DE UTDI   They were up 9 1  and 6 6  respectively after early trading in Frankfurt Thursday  after Drillisch managed to walk away with a large chunk of spectrum for a relatively modest 1 07 bilion euros   1 21 billion   They gave up some of the gains later 
Drillisch s larger rivals are also in the green  although not by as much 
Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn   which had to pay the most at  2 17 billion  was up only 0 7   while  Telefonica   MC TEF  Deutschland  DE O2Dn  was up 3 7  and  Vodafone   LON VOD   which has bet heavily on the German market with its acquisition of Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  s assets  was up 1 2  
Executives from Telekom and Vodafone were quick to complain that the high cost of the auction  which for them represents only a fraction of the overall costs of rolling out 5G services  Vodafone s German head Hannes Ametreiter called it  a disaster for Germany  while Telekom director Dirk Woessener said in a statement that the auction left a  bitter aftertaste   complaining that the money spent on the auction is money that won\ t be available for spending on network building 
 The network rollout in Germany has suffered a significant setback   he said 
Woessener is perhaps guilty of protesting too much  The overall auction proceeds of 6 6 billion euros were almost exactly what Italy raised in October for its considerably smaller market  That s due partly to the fact that the German auctions were less competitive  with only four major participants  Vodafone in particularly paid some 30  more for its spectrum in Italy than it did in Germany 
Even so  the market is allowing a grain of truth in the moaning from the carriers this morning  The worst performing stocks in the space are those of network builders Ericsson  ST ERICb  and Nokia  HE NOKIA   They fell in early trading  only recovering later to trade up less than half a percent ",2019-06-13,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat--winners-and-losers-from-germanys-5g-auction-1896401,1896401

Chief Financial Officer Margherita Della Valle will receive 2 37 million shares under the plan  worth 3 12 million pounds   Vodafone  said 
Vodafone s shares have fallen 19  since former CFO Read became CEO in October 2018  and are down 44  since the start of last year 
The company has struggled in markets like Spain and Italy  with high costs for mobile spectrum in Germany  and with the expensive acquisition of cable assets from Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  
The pressure on the company s balance sheet forced Read to cut the dividend in May for the first time  six months after he said the payout was safe

104358,325873,LBTYA,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Berkshire Hathaway  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  Visa  American Express  Liberty Latin America And Sirius XM,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 10  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa    Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited   NYSE TEVA    Visa Inc    NYSE V    American Express Company   NYSE AXP    Liberty Latin America Ltd    NASDAQ LILA   and Sirius XM Holdings Inc    NASDAQ SIRI   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  5 Must Watch Warren Buffett Stocks for 2019Berkshire Hathaway Inc  CEO Warren Buffett is  undoubtedly  the greatest role model for investors  After getting into the investment game pretty early  Buffett has quite successfully transformed his initial  10 000 of investments into almost  81 billion in just around six decades Buffett s investing style is quite simple and he believes in the buy and hold philosophy  Buffett looks for companies with long term competitive advantages  and which can be purchased and held for extended periods of time These companies have solid business models and the ability to record significant growth  In other words  these companies have good earnings potential and are not concerned about whether the market will recognize its worth  They also generate plenty of cash and provide dividends  which are indicators of strong and sustainable business Let us then focus on the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha s favored companies that are likely to make the most of this year  Most of these companies belong to sectors such as health care  financials and communication services An Intriguing Value PropositionTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Limitedis currently one of the best value stocks in Buffett s portfolio  Teva did face a generic drug price weakness in recent times  leading to a slash in profit and sales guidance  After all  its top selling brand name therapy  Copaxone  grappled with intense competition for the very first time  But  then again  we all know that this company has an extremely efficient management team  Management retrenched nearly 25  of the company s workforce  which will help Teva save nearly  3 billion annually in 2019 An aging global population should also benefit Teva  Moreover  brand name medicines nowadays are becoming pricey  and emerging market nations mostly can t afford brand therapies  Therefore  such nations must be looking for generic medicines which is a major positive  Needless to say  Teva is currently the world s largest producer of generic medicines Teva generic portfolio  thus  will lead to large cash inflows this year while the company sports a rock bottom valuation with a price to earnings ratio  P E  of 6 30  compared with 15 74 for the S P 500  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings  by the way  increased 5 4  over the past 90 days  The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has a Value Score of B  The stock has rallied 14 7  so far this year compared to the Medical   Generic Drugs industry s gain of 8 8  Visa for Consistent GrowthInvestors looking for consistent growth should consider Buffett owned payment facilitator Visa Inc  And when it comes to payment processors  there isn t much competition for Visa as it is recognized both within the United States and globally It s also worth pointing out that Visa s competitors like American Express Company  given the cyclical nature of the business  is exposed to lending delinquency risks  But  Visa s sole focus on payment processing means the company doesn t need to worry about delinquency The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings advanced 0 2  in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth for the current quarter and year are a healthy 15 7  and 15 6   respectively  The Zacks Rank  3 company has a Growth Score of B  It saw its shares rise 3 7  on a year to date basis compared to the Financial Transaction Services industry s gain of 2  Why Not Berkshire Hathaway Way back in 1962  Warren Buffett began acquiring stakes in Berkshire Hathaway after he figured a pattern in the price direction of its stock whenever the company closed a mill  Buffett acknowledged that the textile mill was losing money  which led him to expand into the insurance industry  The insurance business definitely paid off as evident from Berkshire s staggering return of more than 800  since inception Berkshire currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has moved 0 6  up over the past 90 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 68 1  compared with the Insurance   Property and Casualty industry s expected rally of 19 8   Berkshire has already outperformed the broader industry in the past six months   3 4  vs  0 2   Buffett Delves Deeper Into Telecom SpaceAfter purchasing shares of big names from the telecommunication space like Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ   DISH Network Corporation  NASDAQ DISH  and Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR   he has taken over Liberty Latin America Ltd  He now owns more than  1 billion worth of the broadband Internet  fixed line telephone and mobile and other communications service provider s total equity  Liberty Latin America currently has a Zacks Rank  2  while its shares have outperformed the Wireless National industry so far this year   14 1  vs 4 9    You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here Meanwhile  don t let Sirius XM Holdings Inc  s single digit share price baffle you  The obvious upper hand you get with investing in Sirius XM is that there is no other public company that has a satellite radio system in orbit  This gives the provider of satellite radio servicesa monopoly  while it is also making significant money from subscribers  Sirius XM listed 33 7 million subscribers in the most recent quarter who accounted for  1 16 billion of the  1 47 billion in collected revenues The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings moved 0 4  north in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 30  compared with the Broadcast Radio and Television industry s projected rally of 8 1   The Zacks Rank  3 stock has outperformed the broader industry in the last one year period   14 3  vs  12 7   Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens

104399,325914,LBTYA,Motor racing  Formula E faces moment of truth in season five,news,"By Alan Baldwin LONDON  Reuters    Formula E starts its fifth season next week  braced for a big breakthrough but already looking far down the road to a future when its all electric cars could rival Formula One machines and race on similar circuits  The futuristic Gen2  or second generation  cars that will debut in Saudi Arabia on Dec  15 now boast double the battery range  That means drivers can do a full distance without having to pit  jump out and change vehicles midway through a race  as they have had to up to now   I think season five is the big season for Formula E   chief executive Alejandro Agag told Reuters in an interview at his London headquarters   Season five is the moment of truth for Formula E   Now people are coming  assuming that this is a long term venture that is going to be playing a really huge role in the motorsports industry and in the car industry   added the Spaniard   And we cannot fail  We have new manufacturers  new sponsors  It s great  but it also means more responsibility   The technological step up will lend the series  whose shareholders include Discovery Communications  NASDAQ DISCA  and John Malone s Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA   greater credibility and burnish its credentials as a test bed for electric car manufacturers  The new cars are still far from Formula One pace  with the Gen2 accelerating from 0 100kph in 2 8 seconds compared to under two for an F1 car  The top speed of 280kph compares to Formula One s record of 372  but the gap is closing   Electric cars are going to go faster and faster   said Agag   I see us going now towards smaller batteries with the same amount of power  and ultra fast charging so maybe one or two pitstops during the race in generation three   This will mean less weight  even more power  so a lot more performance   And I think generation four or five can be at the same level as the Formula One cars today   TRACK TESTS Ultimately  he said  the time could also come when Formula E was ready to break away from being purely a city based street circuit series  where speeds are limited by track characteristics  The Spaniard said he and Jean Todt  president of the governing International Automobile Federation  FIA  had discussed a lot whether Formula E might one day feature on regular circuits   I think when the performance is there  we need to provide a platform  a laboratory for these electric cars to go to the limit   he said   At the same time racing in cities is part of our DNA   I see maybe a hybrid situation in which we keep some races in the cities but we do maybe three  four  five at racetracks to allow these cars really to express themselves  to show their level of performance    The Spaniard stated recently that he saw Formula One starting to feel the heat from Formula E in the next five years  with the electric series destined to become  the main motorsport in the world   Speaking to Reuters  he said his series    with manufacturers like Nissan  Citroen  BMW  Jaguar  Audi with Porsche and Mercedes set to join in 2019 20    had reason to feel confident but there was plenty of room for both championships   We are not competitors with Formula One and we are still always big fans of Formula One  But obviously the fact that we are still here and now probably in the best moment of our history  of course we feel more confident   he said   I don t think Formula One should be worried at all about Formula E   I think our rival is tennis  golf  football  Other sports  The better Formula One does  the better Formula E will do  And vice versa   MARIO KART Season Five will also feature a new  attack mode  or  hyperboost   introducing a new level of strategy with drivers going off the racing line in certain sectors to collect more power    as in the video game Mario Kart   I think the cars  just the look of the new cars is incredible  but the sound of the new cars is a lot more exciting   said Agag  summing up the draw of the new season   The attack mode I think is going to be super fun to watch   we ve just seen a glimpse of it in Valencia during the test and it looked amazing  but I m so excited to see this thing in action

104402,325917,LBTYA,Top Analyst Report For Amgen  TOTAL S A    Marriott,opinion,"Tuesday  February 20  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Amgen  AMGN   TOTAL  S A   TOT  and Marriott  MAR   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Amgen s shares have gained  6  over the past one year  outperforming the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry  which has declined  1 9  over the same period  Amgen had a rather poor quarter as it missed expectations for both earnings and sales and also issued lower than expected sales guidance for 2018  
The Zacks analyst likes Amgen s newer drugs   Prolia  Xgeva  Kyprolis   which are performing well  Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline and expects approval and launch of migraine candidate  Aimovig this year  However  Amgen has some challenges in store  given slowdown in sales of mature drugs like Enbrel  Aranesp and Neulasta  which are facing an array of branded and generic competitors  Volume growth of new drugs may not be enough to offset the lost sales due to the decline in mature brands  
While Neupogen is already facing U S  biosimilar competition  Neulasta  Epogen and Sensipar could start facing the same this year  Meanwhile  uptake of key new drug Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions 
 You can   
Shares of TOTAL S A  have gained  10  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks Integrated International Oil industry which has increased  6 8  over the same period  Fourth quarter earnings of the company were better than expected due to higher oil production and improvement in commodity prices  
Going forward  the company will benefit further from upstream startups and cost management initiatives  It continues to gain from strategic acquisitions and asset divestures  which will further strengthen the portfolio  The company is utilizing its strong cash flow generating capacity to strengthen its balance sheet  pay dividend and buy back shares  
However  operations in some politically troubled regions and increasing competition could impact the company s profitability  Due to its global presence  it is also exposed to risks associated with doing business abroad 
 You can   
Buy rated Marriott s shares have outperformed the Zacks Hotels industry over the last one year   the stock is up  57 4  vs   39 1  gain for the industry   Marriott s fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings beat expectations and rose 31 8  year over year  
The company is poised to grow on the back of the Starwood acquisition  arresting brand position  an increased demand for travel and significant international exposure  With this acquisition  Marriott became the world s largest hotel company  In fact  this buyout is likely to result in a bigger brand with increased scale and a robust development pipeline in the long run  
The Zacks analyst likes Marriott s rising North American business  sizeable international exposure and attractive brand position  Yet  lingering political uncertainties in key international markets and currency headwinds might continue to limit revenue growth  Moreover  integration risks linked to Starwood purchase is an added concern

Well that s what a selloff feels like  It s been a long time since we ve seen a drop like the one on Tuesday  The major indices started the session in the red and never even hinted that it might turn things around 

The Dow fell 1 37   or a little more than 360 points  to 26 076 9   it s biggest plunge since May of last year  The S P slipped 1 09  to 2822 4 and the NASDAQ was off 0 86  to 7402 5  This marks the second consecutive session of sharp pullbacks for stocks  which is also something we haven t experienced in a while 

Specific reasons for today s drop include rising bond yields and a rough session for healthcare  Generally though  the market has been running hot for a very long time and was primed to cool off  Jeremy has been talking about this pretty succinctly in Counterstrike for a while   Stocks were aggressively sold today  following the laws of gravity that I have been mentioning for the last week   In other words   what goes up  must come down 

Even with today s gutcheck  the major indices go into the final day of January with strong performances for the month  The S P and Dow are each up more than 5  and the NASDAQ has gained more than 7   But it will now be hard for the indices to continue their four week winning streak  Of course  there are several potentially market moving events in the next few days  including the State of the Union tonight  the Fed meeting  earnings reports for a few technology giants and tons of economic data   ending with Employment Situation on Friday 

In the portfolios  Counterstrike used the selloff to add more to a chip equipment maker  while Stocks Under  10 picked up a name that s in turnaround mode  Also  Surprise Trader had a double digit winner and Short List swapped out four names  Give it all a look below 

Today s Portfolio Highlights 

Counterstrike  During the short lived  tech wreck  last year  Jeremy took advantage of the plunge by buying a 5  allocation in Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   Shares of the equipment supplier for chip wafer processing had slipped despite a strong earnings report  And now with the market in the midst of its first real pullback of 2018  the editor saw a great opportunity to double down on this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and add another 5   In addition to its solid quarter and fundamentals  the chart is showing a Fib long setup for LRCX  Learn more about this move in the full writeup  By the way  Jeremy also covered half of Tennant  TNC  for an 8 9  profit 

Stocks Under  10  After a few quarters of falling below quarterly earnings estimates  Accuray  ARAY  appears to be turning the corner  The radiosurgery company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its most recent report and expects revenue to be at least flat with the final quarter  Earnings estimates ticked higher after the news and lifted the stock to Zacks Rank  2  Buy  status  Brian Bolan thinks this is a company on the rise and so he added it to the portfolio on Tuesday  Get more specifics in the full write up 

Surprise Trader  Earlier this month  Infosys  INFY  reported its sixth straight positive surprise  Shortly before the latest report  Dave added this IT services stock to the portfolio  The move really paid off as the editor sold it today for a return of 11 5   As for tomorrow  Dave says there s the potential for two big wins after the bell 

Zacks Short List  Four stocks were short covered in this week s adjustment  The names that left the portfolio include 

  Incyte Corp   INCY   3 5  
	  National Oilwell  NOV   0 3  
	  Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR 
	  Vertex Pharma  VRTX 

The new buys that replaced these names are 

  Akorn Inc   AKRX 
	  Baidu Inc   NASDAQ BIDU 
	  Fluor Corp   NYSE FLR 
	  Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA

104497,326012,LBTYA,Vodafone CEO hits back at D Telekom in spat over Liberty talks,news,"By Paul Sandle
BARCELONA  Reuters     Vodafone  s CEO Vittorio Colao said Deutsche Telekom s public stance against its plan to buy some assets from Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  was surprising  and he contested its assertion that Vodafone  LON VOD  wanted to shut down competition 
Vodafone said this month it was in early stage talks about buying Liberty Global s cable assets in some continental markets where they both operate  the chief one being Germany 
Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  CEO Tim Hoettges said last week that he thought a deal would be  totally unacceptable  during an earnings call with analysts  according to reports 
Colao said he had to be careful about what he said in response to avoid becoming personal 
 I was surprised by the comment from Tim   he told reporters at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday   I believe that competition is good  
He said the logic behind DT s opposition was interesting  given that it was the largest telco in Europe by market capitalization  and had the most connections into homes the Germany  which he said was Europe s best market 
 Why does us buying a regional cable company irritate him  I know why it irritates him  but it s not for the right reasons  
Colao declined to give an update on the progress of the talks  which had restarted after a previous attempt failed in 2015  although the two later came together in the Netherlands 
He said Britain  where Liberty s Virgin Media is the leading cable operator  was excluded from the talks because Vodafone was not as advanced in combining fixed line and mobile services in the country as it was in continental European markets 
 Our priority now is to continue our plan in the UK  to start our convergence in the UK   he said 
  But  I cannot conclude that in the future we might not also talk about the UK  
Colao  who was one of the major business leaders called into Number 10 Downing Street last year to talk about Brexit  said he had advised the government not to pursue a plan of  managed divergence  from European regulations in data after Britain leaves the European Union because it would damage the economy 
Britain is believed to favor mixed approach of  managed divergence  after it leaves  whereby it will follow EU rules in some sectors and diverge from them in others  European Council President Donald Tusk on Friday called the ideas floated so far  pure illusion

104500,326015,LBTYA,Lebara hooks up with WorldRemit in money transfer pact,news,"By Eric Auchard
LONDON  Reuters    WorldRemit will be the exclusive money transfer partner for international call provider Lebara under a deal announced on Tuesday by the London based brands  which are popular among immigrants to Europe 
Lebara offers mobile phone services via shops in six European countries  while WorldRemit enables immigrants to use digital remittances to send money home to families and friends  offering an alternative to more expensive options from firms such as Western Union and MoneyGram 
More than 3 million users of Lebara s calling and mobile money services will now have access to WorldRemit payment services on Lebara s site and mobile app  The company operates in Britain  Denmark  France  Germany  the Netherlands and Spain 
For WorldRemit  the partnership promises to accelerate its growth by giving it access to Lebara s network of 275 000 franchises and independent retailers  WorldRemit Chief Executive Ismail Ahmed told Reuters  It had 2 7 million active users in the last year and aims to reach 10 million by 2020 
The deal  the terms of which were not disclosed  follows months of restructuring by Lebara  which has faced competition from free messaging services such as Facebook  NASDAQ FB  s WhatsApp 
It was acquired last September by Swiss family office Palmarium  a private equity and real estate investment firm 
 We can bring something to WorldRemit and WorldRemit can bring something to us   Graeme Oxby  who joined Lebara as its CEO following the Palmarium acquisition  told Reuters in a telephone interview 
Oxby is a telecoms veteran who served as managing director of both Virgin Mobile and Three in Britain before becoming head of Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  s European operations 
Lebara has been the subject of recent media reports that questioned the departures of former executives and its progress in disposing of non core businesses 
In its 2017 results last week  Lebara updated previously announced plans to exit its non mobile businesses and to build up repeat customers rather than one off pay as you SIM card buyers  Oxby said the partnership  under with most of Lebara s existing remittance customers will be transferred to WorldRemit  demonstrates the progress Lebara is making 
 We see the WorldRemit services really being the dominant portion of our money related activities   Oxby said 
WorldRemit is paying Lebara an upfront fee to complete the partnership  a spokesman said  The deal involves paying Lebara for referring customers its way and an incentive scheme for Lebara shop owners to sell the co branded remittance services 
WorldRemit has raised  220 million since its founding in 2010 from investors including Accel Partners  LeapFrog Investments and Technology Crossover Ventures  TCV   William Blair acted as a financial adviser to WorldRemit ",2018-04-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/lebara-hooks-up-with-worldremit-in-money-transfer-pact-1387915,1387915

The proposed deal s main prize would be to bring together Vodafone s German cable operation with Unitymedia  Liberty s local unit  which operate in separate federal states and would  if combined  cover the country 
 The cable operators shouldn t be too sure of themselves   Jochen Homann  head of the Federal Network Agency  or BNetzA  told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview released ahead of publication on Monday 
In contrast to market leader Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn   the two operators do not have to open their networks for fast broadband internet connections 
 We are now examining whether and which regions cable  operators  have a dominant market position   there are regions where this appears no longer to be out of the question   Homann told FAZ 
 There  providers may be required to open up their infrastructure to other providers  Price controls would also be thinkable  
BNetzA has started a market investigation  results of which could be expected next year  the FAZ reported 
Vodafone confirmed in February it was in talks with John Malone s Liberty Global about buying some of the cable company s assets in the continental European countries where they both operate

	Contrary to popular belief  not all retailers are in trouble  Foot Locker  NYSE FL  proved that with its recent quarterly report  which prompted the editor to take a chance on Zumiez  ZUMZ   He thinks this specialty retailer has found  a nice little niche  and really likes its positive Earnings ESP for next week s report  ZUMZ was added with a 12 5  allocation as well  but Dave warns that this is a more  adventurous  pick with big risk reward possibilities  Read the full write up for more on today s moves Stocks Under  10  Shares of A10 Networks  ATEN  jumped by more than 6 5  today to  8  but Brian Bolan thinks this stock could test  9 by the end of the year  The company announced a solid quarterly report late last month  which included its 10th straight positive surprise  It also beat on the top line and announced a strong guidance  Earnings estimates for this year improved to a profit of 2 cents from a loss of 8 cents over the past 90 days  while next year has also seen a gigantic swing in the right direction  The editor thinks ATEN is rolling back to new highs and then some  so he picked it up for the portfolio on Tuesday  Get his full analysis in the complete write up Insider Trader  The portfolio is now fully invested heading into the homestretch of 2017  On Tuesday  Tracey put the remaining cash into specialty chemicals company Versum Materials  VSM   This stock is outpacing its industry because it specializes in products for semiconductor applications  which has been one of the hottest areas this year  Shares are up 37  year to date  but that didn t keep two directors from buying on Nov  16 during a small selloff  The editor considers it a very bullish signal when insiders buy at or near highs  Read the complete commentary for more Momentum Trader  It took a while for Dave to get comfortable buying oil stocks again  but he finally picked up the Columbian petroleum company Ecopetrol  EC  late last month  The stock has performed well  However  the editor doesn t like how it s just been hovering for a while  Therefore  he sold EC on Tuesday and banked a 12 5  gain in less than a month 
	Meanwhile  the editor also bought Mastercraft boats maker MCBC Holdings  MCFT  with a 12 5  allocation  Yep  it s starting to get cold outside  but Dave bought a boat company anyway  But don t forget that he once doubled up on a ski resort stock at summertime  Read more about today s moves and be ready for another buy soon

104508,326023,LBTYA,Nice Try  NASDAQ,opinion,"The tech heavy NASDAQ made a valiant effort on Tuesday to comeback from a couple of very rough sessions  but it ultimately failed to see the rally through to the end  The index spent the majority of the day on positive ground even as its counterparts slipped into the red  By the end of the day though  the NASDAQ too had given back all its gains and finished with a loss of 0 19  to 6762 2 
	The Dow had been making new all time highs while the other two major indices struggled  But today it joined the malaise as a late shift lower brought about a loss of 0 45  to 24 180 6  The S P also has a three session losing streak now after a slip of 0 37  to 2629 6  The selling to kickoff this week isn t really all that troubling to me  I ve set up some key levels to watch here on the S P 500   said Dave in Momentum Trader and Surprise Trader   I expect the levels to hold and will look to add exposure to the market should the market come down to retest them   Dave was one of the active editors on Tuesday  as he bought a company for Momentum Trader that s in the midst of a  proper pullback  with plenty of room to run higher from here  Also  Stocks Under  10 added an energy name  while Short List swapped out two positions in its weekly realignment  Read the highlights section below for more on these moves Today s Portfolio Highlights  Momentum Trader  As mentioned several times in the last few days  this pullback in tech is opening some intriguing opportunities  For example  SolarEdge  SEDG  has undergone a  proper pullback to the 50 day   and Dave decided to capitalize on the move with a 12 5  allocation in the name  SEDG is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that develops inverter systems for solar photovoltaic installations  The company has pulled back to its 50 day moving average  but the editor believes the stock is oversold and due for a bounce from this level  Read the full write up for more on this new buy 
	Zacks Short List  Both of the stocks that were short covered in this week s adjustment were positive  The portfolio got out of Yandex  YNDX   6 8   and Sina Corp  SINA   7 9    The new buys that replaced these names are  Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  and Vulcan Materials  VMC   Learn more about this emotion free portfolio that takes advantage of falling and volatile markets by reading the Short List Trader Guide Stocks Under  10  The portfolio swapped out energy names on Tuesday  as Brian Bolan got rid of the underperforming Hornbeck Offshore Services  HOS  and replaced it with SunPower  SPWR   This new buy isn t as dependent on oil and has put together three straight quarters of positive surprises  SPWR makes silicon solar cells and solar panels  so the recent strong guidance from First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  is a good sign  Yet  shares of the company have slipped of late  The editor sees this as a great time to buy a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  with a bright future  The complete commentary has more on this new addition Counterstrike   I think the question coming into today was if this selling was simply sector rotation or is tech a canary in the coal mine  We have seen this before  earlier in the year   after a couple weeks of aggressive selling  tech eventually moved to all time highs  This morning things looked bleak for tech  Right before the open  we saw more selling  The first couple minutes stocks like NVDA  LRCX  NFLX  TSLA and GOOGL all made new weekly lows  However  a massive buy program was turned on like a light switch and all the tech stocks exploded higher  The Nasdaq futures  NQ  saw a 100 handle move higher in the first hour and a half  At the same time  retail and financials were weak  The conclusion I have after today s action is we are simply seeing more rotation  While the Nasdaq was strong the S P was weak  the exact opposite of yesterday off the open  This type of divergence can drive a trader nuts as they try to figure it out  Rather than overthinking it  I think it s best to reduce position size until correlations normalize and things make sense again      Jeremy Mullin

104542,326057,LBTYA,European telecoms companies  hopes of lighter regulation dashed by EU,news,"By Julia Fioretti BRUSSELS  Reuters    European Union lawmakers have dashed large telecoms companies  hopes for lighter regulation as part of efforts to encourage investment in superfast internet networks  The EU wants expansion of fiber optic networks to meet growing demand for data services and ensure Europe does not lag behind other regions in technological developments  but it is torn on the right balance between fostering competition and relaxing rules that force operators to open up their networks to competitors  The European Parliament s Industry committee voted on Monday to limit the regulatory sweeteners given to operators investing in new networks together and gave regulators greater powers to force companies to give rivals access to their networks  The costs of running optic fiber into households are high and telecoms operators such as Orange  Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  and  Telecom Italia   MI TLIT  have long complained that the current rules forcing them to open up their networks to competitors at regulated prices do not allow them a decent return on investment  The European Commission sought to entice them to put their hands in their pockets by offering lighter rules if they co invested with rivals  but the lawmakers have tightened the conditions under which they could benefit from softer regulation  which operators say would discourage them from considering joint investment  Smaller telecoms operators such as TalkTalk and Fastweb  SCMNSF UL  had warned that the proposed co investment rules would be detrimental to competition  which they say is the real driver for investment  Monday s vote is not final and will need to be reconciled with the position adopted by member states on planned telecoms reforms still under discussion  The lawmakers also voted to give telecoms regulators the power to force operators to open up their networks to rivals where they hold a jointly dominant position  which would open the possibility for cable operators such as Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  to be regulated more tightly  Only companies with significant market power    usually a former state monopoly    are currently forced to give rivals access at regulated prices  The Commission had argued against the measure  saying it could hamper the expansion of fiber networks  which can deliver speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second  and impose a heavy regulatory burden on new networks in countries such as France  Spain and Portugal  The lawmakers also voted to cap call charges between member states at the price of domestic calls  Consumer groups have argued that  after the abolition of mobile roaming charges for using a mobile phone abroad  additional fees for calling someone in another country should also be scrapped  Telecoms lobbying group ETNO  which represents companies like Orange   Telefonica   MC TEF  and Deutsche Telekom  said it was  extremely concerned  by law s progress  
 Today  all the main investment conducive measures   appear under threat and some investment distracting proposals have been introduced in the legislative debate  Unless this departure from the original objectives is swiftly addressed  we risk sending a negative signal to the investment community  in a major regulatory about face   ETNO said in a statement ",2017-10-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/european-telecoms-companies-hopes-of-lighter-regulation-dashed-by-eu-535667,535667

You can see 
Pharmaceutical stocks have been under pressure since last year on pricing and regulatory concerns and Eli Lily shares have been no different  That said  the stock has done modestly better than the peer group  it is up  12 2  year to date vs   10 9  gain for the Zacks Pharma industry and  9 5  increase for the Zacks Medical sector as a whole  Lilly s second quarter 2017 results were strong with the company beating estimates on both counts 
The company also raised its sales and earnings outlook for the year  Lilly s new products like Trulicity  Taltz  Basaglar  Cyramza  Jardiance and Lartruvo have been performing well and the trend is expected to continue  The Zacks analyst is encouraged by the fact that Lilly expects to launch 20 new products between 2014 and 2023  including at least two new indications line extensions on an average every year 
However  Alimta will continue to be impacted by competition  Other headwinds include competition from immuno oncology agents as well as loss of exclusivity for many drugs

Oil related stocks have been under pressure this year on stubborn global crude glut and Halliburton shares have been no different  That said  the stock has done better than the peer group  it is down  23 6  in 2017 vs   31 2  loss for the Zacks Oil Field Services industry 
The world s No  2 oilfield services provider reported strong Q2 profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America  Halliburton s 12th consecutive quarterly beat was aided by cost saving initiatives  HAL is also set to gain from the Summit ESP buyout on account of the latter s expertise in extending the life of shale wells 
However  pricing pressure across the international markets is likely to dampen investor confidence  Moreover  with the failure of the BHI acquisition  HAL had to book a massive  3 5 billion in breakup charges that stretched its balance sheet  Hence  the Zacks analyst thinks investors should wait for a better entry point before buying shares in HAL 
 You can  
Monster Beverage s shares have gained  17 4  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Soft Drink industry s gain of  13 9  during the same period  Monster Beverage s earnings missed expectations but increased 6  year over year on higher sales  The international segment posted strong results and looks well positioned for the days ahead 
The Zacks analyst likes the fact that the company has several new products lined up for the remaining of 2017 which are likely to boost sales  The company successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy Drinks to Coca Cola bottlers in a number of markets in the quarter and expects further transitions and launches in the second half of the year  However  operating expenses continue to rise  Results were also hurt by unfavorable currency rates which dented quarterly net sales

104589,326104,LBTYA,Top EU court says Pirate Bay may be breaching copyright rules,news,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS  Reuters    Swedish website Pirate Bay may have to amend its file sharing practices after Europe s top court said it may be breaking copyright rules by helping users download films  TV shows and music for free 
File sharing websites such as Pirate Bay and Torrentz have angered music and film companies by providing a platform where users can illegally share films and videos over the internet  costing content providers millions of euros in lost revenue 
The Luxembourg based Court of Justice of the EU  ECJ  said Pirate Bay s role as a host meant it may be liable for web piracy 
 Making available and managing an online platform for sharing copyright protected works  such as  The Pirate Bay   may constitute an infringement of copyright   judges said 
 Even if the works in question are placed online by the users of the online sharing platform  the operators of that platform play an essential role in making those works available   they said 
Pirate Bay could not immediately be reached for comment 
The court ruling came after Dutch industry group Stichting Brein asked a Dutch court to order internet service providers XS4LL and Ziggo  which is owned by Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA   to block Pirate Bay 
The Dutch court subsequently asked for the ECJ s guidance

104601,326116,LBTYA,Should Value Investors Consider Liberty Global  LBTYA  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Liberty Global plc   NASDAQ LBTYA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Liberty Global has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 63  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 38  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Liberty Global s current PE ratio way below its midpoint  which is 69 67  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Cable Television industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 70  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Liberty Global has a P S ratio of about 1 42  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Liberty Global currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes LBTYA a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 10  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 9 35  Clearly  LBTYA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Liberty Global might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives Liberty Global a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past thirty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has deteriorated 55 1  in the past one month  while the full year estimate has fallen about 2 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Liberty Global PLC Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLiberty Global is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 25  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  However  over the past one year  the Zacks Cable Television sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Stocks to Ride a 588  Revenue

104634,326149,LBTYA,Vodafone pays the price for inertia as rivals pull ahead,news,"By Sophie Sassard and Paul Sandle
LONDON  Reuters    British mobile operator  Vodafone   LON VOD  risks being left on the sidelines as rivals converge to break free from just selling ever cheaper data bundles and become internet companies offering combined services from phones to TV to broadband 
Vodafone expanded at breakneck speed through audacious takeovers and now has nearly half a billion mobile customers and operations in about 30 countries  yet investors worry it is not adapting quickly enough to the fast changing landscape 
Long cherished for its dividend yield  Vodafone shares are trading at a discount by most measures for the first time in more than three years and worries about cashflow in a cut throat mobile market are reviving calls for a merger to transform it into a European communications powerhouse once again 
 It s fair to say Vodafone were too slow to appreciate the direction that the market was going in terms of the need to be able to offer genuinely converged products  and to have favorable access to fixed line networks and  ideally  to own those networks   said one of the company s 10 biggest shareholders 
 The longer they wait the more time you are losing ground to others   said the investor  who declined to be named 
Vodafone s home British market epitomizes the broader challenges the company faces  Former fixed line phone monopoly BT and satellite TV pioneer Sky have spread their wings to offer telecoms  broadband and TV bundles 
Rupert Murdoch s Twenty First Century Fox is also buying Sky to expand its global media empire while BT has muscled in on Sky s turf  bidding aggressively to win the rights to broadcast top soccer matches 
In an increasingly crowded marketplace  European focused cable firm Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA   which operates in Britain as Virgin Media  also offers mobile  broadband and entertainment services in one package   and uses its own fixed line network 
And while rivals keep offering more products   Sky launched mobile services in Britain at the end of last year   Vodafone put its long awaited TV launch on hold in February to tackle increasing competition in its traditional product lines 
LIBERTY DEAL
For years  investors have hoped Vodafone would combine with Liberty Global  and while a joint venture between the two in the Netherlands is showing signs of success  the valuation of an overall deal has proved a stumbling block in the past 
Price still appears to be an issue and Vodafone says there are no talks with Liberty at the moment 
Vittorio Colao  who has been Vodafone s chief executive since 2008  said last week at a trade fair in Barcelona that a Liberty merger remained an attractive proposition  especially if the European Union wanted to create a real pan European player 
But Liberty s owner John Malone  would be reluctant to pay any kind of premium for Vodafone  and would instead expect the British company to make the running  a source close to the American cable tycoon said 
 Malone would happily sell at a big premium but Vodafone can t afford it   the source told Reuters 
Analysts at Haitong Securities also say that when Liberty executives are asked about a possible merger with Vodafone  they talk up their own strong growth forecasts and question Vodafone s strategy 
Another shareholder in Vodafone said there would be no problem combining the British firm s network with Liberty s  The challenge would be in combining their balance sheets as the two companies have a very different approach to debt 
Liberty has a debt to earnings ratio of 5 7 for the next financial year whereas Vodafone s is 3 5 times  And while Vodafone is one of the dividend champions in the FTSE 100 index of blue chip companies  Liberty does not pay one 
The companies  different growth rates would also make it hard to agree on a valuation for any deal  with Liberty s revenues up 9 5 percent last year and Vodafone s only expected to increase by about 3 percent 
 Liberty is in a good place  the business is growing well   said a source close to Liberty Global   Why would you pay a premium to acquire a low growth business which has a lot of challenges ahead  
MARKET BY MARKET
Vodafone says moving beyond mobile services and bringing telecoms and multimedia services together is at the heart of its strategy and it is adding 350 000 to 400 000 customers each quarter to make it Europe s fastest growing broadband operator 
Colao says the demand for data on its 4G mobile networks has boosted many of its European markets  though he is taking a cautious market by market approach to convergence 
Vodafone has been building fiber networks in countries such as Spain  Portugal and Italy  places where it can team up with others such as energy firms and where it says regulators create the right conditions to make a return on investment 
It has also bought cable networks in Spain and Germany but in other countries  Vodafone still has to use the fixed line networks of former state run telecoms firms  notably in Britain where it relies on BT 
In quarterly results published in February  Vodafone nudged down its earnings forecasts for the year to March 31 because of pressures in India and Britain  Like for like revenue in Britain fell 3 2 percent while there are other clouds on the horizon in the shape of new competitors elsewhere 
In India  Vodafone  like all the established players  is being hammered by new entrant Reliance Jio s free offers  prompting the British firm to enter merger talks with rival Idea Cellular  a move seen by some analysts as a retreat 
In Italy  entrepreneur Xavier Niel  who rocked the French market with unbeatable offers five years ago  is set to launch mobile services this year and sources say he is confident his cheap deals will appeal to economically constrained Italians 
Some analysts have also questioned whether the increasingly competitive environment could put pressure on Vodafone s dividend  which has delivered an average yield of more than 5 percent a year over the last five years 
 Vodafone s dividend yield is a key reason for investors to hold this stock  so heightened risks around Vodafone s ability to pay and sustain its dividend are a concern to us   said brokerage Beaufort Securities  which has downgraded its recommendation on Vodafone stock to Hold 
TAKEOVER CANDIDATE 
Investment bank Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  said that its meetings with investors in Vodafone suggested sentiment towards the British company was at a long term low as shareholders worried about future cashflow 
Colao said in February that Vodafone s plans in India  which would leave it with a stake in the country s leading mobile operator  and a drive to improve customer service in Britain should help cashflow 
But some investors say the Indian move  which comes after Vodafone listed its main African operations separately  would bring its center of gravity closer to Europe  making it crucial to get convergence right  or risk becoming a target 
 You are left with a European business that seems to be showing the early signs of recovery  which would make the whole company a takeover candidate   the second shareholder said 
The catalyst may come from Vodafone s arch mobile rival in Britain  O2  which is owned by Spain s  Telefonica   MC TEF  
Liberty Global provides its Virgin mobile services in Britain by renting capacity from a rival network  But were it to show an interest in buying O2 to add a mobile network to its fixed line grid  the cautious Colao could be forced to move  One banker who has worked with Vodafone in the past said he did expect it to merge with Liberty  eventually 

But he said that if Vodafone misses out  a company that has shaped the mobile industry since its launch in 1991 to become the second biggest in the world could end up being dismantled by more fleet footed multimedia rivals ",2017-03-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/vodafone-pays-the-price-for-inertia-as-rivals-pull-ahead-465270,465270
104635,326150,LBTYA,German industry warns against underinvestment in fiber telecom links,news,By Georgina Prodhan and Harro Ten Wolde FRANKFURT  Reuters    Germany s powerful engineering industry fears the country will miss out on becoming a global power in digital manufacturing due to complacency about investing in a high speed  fiber based telecoms network  Taking aim at the government  the industry s VDMA lobby says Germany risks heading into an industrial dead end with the strategy for data connections in remoter areas  where many of its often small but world class engineering firms are based  In a position paper seen by Reuters  the association questions how former state monopoly Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  is being allowed to overhaul its old copper wire network  This  it believes  discourages competition and the rolling out of faster  but more expensive  fiber connections  Deutsche Telekom is relying heavily on vectoring  a technique which improves transmission speeds on the  last mile  of copper wire linking fiber connections at the street cabinet to homes and businesses  The VDMA  which represents thousands of firms with combined annual revenue of over  200 billion  regards this as a stop gap and says fiber connections right to the destination building are the only way to meet the medium term demands of German industry   The risk is that a bridging technology like vectoring  when it is implemented in a monopolistic way  will lead Germany as an industrial location into a cul de sac in a few years   it said in the position paper this month  It is not happy that for technical reasons only Deutsche Telekom can provide the upgraded copper links   In the worst case  the monopoly supplier would rest on its laurels with vectoring technology and neglect further investments   The document is for internal circulation but  with Germany lagging many competitors in Europe and Asia in providing fiber connections  the paper s author Johannes Gernandt says the government in Berlin should take note   They have to think further ahead now   he told Reuters  REASONABLE TIMEFRAME Deutsche Telekom  in which the government holds 32 percent  says vectoring allows it to do much more  much faster   Many homes and companies would be stuck with slow internet for many more years   a spokesman said   This way  we can guarantee that households now will have fast internet within a reasonable timeframe   At stake is Berlin s Industrie 4 0 strategy to promote digital manufacturing  This promises to enable leaps in the speed of developing products  as well as technology that detects faults and fixes machines before they break down or that allows parts to tell assembly lines how they need to be put together  All this needs real time or close to real time data connections  but estimates for the cost of connecting every German building with fiber range from 60 100 billion euros  Germany has a particular problem  Many of its famed  Mittelstand  manufacturers   firms that are small or medium sized but globally competitive   are spread out in country towns across the country and therefore costly to connect  Germany is expected to be one of Europe s last nations   along with Italy and Britain  which are also pursuing vectoring   to reach  fiber maturity   The FTTH Council Europe  which lobbies for access to high speed networks  defines this as 20 percent of households having a fiber connection  The German level is now about 2 percent and FTTH expects it to reach 20 percent only after 2022  Japan and South Korea achieved this in 2007  The government has promised every household a download speed of at least 50 megabits per second  Mbps  by 2018   ample for an average home but not for smart factories in which every machine part will be connected   Germany has achieved 75 percent coverage so far  but in the countryside it is just 34 percent  That is where many Mittelstand firms like family owned Harting operate   Harting supplies customers worldwide with advanced connectors and network technology  employing 4 000 people in Espelkamp  a town of 25 000 in North Rhine Westphalia  Harting has high speed broadband at its headquarters but it s different story in the surrounding countryside where many of its staff live  Here access is as slow as 10 Mbps  This means software developers often cannot work remotely from home   People at different sites need to work together  That s a very important part of digital transformation   said head of public relations Detlef Sieverdingbeck  Harting is also having trouble attracting top staff when they and their families expect big city standard connections   You need to get talent from the hotspots  from the universities   he said   You can t have them coming here and then wonder why they are appalled by the lack of broadband and disappointed to find they re living in a backward region    GIGABIT SOCIETY The government launched an initiative last month to attract 100 billion euros of public and private investment to turn Germany into a  gigabit society  by 2025   20 times the 50 Mbps it is promising by next year   Berlin is offering extra subsidies to supplement the 8 billion euros it expects the industry to invest annually  about half from Deutsche Telekom  The federal and local governments have already put up around 4 billion since 2015 to subsidize provision of fast broadband in hard to reach rural areas  Take up  however  has been only about a quarter   The model isn t working   said Gernandt  Critics say it is too complicated to secure the necessary funding from federal and state agencies  The transport and infrastructure ministry declined to comment beyond what minister Alexander Dobrindt said last month   We have determined that with our aid program we have achieved a very high response from the underserviced regions   he said  Stuart Mitchell  founder of UK based boutique fund SW Mitchell Capital  is not worried that the government will push Deutsche Telekom into making costly major investments in fiber   I m not so sure of the necessity to go to fiber in the end   he told Reuters   Mitchell says he has made 35 percent on his Deutsche Telekom investment in the past three to four years   The principal competition in Germany for fast internet connections comes from cable providers  Vodafone   LON VOD   Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  and smaller Tele Columbus  Other companies including United Internet and some energy utilities have their own fiber networks  Some competitors have tried but so far failed in legal actions to loosen Deutsche Telekom s grip  They say they need a level playing field to make large investments   The investors are ready but they need a long term  predictable framework   said Rene Obermann  an ex Deutsche Telekom chief executive and now a partner at private equity firm Warburg Pincus  the majority owner of German fiber network builder Inexio  Recently  Berlin has emphasized the role that fifth generation  5G  mobile networks   unlikely to be deployed in Germany until the middle of next decade   will play in enabling technological trends such as self driving cars  The radio frequencies for 5G may be auctioned next year and telecom providers will need a fiber backbone connecting the cell sites to begin building the mobile networks around 2020  In Britain  incumbent BT is also rolling out vectoring and few new fiber connections are being built by BT or rivals for the last mile  France s Orange began rolling out vectoring in 2013  Italy is trying to promote competition by developing multi operator vectoring that would allow equal access for all participants  Critics  including the European Commission  say this risks delaying network upgrades  Britain ranks 16th in the world with an average broadband download speed of 16 3 Mbps  France 52nd at 10 0 Mbps and Italy 58th at 8 7 Mbps  according to U S  web traffic delivery leader Akamai  Germany ranks 25th in the world with an average speed of 14 6 Mbps    1   0 9298 euros

104638,326153,LBTYA,DOCSIS 3 1  The Next Big Thing In Global Cable TV Industry,opinion,"The need to remain connected is essentially human  An era of digitization and technology is built on this need  It is here that telecommunications come to the fore as a necessary utility  The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecom space in an otherwise tough environment 
With the global telecom industry continuously evolving  companies in the league are fighting it out to stay ahead in the competition  The latest in the league is the newly launched DOCSIS 3 1 technology 
DOCSIS 3 1 versus DOCSIS 3 0  
DOCSIS  Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification  is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high speed broadband connections  This technology was specifically designed to be the cable TV industry s answer to high speed wireless and fiber based wireline networks of telecom operators  The old generation DOCSIS 3 0 technology has helped cable TV operators compete in the race for the fastest Internet speed available in the market 
The next generation DOCSIS 3 1 standard is an improved formulation of the existing DOCSIS 3 0  Theoretically  while DOCSIS 3 0 supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds  DOCSIS 3 1 offers as high as 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities  Additionally  DOCSIS 3 1 comes with several operational benefits 
The technology is also backward compatible  allowing the present hybrid fiber coaxial cable lines to allow such high Internet speed by simply switching to a DOCSIS 3 1 compatible modem  Although FTTH has the advantage of providing unlimited bandwidth  backward compatibility is a major advantage of DOCSIS 3 1  This allows cable MSOs to provide high speed Gigabit broadband to customers  without having to incur additional digging or other cable laying costs  unlike FTTH providers  This is sure to boost margins of cable MSOs 
Major Players
In the U S   the largest cable MSO  multi service operator  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   is already deploying DOCSIS 3 1 network in several markets  Leading European cable MSO Liberty Global plc    NASDAQ LBTYA   has decided to install DOCSIS 3 1 infrastructure from 2017 
Moreover  several networking equipment companies have unveiled their strategies for helping cable MSOs transition to  DAA  distributed access architectures  DAA is will pave the way for widespread delivery of high bandwidth services that are increasingly controlled by software

	The need to remain connected is essentially human  An era of digitization and technology is built on this need  It is here that telecommunications come to the fore as a necessary utility  The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecom space in an otherwise tough environment 

	With the global telecom industry continuously evolving  companies in the league are fighting it out to stay ahead in the competition  The latest in the league is the newly launched DOCSIS 3 1 technology 

DOCSIS 3 1 versus DOCSIS 3 0 

	DOCSIS  Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification  is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high speed broadband connections  This technology was specifically designed to be the cable TV industry s answer to high speed wireless and fiber based wireline networks of telecom operators  The old generation DOCSIS 3 0 technology has helped cable TV operators compete in the race for the fastest Internet speed available in the market 

	The next generation DOCSIS 3 1 standard is an improved formulation of the existing DOCSIS 3 0  Theoretically  while DOCSIS 3 0 supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds  DOCSIS 3 1 offers as high as 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities  Additionally  DOCSIS 3 1 comes with several operational benefits 

	The technology is also backward compatible  allowing the present hybrid fiber coaxial cable lines to allow such high Internet speed by simply switching to a DOCSIS 3 1 compatible modem  Although FTTH has the advantage of providing unlimited bandwidth  backward compatibility is a major advantage of DOCSIS 3 1  This allows cable MSOs to provide high speed Gigabit broadband to customers  without having to incur additional digging or other cable laying costs  unlike FTTH providers  This is sure to boost margins of cable MSOs 

Major Players

	In the U S   the largest cable MSO  multi service operator  Comcast Corp   NASDAQ      is already deploying DOCSIS 3 1 network in several markets  Leading European cable MSO Liberty Global plc   NASDAQ      has decided to install DOCSIS 3 1 infrastructure from 2017 

	Moreover  several networking equipment companies have unveiled their strategies for helping cable MSOs transition to  DAA  distributed access architectures  DAA is will pave the way for widespread delivery of high bandwidth services that are increasingly controlled by software 

	A few of these companies are Harmonic Inc   NASDAQ      Nokia Corp   NYSE      and Casa Systems Inc  Harmonic currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

 But I think Formula One has such a strong tradition that it will continue in the future  Formula E may be the main championship at one point in 50 years or 60 years  but only time will tell  ",2016-09-27,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/agag-committed-to-formula-e,-rules-out-f1-role-428730",428730

104681,326196,LBTYA,U S  600 MHz Spectrum Auction Witnesses Stepped up Bidding,opinion,"The second part of the 600 MHz low band wireless spectrum auction  popularly known as Incentive Auction  witnessed bids of over  11 5 billion in the first week after the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC  opened it on Aug 16  The seventh round of bidding was completed on last Friday 
The Incentive Auction  which was initiated by the FCC on Mar 29  2016  completed its first part early last month  In the first part  which was essentially a reverse auction  the airwaves were freed by TV broadcasters who no longer had any productive use of the same  The TV broadcasters had agreed to free a substantial amount of 126 MHz of spectrums for a massive  86 4 billion 
In the second part of the auction process  the FCC will re sell these airwaves to wireless operators  cable MSOs  multi service operators  or tech firms through competitive bidding  The second part is thus evidently known as forward auction  Needless to say  the total bid price of the forward auction must reach at least  86 4 billion for the Incentive Auction to be successful 
The FCC has received as many as 62 applications for the second part of the Incentive Auction  All 62 bidders have made upfront payments  Important bidders include national telecom giants Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    AT T Inc    NYSE T    and T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T    satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp    NASDAQ DISH   and cable MSOs  multi service operators  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   and Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  Inc 
Low band spectrum is essential for wireless operators as the signals can be transmitted over longer distances and through brick and mortar walls in cities  However  several industry experts believe that telecom operators may be unwilling to shell out such a hefty sum for low band airwaves 
Some industry watchers have also predicted that telecom operators may need around 70 MHz to 80 MHz of spectrums in the 600 MHz bands instead of the total freed up 126 MHz airwaves  In such a scenario  the FCC may have to conduct another round of reverse auction for a reduced volume of spectrum at lower prices 
The FCC was initially hopeful of completing the Incentive Auction process by the end of the third quarter of 2016  However  industry watchers are now expecting it to be much more prolonged and may continue till early 2017  Notably  the freed spectrums cannot be utilized commercially before 2020 ",2016-08-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-600-mhz-spectrum-auction-witnesses-stepped-up-bidding-200149603,200149603

104685,326200,LBTYA,U S  FCC Initiates Stage 2 Of The 600 MHz Spectrum Auction,opinion,U S  telecom regulator  the Federal Communications Commission  FCC   yesterday  initiated stage 2 of the second part of the ongoing 600 MHz low band wireless spectrum auction  popularly known as    Incentive Auction  Stage 1 of the Incentive Auction witnessed total bids worth  23 billion after the twenty seventh round of bidding  Notably  the FCC s first Final Stage Rule was that the minimum bid total should reach  15 9 billion for the spectrum auction to continue The Incentive Auction  which was initiated by the FCC on Mar 29  2016  completed its first part in Jul 2016  In this part  which was essentially a reverse auction  the airwaves were freed by TV broadcasters who no longer had any productive use of the same  The TV broadcasters had agreed to free a substantial 126 MHz of spectrums for a massive  86 4 billion As per the Final Stage Rule of the FCC  the proceeds from the forward auction  net of bidding credits and impairment discounts  must be sufficient to cover Incentive Auction costs  These costs include the aggregate of broadcaster clearing costs  approximately  226 million to cover the FCC s costs for conducting the auction and  1 75 billion for the TV Broadcaster Repacking Fund   Accordingly  the forward phase of the Incentive Auction must generate  88 4 billion for the whole process to be successful The FCC has received as many as 62 applications for the second part of the Incentive Auction  All 62 bidders have made upfront payments  Important bidders include national telecom giants Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    AT T Inc    NYSE T    and T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T    satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp    NASDAQ DISH   and cable MSOs  multi service operators  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   and Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  Inc  Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  In yesterday s auction procedure  the FCC reduced the event clearing spectrum size to 114 MHz instead of 126 MHz fixed earlier  However  99 6  of the spectrum offered in this stage will be completely unimpaired compared with 97  that offered in the first stage  Importantly  during this stage of the bidding process  the FCC will negotiate with TV broadcasters to determine how much spectrum they will release to the  forward  portion of this event and at what price Low band spectrum is essential for wireless operators as the signals can be transmitted over longer distances and through brick and mortar walls in cities  However  several industry experts believe that telecom operators may be unwilling to shell out such a hefty sum for low band airwaves Some industry watchers have also predicted that telecom operators might need around 70 MHz to 80 MHz of spectrums in the 600 MHz bands instead of the total freed up 126 MHz airwaves  In such a scenario  the FCC might have to conduct another round of reverse auction for a reduced volume of spectrum at lower prices The FCC was initially hopeful of completing the Incentive Auction process by the end of the third quarter of 2016  However  industry watchers are now expecting it to be more prolonged and continued till early 2017  Notably  the freed spectrums cannot be utilized commercially before 2020 Interested in IPOs  Check out the special edition of Zacks Friday Finish Line below  where Editor Maddy Johnson and Content Writer Ryan McQueeney interview Kathleen Smith of Renaissance Capital about the IPO market in 2016  see   Where Do Zacks  Investment Ideas Come From You are welcome to download the full  up to the minute list of 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks free of charge  There is no better place to start your own stock search  Plus you can access the full list of must avoid Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sells  and other private research ,2016-09-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-fcc-initiates-stage-2-of-the-600-mhz-spectrum-auction-200153490,200153490
104686,326201,LBTYA,Liberty Global To Carry Out DOCSIS 3 1 Services In 2017,opinion,"Major cable MSOs  multi service operators  across the world are gradually deploying high speed Wideband network based on the DCOSIS 3 1 technology  The latest addition in this list is Liberty Global plc    NASDAQ LBTYA    a leading cable MSO with operations in Europe and Latin America  The company recently announced that it will launch its first DOCSIS 3 1 service in 2017 
DOCSIS 3 1 versus DOCSIS 3 0  
DOCSIS  Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification  is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high speed broadband connections  This technology was specifically designed to be the cable TV industry s answer to high speed wireless and fiber based wireline networks of telecom operators  The currently available DOCSIS 3 0 technology has helped cable TV operators compete in the race for the fastest Internet speed available in the market 
The DOCSIS 3 1 standard is an improved formulation of the existing DOCSIS 3 0  Theoretically  while DOCSIS 3 0 supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds  DOCSIS 3 1 offers as high as 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities  Additionally  DOCSIS 3 1 comes with several operational benefits 
The technology is also backward compatible  allowing the present hybrid fiber coaxial cable lines to allow such high Internet speed by simply switching to a DOCSIS 3 1 compatible modem  Although FTTH has the advantage of providing unlimited bandwidth  backward compatibility is a major advantage of DOCSIS 3 1  which allows cable MSOs to provide high speed Gigabit broadband to customers  without having to incur additional digging or other cable laying costs  unlike FTTH providers  This is sure to boost margins of cable MSOs 
The Bottom Line
Recently  increased cord cutting has put pressure on the pay TV industry  leaving them looking for alternatives for revenue generation  DOCSIS 3 1 is facilitating cable MSOs to explore new markets  The slump in the basic video market is being compensated by broadband services in the cable telephony and high speed Internet markets  Escalating demand for TVEverywhere  watching movie on the Internet  has made DOCSIS 3 1 essential for cable MSOs  In addition  demand for online gaming and downloading of various multimedia applications have also increased 
In the U S   leading cable MSO  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   is aggressively deploying DOCSIS 3 1 networks  Meanwhile  the DOCSIS 3 1 cable modem market is expected to become increasingly competitive with the presence of large players like ARRIS International plc   NASDAQ ARRS   and Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO

104719,326234,LBTYA,EU blocks Hutchison s deal to buy Telefonica s O2 UK,news,By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS  Reuters    The European Union s competition regulator blocked on Wednesday CK Hutchison Holdings   HK 0001  plan to become Britain s biggest mobile telecoms network operator  in a decision which also cast doubts on whether it can still win approval for another deal in Italy  The European Commission said allowing Hutchison s 10 3 billion pound   14 9 billion  acquisition of O2 UK from Spain s  Telefonica   MC TEF  would have led to higher British mobile prices  as it left just two rival network operators   BT Group s  L BT  newly acquired EE  and  Vodafone   L VOD   Hutchison is also awaiting a ruling on the agreed 21 8 billion euro   24 8 billion  merger of its Italian subsidiary 3 Italia with Vimpelcom s  O VIP  Wind to create a stronger rival to  Telecom Italia   MI TLIT  and Vodafone  L VOD   Hutchison said it was disappointed by the Commission s decision on its O2 deal and would consider its options  including a possible legal challenge   It also said it would now focus on working with the Commission to secure clearance of the proposed merger of Wind and 3 Italia  The collapse of the British deal is also a blow to Telefonica  which was selling O2 to cut its 50 billion euros of debt  but Wednesday s announcement did not come as a surprise as the deal was already expected to be blocked last month  according to sources familiar with the matter  A precedent was set in September when TeliaSonera  and  Telenor   OL TEL  scrapped a merger in Denmark after European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said she believed that the national market needed at least four mobile network operators to maintain competition  Telefonica said last month it had plenty of options for O2 UK if the Hutchison deal fell through  including finding another buyer for all or part of the business  a stock market listing  or investing further in the subsidiary  Ronan Dunne  chief executive of O2 UK  said on Wednesday he would evaluate options for the group once the agreement with Hutchison has lapsed at the end of June  But he said the strength of the O2 brand in Britain meant there was no pressure to strike a deal with another operator   There s a strong role that can be played by a pure mobile operator if it has the right quality in place   he told reporters   I am hugely excited about the prospects for us as a business and for the sector itself  and in those circumstances we are in an even stronger position than we were 15 to 18 months ago   On Tuesday cable group Liberty Global  O LBTYA  said it would consider buying O2 UK if Brussels blocked the Hutchison deal but said it also valued the flexibility it had in its current strategy of being a virtual mobile operator  France s  Iliad   PA ILD   the owner of Free Mobile  is also interested in the British market  a source familiar with the situation said in January   The European Commission said on Wednesday combining Hutchison s Three UK and O2 UK would have created a market leader with a share of more than 40 percent  reducing choice  hampering infrastructure development and weakening the negotiating power of smaller  virtual  operators seeking to obtain access to networks  Vestager said the size of the EU document setting out the decision underlined the complexity of the case   This decision is 2 56 kilograms  It is a very heavy decision  I weighed it myself   she told a news conference   CHILL ON TELECOMS CONSOLIDATION The Commission said Hutchison s proposal to boost competition from virtual rivals such as Virgin Media  owned by Liberty  and  Tesco  Mobile  owned by Tesco  L TSCO  and O2  by offering them capacity on the merged network were not sufficient  and that the company was also not willing to create a wholly separate fourth network operator   The regulator also rejected the industry s arguments that mergers were necessary to enable big new investments to be made in mobile broadband networks  saying effective competition was the main driver for investment  The decision will discourage further similar deals  leaving companies to look instead at more horizontal mergers as they seek to offer packages of fixed and mobile broadband Internet  TV and telephony services  said Adrien Giraud  a partner at Willkie Farr   Gallagher  In January BT completed its 12 5 billion pound   18 billion  acquisition of EE  the UK s biggest mobile network operator  opening the way for the former state monopoly to create a single integrated network offering a combination of telecoms and TV services that competitors are scrabbling to match   Although the Commission will probably reiterate that there is no magic number and that every case needs to be assessed on its own merits  this will undoubtedly chill consolidation efforts in the telecoms industry and in particular every planned so called four to three case   he said   Convergence therefore seems to be the only way forward for consolidation  ,2016-05-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/eu-blocks-hutchison's-deal-to-buy-telefonica's-o2-uk-401375,401375

country will vote to leave the European Union with extra funds  pre written statements and plans for late night vigils by teams of consultants  In the final week before Britain s June 23 referendum on EU membership  the prospect of a  Leave  vote has come into sharp focus  prompting a last minute flurry of preparations in the corridors of  UK PLC    Much of the focus is on communication    how to assure customers  employees and investors that there will be near term business continuity in the event of an  Out  vote  Britain would have two years to negotiate its exit  or  Brexit   from the 28 country bloc   Treasury departments will also be working overtime because a vote for a Brexit would be expected to roil currency markets and have major consequences for trade  the economy and migration in Britain and elsewhere  Many companies have yet to work out detailed plans  as any post Brexit picture is unclear and opinion polls had until recently suggested the  Remain  camp was comfortably ahead   But some have sprung into action since the momentum in the polls swung toward the  Leave  camp in the latter stages of campaigning  which was suspended on Thursday after a British lawmaker was killed   The nearness of the vote and sudden increased likelihood of Brexit has definitely sharpened client appetite for draft statements   said a senior executive at a public relations firm  one of three who said this week there had been an increase in client requests for communications advice  As of February  more than three quarters of Britain s FTSE 250 companies had not made any contingency plans for a possible exit  according to a survey published in April by the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors   More than 60 percent said they planned to do so  but the uncertainty

104723,326238,LBTYA,Liberty Global sees no Brexit fallout on Vodafone deal,news,"By Adrian Krajewski
WARSAW  Reuters    Liberty Global  O LBTYA   the world s largest cable operator  does not expect Brexit to derail its Dutch joint venture with  Vodafone   L VOD  and is keeping an eye out for more takeovers in Europe  its chief executive said on Tuesday 
Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the Cable Congress  Chief Executive Mike Fries   an industry veteran and after hours lead singer in a rock band   said he expected EU regulators to approve the tie up  and that going forward Liberty would prefer takeovers rather than joint ventures in Europe 
 The deal with Vodafone is already agreed   said the CEO of Liberty Global  which owns British cable TV network Virgin Media   It is being reviewed by EU regulators and their review should not be impacted by Brexit  
 It has no immediate impact on our business and it has not reduced our appetite or interest in Europe  The UK is a relatively large part of our business and in the end British consumers will still want the same products and services  
EU regulators are due to rule by July 19 on the deal between Liberty Global and Vodafone to merge their Dutch operations and create the second biggest telecoms provider there behind KPN  AS KPN  
The joint venture is part of a consolidation wave in recent years as companies seek scale to invest in costly fast speed network infrastructure and offer combined services 
Vodafone and Liberty had been in talks about combining operations in as many as seven European markets last year but the negotiations failed 
 It s a one off transaction where we both benefit  Neither of us is looking beyond Holland in terms of such cooperation at the moment   Fries told Reuters   We don t have plans to do it again  although it is a possibility  We re more into takeovers than joint ventures  
Liberty Global  owned by U S  billionaire John Malone  operates in more than 30 countries 
The company has no plans to add new countries in Europe  but does intend to expend operations in countries where it is already present  including Poland  Fries said 
Market sources told Reuters this month Liberty  which owns Poland s largest cable operator UPC  was in talks to buy rival Multimedia to double its market share  and may also be interested in Polish mobile operator Play 
Fries declined to comment on any specifics 
He said the company was always looking to get bigger and planned to invest about 4 billion zlotys   1 billion  in Poland over the next five years anyway  not counting any takeovers 
 We are committed to mobility and it will grow as part of our business  We re going to try to grow in mobile in Poland  too   he said 

 We don t have great scale in Poland  where we have 20 percent of the cable market  It s a fragmented market and acquisitions are an option here  ",2016-06-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/liberty-global-sees-no-brexit-fallout-on-vodafone-deal-411071,411071

104727,326242,LBTYA,U S  FCC s Incentive Auction Witnesses Stepped Up Bidding,opinion,"Last Friday  the U S  telecom regulator  the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  declared that its ongoing 600 MHz low band wireless spectrum auction  popularly known as    Incentive Auction    has received as many as 62 applications  All 62 bidders have made upfront payments  The Incentive Auction  which was kicked off by the FCC on Mar 29  2016  recently completed its first part 
In the first part  which was essentially a reverse auction  the airwaves were freed by TV broadcasters who no longer had any productive use of the same  The TV broadcasters had agreed to free a substantial amount of 126 MHz of spectrums for a massive  86 4 billion 
In the second part of the auction process  the FCC will resale these airwaves to wireless operators  cable MSOs  multi service operators  or tech firms through competitive bidding  The second part is known as forward auction  Needless to say  the total bid price of the forward auction must reach at least  86 4 billion for the Incentive Auction to be successful  The second part of the Incentive Auction is likely to start from Aug 16  2016 
Important bidders include national telecom giants like Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    AT T Inc    NYSE T    T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T    satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp    NASDAQ DISH   and cable MSOs  multi service operators  such as Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   and Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  Inc  Low band spectrum is crucial for wireless operators as the signals can be transmitted over longer distances and through brick and mortar walls in cities 
However  several industry experts believe that telecom operators may be reluctant to offer such a hefty sum for low band airwaves  Some industry watchers have also predicted that telecom operators may need around 70 MHz to 80 MHz of spectrums in the 600 MHz bands instead of the total freed up 126 MHz airwaves  In such a scenario  the FCC may have to conduct another round of reverse auction for a reduced volume of spectrum at lower prices 
The FCC was initially hopeful of completing the Incentive Auction process by the end of the third quarter of 2016  However  industry watchers are now expecting it to be much more prolonged and may continue till early 2017  Notably  the freed spectrums cannot be utilized commercially before 2020 ",2016-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-fcc's-incentive-auction-witnesses-stepped-up-bidding-200142541,200142541

104762,326277,LBTYA,Vodafone goes back to basics after failed Liberty deal,news,"By Leila Abboud  Pamela Barbaglia and Kate Holton LONDON  Reuters    With a  120 billion merger with Liberty Global  O LBTYA  off the table   Vodafone   L VOD  boss Vittorio Colao needs his strategy of higher network investments and acquisitions of European cable companies to start paying off  quickly  The world s second largest mobile operator abandoned talks with John Malone s Liberty last week over valuation disagreements that would have seen a swap of assets or a broader merger that could have helped Vodafone  in one fell swoop  offer mobile  broadband and TV in its biggest markets  Instead the focus now returns to the unglamorous effort to get revenues and profit growing steadily again  especially in Germany and Spain where Vodafone spent 15 billion euros buying cable players Kabel Deutschland and Ono to compete with local leaders Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  and  Telefonica   MC TEF    In addition to operational progress  several bankers said Vodafone should also move ahead with floating its Indian mobile business  its biggest emerging market holding  so as to show the value within the company  One person familiar with the situation said management focus would now return to running its biggest markets  including attacking the former state owned monopolies that it competes with on regulatory and commercial fronts    We really need to see an operational turnaround in Europe in this fiscal year  That is priority number 1  2  and 3  including the integration of cable assets in Germany and Spain   said Bruno Grandsard  a portfolio manager at Axa Investment Management  Vodafone s tenth biggest shareholder with a 1 percent stake   Then they need to continue to develop an approach to accessing fixed assets in markets where they don t have them like Britain  Italy  and the Netherlands   Were Vodafone to make those improvements  it would not only keep investors on side but put the firm in a stronger position for when Liberty comes calling again   as it is expected to do   Bankers believe a Vodafone and Liberty deal holds the promise of some 20 billion euros in cost savings   largely reaped from Britain and Germany   which could draw the pair back to the table in about 12 to 18 months time  Another factor is what happens to the relative valuations of telecoms and cable  which could determine who has the upper hand in future talks and whether a largely share based deal is possible  European telecoms are trading around six to 6 5 times forward earnings for next year  while cable is 8 5 to 9 times   People close to both companies said the firms had not yet given up on a deal and were separately examining options for a future attempt   TUMULTUOUS TIMES The would be alliance between one of Europe s biggest mobile operators and its biggest cable provider is emblematic of the tumult in the industry as carriers in the region increasingly sell all inclusive bundles of fixed and mobile communications  along with television and broadband  It also comes amidst a wider mergers and acquisitions spree  which has redrawn the map in several markets  and prompted scrutiny from competition regulators who recently blocked a deal over concerns that people would pay higher prices  The move to so called triple and quad play bundles  which is most developed in France and Spain and growing in Britain and Germany  also reflects the need operators have for strong fixed networks to carry ballooning mobile data traffic   Vodafone s answer has been not only to buy up some cable companies  but also to spend 19 billion pounds   29 billion  on upgrading its networks globally  The investment program dubbed Project Spring has six months left to run   In its biggest market Germany  where Vodafone bought Kabel Deutschland  KDG  in October 2013  the carrier has struggled to keep up with Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn   Service revenue dropped 3 2 percent in the year to March 2015  excluding KDG  although in its most recent quarter  when it included KDG numbers  it was down only 1 2 percent  Strategic errors such as focusing network investments on rural areas rather than urban  and a badly executed plan to sell more mobile contracts directly to consumers rather than through retail partners also caused problems   Nor has the picture been much brighter in Britain where Vodafone could be weakened by a wave of dealmaking   Broadband leader BT  L BT  has agreed to buy the biggest mobile operator EE  and number four mobile player Hutchison s  HK 0001  3 is hoping to swallow Telefonica s  MC TEF  02  which would leave Vodafone in third place in its home market  Vodafone is planning on launching its own pay TV service in Britain but the offering is likely to be weak in comparison to those offered by BT and market leader Sky  L SKYB    Vodafone needs to show that quad play works   they spent billions on cable deals  they need to show it was worth it   a sector banker said   Usually you need at least 2 3 years after deals to see if it worked well or not  so the crunch period is coming   Vodafone s shares have fallen 4 6 percent this year while the European telecoms index  SXKP  is up 4 5 percent   EMERGING MARKETS In parallel to the work in Europe  some bankers believe Vodafone must streamline or separate its emerging market businesses  the largest of which are India  South Africa  and Turkey  to facilitate a deal with Liberty  which is only present in Europe and Latin America  Given the companies respective market capitalizations  with Vodafone worth 57 billion pounds   83 billion  and Liberty  39 9 billion  hiving off Vodafone s emerging market units would make structuring a deal easier since it could then combine the remainder of its Europe activities with Liberty   Liberty saw Vodafone s emerging market business as a stumbling block in the recent talks because it could not judge its quality or value  Vodafone has said it is weighing the idea of an initial public offering in India  A long running tax dispute and an upcoming spectrum auction could make valuing the unit challenging   Vodafone needs to maximize value from their emerging market holdings in order to have more flexibility and more optionality to negotiate a better deal with Liberty   another banker said    This is a key step and it doesn t matter whether the emerging market deals happen before or during negotiations with Liberty  what matters is that the right structure is in place     1   0 6577 pounds

a few developments were worth noting  U S  telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   warned that the company s second quarter 2016 financial results may be affected by the ongoing strike of its wireline and cable TV workers which started from Apr 13  2016 Verizon and the striking unions  The Communications Workers of America  CWA  and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  IBEW   are currently at a stalemate over a new labor contract  The company s wireline employees have been working out of contract since August last year  The CWA said nearly 40 000 workers have gone on strike Lowell McAdam  CEO of Verizon recently stated thatthe company is currently on track with respect to repairing and maintenance issues of the existing installed bases  However  the number of new installations of FiOS high speed Internet and FiOS pay TV has dropped significantly  As a result  the company may suffer high speed broadband and pay TV customer attrition  The situation may become even worse going forward if the strike continues for an indefinite period of time Meanwhile  videoconferencing giant Polycom Inc    NASDAQ PLCM   recently received a new takeover bid from an unnamed private equity  PE  firm  Notably  IP based integrated communications solutions provider Mitel Networks Corp    NASDAQ MITL   had placed a bid of around  1 96 billion to acquire Polycom

104807,326322,LBTYA,Vodafone in talks with Liberty Global on asset swap  not merger,news,"By Sarah Young and Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON  Reuters    Vodafone  NASDAQ VOD   the world s second biggest mobile company  said it is in early talks about exchanging selected assets with Europe s largest cable operator Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA   which could enable each to better compete with rivals 
Analysts and sector bankers said the two most important countries for both firms where they overlap were Britain and Germany  They also both operate in Ireland  the Netherlands  Czech Republic  Hungary and Romania 
Vodafone  traditionally a mobile only company  has been on the back foot in recent years as companies with access to mobile and fixed line infrastructure such as Orange   Telefonica   MADRID TEF  and Deutsche Telekom  XETRA DTEGn  offer packages of services to customers in one bundle 
After weeks of speculation  Vodafone released a statement on Friday saying it was not in merger talks with Liberty  but was holding talks about a possible exchange of assets  without saying which businesses were being discussed 
 Whilst talks might yet lead to a full combination with Liberty  an asset swap would allow both parties to boost their respective positions in converging markets  and could still lead to a full combination over time   analysts at  Deutsche Bank   XETRA DBKGn  said 
In Germany  Deutsche Telekom has started selling mobile  Internet  TV and fixed line telephony in one package and in Britain  BT will be able to do the same once it has completed the acquisition of the country s largest mobile operator EE 
Liberty Global  which has operations in 12 European countries  has a market capitalisation of  46 billion  while Vodafone s is 66 billion pounds   102 billion  
An industry banker said he believed Vodafone s primary interest was in acquiring Liberty s UK arm Virgin Media  while the main attraction for Liberty was Vodafone s German business 
Liberty already owns Unitymedia  Germany s second biggest cable operator  and it has long coveted its bigger rival Kabel Deutschland  which Vodafone bought in 2013 for  10 billion to merge with its mobile operations there 
 This deal is about swapping UK with Germany  Nothing else is relevant   the banker said 
Alternatively  analysts said Vodafone could sell its British and Dutch operations in exchange for Liberty s German business  however that would leave Vodafone out of its home market 
The lack of an obvious solution might shed light on why the two firms have failed to agree on a wider deal despite much speculation 
The stock is trading up 7 percent since May 19 when John Malone  the U S   King of Cable  and chairman of Liberty  said in an interview that the two companies would make a  great fit  
Other ways of teaming up include commercial deals  where both firms agree to sell the other s services but these tend to be difficult to agree in terms of pricing and discounts  It would also not provide the billions of pounds of synergies that could come from a merger or acquisition 
The firms could also put their four overlapping markets   Britain  Germany  Ireland and the Netherlands   into a joint venture  however this also has its problems as few mobile joint ventures succeed and tend to end with one partner buying the other out 
Shares in Vodafone finished the day down 2 4 percent 
 There is no certainty that any transaction will be agreed  nor is there certainty with respect to which assets will ultimately be involved   the company said in its statement 
Accendo Markets analyst Augustin Eden said that a merger could still be on the cards some time in the future 

 One has to wonder whether this is somewhat of a warm up act for a heightened display of affection between the UK mobile operator and Europe s biggest cable company   he said in a note ",2015-06-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/vodafone-says-considering-asset-swap-with-liberty-345205,345205

104814,326329,LBTYA,Higher Wages And Low Inflation Is A Time Bomb For UK s Housing Market,opinion,"The trend in the GBP complex sharply reversed after BoE Governor Carney said the UK is moving closer to a rate hike yesterday 
The unexpected rise in UK s unemployment rate in May  from 5 5  to 5 6   sent Cable down to 1 5603 in London  But given that this is merely transitional and heavily weighted to The kneejerk sell off could be a good opportunity to enter the bull market as the improvement in wages growth   when adjusted for inflation  at the highest pace in seven years   has an influence on the BoE outlook  First  we know that Carney is closely monitoring the progress in wages to determine how fast the slack in the labour market disappears  Second  higher wages are the growth engine for the economic recovery  Third  a healthy recovery is a sine qua non condition for the policy normalisation  Finally  Osbourne is also pushing for higher wages to solidify the UK budget 
The conclusion is that the improvement in wages has become a primary  common goal for fiscal and monetary policies and should outweigh the unexpected deterioration in the unemployment rate 
Looking ahead  higher wages and low inflation is a time bomb for the real estate market in the UK  Even if inflation takes time to pick up  the BoE may want to be pro active avoiding an extra overheating in the UK s house market  For all the reasons stated above  the UK jobs data has potential to further boost the BoE hawks and push the pound higher against EUR and USD  It is just a matter of time before the 0 70p level is breached against the euro 
UK Markets foiled by Carney 
The FTSE 100 is trading flat unable to capitalise on the upside moves witnessed in the past couple of days  The threat of monetary tightening as well as the continual strain from Greek headlines is keeping any real gains in check for now

Burberry Group  LONDON BRBY    2 One of Britain s flagship brands abroad  the luxury fashion house is seeing a slowdown in growth as the year goes on  Following 11  growth in Q1  Q2 expansion has slipped to 8   Underlying the performance reads well  but the worry over a sharp fall in activity in Hong Kong and lacklustre growth on the Chinese mainland will worry investors that other signs of a slowdown in the region are now being exhibited in one of their favoured imports  Shares peaked in the first quarter and have struggled to show sustained resistance on the way down since  Full year performance will be impacted by how the brand deals with volatile currency movements  with the FT highlighting that despite the growth slowdown  at current FX levels full year profit for this year will be ahead of guidance in May 
Vodafone  LONDON VOD    1 Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  have downgraded the telecoms giant to neutral  as talks with Liberty Global  NASDAQ LBTYA  about an asset swap continue  The bank views a base case for Vodafone as 220p without any M A premium  whilst upside above 280p is unlikely and their current target is 250p  a 6 7  gain from current levels 
With Yellen set to testify later today  we look for the Dow to open 10 points higher 
Greek Parliament votes on a deal agreed with a  knife to the neck 
Greek parliament votes today on whether the austerity conditions agreed with the EU on Monday are worth a third bailout deal  PM Tsipras  who said to have agreed with  a knife to his neck  will now face revolt from his party given that the latter EU agreement consists of tougher austerity measures than those rejected by the population on July 5 referendum  The opposition support is critical  We are heading into another politically tense day in Greece 
With its hands apparently tied  the Eurozone s periphery is witnessing the slow death of democracy in Greece  There are no particular signs of contagion in Eurozone s sovereign debt market

The correlation between the DAX and the EUR USD turns neutral from negative as euro and DAX are both subject to the same event risk  Greece  Fundamentally speaking  today s euro levels are still very favourable for German competitiveness on the international platform  Potential appreciation in euro following a deal should not be an important barrier to DAX futures  advance ",2015-07-15,Ipek Ozkardeskaya,https://www.investing.com/analysis/higher-wages-and-low-inflation-is-a-time-bomb-for-uk’s-housing-market-258418,258418

agreed to buy Telefonica s British mobile unit O2 for up to 10 25 billion pounds   15 4 billion   as Asia s richest man makes his boldest bet yet to revamp his European telecoms business  Hutchison already operates the Three Mobile network in Britain  and buying second ranked O2 from the Spanish group in Li s biggest ever takeover will make it the top mobile operator in the country  The company made its first forays into European telecoms markets in 2000  but returns from the business have lagged other parts of Li s ports to property empire  Li and his chief dealmaker Canning Fok have doubled down in response  sinking more money into Europe as they look to snap up businesses from operators who have been battered by the continent s debt crisis  The proposed O2 deal comes just two weeks after the Hong Kong tycoon undertook a major overhaul of his businesses  which will be split into two listed companies  one focusing on property and the second on telecommunications  ports  infrastructure and others  The revamp will boost Hutchison s acquisition firepower by about  7 billion as it spins off its property assets to Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd   The deal indicates that the group is continuously eyeing Europe to seek future growth   said Alex Wong  a director with Hong Kong based Ample Finance Group  The marriage of Three Mobile and O2 would mark the latest move towards telecoms consolidation in Britain  where the market is split between four mobile network operators and four separately owned fixed line and broadband providers  REGULATORY SCRUTINY While the deal will attract scrutiny from competition authorities  European regulators have allowed the number of telecoms operators in countries including Austria and Ireland to shrink from four to three through mergers and acquisitions   The European Commission has taken a positive view of four  to three consolidations of mobile in three cases now   and we believe that the precedents that they have set in those transactions will apply for this transaction   Frank Sixt  Hutchison s group finance director  told reporters  The deal will mark Li s biggest ever acquisition  overtaking Hutchison s  7 5 billion purchase of Britain s Northumbrian Water Group in 2011  according to Thomson Reuters data  Hutchison shares were briefly suspended ahead of the announcement  and jumped more than 4 percent when trading resumed  outpacing a 1 2 percent rise in Hong Kong s benchmark Hang Seng share index  The company said in a statement that it had   agreed to enter into exclusive negotiations with Telef nica SA over a period of several weeks  for the potential acquisition  It said it had agreed to pay an indicative price of 9 25 billion pounds  with another 1 billion pounds in  interest sharing payments  should the combined business reach certain cash flow targets  Hutchison will fund the deal with a 6 billion pounds bank loan  The company is in talks with private equity firms and others to bring in minority partners  who would be offered not more than a 30 percent stake  Sixt added  In December  former state monopoly BT entered exclusive talks with the owners of EE  Britain s biggest mobile operator  BT had preferred EE over O2  which was acquired by Telefonica in early 2006 and has about 22 million subscribers  Reuters reported in November that Hutchison  whose Three is Britain s smallest mobile network  was waiting in the wings to buy whichever group BT spurned  NEXT STOP ITALY  Three Group Europe reported total revenue of HK 31 billion   4 billion  for the six months ended June  2014  a 3 percent rise from a year ago  Its core earnings  or EBITDA  rose 15 percent to HK 6 5 billion in the same period  It operates businesses in Italy  Britain  Sweden  Denmark  Austria and Ireland  In Asia  Hutchison has mobile operations in Indonesia  Vietnam and Sri Lanka  Analysts expect Hutchison to consolidate its Italian operations next  In 2013  it approached Telecom Italia with a proposal to merge their mobile businesses whereby Hutchison would have taken a near 30 percent stake in Italy s biggest phone operator  But the proposal was rebuffed by Telecom Italia s core shareholders  It then tried to merge its Italian unit 3 Italia with Wind  a subsidiary of Russian telecoms group Vimpelcom  but talks have stalled  When asked whether the company could move quickly to consolidate Italian operations  Sixt said   I like to think we can move very quickly in any circumstance  But you have to have achieved the right deal for all sides for anything like this to happen  that was the case in the UK  and that will be the case in relation to Italy   Last year  Hutchison bought Telefonica s Irish business in a bid to boost its market share  though it still trails behind the market leader Vodafone plc  Telefonica said in November the British market was a core one for the company  but it had set as higher priority on reducing its big debt pile and protecting a fat dividend  It also needed fresh cash to consider potential acquisitions in Brazil  its biggest market along with its home country  where it is investing massively to build an optic fiber network    1

104845,326360,LBTYA,Europe s big telecoms roar back to health  worrying rivals,news,"By Leila Abboud  Harro Ten Wolde and Julia Fioretti PARIS  Reuters    Europe s big telecom firms are back to rude financial health after years of poor results and regulatory pressure  drawing crowds of new investors and protests from rivals who worry the formerly state owned companies may rebuild their monopolies  Germany s Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  and Spain s Telefonica  MC TEF  have predicted that revenues will grow this year  while France s Orange  PA ORAN  and Norway s Telenor  OL TEL  have promised higher future dividends  a major motivation for investors in the sector  The renaissance is a marked shift from the past five years in which the sector s sales fell steadily because of regulation ending various types of mobile fees and tough competition from cable operators such as Liberty Global  O LBTYA  and low cost players like France s Iliad  PA ILD   Sector executives credit the improvement to new 4G technology that powers speedier mobile broadband  as well as a more relaxed attitude by regulators to mergers and acquisitions  and the fees the former state firms can charge to share their networks  Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges attributed the rebirth of the firms often referred to as incumbents to the trend of selling multi service packages comprising broadband  television  and fixed and mobile services    It is the convergence that makes the incumbents fly   he said on Thursday   We are in a better position to tell that story with confidence   Thus for the first time in eight years these incumbents gained broadband market share between January and July 2014  according to EU Commission figures  beating alternative players by emphasizing higher speeds  All this has translated into a 15 percent rise in the European telecoms index  SXKP  this year  after a 7 5 percent rise last year     Consequently the once yawning valuation gap between U S  and European telecoms has reversed  with the European sector now trading at 19 3 times forward price to earnings compared with 14 times for U S  peers such as AT T  N T  and Verizon  N VZ      SOFTER REGULATION After recent years of recession  the new European Commission under President Jean Claude Juncker wants to spur growth in part by encouraging telecoms firms to invest in faster broadband infrastructure  which underpins the modern economy   By way of incentive  Brussels has decided that when telecoms companies build new high speed fiber lines they may charge rivals commercial rates to use them  rather than the regulated rates that were introduced in the 1990s to inject competition into the markets  The regulators are also taking a softer line on consolidation  prompting a wave of activity  since December 2012  antitrust authorities have approved mobile deals in Austria  Ireland and Germany  as well as Vodafone s  L VOD  purchases of cable operators in Germany and Spain  ECTA  the trade association for alternative operators such as Iliad  PA ILD  and Talk Talk  L TALK   warns however that such policies have tipped the balance too far to the big firms   Its claim is given weight by a Citigroup  NYSE C  report titled  The Rebirth of the telecom monopoly  last November that showed a decrease in competitiveness in 25 global mobile markets since late 2011  a shift from the prior decade when incumbents were losing clients  The recent rapid re making of the British market sums up the big players  rebirth   BT Group  L BT   the former state owned entity that was focused on fixed telephony and broadband  has agreed to buy the country s biggest mobile provider EE  This recreates an integrated market leader in Britain just as Telefonica dominates in Spain or Orange in France  competition advocates warn  BT s rivals  including heavyweight Vodafone   which grew by stealing mobile business from the former monopolies   are calling for closer monitoring of the new leader and a full separation of the Openreach unit that makes its network available to competitors   Some operators can use their networks as a fortress   Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao told an audience of lobbyists and policy makers at an event in Brussels on Thursday    We cannot afford to have remonopolization in Europe   MORE DEALS COMING  It remains to be seen whether the big firms  stronger positions will result in higher prices for consumers   In Austria where the market went from four to three mobile players in 2013  the cost for average phone and text users rose by 29 percent between September 2013 and December 2014  while mobile data users saw costs jump 78 per cent  according to the Vienna Chamber of Labour  Senior executives at major telecoms groups say raising prices across the board remains difficult so instead they must focus on high end customers to sell bigger buckets of mobile data or faster broadband  both of which bring in more revenue   Bankers and industry executives predict more mergers and acquisitions in Europe  perhaps eventually across borders   Some like Deutsche Telekom  Telenor  Teliasonera will eventually consolidate the markets outside their home country   said one banker  But he added that so far the likes of Altice  AS ATCE   Hutchison  HK 0013  and Iliad founder Xavier Niel were better placed to buy assets because they had billionaire founders behind them with big ambitions and were unafraid to load up on debt  The trio has done recent deals in Portugal  Britain and Switzerland respectively  Ramon Fernandez  the chief financial officer of French incumbent Orange  said he was glad the tough times were over but added the company had emerged stronger  As part of the sector shake out  Orange had to slim down  cutting 1 6 billion euros in costs and prompting a 57 percent rise in its share price in 2014  That  says Fernandez  means it is now in a far better position to compete   When your valuation multiples are closer to your competitors  it gives you more flexibility in expansion opportunities because you can pay for deals in share and cash   he said  Bruno Grandsard  an investor at Axa Investment Managers  said there was further upside in the European telecom sector especially because of the high dividend yields on offer in an environment of low interest rates

 By Sven Nordenstam and Quentin Webb 
 STOCKHOLM LONDON  April 20  Reuters    EQT  the private
equity firm backed by Sweden s Wallenberg family  has begun the
 3 billion plus sale of burglar alarm firm Securitas Direct 
people familiar with the matter said 
 Securitas Direct could interest both rival private equity
investors and large listed companies with security operations 
including Stanley Black   Decker Inc  Tyco and United
Technologies Corp  UTC   some of the people said 
 Bidders are now receiving information memorandums on the
business and must submit indicative bids next month  the people
said  EQT hopes the business could as much as 20 billion Swedish
crowns   3 3 billion   or more  two of the people added 
 The auction comes three years after EQT acquired Securitas
Direct  which claims a fifth of Europe s monitored alarm market 
selling security systems to homes and businesses in nine
European countries  The potential sale was reported by the Wall
Street Journal in March 
 The business achieved earnings before interest  tax 
depreciation and amortisation  EBITDA  of 1 32 billion crowns in
2009 on revenue of 5 49 billion

services firm  
 Securitas Direct and Tyco declined to comment  EQT  Stanley
and UTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment

alarm industry  Tyco s management may be too preoccupied dealing
with a potential bid from France s Schneider Electric to focus
on sizeable external deals 
 Schneider is serious about buying Tyco  people familiar with
the matter said last week  even after media reports of a  30
billion preliminary bid prompted the French company to say it
was  not currently  in talks with Tyco

facility services providers 
 Three bid teams    Blackstone Group  Bain Capital  Nordic

  Adds market share details  CDS move  union reaction 
 By Roberta B  Cowan
 AMSTERDAM  April 21  Reuters    Dutch telecoms firm KPN cut
its 2011 profit forecast on Thursday  citing weak domestic
revenues in the face of intense competition  and said it would
slash its Dutch workforce by up to a quarter 
 KPN shares fell 7 8 percent in a flat Amsterdam market as
the firm cited pressure on its Dutch business from other mobile
and cable operators  and as consumers increasingly turn to
Facebook  Twitter and instant messaging to bypass traditional
mobile phone services 
 Eelco Blok  a KPN insider who only took over as chief
executive from Ad Scheepbouwer earlier this month  already had a
reputation as a cost cutter  The market had been waiting for him
to announce a new strategy for a telecoms firm that some
consider to be a merger candidate 
  There is tough competition from many directions     In the
past there only was direct competition from phone companies  but
now you have all these cable companies   said Keijser Capital
trader Peter Jurgens 
  This is quite predictable  Scheepbouwer has left  and the
new man makes a headstart so he can report good results after
the first year   Jurgens added 
 The Dutch telecoms firm  which has a stock market cap of
17 9 billion euros   26 13 billion   said it was cutting its
forecast for 2011 earnings before interest  tax  depreciation
and amortisation  EBITDA  to 5 3 billion euros  down from more
than 5 5 billion stated earlier this year 
 KPN caught the market by surprise with the profit warning
and by announcing its first quarter results a week ahead of
schedule  It said first quarter EBITDA fell 4 1 percent to 1 27
billion euros from a year ago 
  We face negative trends in the Netherlands   said Blok 
though he added that KPN was still experiencing strong
underlying growth in Germany and Belgium 
 KPN s five year credit default swaps widened by 2 5 bps to
65 bps according to Markit data to underperform a generally
broader stable credit market for investment grade credits  The
move meant it became more expensive to protect KPN s debt
against default 
 
 PINGING TRUMPS SMS
 KPN s share of its home market is under threat as it
competes with Vodafone Group and Deutsche Telekom AG  and
increasingly with cable firms Ziggo and UPC 
 Ziggo  owned by private equity groups Cinven and Warburg
Pincus  and UPC  owned by Liberty Global Inc   are both wooing
customers with bundled packages of super fast broadband 
television and telephone services  
  KPN had about a 50 percent share of the Dutch landline
market in 2010  but this fell to just over 45 percent in the
first quarter this year  while the number of mobile subscribers
has slid nearly 10 percent to 5 5 million from a year ago 
 Blok blamed changing consumer behaviour  initially among
younger smartphone users but increasingly now among most Dutch
smartphone subscribers  for KPN s revenue difficulties 
 Customers are quick to exploit free forms of communication 
for example updating their status on Facebook or Twitter or
pinging friends with instant messages on internet connected
phones including RIM s Blackberry messaging or the WhatsApp
communicator popular on Apple s iPhone 
 That shift  which Blok says will eventually be seen across
the entire telecom sector  meant KPN now makes less money from
mobile voice calls and text messages  or SMS  for which
customers pay extra charges 
 Blok told reporters on Thursday that SMS revenues fell
dramatically in the Netherlands in the first quarter  and that
KPN plans to introduce new integrated bundles in the coming
months to try to offset those revenue losses in the longer term 
 Blok added he will unveil a strategy update on May 10 
 Corne van Zeijl  a fund manager at SNS  said KPN should have
acted earlier to address the problems in its home market and
criticised its  dramatic  communication 
  The problems were known  and I had asked about it the last
time I saw them  However  they continued to state that
cost cutting measures were sufficient and that data traffic will
compensate   Van Zeijl told Reuters by email 
 Dutch trade unions were stunned by the job cuts which are
due to take place through to 2015  with union Abvakabo FNV
criticising the news as  an unexpected  but especially very
unpleasant blow  to employees

104890,326405,LBTYA,Liberty Global buys stake in UK broadcaster ITV,news,"By Kate Holton LONDON  Reuters    U S  based cable group Liberty Global  O LBTYA  has bought BSkyB s  L BSY  6 4 percent stake in ITV  L ITV   Britain s biggest free to air commercial broadcaster  boosting its shares on hopes of a wider bid 
Billionaire John Malone s Liberty  which bought British cable operator Virgin Media as part of a European expansion last year  said it did not intend to make an offer for the rest of the broadcaster  but ITV shares still rose 9 percent 
The sale  at a price of 481 million pounds   824 million   may also indicate that BSkyB is looking to raise cash to push ahead with its own expansion plans after it opened talks this year to buy Rupert Murdoch s  O FOXA  Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland  DE SKYDn  
The purchase is just the latest in a string of deals in the global media sector to buy content and follows ITV s drive to develop its production arm and generate revenue beyond its traditional  and volatile  advertising source 
 It is hard to see how this will not be looked at as anything other than Liberty planting a flag in the ground for a potential acquisition at some point   Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said 
 ITV is now likely to be seen as a potential M A story  especially given recent news flow in the media sector  
Just this year  Liberty teamed up with Discovery Communications  O DISCA  to buy TV producer All3Media  Discovery took a controlling interest in European sports broadcaster Eurosport and Murdoch s 21st Century Fox has been seeking to buy Time Warner 
Cable operators have traditionally focused on providing broadband and television to households  meaning they were more likely to be aggregators and re sellers of programing  but Liberty has owned content companies in the past 
Dubbed everything from the Cable Guy to Cable Cowboy  Malone made his fortune through a series of deals that transformed and ultimately consolidated the U S  cable industry into one dominated by a few big players  Liberty Global is now also present in 12 European companies 
It called ITV officials on Wednesday evening to make them aware of the stake sale and to say it did not intend on launching a full bid 
ITV S GOT TALENT
ITV  which began broadcasting in Britain in 1955 as Channel 3  is known for airing  Britain s Got Talent  and  Downton Abbey  
The company  renowned for producing some of Britain s most popular dramas in the 1980s and 1990s such as  Prime Suspect   was hammered during the financial crisis as advertisers and viewers deserted its TV channels 
It has since been rebuilt under Chief Executive Adam Crozier by improving the quality of its programing and selling it around the world  which helped non advertising sources contribute 44 percent of its revenue in 2013 
With shares up 9 percent at 201 pence at 1005 GMT  ITV had a market valuation of 8 1 billion pounds 
The stake sale brings an end to one of the most controversial corporate moves in the British media sector   the decision by James Murdoch  then BSkyB boss  to buy 17 9 percent of the then struggling ITV to block rival NTL from creating a larger  more powerful competitor 
The move in 2006 kicked off a long running regulatory investigation  which eventually forced BSkyB to reduce the stake to 7 5 percent 

BSkyB bought the shares in 2006 for 135 pence each  sold more than 10 percent at 48 5 pence  a deep loss  and sold the remainder this week at 185 pence 
NTL went on to become Virgin Media  which was then bought by Liberty 
 This is an opportunistic and attractive investment for us in our largest cable market   Mike Fries  Liberty Global s chief executive said in a statement

104891,326406,LBTYA,Telefonica does not rule out a sale of O2 in the UK,news,"By Danilo Masoni and Leila Abboud BARCELONA  Reuters    Telefonica would have to consider its options regarding its UK presence  including a sale of the O2 business  if more of the market moves to bundling fixed and mobile telecom services  a top executive said on Thursday 
Telefonica  which bought O2 in 2006  has said the UK business remains core but has not ruled out asset sales to meet a year end debt target of below 43 billion euros  34 37 billion pounds  
 If the market goes convergent then we will need to evaluate our options   Telefonica s chief operating officer  Jose Maria Alvarez Pallete  told the Morgan Stanley Technology  Media and Telecom Conference in Barcelona  when asked about a potential sale of its O2 business in the UK 
O2  which trails EE in Britain  was performing well  Alvarez Pallete said  with average revenue per user growing and churn rates on customer retention lower 
However  the mobile market could be shaken up by the expected return next year of BT  the original owner of O2  and a bigger push by the likes of cable firm Virgin Media into making bundled offers of TV  fixed line broadband and mobile services 
 In the landscape as it stands today we are in good shape   Alvarez Pallete said   But the position taken by BT when and if it launches in mobile will be a key event  Virgin and others already have converged offers  but we don t see a major appetite from consumers  So we ll see how that evolves  
Vodafone said last week it would offer fixed line broadband and TV next year  while EE also offers broadband  which it wholesales from BT  and recently announced a TV product 
O2 has no equivalent offer after selling its fixed line and broadband business to pay TV company Sky last year  However  UK broadband and TV services provider TalkTalk said on Monday it had signed a new agreement to use the O2 network to provide mobile phone services to its customers  including for the first time 4G mobile broadband 
Stephane Richard  chief executive of EE co owner Orange said in Barcelona he was also monitoring the take up of fixed and mobile offers in Britain 
 Looking to the future  we have strategic issues around convergence   he said  adding that EE could respond with partnerships with broadband companies or other moves
