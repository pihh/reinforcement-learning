127116,348631,DRI,Arcosa  Deere And Company  McDonald s  Darden Restaurants And Denny s Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 27  2020    Shares of Arcosa Inc    NYSE ACA   as the Bull of the Day  Deere and Company   NYSE DE   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD    Darden Restaurants  Inc    NYSE DRI   and Denny s Corp    NYSE DE   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  2019 brought many of the most highly anticipated initial public offerings in recent memory  A huge number of well known brands hit the public equity markets for the first time and the term  unicorn    referring to a company that achieved more than a billion dollars in value before its IPO   became frequently used in the financial press With a crop of new stocks like Uber  NYSE UBER   Lyft  NASDAQ LYFT   Peloton  NASDAQ PTON   Beyond Meat  NASDAQ BYND   Pinterestand many more suddenly available to ordinary retail investors  it s understandable that less exciting names didn t end up getting a whole lot of attention Many of the most popular IPOs struggled coming out of the gate  Big private valuations and concerns about a path to profitability have investors cautious of buying up the shares in the secondary market  even for companies with well known goods and services that those same investors frequently use Debuting on the public stage at the end of 2018  Arcosa Inc  has been quietly beating analyst estimates and growing shareholder value  Unlike some of the big new stock names  Arcosa is consistently profitable even as it grows  After nearly doubling in its first year  Arcosa shares still trade at a thoroughly reasonable 12 month forward P E Ratio of 17 4X   lower than the S P 500 Infrastructure has been a hot industry for years with a strong economy and help from big spending Federal  state and local governments who are finding it easy to appropriate huge sums to projects intended to shore up the nation s roads  bridges and energy capital Arcosa s business is split into three separate units   Construction  Energy and Transportation and all of those lines have been booming Construction provides huge amounts of aggregate and specialty materials as well as the know how to guide clients through every stage of enormous projects Energy creates wind towers  utility transmission structures and storage tanks  The company s focus on clean  renewable energy leaves it well positioned to capitalize on global trends toward environmentally sustainable sources Transportation provides barges and marine hardware and a wide variety of equipment for the rail industry  Barges may not exactly sound like a very exciting business line  unless you consider that during just the past quarter  Arcosa s order backlog bacjlog for barges increased to  364 million Construction and Transportation each make up just about 25  of revenues with energy filling in the other half  That diversification of revenue sources means Arcosa is well insulated from a temporary downturn in any given segment  All three divisions showed quarterly and YoY revenue increases In the first three quarters that Arcos has been reporting results as a public company  they ve beat the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimates by 81   41  and 51   bringing the average surprise to almost 58  Sales are expected to grow 16 5  in 2020 and net earnings are forecast to increase by 14 5   Recently rising estimates earn Arcosa a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  While the infrastructure industry doesn t have the cache of high tech offerings like ride sharing  food delivery  fitness and internet apps  that can actually be good news for careful investors who are more concerned about profitability and valuation metrics than they are about hype Everyone loves an interesting story  but for the long term health of a portfolio  consistently profitability in a growth industry is much more important  Sometimes the Zacks Bear of the Day is a company with truly dismal prospects   possibly even a stock that s so bad that not only should investors avoid owning it  but aggressive traders might want to consider initiating a short position Deere and Company is not one of those stocks  It s an iconic American heavy equipment manufacturer with truly global reach and solid plans for both cutting costs and expanding product offerings  Unfortunately  it s also been on the wrong side of several global economic trends that threaten to weigh on results in the immediate future Recent reductions in company revenue guidance and subsequent negative earnings estimate revisions have landed Deere at the bottom of our rankings   a Zacks rank  5  Strong Sell  The trade disputes between the US and China   and to a lesser extent  Europe   have really put a squeeze on sales of agricultural equipment  US producers who had grown accustomed to exporting a huge amount of agricultural products abroad saw many of those international purchases drop off to near zero basically overnight Difficult weather conditions in the US in 2019 further added to the misery It s a basic economic reality that when farmers are experiencing favorable economic conditions  they frequently invest much of the surplus in equipment purchases  When times are tight  they generally curtail or delay big spending plans In an strange paradox for Deere  one of their strengths can actually hurt the company in times like these  Deere equipment is renowned for its high quality and durability  Though each new generation of machines adds technological advances that help farmers to work less  increase yields or both  the long useful life of the older equipment means farmers can keep servicing  maintaining and using their aging machinery during periods when they feel the need to tighten their belts In fact  it was reported recently that the used market for Deere tractors that are now 40 years old has been firming up lately because that generation of equipment   which lacks many of the modern comfort  convenience and data collection features of newer models   can also be repaired and maintained by even the smallest farmers Even though the latest  Phase 1  deal between the US and China will include a significant increase in Chinese purchase of US agricultural products over the next two years  it will take quite a while for those sales to make it to the bottom line for US farmers  meaning they ll probably be making do with old equipment for the foreseeable future Deere management certainly hasn t been ignoring the issue  In response to falling revenues  they ve been getting increasingly lean   by cutting staff and unprofitable product lines  and also making strategic investments in new products aimed more at the heavy construction industry rather than just agriculture They are also developing  precision agriculture  technologies that allow farmers to plant in ways that decrease costs while increasing yields As I mentioned earlier  the current situation is far from a disaster  Deere has been around since 1837 and with more than  32 billion of annual revenues   plus  4 4 billion in cash and over  50 billion in current assets on the balance sheet   they re certainly not going away anytime soon The next year or so could be rough however  so Deere shareholders might want to consider alternatives until the dust settles Additional content McDonald s Gears Up for Q4 Earnings  What s In Store McDonald s Corp is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2019 results on Jan 29

127117,348632,DRI,Powerful Proof Anyone Can Invest For An Early Retirement   February 03  2020,opinion,"Achieving the financial freedom to retire early a dream for most  Making that dream a reality isn t as tricky as it sounds  The secret is simple  Save a lot more each month  Sounds easy  right  Not so fast 
The typical rule of thumb given by financial planners is to have a goal of saving up to 20  of total earnings  But if you want to retire when you re younger  that percentage will probably need to be more like 40  to 50  of your income  Of course  that s not so simple since a big part of your paycheck goes to day to day  necessary expenses  So if you want to save that much  you need to make some serious lifestyle adjustments  It requires making changes  but it s doable 
A generally new development called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been created around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  idea  FIRE supporters create exacting savings plans  up to 75  of income  and make related compromises like living in small homes  walking to work every day  prohibitive weight control plans  etc  This way might be unreasonably prohibitive for many  yet the mentality offers a few takeaways that may merit consideration 
First  stick with the fundamentals of long term growth investing  Choose a diversified portfolio of stocks with exposure to different styles  sizes  sectors  and regions 
You may be able to accelerate your potential retirement earnings by consciously seeking higher returns  and also accepting more risk  in your investment portfolio  But whatever your risk tolerance  your portfolio must be diversified to protect against extreme market movements that could jeopardize your early retirement objective  You can choose from a number of ways to allocate investments to diversify your portfolio  and these should be informed by your individual goals  growth and income needs  appetite for risk  and age 
Once you ve begun saving at a higher rate and you have an investment plan  put that money to work in your plan as quickly as you can  Don t worry about finding the  perfect time  to invest   simply put the money in and keep it in  Let compounding work to help you grow your retirement savings at an exponential rate 
Astute investors pick retirement growth stocks with low beta  strong earnings estimates  positive sales growth  and expected future growth 
The Zacks Rank routinely recognizes lower risk growth retirement portfolio picks  and here are a few that may be worth considering  Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI  and PennyMac Mortgage  PMT   These growth stocks have strong Zacks Ranks and a beta of 1 or lower  with earnings and sales growth of at least 5  over the past 5 years

127118,348633,DRI,3 Top Ranked Dividend Stocks  A Smarter Way To Boost Your Retirement Income   February 03  2020,opinion,"Here s a revealing data point  older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself 
And unfortunately  even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned   with the traditional approaches to retirement planning  income may no longer cover expenses  That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet  setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans 
In today s economic environment  traditional income investments are not working 
For example  10 year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6 50   which translated to an income source you could count on  However  today s yield is much lower   currently under 2  and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements 
That means if you had  1 million in 10 year Treasuries  the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than  1 million 
In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields  today s retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits  Because of certain demographic factors  it s been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035 
So what s a retiree to do  You could cut your expenses to the bone  and take the risk that your Social Security checks don t shrink  Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady  higher rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
Dividend paying stocks from low risk  high quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace current low risk  low yielding Treasury and bond options 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
One way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3   and positive average annual dividend growth  Many stocks increase dividends over time  helping to offset the effects of inflation 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Carnival  NYSE CCL  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 5 per share  with a dividend yield of 4 59   This compares to the Leisure and Recreation Services industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 81   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 is flat compared to last year 
CyrusOne  CONE  is paying out a dividend of 0 5 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 29  compared to the REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry s yield of 4  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 is up 8 7  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 88 per share  Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI  has a dividend yield of 3 02   This is compared to the Retail   Restaurants industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 52 is up 17 33  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
It is true that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  but high quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly  can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market 
A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies  especially blue chip stocks  increase their dividends over time  helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
You may be thinking   I like this dividend strategy  but instead of investing in individual stocks  I m going to find a dividend focused mutual fund or ETF   This approach can make sense  but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees  which may reduce your dividend gains or income  and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach  If you do wish to invest in a fund  do your research to find the best quality dividend funds with the lowest fees 
Bottom Line
Whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  seeking the steady income of dividend paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress free retirement

127119,348634,DRI,Signs That Your Trading Will Ruin Your Retirement   February 04  2020,opinion,"You have a substantial retirement portfolio  You re an accomplished investor  You ve done truly well selecting stocks  You probably already own a couple of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI   First Defiance Financial  FDEF  and NexPoint Residential Trust Inc   NXRT  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
It could be a good idea   that is  if you are one of the very few investors who understands your own risk tolerance and can keep your emotions in check during chaotic market swings  However  if you re like the rest of us  there are likely more prudent ways to reach your retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires an altogether different investing philosophy and risk   reward understanding than building wealth for retirement 
Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets over nine decades found that just 4  of the best performing U S stocks generated all the market s gains  The rest were flat   the gains of the next 38  were wiped out by the bottom 58   which lost money 
For even the most talented stock pickers  the odds for long term success are slim 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
It is interesting to note that the period covered by this study includes the 1987 crash  the 2000 bear market  and the Great Recession of 2008  as well as the bull market of the 1990s 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

127154,348669,DRI,Should Value Investors Pick Darden Restaurants  DRI  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Darden Restaurants  Inc    NYSE DRI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Darden Restaurants has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 67  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 20  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Darden Restaurants  current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 20 39  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 75  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Darden Restaurants has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 62  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Darden Restaurants  stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Darden Restaurants has a P S ratio of about 1 62  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 49 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Darden Restaurants currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DRI a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Darden Restaurants is just 1 94  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2 09  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  DRI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Darden Restaurants might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of F  This gives DRI a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen nine estimates go lower in the past sixty days and two higher  while the full year estimate witnessed two upward and five downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has slipped 1 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has not witnessed any earnings movement  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Darden Restaurants  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDarden Restaurants is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 25  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks for Today Experts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning average gain of  24 6  per year These 7 were selected because of their superior potential for immediate breakout ,2020-01-06,Zacks Investment

127184,348699,DRI,Darden Restaurants  DRI  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI  reports results for the quarter ended November 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 19  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of Olive Garden and other chain restaurants is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 07 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 06 billion  up 4 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Darden Restaurants 
For Darden Restaurants  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Darden Restaurants will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Darden Restaurants would post earnings of  1 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 38  delivering a surprise of  1 47  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Darden Restaurants doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-12-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/darden-restaurants-dri-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200492231,200492231
127185,348700,DRI,Simple Secrets Anyone Can Use To Reach Early Retirement   December 13  2019,opinion,"Building sufficient financial resources to retire early may sound like a dream  but making that dream come true is not as hard as it may sound  The main thing is simply to save more money each month  No big deal  right  Well   
The typical rule of thumb given by financial planners is to have a goal of saving up to 20  of total earnings  But if you want to retire when you re younger  that percentage will probably need to be more like 40  to 50  of your income  Of course  that s not so simple since a big part of your paycheck goes to day to day  necessary expenses  So if you want to save that much  you need to make some serious lifestyle adjustments  It requires making changes  but it s doable 
A relatively new movement called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been developed around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  concept  FIRE followers develop strict savings programs  up to 75  of income  and make associated sacrifices like living in small apartments  walking to work every day  restrictive diets  and so on  This path may be too restrictive for many  but the mindset offers some takeaways that might be worth considering 
To start  stick with the essentials of long term growth investing  Build a diversified portfolio of stocks with exposure to various styles  sizes  sectors  and regions 
To accelerate the retirement investment cycle  you can construct a portfolio designed with more risk   and the potential for higher returns   but it should still be appropriately diversified to protect against larger than average market drawdowns that can be difficult to recover from and ruin any chance to accomplish your early retirement goal  There are numerous ways to diversify a portfolio  and how you do so should depend on your age  your risk tolerance  your growth and income needs  and your long term goals 
Once you ve begun saving at a higher rate and you have an investment plan  put that money to work in your plan as quickly as you can  Don t worry about finding the  perfect time  to invest   simply put the money in and keep it in  Let compounding work to help you grow your retirement savings at an exponential rate

127187,348702,DRI,Signs That Your Trading Will Ruin Your Retirement   December 20  2019,opinion,"You have a significant retirement portfolio  You re an experienced investor  You ve done pretty well at picking stocks  You probably even own a few of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI   CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP  and Horizon Bancorp  HBNC  
If you did something similar  would it be advisable for you to trade your own retirement nest egg 
Perhaps   if you re the  one in a million  investor who can expertly manage risk and maintain unflinching emotional control in volatile markets  But for most  there may be better strategies to achieve long term retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk   reward mindset than investing for retirement 
How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets over nine decades found that just 4  of the best performing U S stocks generated all the market s gains  The rest were flat   the gains of the next 38  were wiped out by the bottom 58   which lost money 
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is Investing Success All In Your Mind 
Most people think they can make rational investment decisions  but research indicates the opposite is often true  Investors followed in a DALBAR study performed significantly worse than the S P 500  For the 30 years between 1986 to 2015  the average investor earned just 3 66   whereas the S P 500 produced a 10 35  return 
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
Does that mean you should give up trading  Not necessarily  One solution is to take 10  of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

Typically  advisors peg 15  to 20  of total income saved each month as a goal   but if you want to retire earlier  you probably have to ratchet that number up to 40  or 50  of your income  Not a feat easily accomplished when you review your take into account that a good portion of your paycheck goes to essential  non negotiable lifestyle items  However  if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle changes and sacrifices  it s possible 
A generally new development called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been created around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  idea  FIRE supporters create exacting savings plans  up to 75  of income  and make related compromises like living in small homes  walking to work every day  prohibitive weight control plans  etc  This way might be unreasonably prohibitive for many  yet the mentality offers a few takeaways that may merit consideration 
The first point is to adhere to the key principles of long term investing  including developing a diversified portfolio that includes stocks with various styles  sizes  sectors and regions 
To speed up the retirement investment cycle  you can build a portfolio structured with more risk   and the potential for higher returns  It should in any case be adequately diversified to safeguard against sharper than normal market downturns that can be hard to recuperate from and that can ruin any opportunity to achieve your early retirement goal  There are various strategies to diversify a portfolio  and how you do so should be guided by your age  your risk appetite  your growth and income needs  and your long term objectives 
After accelerating your savings and setting up an ongoing plan  invest your savings into your portfolio at the earliest opportunity  Try not to attempt to time the market  Stay put  and let the compounding characteristics of the markets do its work to help grow your retirement wealth exponentially over time 
Growth stocks with low beta  strong earnings estimates  positive sales growth  and expected future growth are an excellent way to determine investable growth stocks for your retirement

If that sounds like you  should you actively trade your own retirement assets 
Perhaps   if you re the  one in a million  investor who can expertly manage risk and maintain unflinching emotional control in volatile markets  But for most  there may be better strategies to achieve long term retirement investing goals 
That s because the risk   reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long term wealth building and active stock trading 
Diversification vs  Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets spanning nine decades revealed that only 4  of the best performing U S stocks produced all the market s increases  The rest were flat   the gains of the following 38  were offset by the losses of the bottom 58

Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets   and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement

Does that mean you should give up trading  Not necessarily  One solution is to take 10  of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns 
However  the major part of your wealth   those assets reserved for retirement   ought to be invested utilizing a more careful  conservative  risk management strategy to produce steady  compounded returns so you can securely achieve your retirement objectives

127252,348767,DRI,Powerful Proof Anyone Can Invest For An Early Retirement   November 01  2019,opinion,"Building sufficient financial resources to retire early may sound like a dream  but making that dream come true is not as hard as it may sound  The main thing is simply to save more money each month  No big deal  right  Well   
Typically  advisors peg 15  to 20  of total income saved each month as a goal   but if you want to retire earlier  you probably have to ratchet that number up to 40  or 50  of your income  Not a feat easily accomplished when you review your take into account that a good portion of your paycheck goes to essential  non negotiable lifestyle items  However  if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle changes and sacrifices  it s possible 
A generally new development called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been created around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  idea  FIRE supporters create exacting savings plans  up to 75  of income  and make related compromises like living in small homes  walking to work every day  prohibitive weight control plans  etc  This way might be unreasonably prohibitive for many  yet the mentality offers a few takeaways that may merit consideration 
The first point is to adhere to the key principles of long term investing  including developing a diversified portfolio that includes stocks with various styles  sizes  sectors and regions 
You may be able to accelerate your potential retirement earnings by consciously seeking higher returns  and also accepting more risk  in your investment portfolio  But whatever your risk tolerance  your portfolio must be diversified to protect against extreme market movements that could jeopardize your early retirement objective  You can choose from a number of ways to allocate investments to diversify your portfolio  and these should be informed by your individual goals  growth and income needs  appetite for risk  and age

127253,348768,DRI,The Extreme Risks Of Trading Your Own Retirement Assets   November 08  2019,opinion,"You have a significant retirement portfolio  You re an experienced investor  You ve done pretty well at picking stocks  You probably even own a few of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI   CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP  and Southwest Gas  SWX  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
Perhaps   if you re the  one in a million  investor who can expertly manage risk and maintain unflinching emotional control in volatile markets  But for most  there may be better strategies to achieve long term retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires an altogether different investing philosophy and risk   reward understanding than building wealth for retirement 
Diversification vs  Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets spanning nine decades revealed that only 4  of the best performing U S stocks produced all the market s increases  The rest were flat   the gains of the following 38  were offset by the losses of the bottom 58  
For even the most expert stock pickers  the chances for long term achievement are thin 
Is Investing Success All In Your Mind 
Most people think they can make rational investment decisions  but research indicates the opposite is often true  Investors followed in a DALBAR study performed significantly worse than the S P 500  For the 30 years between 1986 to 2015  the average investor earned just 3 66   whereas the S P 500 produced a 10 35  return 
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

In business  it is to attract customers to your offering  These may seem simple  but success or failure is often determined by the relative attractiveness of what your entity offers compared to the other alternative  In conjunction with this simple reality  the psychological approach of those in the battle is a crucial variable  Today  as has been the case historically  you often learn about those who make the challenge much more formidable than it really is  When I was growing up  the local university  the University of Nevada Las Vegas  had a famous coach  He typically would describe upcoming opponents  no matter how good or bad  as tremendously formidable  as a way to motivate his players  As a youth  I thought his psychological strategy was tremendously advantageous and was part of the reason why his teams were successful  Having matured and been exposed to a wide variety of different mental approaches in various fields  my view is vastly different  Every battle is not going up a hill to take on a well fortified position by a heavily armed opponent  Many business opportunities are difficult  but achievable  The same holds true in hotly contested political races  An accurate analysis of the task at hand  the risks  and where the difficulties lie is at the top of any kind of strategic overview for competitive situations  Overstating those challenges can make a tough task seem insurmountable  or a relatively simple assignment much harder  With that  let us turn to the financial markets and how this pertains to the current environment 
With ten days remaining in the third quarter  global financial markets remain on edge  One only needs to look at what transpired in the equity markets on Friday as an example  With about half the trading day remaining  market participants were informed the Chinese delegation  here to lay the groundwork for trade negotiations with the United States in October  had decided to leave the country early  You know what came next  the market sold off after starting the day positively  Earlier in the week  the Federal Reserve Board made the much anticipated decision to lower short term interest rates by twenty five basis points  Chairman Powell also faced a dillemma in the short term repo market this week and had to inject anywhere from 50 75 billion dollars per day to lower the repo rates for users  they had spiked from 2  up to 10    After the Fed announcement  President Trump and his assistant  Peter Navarro  criticized Powell for being behind the curve  They wanted a fifty basis point cut to be more competitive with markets where interest rates are negative or zero  So  what comes next 
October quickly approaches  and already large players  most prominently Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   are warning of a very volatile month ahead  Earnings season will begin about ten days in  and the largest banks will initially be the center of attention  The energy area remains volatile as the recent events in Saudi Arabia certainly have heightened the tension around oil prices  Supply seems bountiful  and many believe weak demand in Asia  specifically China  will weigh on prices for quite some time  With the United States sending military personnel in the region  the Saudis are proclaiming lost production will come on line relatively quickly  On the earnings front  FedEx  NYSE FDX  and Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  both gave poor guidance because of tough competition and  in the case of FedEx  unpredictability about global trade  On the consumer end   General Mills   NYSE GIS   Cracker Barrel  and Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI  showed solid results  Those numbers are consistent with the thesis the strength of the economy is with the consumers  with weakness in manufacturing or dependent on global supply chains  Now  let s turn to the other wild card  the joy that is the political realm ",2019-09-22,Yale Bock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chinese-go-home-early-and-investors-panic-as-powell-cuts-rates-200466840,200466840

NEW YORK  Reuters    Las Vegas gambler William  Billy  Walters is expected to go to trial Monday on charges that he made more than  40 million through insider trading 
The case has drawn attention not only because of Walters  renown as a wealthy professional sports gambler  but because of a connection to star golfer Phil Mickelson and an investigation plagued by leaks 
Jury selection is set to begin in the morning before U S  District Judge Kevin Castel in federal court in Manhattan 
Walters  70  was arrested in May 2016 in Las Vegas on charges of securities and wire fraud 
Prosecutors accused him of trading on tips about Dean Foods Co from the company s former chairman  Tom Davis  making  43 million in profits and avoiding losses between 2008 and 2014  Walters was also accused of making  1 million trading on a tip about Darden Restaurants Inc  NYSE DRI  
Davis has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors 
In a related civil lawsuit  the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission said that Mickelson at one point bought Dean Foods  stock on a recommendation by Walters  to whom he owed money after placing bets with him 
Mickelson  who has won three Masters golf titles  was not accused of wrongdoing  but agreed to pay back more than  1 million that the SEC said he obtained by trading Dean Foods shares 
News that federal prosecutors were investigating Walters and Mickelson leaked to the news media two years before charges were filed  An agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation has admitted to being the source of the leaks  which are themselves being investigated by the Justice Department s Office of the Inspector General 
Walters sought to have the charges against him dismissed because of the leaks  but Judge Castel denied that motion earlier this month

127413,348928,DRI,Ex Dean Foods chairman  gambler charged for insider trading  Mickelson settles,news,"By Nate Raymond and Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  authorities on Thursday charged a former chairman of Dean Foods Co and a professional Las Vegas gambler with engaging in an insider trading scheme that netted over  40 million and included a tip that benefited professional golfer Phil Mickelson  William  Billy  Walters  who has built a multimillion dollar fortune as a famed Las Vegas sports bettor  was accused in an indictment filed in Manhattan federal court of trading on tips from Thomas Davis  Dean Food s former chairman   These bets were no gamble at all   Manhattan U S  Attorney Preet Bharara said   They were sure things   Mickelson  who has won three Masters golf titles  was not criminally charged  But he was named as a relief defendant  meaning he is not accused of wrongdoing but received ill gotten gains as a result of others  illegal acts  in a civil lawsuit by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  It said he also traded in Dean Foods stock  The lawsuit said that at a time when Mickelson owed Walters money after placing bets with him  Walters  aware of a Dean Foods corporate spin off  urged him to trade in the company s stock  enabling the golfer to earn  931 000  Mickelson agreed to pay back  1 03 million in profits and interest to resolve claims from his role in the scheme    Simply put  Mickelson made money that wasn t his to make   said Andrew Ceresney  the SEC s director of enforcement  Walters  69  was arrested in Las Vegas on Tuesday on charges of securities fraud  wire fraud and conspiracy  Davis  who resigned from Dean Foods  board in August  pleaded guilty on Monday  Barry Berke  Walters  lawyer  said the allegations were  based on erroneous assumptions  speculative theories and false finger pointing   Thomas Melsheimer  Davis s lawyer  said his client was cooperating in the probe   APPELLATE RULING The charges marked the most significant case Bharara s office has pursued since a 2014 appellate ruling limited the scope of insider trading laws  marking a major setback for a high profile crackdown underway since 2009  The ruling in particular limited authorities  ability to pursue charges against a defendant who heard a stock tip second  or third hand that originated with a corporate insider  making prosecuting someone like Mickelson more difficult  At a news conference  Bharara declined to say if that ruling was the reason Mickelson was not accused of wrongdoing  But he said the decision  has had an impact on our investigations   allowing some  nefarious conduct  not to be prosecuted  He called the ruling  wrongly decided   and noted the U S  Supreme Court has agreed to review what constitutes insider trading  Gregory Craig  Mickelson s lawyer  did not address the ruling in a statement but said the golfer felt  vindicated  the SEC concluded he did not engage in wrongdoing   At the same time  however  Phil has no desire to benefit from any transaction that the SEC sees as questionable   Craig said   DALLAS COWBOYS  TRADES Walters has long faced various state and federal probes in his career as one of the most successful sports betters in the United States  In 1992  he was acquitted by a federal jury of charges related to illegal bookmaking  According to Thursday s indictment  from 2008 to 2014 Walters obtained inside information about Dean Foods from Davis and used it to make  32 million in profits and avoid another  11 million in trading losses  Davis disclosed information to Walters about Dean Foods  financial outlook  earnings and its spin off of WhiteWaves Food Co  The deal sent the company s shares soaring after it was announced on Aug  8  2012  according to the indictment  To avoid detection  Walters gave Davis a prepaid cellular phone to use when passing along inside information and instructed him to use code words  including referring to Dean Foods as the  Dallas Cowboys   prosecutors said  Walters earned another  1 million trading on insider information about Darden Restaurants Inc  NYSE DRI  from Davis  who was sought by an investment firm in New York as an investor or director  the indictment said  The two men have been friends since the mid 1990s  based on shared interests in sports  golf  gambling and business  according to court papers  In exchange for his tips  the indictment said Davis received significant benefits  including about  1 million in loans that largely were never repaid  The probe conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U S  Securities and Exchange Commission became public in 2014 amid news reports also linking the investigation to activist investor Carl Icahn  Investigators had examined whether Icahn passed inside information about Clorox Co to Walters  sources have told Reuters  Bharara declined to say if that aspect of the probe remained open  Icahn acknowledged last year he had a business relationship with Walters but said he never provided inside information to anyone  
The cases in the U S  District Court  Southern District of New York  are U S  v  Walters  No  16 cr 338  U S  v  Davis  No  16 cr 338  and Securities and Exchange Commission v  Walters  No  16 cv 03772 ",2016-05-19,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dean-foods-ex-chairman,-pro-gambler-charged-with-insider-trading-403133",403133
127414,348929,DRI,Darden Restaurants  DRI  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended May 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on June 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of Olive Garden and other chain restaurants is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 24 billion  up 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 07  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Darden Restaurants 
For Darden Restaurants  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 16  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Darden Restaurants will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Darden Restaurants would post earnings of  1 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 80  delivering a surprise of  2 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Darden Restaurants appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-06-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/darden-restaurants-dri-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200431362,200431362

Darden Restaurants shares have added about 17 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 7  
What s Next for Darden Restaurants 
While Darden Restaurants has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Darden Restaurants was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 38 on  2 15 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  6 44 on  9 11 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

Darden s board expects to nominate nine directors for the 12 available seats at the Sept  30 shareholder meeting  Doing so  would ensure that at least three of the nominees proposed by Starboard would be elected  the company said 
 While a leadership change at Darden and the appointment of an independent chairman are positive steps that are long overdue  we view the board s 11th hour gesture to concede three board seats to Starboard as  too little  too late    Barington CEO James Mitarotonda said in a statement  He had asked Darden to split the chairman and CEO roles and agitated for Otis to be replaced 
 This board has a history of repeatedly making the easy decision  rather than the decision that is best for shareholders   Jeffrey Smith  Starboard s CEO  said in a statement   Darden needs a majority change to the board as soon as possible to jumpstart and complete the process of recruiting a truly great leader   Smith added 
Starboard owns about 5 5 percent of Darden s shares  Barington represents a group that holds more than 2 percent of Darden s shares 
Howard Penney  a restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management and a vocal critic of Darden s management  had a one word reaction to the CEO s departure and the other news   Amen  
Otis  who has been charge for a decade  will remain CEO until Dec  31 or until a replacement is appointed 
Darden named independent lead director  Charles Ledsinger Jr  as independent non executive chairman  effective immediately 
Earlier on Monday  Darden said it finalized the  2 1 billion sale of Red Lobster to Golden Gate Capital  a deal opposed by both Starboard and Barington  which were pressing for more comprehensive changes  Investor ire surged after Otis resisted putting the sale to a shareholder vote 

A Darden representative said Otis  departure was a  mutual decision  between the CEO and the board and had been under discussion for some time  The exit package has not yet been determined 
 With the Red Lobster sale complete and progress on our Olive Garden brand renaissance and other strategic priorities underway  this is the right time for me to step down   Otis said in a statement 
Darden shares rose  1 63 to  46 55 in after hours trading

127467,348982,DRI,Darden posts loss amid growing pressure from investor Starboard,news,"By Lisa Baertlein and Ramkumar Iyer  Reuters    Darden Restaurants Inc  N DRI  on Friday reported a quarterly loss  but its results were overshadowed by activist investor Starboard Value LP s revised plan to boost Darden s profit and stock price 
Starboard  one of Darden s largest investors with an 8 8 percent stake  late on Thursday unveiled a proposal that included plans to sell Darden s real estate  franchise its restaurants  spin off The Capital Grille  Yard House and other chains and fix its flagship Olive Garden chain 
Starboard  which also seeks to replace Darden s entire 12 member board  said it has identified cost savings of up to  326 million  It believes its strategy could send Darden s stock as high as  86 per share  even before it gets to work on fixing Olive Garden or selling restaurants to franchisees 
Darden President and Chief Operating Officer Gene Lee said the company was open to ideas for improving long term results and that it was  encouraged  by its own progress turning around Olive Garden 
Shares  which are down about 13 percent so far this year  fell 1 5 percent to  47 54 in afternoon trading 
Darden reported a net loss of  19 3 million  or 14 cents per share  from continuing operations for its first quarter ended Aug  24  Quarterly sales at Olive Garden restaurants open at least 16 months fell 1 3 percent 
Olive Garden accounts for more than half of Darden s overall revenue and about two thirds of its profit  Key same restaurant sales have been down for five straight quarters as it struggles to lure diners amid robust competition 
Starboard launched a fight to take over Darden s board in May  saying the then pending sale of Darden s Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain was a  destructive transaction  that ignored the rights of shareholders 
On July 28  the restaurant operator closed its  2 1 billion sale of Red Lobster  It also announced the year end departure of Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis 
That latter move was one of several concessions Darden has made to activists  which also include Barington Capital Group 
In its latest move  Darden said it would give four board seats to Starboard nominees 
In its presentation  Starboard outlined ways to cut executive costs and simplify everything from purchasing to menus  It plans to boost Olive Garden s alcohol sales  to use technology to eliminate  false waits  for tables at the Italian themed chain and to use more cost effective digital marketing 
The hedge fund also wants to fix Olive Garden s pasta  which it called poorly handled and generally overcooked 
 Shockingly  Olive Garden no longer salts the water it uses to boil the pasta  merely to get a longer warranty on its pots  Starboard said 

Meanwhile  Olive Garden this week had mixed results with its  100  Never Ending Pasta Pass  that gives holders unlimited pasta  salad  bread and Coca Cola drinks for seven weeks  It quickly sold all 1 000 passes offered  but demand crashed servers and spawned complaints on Facebook and Twitter from empty handed diners

127495,349010,DRI,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Darden Restaurants  DRI ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this owner of Olive Garden and other chain restaurants is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Darden Restaurants is 24 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 20 2  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 4 9  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Darden Restaurants has an S TA ratio of 1 52  which means that the company gets  1 52 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 1 46  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Darden Restaurants looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 5 4  this year versus the industry average of 3 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Darden Restaurants  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Darden Restaurants a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DRI s Value grade of B and WEN s Value grade of D

Chicago  IL   March 14  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Tiffany   Co    NYSE TIF    Darden Restaurants   NYSE DRI    PVH Corp    NYSE PVH   and G III Apparel   NASDAQ GIII   
Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  
These Factors Are Likely to Spell Tiffany s  TIF  Q4 Fate
Tiffany   Co is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 22  In the trailing four quarters  this designer  manufacturer and retailer of jewelry and other items has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by average of 14 1   In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 3  
How Are Estimates Shaping Up 
After witnessing a bottom line decline of about 4  in the third quarter of fiscal 2018  Tiffany is likely to record year over year decrease of roughly 4 2  in the fourth quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at  1 60 compared with  1 67 reported in the year ago quarter  We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  1 341 million  up marginally from  1 334 3 million generated in the year ago quarter 
For fiscal 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  4 67  reflecting an increase of approximately 13  year over year  For revenues  the consensus estimate stands at  4 46 billion 
Key Factors
Tiffany is well positioned to augment its top line performance in the long haul by leveraging capital investments made over the past several years in distribution  manufacturing and diamond sourcing processes  The company is also looking at other revenue generating avenues  It also intends to expand distribution network by adding stores in both new and existing markets 
The company is focused on opening smaller stores that offer selected collections of lower priced higher margin product  which in turn boosts store productivity  The company is gradually coming up with new jewelry designs  range of watches and fragrance  It has also introduced  build your own program  on its website under which customers are allowed to personalize their charm bracelets  Further  Tiffany is enabling customers to customize rings  That said  management envisions fiscal 2018 worldwide net sales growth of 6 7   on a reported and constant currency basis 
Despite the company s efforts to bolster the top line  rising SG A expenses may dent operating margin  SG A expenses may increase on account of higher spending on technology  marketing communications  visual merchandising  digital and store presentations  Management expects operating margin in fiscal 2018 to decline year over year  owing to a rise in SG A costs  As a result  Tiffany expects fiscal 2018 earnings per share at the low end of its previously guided range of  4 65  4 80 
Holiday Season Did Not Fare Well
Holiday Season  which coincides with the fourth quarter  did not fare well for Tiffany  The company s worldwide net sales slipped 1  to  1 04 billion  while comparable sales declined 2   Results were significantly impacted by reduced sales to foreign tourists and lower demand from local customers in Europe and Americas  However  robust sales growth was noted in mainland China and Japan  while the global e commerce sales were also favorable during the season 
What s the Probability of Earnings Beat 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tiffany is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

the stock has gained nearly 12  in the past six months  Yet  high labor costs and currency headwinds remain major concerns  Also  revenues have been under pressure for quite some time due to its refranchising initiatives Key CatalystsMcDonald s delivered better than expected earnings for the 18th straight quarter when it posted fourth quarter 2018 results  The bottom line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  the average being 5 2   A robust operating performance drove McDonald s earnings during this time frame  Adjusted earnings of  1 97 per

in the United States  representing about 40  of the company s business  McDonald s aims at improving its focus on growing guest traffic  In this regard  it is imperative to mention that the company is accentuating on operational excellence  product innovation  offering a value menu and rolling out more limited time offerings  The United Kingdom reported 51 straight quarter of like for like sales growth  Meanwhile  Australia  Canada  Germany and Italy are all witnessing robust sales growth Further  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s strategic efforts in the International Lead segment and High

of 5 4  and 4 6  in the third quarter  Comps growth in international markets was driven by robust sales in the United Kingdom  Australia and France  In High Growth markets  improvement in comps can be attributed to solid performance in Italy  Poland  the Netherlands as well as impressive results across majority of the segments ConcernsRevenue decline at McDonald s has been weighing on the company s performance for quite some time  In the fourth quarter of 2018  the metric decreased 3  year over year  following a 7   12  and 9  fall in the third  second and first quarter of 2018  respectively  The top line had also declined 11 4   13   7   and 4 7   in the fourth  third  second and the first quarter of 2017  respectively  This downturn reflects the impact of the company s strategic refranchising initiatives  During the reported quarter  the company operated restaurants  revenues decreased 11  year over year to  2 371 2 million Of late  McDonald s margins have been under pressure due to worldwide wage increases  Meanwhile  apart from minimum wage increases  additional health care costs related to  Obamacare  in the United States are pushing up labor costs  Further  costs associated with brand positioning in all the key markets as well as ongoing investments in initiatives would continue to dent margins at least in the near term  Increased commodity costs may further hurt margins  In the fourth quarter  company operated margins contracted 190 bps  following a decline of 70 bps in the preceding quarter due to continued labor as well as commodity pressures across

127630,349145,DRI,Pick These 4 Retail Stocks To Alleviate Holiday Sales Woes,opinion,Just when it seemed that Wall Street has got fairly accustomed to domestic issues after a tumultuous 2018  the recently reported soft holiday sales numbers may unnerve the market again  National Retail Federation  NRF  unveiled that holiday sales in 2018 did not live up to expectations in spite of signs that consumers remained somewhat optimistic about the economic scenario Further  the Commerce Department stated that U S  retail and food services sales witnessed its steepest drop since September 2009 in the month of December  This has raised concerns regarding moderating pace of consumer spending in the October December quarter of 2018  Consumer spending showcased an increase of 3 5  in the third quarter What the Numbers Say Data compiled by the NRF revealed that retail sales during the festive season rose 2 9  over last year to  707 5 billion  Clearly  this fell short of the group s projection of 4 3 4 8  increase in November and December sales  excluding autos  gas and restaurant  to  717 45  720 89 billion The retail trade association also suggested that online and other non store sales surged 11 5  to  146 8 billion  compared with growth forecast of 11 15  to  151 6  157 billion  While sales during the month of November rose 5 1  year over year  the metric was up by a meager 0 9  in December and down 1 5  sequentially Per the Commerce Department  U S  retail and food services sales in December fell 1 2  to  505 8 billion  following a downwardly revised reading of 0 1  gain in November last year  The report indicated sharp fall in sales at furniture   home furnishing stores  health   personal care stores  and sporting goods  hobby  book   music stores  Receipts at gasoline stations also took a plunge  Even e commerce  which used to look strong  struggled A Brief IntrospectionMarket experts cited that various macro and micro issues such as U S  China trade conflict  volatile crude prices  tightening of monetary policy  partial government shutdown and slowing global economy might have impacted consumer behavior  These factors have a direct or an indirect bearing on consumer sentiment There is a lingering fear that a fall in consumer sentiment might have impacted consumers  spending pattern  which accounts for over two thirds of the U S  economic activity  Undoubtedly  reluctance on the part of consumers to spend more is the last thing retailers want  A group of investors believe that these factors will weigh on markets Nonetheless  some pundits remain skeptical about the data  Further  the NRF said  There s also a question of whether the government shutdown and resulting delay in collecting data might have made the results less reliable   Definitely  sales results come as a surprise when the economy is witnessing strong job additions and rising wages  Earlier this month  the NRF projected that retail sales will increase in the band of 3 8 4 4  to more than  3 8 trillion in 2019 4 Prominent PicksWell keeping aside disappointing sales results for a while  let s take a look at some retail stocks with a favorable

Holiday Sales Woes  4 Retailers to BuyJust when it seemed that Wall Street has got fairly accustomed to domestic issues after a tumultuous 2018  the recently reported soft holiday sales numbers may unnerve the market again  National Retail Federation  NRF  unveiled that holiday sales in 2018 did not live up to expectations in spite of signs that consumers remained somewhat optimistic about the economic scenario Further  the Commerce Department stated that U S  retail and food services sales witnessed its steepest drop since September 2009 in the month of December  This has raised concerns regarding moderating pace of consumer spending in the October December quarter of 2018  Consumer spending showcased an increase of 3 5  in the third quarter What the Numbers Say Data compiled by the NRF revealed that retail sales during the festive season rose 2 9  over last year to  707 5 billion  Clearly  this fell short of the group s projection of 4 3 4 8  increase in November and December sales  excluding autos  gas and restaurant  to  717 45  720 89 billion The retail trade association also suggested that online and other non store sales surged 11 5  to  146 8 billion  compared with growth forecast of 11 15  to  151 6  157 billion  While sales during the month of November rose 5 1  year over year  the metric was up by a meager 0 9  in December and down 1 5  sequentially Per the Commerce Department  U S  retail and food services sales in December fell 1 2  to  505 8 billion  following a downwardly revised reading of 0 1  gain in November last year  The report indicated sharp fall in sales at furniture   home furnishing stores  health   personal care stores  and sporting goods  hobby  book   music stores  Receipts at gasoline stations also took a plunge  Even e commerce  which used to look strong  struggled A Brief IntrospectionMarket experts cited that various macro and micro issues such as U S  China trade conflict  volatile crude prices  tightening of monetary policy  partial government shutdown and slowing global economy might have impacted consumer behavior  These factors have a direct or an indirect bearing on consumer sentiment There is a lingering fear that a fall in consumer sentiment might have impacted consumers  spending pattern  which accounts for over two thirds of the U S  economic activity  Undoubtedly  reluctance on the part of consumers to spend more is the last thing retailers want  A group of investors believe that these factors will weigh on markets Nonetheless  some pundits remain skeptical about the data  Further  the NRF said  There s also a question of whether the government shutdown and resulting delay in collecting data might have made the results less reliable   Definitely  sales results come as a surprise when the economy is witnessing strong job additions and rising wages  Earlier this month  the NRF projected that retail sales will increase in the band of 3 8 4 4  to more than  3 8 trillion in 2019 4

shutdown in history  Consumers  assessment of current conditions improved and expectations about the future strengthened  indicating sturdy economic growth On more confident Americans  things have

analysts  expectations of a 124 7 reading and has rebounded after three straight months of declines People s confidence in the present situations improved from 170 2 last month to 173 5 this month  which is an 18 year high  The future expectations index also increased from 89 4 to 103 4  the largest monthly gain since 2011 What Drove Confidence Consumers  optimism was largely driven by strength in the labor market  The U S  economy continues to be one of the world s most powerful employment generating machines  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the economy added 304 000 new jobs

diminished concerns about recession  Lynn Franco  director of economic indicators at the Conference Board  added that  consumer expectations  which had been negatively impacted in recent months by financial market volatility and the government shutdown  recovered  Why Does Consumer Confidence Matter Such a record consumer confidence number is a significant reading since it has been  historically  good at predicting consumer spending over the next three to six months  The more confidence households generate  the more will they spend  Notably  consumer spending accounts for roughly 70  of the U S  economy  which isn t a petty number These numbers influence companies  production schedule  particularly big ticket items like cars and appliances  In fact  the consumer discretionary sector is mostly affected as spending plays a major role in determining revenues  Automobile stocks often track these numbers and so do appliance manufacturers  retailers  consumer discretionary

Americans Regain Confidence in February  5 Top Gainers
Consumer confidence bounced back in February on a healthy labor market and an end to the U S  government s longest shutdown in history  Consumers  assessment of current conditions improved and expectations about the future strengthened  indicating sturdy economic growth 
On more confident Americans  things have been looking up for consumer stocks  Stocks of consumer discretionary companies are poised to grow on signs of renewed consumer spending 
Consumer Confidence Bounces Back in February
According to the Conference Board  the consumer confidence index climbed to 131 4 this month from a revised 121 7 in January  The key economic indicator that measures attitudes on future economic prospects exceeded analysts  expectations of a 124 7 reading and has rebounded after three straight months of declines 
People s confidence in the present situations improved from 170 2 last month to 173 5 this month  which is an 18 year high  The future expectations index also increased from 89 4 to 103 4  the largest monthly gain since 2011 
What Drove Confidence 
Consumers  optimism was largely driven by strength in the labor market  The U S  economy continues to be one of the world s most powerful employment generating machines  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the economy added 304 000 new jobs in January  exceeding analysts  estimates of around 172 000 
December s job additions  in the meanwhile  were revised down from 312 000 jobs to 222 000  while November s rose from 176 000 to 196 000  Nonetheless  the average for the last three months is now 241 000 jobs  marking one of the best stretches during an economic expansion dating back nine and a half years ago  By the way  employment gains in 2018 turned out to be the strongest in the last three years 
An end to a partial federal government shutdown also helped Americans regain optimism and diminished concerns about recession  Lynn Franco  director of economic indicators at the Conference Board  added that  consumer expectations  which had been negatively impacted in recent months by financial market volatility and the government shutdown  recovered  
Why Does Consumer Confidence Matter 
Such a record consumer confidence number is a significant reading since it has been  historically  good at predicting consumer spending over the next three to six months  The more confidence households generate  the more will they spend  Notably  consumer spending accounts for roughly 70  of the U S  economy  which isn t a petty number 
These numbers influence companies  production schedule  particularly big ticket items like cars and appliances  In fact  the consumer discretionary sector is mostly affected as spending plays a major role in determining revenues  Automobile stocks often track these numbers and so do appliance manufacturers  retailers  consumer discretionary manufacturers  big ticket entertainment providers  jewelry sellers and cruise line operators  to name a few

127638,349153,DRI,What Bargain Hunting  Bet On 5 Stocks With Rising P E,opinion,"Wall Street has been rock solid from the start of this year  having seen the best start   per financial times  Many may start finding stocks fairly valued  or overvalued  at the current level and go for some bargain hunting 
After all  looking for stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is among the widely used investing strategies  Investors believe that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  The logic is simple   a stock s current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside 
But there is more to this whole P E story as not only low P E  stocks with a rising P E can also fetch solid returns 
Rising P E  An Useful Tool
Generally  the price of a stock rallies on a rise in earnings  As forecasts for expected earnings move higher  demand for the stock should drive its price  After all  astock s P E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out for every dollar of earnings  Thus  if the P E of a stock is rising steadily  it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company s inherent strength 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 47 
Here are five of the 47 stocks 
Materion Corporation   NYSE MTRN    Materion Corporation through its wholly owned subsidiaries is engaged in the production and supply of high performance engineered materials in the United States and internationally  It hails from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 15    The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

Investment Research 4 of the Best Stocks to Buy for Earnings GrowthTake a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have earnings  Earnings growth draws the attention of almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  And why not  If the company doesn t make money  it won t survive the test of time This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important for investors to buy stocks that have witnessed historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

127675,349190,DRI,Bear Of The Day  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  Inc   RRGB ,opinion,"The overall retail restaurant industry gained 6 23  last year  while the S P 500 slipped over 4   Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  Inc   RRGB   however  was not one of the restaurant industry s winners as it suffered from subdued comparable sales  poor dine in traffic  rising costs  and more 
Overview   Outlook 
Red Robin is a casual restaurant chain best known for its burgers and fries  The company boasts more than 570 mostly suburban locations across the U S  and Canada  In 2018  RRGB stock plummeted roughly 53  for the reasons we mentioned at the top 
Red Robin s revenues fell 3 5  in the third quarter on the back of a 3 4  drop in same store sales  RRGB s revenues also fell short of Wall Street Estimates for the third straight quarter  Plus  the firm s guest count comps slipped 1 9  from the year ago period  Red Robin s operating costs also climbed as it spent more on technology updates  repairs and maintenance expenses  third party delivery fees  and more 
Red Robin hopes its spending will help the company lower wait times  The company also rolled out its new in restaurant table management software to lower ticket times  improve tableside service  and handle larger volumes during peak hours  On top of that  Red Robin has tried to expand its online ordering business and ramp up its carry out  delivery  and catering sales 
Q4 Estimates 
Looking ahead  Red Robin s fourth quarter revenues are projected to sink 9 83  from  342 35 million in the year ago period to  308 70 million  Clearly  year over year declines are never good  but we should note that RRGB s fourth quarter 2017 revenues soared 17 5   This growth was  however  driven primarily by new restaurant openings           
Investors should also note that Red Robin s Q4 comps are projected to fall 3  based on our current NFM estimates  Jumping ahead to fiscal 2019  Red Robin is expected to see its full year revenues slip marginally below our 2018 estimate 
Moving on  Red Robin s adjusted Q4 earnings are expected to plummet 51 28  to touch  0 38 a share  Meanwhile  the company s full year earnings are also projected to sink 32 53   RRGB s fiscal 2019 EPS figure is expected to climb 2 1  above our 2018 projection  which is hardly impressive considering just how much its bottom line is expected decline 
Earnings Trends
On top of its expected top and bottom line downturns  Red Robin has also experienced some negative earnings estimate revision activity over the last 90 days  In fact  RRGB has seen its Q4 earnings estimate fall from  0 63 a share to its current  0 38 during this stretch  Investors will also see that Red Robin has earned some negative earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2018 and 2019 over the 30 days  This means at least some analysts are even more bearish on the burger joint s bottom line            
 
Bottom Line
Red Robin is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  at the moment based  in large part  on the negative earnings revision trends we just touched on  Even though RRGB stock has tumbled over the last 52 weeks  it might have a hard time bouncing back in 2019 based on its top and bottom line projections as it fights to adapt to a quickly changing retail age

127689,349204,DRI,Soft Traffic To Hurt Restaurant Industry s Near Term Prospects,opinion,"The Zacks  industry includes owners and operators of casual dining restaurants and full service restaurants  and roaster  marketer and retailers of specialty coffee  Companies in the industry also develop  franchise  license and operate quick service restaurants 
Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Growth in the restaurant industry is likely to be driven by increase in consumer spending  steady rise in wages  lower unemployment and restaurant operators  focus on digital innovation  With the growing clout of Internet  digital innovation has become the need of the hour  Restaurant operators are continuously partnering with delivery channels and digital platforms to drive incremental sales  Such efforts should continue benefiting the industry  According to an article by Restaurant Business  the fast casual restaurant space is likely to record sales growth of 8 3  in 2019 compared with 8  in 2018  Casual dining sales are expected to rise 3 4  in the current year  up from the past year s 3 2   Fine dining restaurants will also see a rise in sales of 5 2  compared with 5  growth in 2018  Even though comps have increased over the past months  decline in traffic continues to be a major concern for the companies in this space  Persistent erosion in traffic compared with comps growth indicates that it is only guest checks and not guest counts that contribute to restaurant sales  This also means that consumers are not frequently visiting restaurants and instead are getting increasingly reliant on delivery services  Moreover  restaurant giants are plagued by high cost of operations  Further  sales building efforts such as promotional activities and a convincing pricing strategy are detrimental to margins  Apart from this  competition  high wage and food cost inflation remain concerns Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dismal Prospects
The Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry is grouped within the broader  
The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates gloomy near term prospects  The Zacks Retail   Restaurant industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  167  which places it at the bottom 35  of 256 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since Jun 30  2018  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 2  
Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry s rank has remained in the bottom half in the past eight weeks 
 
Industry Outperforms S P 500   Sector
The Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry has outperformed its own sector and the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year 
Over this period  the industry has gained 5 4  against the sector and Zacks S P 500 composite s decline of 3  and 5 1   respectively 

 
Despite the industry s drab near term prospects  we ll present a few restaurant industry stocks that one can buy  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder return and current valuation before that 
Restaurant Industry s Valuation
On the basis of the forward 12 month P E ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing restaurant stocks  the industry is currently trading at 22 22X compared with the S P 500 s 15 71X  It is also above the sector s forward 12 month P E ratio of 21 37X 
Over the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 25 29X  as low as 19 55X and at the median of 22 42X  as the chart below shows 
 
Bottom Line
Steady decline in traffic has been raising concerns about the near term fate of restaurant operators  Moreover  restaurants are highly susceptible to the inconsistent nature of consumer discretionary spending  However  restaurant operators are continuously partnering with delivery channels and digital platforms to drive incremental sales 
Below we have discussed four stocks that investors may want to buy now You can see  Bojangles   Inc   BOJA   This Charlotte  NC based company  which develops  operates  and franchises limited service restaurants in the United States  has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 EPS indicates year over year growth of 10 6   Earnings estimates have been stable over the past 30 days

127690,349205,DRI,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Darden Restaurants  DRI ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Darden Restaurants currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if DRI is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this owner of Olive Garden and other chain restaurants holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For DRI  shares are up 6 5  over the past week while the Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry is up 4 01  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 28  compares favorably with the industry s 1 32  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Darden Restaurants have increased 0 06  over the past quarter  and have gained 10 88  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved  4 65  and  4 45   respectively 
Investors should also take note of DRI s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  DRI is averaging 1 437 054 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with DRI 
Over the past two months  10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost DRI s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 61 to  5 68 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line

127692,349207,DRI,4 Of The Best Stocks To Buy For Earnings Growth,opinion,"Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have earnings  Earnings growth draws the attention of almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  And why not  If the company doesn t make money  it won t survive the test of time 
This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock 
Earnings Estimates Determine Share Prices

Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm 
Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important for investors to buy stocks that have witnessed historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates

	For a moment Monday morning  it looked like the major indices may be able to recover from another negative open  But with breakeven in sight  their mood turned sour again and stocks dropped almost right into the close 
	The NASDAQ is now in negative territory for the year after slumping 2 27   or nearly 157 points  to 6753 73  The Dow slipped 2 1   or 507 points  to 23592 98  bringing its two day loss to over 1000 points

	The big news of the week  and possibly for the rest of the year  is the Fed meeting that starts tomorrow and ends on Wednesday  For a market that s scared of its own shadow  this important get together is more than enough reason to continue selling off  Fed Chair Jerome Powell   Friends are still expected to raise rates for a fourth time this year 
	The big question is whether or not this steep correction has convinced them to take things slower in 2019  You can feel how much the anticipation is stressing the market right now  And it s downright unbearable when you add the 90 day window for trade negotiations with China 
	The market may continue to selloff on any upward movement until some actual progress can be reported on these issues  Maybe the Fed can strike the right tone this week  Let s not give up on Santa just yet Today s Portfolio Highlights 
	Home Run Investor  When the market really started turning lower this afternoon  nLight  LASR  was still solidly in the green  The company eventually succumbed to all the selling  but still finished better than the market in general  Brian Bolan liked the resilience that was shown  and decided to add the stock on Monday  But that s not all he likes about LASR  which makes chips that guide lasers for cutting  welding and all sorts of other end uses  The company beat by 25  in its most recent quarter  while the topline grew nearly 40  amid an improving margin picture  The editor has several openings in the portfolio after selling a few last week  and he s got a nice entry point with LASR hovering near its 52 week lows  Read the complete commentary for a lot more on this new addition  Black Box Trader  The portfolio swapped out four names in this week s adjustment  The stocks that were sold today include

	 Dangerous time to be in the market  I hope most have focused on capital preservation and discipline these last couple weeks  Besides going to cash or actively trading both long and short  being disciplined is all you can really do in this environment 
	 Our strategy will be to manage the current positions and get out when stopped  This will manage our losses while raising cash while the market falls  When there is a turning point  we will be able to attack all the opportunity that this market is about to give us      Jeremy Mullin

127754,349269,DRI,Why Darden Restaurants  DRI  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This owner of Olive Garden and other chain restaurants has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5 95  
For the most recent quarter  Darden Restaurants was expected to post earnings of  1 23 per share  but it reported  1 34 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 94   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 35 per share  while it actually produced  1 39 per share  a surprise of 2 96  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Darden Restaurants  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Darden Restaurants has an Earnings ESP of  4 40  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on December 18  2018 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-darden-restaurants-dri-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200366178,200366178
127755,349270,DRI,Will Top Line Growth Support Ciena s  CIEN  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Ciena Corporation   NYSE CIEN   is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2018 financial results  ended Oct 31  2018  before the opening bell on Dec 13  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 37 1  Let s find out how things are shaping up prior to the announcement Factors to ConsiderCiena remains confident about its business model and ability to achieve the three year financial targets on the back of its diversification  global scale and innovation leadership  The company is augmenting its Packet Networking portfolio with new Adaptive IP capabilities  coherent optics and purpose built hardware platforms to enable service providers to capitalize on 5G During the fiscal fourth quarter  Ciena announced that Tele2 Netherlands   a leading regional telecommunications service provider   deployed its WaveLogic Ai coherent optical solution to increase the latter s network capacity and minimize operating expenses  The company also announced that Hawaiki Submarine Cable LP   a new entrant in the telecommunications market   selected its GeoMesh Extreme solution based on Waveserver Ai and various packet optical networking platforms to deliver unmatched connectivity to Australia  New Zealand  the Pacific Islands and the United States Furthermore  Ciena announced that Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  Global Carrier   the international wholesale arm of Deutsche Telekom   deployed the company s WaveLogic Ai coherent optical solution to boost bandwidth services and reach longer distances across the latter s network  Although these deals are not likely to have a significant impact on the top line  incremental revenues will enable the company to attract similar deals in the future and strengthen its leading position in the market For fiscal fourth quarter  management expects revenues to be between  845 million and  875 million  It expects to deliver gross margin in the low 40s  The company projects operating expenses to be approximately  255 million and expects it to be slightly higher in the quarter due to the 53 week fiscal year and the addition of Packet Design Top Line ExpansionOwing to a combination of solid strategy execution and broad based customer demand  Ciena expects to witness a year over year improvement in revenues for the quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Networking Platforms segment  which accounts for the lion s share of total revenues  is currently pegged at  700 million  Revenues from Software and Software Related Services are expected to be  49 3 million compared with  24 5 million reported in the year ago quarter  Revenues from Global Services are estimated to be  111 million  Consequently  for the fiscal fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at  860 million  Notably  it generated revenues of  744 million in the year earlier quarter  Adjusted earnings per share are pegged at 49 cents  up from 46 cents reported a year ago What Our Model SaysOur proven model conclusively shows that Ciena is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses both the two key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP  Ciena s Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  0 75   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our     Ciena Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Zacks Rank  Ciena currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  This increases the predictive power of ESP and makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Darden Restaurants  Inc    NYSE DRI   has an Earnings ESP of  4 40  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Accenture plc   NYSE ACN   has an Earnings ESP of  0 69  and a Zacks Rank  2   American Express Company   NYSE AXP   has an Earnings ESP of  2 67  and a Zacks Rank  2   Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like

reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2018-12-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-topline-growth-support-cienas-cien-q4-earnings-200367020,200367020
127756,349271,DRI,Darden Restaurants  DRI  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of Olive Garden and other chain restaurants is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 91 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 98 billion  up 5 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 06  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Darden Restaurants 
For Darden Restaurants  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 40  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Darden Restaurants will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Darden Restaurants would post earnings of  1 23 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 34  delivering a surprise of  8 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Darden Restaurants appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/darden-restaurants-dri-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200367091,200367091

127876,349391,DRI,Darden Gains From Cheddar s Acquisition  Competition Rife,opinion,Darden Restaurants  Inc  s   NYSE DRI   effective sales boosting initiatives  Brand Renaissance Plan and synergies from Cheddar s acquisition put the company on growth trajectory  However  high costs related to restaurant operations and stiff competition in the industry remain major concerns Last month  Darden posted   wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues lagged the same  Also  both earnings and revenues in the last reported quarter grew 29 5  and 13 3   respectively  from the prior year quarter The company s relentless efforts in improving the basic operating factors of the business   food  service and atmosphere   remain the key growth driver Notably  shares of Darden have rallied 7 4  in the past six months  outperforming its  s gain of 3 8  Cheddar s Acquisition Drives Top LineDarden s acquisition of small restaurant chain  Cheddar s Scratch Kitchen  Cheddar s   in April 2017  added an undisputed casual dining value to the company s portfolio of differentiated brands  It also helped Darden to further enhance its scale In the fiscal third quarter  total sales were favored by 11 3  from the addition of 154 Cheddar s and 34 other new restaurants  Segmental sales also improved owing to Cheddar s integration in the Other Business segment  which jumped 71 4  year over year to  438 million in the last reported quarter Brand Renaissance Plan for Olive Garden   Other Sales Building Efforts Boost CompsDarden implemented a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan to boost the performance of the Olive Garden brand  These include simplifying kitchen systems  improving sales planning and scheduling  operational excellence to improve guest experience  developing new core menu items  allowing customization and making smarter promotional investments Also  the brand is focusing on remodeling and bar refreshes  The revamped restaurants are already generating high same restaurant sales and returns  In fact  the remodeling program has gained momentum in the last couple of quarters and the company intends to continue investing in remodeling for optimal returns  In fact  supported by these initiatives  Olive Garden posted the 14th consecutive quarter of positive comps in third quarter fiscal 2018 Meanwhile  Darden is also focusing on technology driven initiatives like the system wide rollout of tablets  in order to capitalize on the digital wave that has hit the U S  fast casual restaurant sector  This initiative has boosted sales for the past few quarters  Sales of the company have also picked up momentum with the launch of mobile ordering in November 2014 High Costs Pose ConcernHigher labor costs due to increased wages and those incurred on implementation of the Affordable Care Act are expected to continue keeping Darden s profits under pressure Further  the non franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses  Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Darden  so instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs on the franchisee  the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business In fact  in the first nine months of fiscal 2018  total operating costs and expenses increased 14 4  year over year Competitive Industry Puts Pressure on DardenDarden operates in the retail restaurant space that is highly dependent on consumer discretionary spending  Although higher disposable income and increased wages are favoring the industry right now  it can change with the slightest disruption in the economy  Darden  therefore  is highly vulnerable to the inconsistent nature of consumer discretionary spending  If the company does not make pragmatic use of advanced technologies to innovate across value chains  it has high chances of fading out like many other retailers  In fact  for the restaurant industry as a whole  the fourth quarter comps were up by a meager 0 4  after seven consecutive quarter of declining comps Moreover  the retail restaurant space is highly competitive as numerous restaurant operators are adapting advanced and prudent strategies to increase their sales  These initiatives involve high costs  Darden also is bearing the brunt of higher operating cost from these sales building initiatives  In fact  in the first nine months of fiscal 2018  total operating costs and expenses increased 14 4  year over year  Amid such stiff competition  Darden is also missing out on international presence that other restaurant chains like McDonald s   NYSE MCD    Domino s   NYSE DPZ   and Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM   are aggressively pursuing We believe that the company needs to expand its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cut throat competition in the saturated domestic market Zacks RankDarden carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

to pamper their loved ones on Valentine s Day  Demand for dining out also sees an uptick This Valentine s Day won t be any different  The demand for such discretionary items is likely to shoot up

127947,349462,DRI,Sizzling Steak Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"The old saying goes  the sizzle sells the steak  which suggests that the meat is not the thing that gets your interest as much as the sound of the cooking that tantalizes your senses   
I would point out that what creates the sizzle is the steak  and if the steak is selling  then there is going to be even that much more sizzle   I think I have started a virtuous cycle of steaks and sizzles    but I think you get my idea 
Let s look at a few sizzling stocks that can attribute steaks and strong economy as the reason for their great charts 
Ruth s Hospitality  RUTH 
When I think of RUTH  I picture a juicy steak that literally does still sizzle when it reaches my table   I can say that in the last 5 months I was at a RUTH restaurant and while it was fantastic   It was a Sunday evening in Boston and the place was packed    suggesting that this story has been ongoing for a few months now 
RUTH has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 3 of the last 4 reports and has even seen an increase in earnings estimates but the stock is still a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   I see the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved from  1 12 to  1 15  but that was not enough to move the rank higher 
 Ruth s Hospitality Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    
Del Frisco s Restaurant Group  DFRG 
As a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  the group that owns names like Double Eagle Steakhouse and Sullivan s Steakhouse and Del Frisco s Grille  this one could have the best chart   It has been some time since I was in a Sullivan s but I have eaten there and it was fantastic   
The earnings history for DFRG is a little rough  with the company missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 3 of the last 4 quarters  That said  estimates for 2017 and 2018 are inching higher   One other factor that adds some sizzle here is the Zacks ESP  most accurate estimate  is showing a  4 76  reading with earnings expected in the middle of February 
Chart 

Darden  DRI 
DRI is not really a steakhouse as the majority of this name is Olive Garden and more casual dining   That said  Capital Grille and Longhorn Steakhouse is under that umbrella  The thing to note about this chart is that the company reported a solid beat in December and could have been the driver for the recent run in other steakhouse names 
Chart 
 
Bloomin  Brands  BLMN 
Outback Steakhouse is the best known part of BLMN but there is also Fleming s Prime Steakhouse as well as properties like Bonefish and Carrabba s in the mix there too  I have to say  I ate at Fleming s some time back and as I recall how good it was  I wonder why I haven t been back   As for the Outback  it is a staple steakhouse for those on a budget  which is to say my high end option most of the time 
BLMN is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and has one beat  one miss and two meets over the last four reports   The most recent report was a bigger than average miss  but earnings estimates have been inching higher of late   This is a good stock to keep on your radar screen

127950,349465,DRI,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  Bloomin  Brands  Darden  Del Frisco  And Ruth s,opinion,For Immediate Release Chicago  IL   January 26  2018   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  Bloomin  Brands   NASDAQ BLMN    Darden   NYSE DRI    Del Frisco s Restaurant Group   NASDAQ DFRG    Ruth s Hospitality   NASDAQ RUTH   Sizzling Steak Stocks to Buy NowThe old saying goes  the sizzle sells the steak  which suggests that the meat is not the thing that gets your interest as much as the sound of the cooking that tantalizes your senses   I would point out that what creates the sizzle is the steak  and if the steak is selling  then there is going to be even that much more sizzle   I think I have started a virtuous cycle of steaks and sizzles    but I think you get my idea Let s look at a few sizzling stocks that can attribute steaks and strong economy as the reason for their great charts Ruth s HospitalityWhen I think of RUTH  I picture a juicy steak that literally does still sizzle when it reaches my table   I can say that in the last 5 months I was at a RUTH restaurant and while it was fantastic   It was a Sunday evening in Boston and the place was packed    suggesting that this story has been ongoing for a few months now RUTH has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 3 of the last 4 reports and has even seen an increase in earnings estimates but the stock is still a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   I see the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved from  1 12 to  1 15  but that was not enough to move the rank higher Del Frisco s Restaurant GroupAs a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  the group that owns names like Double Eagle Steakhouse and Sullivan s Steakhouse and Del Frisco s Grille  this one could have the best chart   It has been some time since I was in a Sullivan s but I have eaten there and it was fantastic   The earnings history for DFRG is a little rough  with the company missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 3 of the last 4 quarters  That said  estimates for 2017 and 2018 are inching higher   One other factor that adds some sizzle here is the Zacks ESP  most accurate estimate  is showing a  4 76  reading with earnings expected in the middle of February DardenDRI is not really a steakhouse as the majority of this name is Olive Garden and more casual dining   That said  Capital Grille and Longhorn Steakhouse is under that umbrella  The thing to note about this chart is that the company reported a solid beat in December and could have been the driver for the recent run in other steakhouse names Bloomin  BrandsOutback Steakhouse is the best known part of BLMN but there is also Fleming s Prime Steakhouse as well as properties like Bonefish and Carrabba s in the mix there too  I have to say  I ate at Fleming s some time back and as I recall how good it was  I wonder why I haven t been back   As for the Outback  it is a staple steakhouse for those on a budget  which is to say my high end option most of the time BLMN is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and has one beat  one miss and two meets over the last four reports   The most recent report was a bigger than average miss  but earnings estimates have been inching higher of late   This is a good stock to keep on your radar screen Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the

127960,349475,DRI,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Wal Mart Stores  Darden Restaurants  At Home Group  EVINE Live And PetMed Express,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Jan 16  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT    Darden Restaurants  Inc    NYSE DRI    At Home Group Inc    NYSE HOME    EVINE Live Inc    NASDAQ EVLV   and PetMed Express  Inc    NASDAQ PETS   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Retailers Cap a Robust Holiday Shopping Season  5 Must BuysRetailers capped a healthy holiday shopping season last year as Americans continued to spend at stores at a steady clip  Spending increased at both online and bricks and mortar stores and restaurants  and was largely fueled by low unemployment level  rise in income and more confident consumers  Such factors will further drive retailers in the upcoming year In fact  spending can get a kick from the  1 5 trillion package of tax cuts approved by the Republican controlled U S  Congress and signed into law by President Trump last month  These massive tax cuts will drive household income and in turn increase the propensity to consume  This calls for investors to cash in on the hottest retailers right away December Retail Sales RiseHouseholds bought a range of goods in December  helping retail sales increase for four straight months  Retail sales rose 0 4  last month and figures for the prior month were revised higher as per the Commerce Department  Retail sales for last month also rose 5 4  from a year ago  In 2017  such sales advanced 4 2  compared to 3 2  in 2016 The so called core retail sales went up 0 3  last month following an upwardly revised 1 4  gain in November  Sales were supported by a jump in receipts at gardening and building material stores  and furniture store  There was an uptick in sales at auto dealerships  restaurants and bars as well  Notably  sales picked up at Internet retailers  Sales at online retailers gained 1 2   In fact  online players made a significant headway throughout last year  mostly led by Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  Bulk E Commerce Sales From AmazonAmazon accounted for 44  of online sales in 2017  But  it only adds up to 4  of total retail sales  Such a crazy number now makes analysts believe that they are in a position to acquire Target this year Despite many efforts by traditional brick and mortar retailers to get the bigger piece of the action  Amazon continues to dominate  The company s strength in the e commerce segment can be attributed to innovation in delivery and logistics  broadening of its product selection  device strategy  international expansion and the Prime membership program Holiday Retail Sales Rise at Best Pace Since 2011Retailers  in the meanwhile  enjoyed some extra Christmas cheer  According to the National Retail Federation  U S  year end holiday retail sales during November and December increased 5 5  compared with the same period last year  NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay added that  whether shoppers shopped in store  online or on their phones  consumers were in the mood to spend  and retailers were there to offer them good value for their money  Some of the largest jumps were seen in electronics and appliances  The segment climbed 7 5  and registered the strongest growth in the last 10 years  Home furniture and furnishings grew 5 1  and so did home improvement  Department stores and specialty apparel saw moderate gains  which is quite encouraging given the recent store closings  The jewelry segment also gained 5 9   primarily driven by last minute sales Factors Driving the SurgeStronger employment and higher confidence led consumers to spend more during the holidays  Jobless rate remaining at an ultra low level of 4 1  lifted consumer confidence to a 17 year high set in November Workers  pay has also increased 2 5  from December 2016 to December 2017  up from 2 4  in the prior month  The National Employment Law Project  in fact  showed that minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States  This will reach employee wage closer to  15 an hour  which is known as  living wage  5 Solid PicksGiven the aforesaid positives  investing in sound retail stocks seems judicious  We have thus selected five such retailers to boost

128041,349556,DRI,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Darden Restaurants  Yum  Brands  Restaurant Brands  Domino s And Papa John s,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 29  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Restaurants  including Darden Restaurants  Inc    NYSE DRI    Yum  Brands  Inc    NYSE YUM    Restaurant Brands   NYSE QSR    Domino s   NYSE DPZ   and Papa John s International Inc    NASDAQ PZZA   Industry  Restaurants  Part 2Link   Given the exponential rise in costs  companies are striving to keep expenses under control  Along with several conscious attempts  commodity cost deflation is helping Cracker Barrel to make solid progress in reaching its cost reduction targets Additionally  these initiatives are expected to aid the company in combating some of the wage inflation pressures  Darden Restaurants  Inc  is also focusing on an aggressive cost management plan  under which it has been able to significantly cut operating costs Of late  various companies in the restaurants space like Yum  Brands  Inc   Restaurant Brands  Domino s and others have adopted a de risking strategy by reducing their ownership of restaurants through refranchising  Notably  refranchising a large portion of the system reduces the company s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion In addition  free cash flow continues to grow  thus allowing reinvestment for increasing brand recognition and shareholder returns  Moreover  since a major portion of their business is re franchised  these companies are less affected by food inflation than their peers Increased Focus on Modern Technology  Digital Ordering  In this digital era  as consumers increasingly look for convenience  technology has started to play an important role in determining customer experience  This digital wave has hit the U S  restaurant space too  as an increasing number of chains are deploying technology to enhance guest experience In fact  technology at restaurants has become essential   more than ever before   given the troubles plaguing this space over the past few quarters  Hence  restaurant operators are comping up all guns blazing  with their online and digital marketing activities  to meet consumers  increasing dependence on and penchant for online and mobile web technology and consequently lure them back While smartphone apps attract consumers  video menu boards in quick service restaurants and tabletop devices speed up sales and ensure convenience  Further  restaurant operators rely on social media for promotions and incorporate Facebook  NASDAQ FB   online review sites  Twitter and blogs aggressively into their marketing mix In fact  mobile ordering in particular is fast becoming a crucial part of many restaurants  plans  given what it can bring in enhanced sales  This is because when using a phone to order their food  customers  on average  tend to spend more and visit more often  Going forward  mobile ordering will form the crux of customer s experience  rather than just being a point of differentiation Notably  pizza giants Domino s and Papa John s International Inc  have been the industry bellwethers in the digital ordering space  Domino s continues adding to its digital capabilities with the launch of various ordering apps and platforms  The extended ways to order a pizza has thus kept this company in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience Papa John s aims to continue making investments in technology focused on foundational improvements to their digital channels to increase order conversion rate  frequency and ticket average  Further  in 2018  Papa John s aims to completely redesign its digital platform and solutions capabilities  leveraging enhanced data analytics and insights to ensure that its industry leading platforms are sustainable  efficient and effective Though a few restaurants have managed to come along as far as the pizza chains  there are still many who have advanced their own apps by leaps and bounds to attract more customers on the go Follow us on Twitter   Join us on Facebook   Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated

128043,349558,DRI,Dave   Buster s Amusement Business Solid  Industry Woes Rife,opinion,Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc    NASDAQ PLAY   generates strong returns  courtesy of its unique business model and favorable store economics  The company continues to perform well on the customizable experience it offers across its platforms   Eat  Drink  Play and Watch However  rising labor costs amid a tepid sales environment along with limited geographical presence remain potent headwinds for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company  You can see  Recently  Dave   Buster s reported mixed  results  The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  while the top line lagged the same  Notably  the third quarter marked the 13th successive earnings beat for the company Key Growth DriversDave   Buster s distinctive business model sets it apart  Along with food and beverages  the company has a robust entertainment business  In fact  in the first nine months of fiscal 2017  amusement and other revenues accounted for 55 6  of total revenues  In fact  the segment s revenues grew 17 1  year over year as increased dependence on gaming has cushioned the company against headwinds in restaurant space  It will also drive market share and comps for the company  Also  the increased focus on its higher margin amusement business is driving earnings Dave   Buster s continues to pursue a disciplined new store growth strategy in both new and existing markets  In fiscal 2017  the company expects to open 14 new stores  including 10 large and four small outlets  The company currently has 11 stores under construction and a total of 27 times leases  and is expected to continue with the expansion in fiscal 2018 as well as 2019  In fiscal 2018  the company plans to open 14 to 15 new stores and achieve a 13  to 14  annual unit growth rate  including a combination of large and small format stores For third quarter fiscal 2017  the company has planned on a smaller store format of about 15 000 to 20 000 square feet in order to capitalize on demand in smaller and untapped markets  Management expects to open 20 40 stores in the long term  including two that are to be opened in 2018  The company believes that this new format will expand brand potential and spread growth runway  The first store under this new format will be opened in Rodriguez  AR  at the beginning of fiscal 2018 Apart from an efficient business model and expansive strategies  Dave   Buster s relies heavily on menu and entertainment innovation to drive sales  Notably  the company continues to evolve its amusement section on new and interesting content  including games based on some of the world s finest movies  In this regard  the company continues to collaborate with various game manufacturing partners and remains steadfast on its strategy of including proprietary content that is exclusive to the company Additionally  the company believes that it can drive traffic by enhancing in store and out of store customer experience via digital and mobile strategic initiatives as well as through employing better technology Notably  Dave   Buster s delivered return on equity  ROE  of 24 8  in the trailing 12 months  compared with the  s gain of 6 9   This indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to peers which drives its growth trajectory ConcernsIncreased labor costs due to the implementation of Obamacare continues to have an adverse impact on margins of restaurant operators like Darden Restaurants Inc    NYSE DRI    Brinker International Inc    NYSE EAT    Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  Inc    NASDAQ RRGB   and many others  including Dave   Buster s  Also  pre opening costs of outlets given the company s unit expansion plans and expenses related to sales initiatives are driving costs and are likely to weigh on margins Subsequently  shares of Dave   Buster s lost 2  year to date as against the industry s gain of 14 5   The underperformance has been led by downward estimate revisions  Over the last 60 days  earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have moved down 8 2  and 0 7   respectively  reflecting analysts  pessimism over the stock  Also  a decelerating comps growth rate given the persistently challenging sales environment in the U S restaurant space is a concern Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2017-12-10,Zacks Investment

European equities lack decisive direction  Asia finishes mostly lower
European equities oscillated between gains and losses before ultimately closing mixed amid the rising tension between North Korea and the United States and as the outgoing government of Germany s Chancellor Merkel rejected a proposal to pool euro area sovereign debt  The proposal  supported by French President Macron  would have been aimed at utilizing the region s bailout fund  the European Stability Mechanism  ESM   with a goal of granting additional powers to the ESM to turn it into a sort of European Monetary Fund  The German Chancellor is in the midst of complex coalition talks in an attempt to build a new government  
Elsewhere  a recent speech by U K  Prime Minister Theresa May seemingly failed to spark trade negotiation optimism  though some European Finance Ministers said the speech was constructive and likely a step in the right direction as EU leaders will have their first chance to approve trade talks in mid October  The British Prime Minister is meeting with the President of the European Council today  while their counterparts held a fourth round of Brexit discussions in Brussels  The euro and British pound dipped versus the U S  dollar and bond yields in the region were mixed  In economic developments  import prices for Germany rose in line with forecasts  business confidence in France missed expectations and finance loans for housing in the U K  increased  but were lower than projections 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly to the downside  but losses were limited as the markets seemingly attempted to stabilize amid the recent host of catalysts  Mainland Chinese equities and those traded in Hong Kong advanced modestly  after both indexes came under pressure yesterday amid increased measures aimed at curbing the country s housing market where record home sales helped to spark a surge in Chinese property developers this year  Japanese securities decreased amid strength in the yen  and as minutes released from the Bank of Japan s July meeting indicated some optimism regarding consumer price inflation  Separately  the island nation also released economic data that showed producer price inflation slightly exceeded expectations  Markets in Australia declined  led lower by consumer discretionary issues  stocks in South Korea fell amid the festering North Korean rhetoric  while Indian listings were also lower

128133,349648,DRI,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  McDonald s  Yum  Brands  Wendy s  Darden Restaurants And Restaurant Brands International,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 15  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Restaurants  Part 1  including McDonald s Corp   NYSE   NYSE MCD       Yum  Brands  Inc   NYSE   NYSE YUM        Wendy s Company  NASDAQ   NASDAQ WEN        Darden Restaurants  Inc   NYSE   NYSE DRI       and Restaurant Brands International  Inc   NYSE   NYSE QSR       Industry  Restaurants  Part 1Link  Over the past few quarters  the U S  restaurant space has not been too enticing for investors  Despite economic growth  somewhat lower energy prices and higher incomes  consumers have increased their spending only modestly on dining out  This is because  along with wage growth  inflation is also on the rise  which translates into lower real income and thus less disposable income  The situation has taken a turn for the worse  thanks to higher health care costs and tightened credit availability in the U S Moreover  as consumers demand high quality products at lower prices  it is pushing grocery stores to decrease their food prices in order to remain competitive  This is resulting in a bigger gap between food at home and food away from home indices Thus  same store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment  Foot traffic also went into retreat  and profits at many chains followed suit  In fact  the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative same store sales  comps  for the restaurant industry as a whole  continuing the somber mood This is further reflected in the industry s stock price performance  Over the past year  while the industry stocks have gained a mere 4 9   the broader index is up 11 2  However  despite the louder buzz of the so called restaurant recession  it is to be noted that recent strong gains in the labor market on the back of a steady rise in wages will likely encourage consumers to dine out more and put a check on declining traffic  Restaurateurs are undertaking various sales and digital initiatives to enhance guest experiences and  in turn  drive traffic and comps  Also  they are increasingly adapting to the changing tastes and preferences of their consumers  Moving ahead  the restaurant industry should thus get its mojo back What Are the Challenges Restaurants have been witnessing solid sales growth ever since the Great Recession and 2016 wasn t any exception  despite an industry wide slowdown  Moreover  in its 2017 Restaurant Industry Forecast  the National Restaurant Association revealed that it expects sales in the industry to reach  799 billion  reflecting an increase of 4 3  over estimated sales of  766 billion in 2016  So  then what s really spooking the industry It is to be noted that though this will mark the eighth consecutive year of real growth in restaurant sales  the rate of growth will remain dampened by historical standards  Considerable variances among geographic regions and industry segments are also likely to hamper restaurant sales performance Additionally  even though total sales are up  foot traffic at individual restaurants is waning fast  Same store sales that account for traffic dropped in each of the four quarters of 2016  0 2   0 7   1 1  and 2 4   respectively   per TDn2K s Black Box Intelligence  Moreover  comps have declined 1 6  and 1   respectively  in the first two quarters of 2017  highlighting the difficult operating environment currently facing many operators We note that the prime reason for such a drop in same store sales is essentially the increased number of new restaurants amid restricted growth in eating out budgets  Supply glut and limited demand are thus hampering traffic as well as stock prices for restaurants as instead of generating added sales  each new restaurant is eating up share from other restaurants  This has  in fact  resulted in bankruptcy for many public and private restaurants Another major challenge that restaurants are facing of late is an increase in menu prices at a much quicker rate than the prices for food at grocery stores  This is adding to the competitive pressure for restaurants  as preparing food at home has become much more attractive from a cost perspective  resulting in declining footfall Additionally  rising labor costs and a complex legislative and regulatory landscape on federal  state and local levels is thwarting business performance and bottom lines What Can Possibly Drive Growth Nevertheless  some of the big names like McDonald s Corp   NYSE       Yum  Brands  Inc   NYSE       The Wendy s Company  NASDAQ       Darden Restaurants  Inc   NYSE      and Restaurant Brands International  Inc   NYSE      seem to be unperturbed by the plight and continue to do well on the back of strong fundamentals and innovative offerings  You can see  This signifies that all is not lost for the U S  restaurant space  and investors should thus not shy away from putting money into this space and cash in on the bountiful opportunities In fact  long term trends favoring eating out over eating at home are still in place  Moreover  operators willing to evolve and stand out in a competitive market will continue to reap profits  Thus  restaurants with solid fundamentals and sufficient capacity for innovation will remain compelling bets More importantly  long term factors supporting the sector remain firmly in place  Per the USDA  spending on food outside homes has risen from 10  to 50  of total food purchases over 1904 to 2013  In addition  sales at food services and drinking places have increased more rapidly than retail sales since 2014  This trend is also far more stable and will continue to lift the sector once the current weakness subsides Meanwhile  though comps fell in the second quarter of 2017  the period posted the best results for the industry since the second quarter of 2016  Notably  besides improving economic conditions  easy year over year comparisons also seem to have aided the results Valuation Looks Bit StretchedGoing by the P E  price to earnings per share  valuation metric  which is one of the most commonly used ratio and best suited for evaluating restaurants  the industry looks a bit expensive at this stage and investors might not want to pay any further premium The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P E ratio of 25 18  which compares unfavorably with what it saw in the last five years  The ratio is higher than the median value of 23 87 and toward its high of 29 37 over this period Moreover  this level compares unfavorably with the market at large  as P E for the S P 500 stands at about 19 85 Overall  the valuation of the industry from a P E perspective looks not so attractive when compared with its own range in the same time period  Moreover  given its higher than market positioning  there seems to be little room for upside

	Chicago  IL   June 29  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Conn s  Inc   NASDAQ           Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation  NASDAQ           Best Buy Co  NYSE BBY    Inc   NYSE           Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI   Inc   NYSE          and Burlington Stores  Inc   NYSE          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  

5 Retail Stocks to Buy on Renewed Consumer Confidence

	Consumer confidence  which ebbed some time back  took an unexpected  U  turn in June  indicating that the economy remains well on track  barring a few hiccups  Though consumer confidence has largely receded from the highs it reached in March this year  analysts believe that it will improve once the policies announced by the current regime start taking shape and the picture becomes clearer 

	For now  steady job additions  persistently low unemployment and gradual wage acceleration offer a perfect background to drive consumer confidence  a key determinant of the economy s health  According to the recent Conference Board data  the Consumer Confidence Index rose to 118 9 this month from May s reading of 117 6  We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help revive sales 

	U S  retail sales in May recorded the steepest drop in 16 months  The Commerce Department stated that U S  retail and food services sales in May fell 0 3  to  473 8 billion   following an unrevised reading of 0 4  growth registered in April   as people refrained from buying motor vehicles and spent less at gasoline stations  department stores and electronics shops  However  retail sales increased 3 8  from May 2016 

	Nevertheless  the  sector still holds some promise  given the favorable economic indicators  We note that so far in the year  the sector has registered an increase of 14 3  compared with the S P 500 that is up roughly 9 2   The rebound in oil prices from all time lows  improving labor market and a gradual improvement in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode  Thus  adding a few stocks from the space would be a prudent decision 

5 Prominent Picks 

	Here we have highlighted five Retail Wholesale stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  and a  of  A  or  B  

	We suggest investing in Conn s  Inc   NASDAQ          with a long term earnings growth rate of 18 5  and a VGM Score of  A   In the past one year  the stock has zoomed over 100  and comfortably outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  which advanced 64 9   This specialty retailer of durable consumer goods and related services delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 80 9  over the trailing four quarters and flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  You can see   

	You may also consider Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation   NASDAQ          which operates as a sporting goods retailer  The stock sports a Zacks Rank  1 and has a VGM Score of  A   The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 94 5  in the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 9   In the past one year  the stock has displayed a fabulous bull run on the index and has risen 44 5   while the Zacks categorized  industry decreased 7 8  

	Another lucrative option is Best Buy Co   Inc   NYSE           which has a long term earnings growth rate of 11 8  and a VGM Score of  A   This retailer of technology products  services  and solutions delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 33 8  in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank  2  We note that in the past one year  the stock has surged approximately 84 2   while the Zacks categorized  industry has gained 64 9  

	Investors can count on Darden Restaurants  Inc   NYSE           an operator of full service restaurants  with a long term earnings growth rate of 10 9   The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3 4  over the trailing four quarters and has a VGM Score of  A   In the past one year  this Zacks Rank  2 stock has exhibited a bullish run and surged roughly 40 5   while the Zacks categorized  industry gained 11  

Burlington Stores  Inc    NYSE          a retailer of branded apparel products  with a long term earnings growth rate of 15 9  is a solid bet  The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 22 6  over the trailing four quarters and has a VGM Score of  A   In the past one year  this Zacks Rank  2 stock has soared 36 8   while the Zacks categorized  industry fell 10  

Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies

	It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively 

	And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation    

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

	Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  Its average gain has been a stellar  26  per year

128198,349713,DRI,5 Top Restaurant Stocks To Bet On Cooling Inflation ,opinion,"Restaurant stocks have failed to find favor with investors in the last few quarters despite economic growth  somewhat lower energy prices and higher incomes  This is because  along with wage growth  inflation has also been on the rise  thereby translating into lower real income and thus less disposable income As a result  most of the restaurateurs have been grappling with sluggish comps and soft traffic growth  Resultantly  there has been a lot of buzz about the restaurant industry falling into recession However  if the recent economic data is anything to go by  then speculation surrounding a restaurant recession should hold no ground Notably  as per recent data released by the U S  Labor Department in Washington on Jun 14  the  core  inflation rate  a closely monitored measure of underlying inflation that excludes discretionary food and energy components  weakened to 1 7  in May from 2 3  in January Moreover  with inflation on a 12 month basis expected to remain below 2  in the near term  restaurant companies should certainly get a boost  This is because softening inflation is likely to translate into more purchasing power and higher spending capacity Besides  recent strong gains in the labor market on the back of a steady rise in wages are also expected to encourage consumers to dine out more and put a check on declining traffic In fact  the labor market is near full employment with a drop in the unemployment rate at a nearly 16 year low of 4 3  in May  Moreover  as per data released by the Labor Department on Thursday  new jobless claims for last week fell by 8000 to 237 000 from the previous week Meanwhile  the Fed s decision to lift the benchmark interest rate to a range of 1 1 25  should be further reassurance that all s well with the economy

128201,349716,DRI,Week Ahead  Bearish Oil To Fuel Stronger U S  Economic Downtrend ,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
The Week That Was 
Oil Crash Rattles Markets

The markets were dominated last week by the crash in oil  an immediate reversal after having been a market leader during the tech selloff 
However  the continuously rising oil supply  both from Libya and Nigeria  two OPEC members exempt from the production agreement as well as the ongoing ramp up of US production officially reversed oil s bullish trend to bearish  after the price fell 20  from its January high of  55  While analysts expected US shale production to moderate as oil prices fall  which would make shale less profitable  it s been reported that US producers have hedged themselves  guaranteeing a  50 per barrel payout irrespective of spot prices  thus incentivizing capacity pumping while continuing to drive the price down 
Bad Timing for Fed Reflation

Ironically  the timing of the oil crash came just when dollar and bond investors had begun to buy into the Fed s reflation outlook  However  the oil crash inundated the Fed s efforts at winning the hearts and minds of investors  In an industrial economy  oil has a dramatic impact on so many other products and services that it s impossible to see inflation rising in this low oil price environment 
Europe in Economic Correction  while US Economy Trending Down
If that weren t enough  on Friday morning  the US s Flash Purchasing Managers Index offered yet another perspective into the underperformance of the US economy  While the global cycle outside of the US had accelerated from the second half of 2016 till recently  the latest numbers show a small step down from those healthy levels  though still encouraging  as well as solid numbers around the global growth trajectory 
If you take the second quarter in its entirety  Europe is still growing at its strongest pace in the last 6 years  However  in the US  the results were more tepid  While the US had a step down similar to what was seen in Europe  the US economic reading was closer to a 3 month low  Looking at the bigger picture  although the US showed similar growth in the past month  for Europe it was a correction  while the concern is that for the US it s the trend 
The Week Ahead
Biggest Focus   Senate s Healthcare Bill Prelude to Tax Reform
The biggest focus for investors this week should be the Senate s healthcare bill  Not so much because of the bill itself  but because it s in the way of a more investor relevant bill  tax reform 
The Republicans need to pick their battles  and their bread and butter is tax reform  The Senate put out its healthcare draft bill last week  and it appears that the Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell  is resolved to get to a vote by Friday one way or another  He wants the issue in the rear view mirror  so the legislative branch can shift gears and finally focus on taxes  That would be good news for investors  because it keeps tax reform on schedule  Should the timeline remain intact  the ball toward fiscal policy would finally start to roll forward 
Economic Data in Focus
After last week s investor confidence shakeup  this week s US durable goods orders on Monday morning ET and consumer confidence readings on Tuesday morning should be in the spotlight  Weaker than expected readings could add additional perspective on whether the US economy is indeed slowing as many analysts have forecast 
As well  on Thursday we ll be given some perspective on the world s second largest economy  which has dramatic influence on the global economy   China PMI  released Thursday night EDT  may shed more clarity on that country s economy  after mixed readings in recent months

On June 14 the stock was trading near  60  Since then it declined 6 percent  to  55 94 and 23  since its all time high of almost  73 on June 2016  What s interesting about this stock is that it wasn t part of the Trump reflation party  It just moved sideways in the low  60s  till this past March  when it resumed its decline  Perhaps the stock s lack of participation either in the Trump or Fed reflation trade renders it a value stock  Technically  it s reaching the support of its May low and is potentially forming a base

	Chicago  IL   June 06  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Gartner  Inc   NYSE           NV5 Global  Inc   NASDAQ           LHC Group  Inc   NASDAQ           Uranium Resources  Inc   NASDAQ          and Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI   Inc   NYSE          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  

5 Stocks to Buy as Jobless Rate Hits 16 Year Low

	Job additions declined sharply in May  coming in well below expectations created by economists and last week s ADP data  Private payrolls surged by 253 000 last month according to ADP  well above most estimates  But the fall depicted by official figures has given rise to an impression that the jobs market may be cooling down 

	Far from it  several economists believe that the U S  is now close to full employment  A shrinking labor market is making it difficult for companies across some sectors to attract and retain their workforce  But job additions are continuing in other professions  which make it a good idea to invest in stocks from those sectors 

Gauges of Joblessness Plunge

	Most analysts and market watchers had expected significant job additions in May following the release of bullish ADP data  However  official data revealed that only 138 000 job additions had taken place last month  much lower than the consensus estimate of 184 000  Additionally  April s figures were revised downward from 211 000 to 174 000 while March s job additions declined from 79 000 to 50 000 

	But there was a lot to digest beyond the 66 000 jobs lost due to downward revisions  For one  the unemployment rate declined from 4 4  to 4 3  in May  marking its lowest level since 2001  Since January  the unemployment rate has experienced a decrease of 0 5  

	Also  the unemployment rate for individuals without employment for a period lower than six months declined to a 47 year low of 3 3   The  U 6   considered to be a broader measure of unemployment  since it includes those workers who are working part time for purely economic reasons  declined to 8 4   This marks its lowest level since mid 2007 

Select Sectors Continue to Notch up Gains

	Despite the decline in job additions for May  several economists believe that the situation is not as bad as it seems at first glance  With full employment within grasp  the economy may need to add only 100 000 jobs on a regular basis to maintain growth levels 

	Though job additions have slowed in January  the labor market as a whole hasn t been better in a decade or more  More importantly  the economy shows no signs of stalling  In fact  the current expansionary phase has stretched over 96 months and is third longest of all time since World War II 

	And specific sectors continue to notch up job additions  In May  professional and business services led the way by adding 38 000 jobs whereas food services and drinking places added 30 000 jobs  The healthcare sector experienced 24 000 job additions  whereas mining added another 7 000 jobs 

Labor Market Shrinks on Multiple Factors

	What is difficult to ignore is the reality of an ever shrinking labor market  With the economy nearing full employment  companies are finding it increasingly difficult to attract and retain the workforce they need  Some of them  particularly in areas which require skilled labor such as construction  have resorted to raising overtime hours 

	Other factors such an ageing baby boomer generation and tighter immigration rules are also diminishing the workforce  Most economists agree that such trends will ultimately lead to a significant spike in wage growth which still remains relatively sluggish 

Our Choices

	May s lower job additions notwithstanding  the labor market remains in good shape  A shrinking workforce and near full employment conditions are primarily responsible for the fall in jobs added last month 

	However  select sectors continue to notch up steady job gains  This is why it makes for a smart option to invest in stocks from these areas  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics 

Gartner  Inc    NYSE         is a research and advisory firm that helps clients understand technology and drive business growth

	Although the  sector  which is at the bottom 19  of the Zacks Sector Rank  13 out of 16   has not been an outstanding performer it still holds some promise  given the favorable economic indicators  We note that so far in the year  the sector has registered an increase of 14 9  compared with the S P 500 that was up roughly 9  

	The rebound in oil prices from all time lows  decelerating unemployment rate  and a gradual improvement in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode  These factors are playing a crucial role in raising consumers  confidence  We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending  U S  consumer spending leaped to a four month high in April and personal income also rose  Consumer spending rose 0 4  in April  following a 0 3  uptick in March 

	This calls for investing in the retail space  Here we have highlighted five Retail Wholesale stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  and a  of  A  or  B   These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals  surging share price and a track record of better than expected results

128273,349788,DRI,Yum  Brands   YUM  Taco Bell Drafts Restaurant Growth Plan,opinion,At its 2017 investor and analyst day  Taco Bell Corp    a subsidiary of Yum  Brands  Inc    NYSE YUM     announced plans to add restaurants in the domestic market and also named four key international markets where it aims to remain focused to drive the growth momentum as a global brand We note that these initiatives are part of the brand s strategy to grow to  15 billion in annual global system sales by 2022  from the present  10 billion Inside the HeadlinesCurrently  Taco Bell operates over 6 650 restaurants in 23 countries  Notably  the brand plans to operate roughly 9 000 restaurants  in the next five years  in more than 40 countries  This will lead to the creation of 100 000 new jobs in the U S  alone Taco Bell opened in excess of 600 net new restaurants  exclusive of license units  domestically  between 2012 and 2016  In 2017  the brand intends to perk up last year s growth rate  Meanwhile  on the international front  Taco Bell expects to open at least 100 restaurants in each of the following markets    Brazil  Canada  China and India Domestic ExpansionIn terms of domestic unit growth  Taco Bell has expanded into rural markets and has furthered its suburban penetration  by aptly managing building costs and design  Taco Bell now plans to enter greatly pedestrian urban areas that do not have room for drive thru  in order to boost its latest development spree Given that urban markets entail a distinct approach for Taco Bell to stay pertinent for consumers and create a successful business model for its franchisees  the brand aims to make use of its inline and Cantina restaurant concepts  for these locations  Notably  these  inline  concepts are not dependent on a drive thru  and thus allow Taco Bell to penetrate various new markets Cantina restaurants  a flashy restaurant brand aimed at millennials  is arguably the most prominent  in the fast food chain s new line of upscale restaurants  Facilities unique to Taco Bell Cantinas include digital menu boards  digital queues to monitor customers  order process  open kitchen  tapas style menu of shareable appetizers and other amusements The first Cantina restaurant debuted in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago in late 2015  Since then  11 urban inline stores have opened in various cities  of which five are Cantina locations  meaning they serve alcohol By 2022  Taco Bell foresees at least 300 of the new locations to be urban inline restaurants in markets with enormous growth potential Meanwhile  last year  Taco Bell announced four new restaurant designs to reflect diverse community experiences  These included Heritage  Modern Explorer  California Sol and Urban Edge  We note that the four test locations debuted in California in 2016 and two more opened earlier this year Apart from focusing on the broader roll out of these designs  the brand remains committed on remodeling its existing stores  By the end of 2017  an added 350 restaurants are likely to be invigorated  bringing the total number to about 80  of the system Focus on International MarketsOn the international front too  Taco Bell continues to gain momentum with new restaurant openings in various markets  given the growing enthusiasm for the brand and its improving economics With the recent opening in the Netherlands  Taco Bell presently has 350 restaurants in 22 countries outside the U S   By focusing its efforts on four key markets discussed above  that have billions of people and a compelling youth culture  Taco Bell aims to become a global powerhouse  Apart from these markets  Spain  Guatemala  South Korea and the United Kingdom are some of the international growth markets gaining scale Bottom LineOn Nov 1  2016  Yum  Brands announced that it has spun off its all important China division into an independent  publicly traded company Yum China Holdings  Inc    NYSE YUM    Post the separation  shares of Yum  Brands have slightly underperformed the Zacks categorized Retail Restaurants industry  While the industry gained 21 3   the company s shares have rallied 18 9  Nonetheless  the company is leaving no stone unturned to subsidize the effects of the spin off and revive business by driving growth at KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands In fact  such robust restaurant development plan for the Taco Bell brand is also one such attempt in this direction  While the brand is exploring opportunities to amplify its penetration in underserved markets  domestically  it is assessing new markets to serve new customers internationally Going forward  continual focus on menu and digital innovation along with diversification of its development portfolio  is expected to fuel the brand s growth Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderYum  Brands has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some better ranked stocks in this sector include Del Taco Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ TACO   and Darden Restaurants  Inc    NYSE DRI    carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  each  You can see  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Del Taco s 2017 earnings climbed 1 9   over the past 60 days  The company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in

128279,349794,DRI,5 Stocks To Buy As Jobless Rate Hits 16 Year Low,opinion,"Job additions declined sharply in May  coming in well below expectations created by economists and last week s ADP data  Private payrolls surged by 253 000 last month according to ADP  well above most estimates  But the fall depicted by official figures has given rise to an impression that the jobs market may be cooling down 
Far from it  several economists believe that the U S  is now close to full employment  A shrinking labor market is making it difficult for companies across some sectors to attract and retain their workforce  But job additions are continuing in other professions  which make it a good idea to invest in stocks from those sectors 
Gauges of Joblessness Plunge
Most analysts and market watchers had expected significant job additions in May following the release of bullish ADP data  However  official data revealed that only 138 000 job additions had taken place last month  much lower than the consensus estimate of 184 000  Additionally  April s figures were revised downward from 211 000 to 174 000 while March s job additions declined from 79 000 to 50 000 
But there was a lot to digest beyond the 66 000 jobs lost due to downward revisions  For one  the unemployment rate declined from 4 4  to 4 3  in May  marking its lowest level since 2001  Since January  the unemployment rate has experienced a decrease of 0 5  
Also  the unemployment rate for individuals without employment for a period lower than six months declined to a 47 year low of 3 3   The  U 6   considered to be a broader measure of unemployment  since it includes those workers who are working part time for purely economic reasons  declined to 8 4   This marks its lowest level since mid 2007 
Select Sectors Continue to Notch up Gains
Despite the decline in job additions for May  several economists believe that the situation is not as bad as it seems at first glance  With full employment within grasp  the economy may need to add only 100 000 jobs on a regular basis to maintain growth levels 
Though job additions have slowed in January  the labor market as a whole hasn t been better in a decade or more  More importantly  the economy shows no signs of stalling  In fact  the current expansionary phase has stretched over 96 months and is third longest of all time since World War II 
And specific sectors continue to notch up job additions  In May  professional and business services led the way by adding 38 000 jobs whereas food services and drinking places added 30 000 jobs  The healthcare sector experienced 24 000 job additions  whereas mining added another 7 000 jobs 
Labor Market Shrinks on Multiple Factors
What is difficult to ignore is the reality of an ever shrinking labor market  With the economy nearing full employment  companies are finding it increasingly difficult to attract and retain the workforce they need  Some of them  particularly in areas which require skilled labor such as construction  have resorted to raising overtime hours 
Other factors such an ageing baby boomer generation and tighter immigration rules are also diminishing the workforce  Most economists agree that such trends will ultimately lead to a significant spike in wage growth which still remains relatively sluggish 
Our Choices
May s lower job additions notwithstanding  the labor market remains in good shape  A shrinking workforce and near full employment conditions are primarily responsible for the fall in jobs added last month 
However  select sectors continue to notch up steady job gains  This is why it makes for a smart option to invest in stocks from these areas  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics 
Gartner  Inc    NYSE IT   is a research and advisory firm that helps clients understand technology and drive business growth

Sector s Correlation with the Economy
The Retail Wholesale sector has not been an outstanding performer but it still holds some promise  given the favorable economic indicators  The rebound in oil prices from all time lows  decelerating unemployment rate  and a gradual improvement in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode 
These factors are playing a crucial role in raising consumers  confidence  We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending  Consumer spending rose 0 4  in April  following a 0 3  uptick in March 
As per the Commerce Department  sales at U S  retailers increased 0 4  in April and were 4 5  higher than the year ago levels  It was the strongest sales gain in three months  March sales were also stronger than originally reported  A monthly decline of 0 2  in March was revised upward to show a 0 1  uptick  Non store retailers  which include online shopping outlets  saw sales growth of 1 4  in April 
Kiplinger s latest forecast shows that retail sales  excluding gasoline  are expected to jump 3 8  in 2017  The report further suggests that e commerce sales are expected to increase 14  this year compared with 13 1  in 2016

Worried About Volatility  Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks 

	The U S  stock market suffered a setback yesterday as weak earnings reports from some of the retail bellwethers along with political tension revolving around the sudden dismissal of the FBI chief made investors skeptical  Retail giants reported tepid first quarter results  This took a toll on the consumer discretionary sector  which in turn might have dragged the market down  The benchmark S P 500 posted its largest one day percentage fall in four weeks yesterday 

	This temporarily marred the positive sentiments prevailing in the market  courtesy of the improving macroeconomic indicators in the nation  and forced investors to turn to safe haven investments like gold 

	Nevertheless  investing in the stock market hardly backfires provided one is cautious  Considering the fact that sudden variability can hit the global market any time  it is better to choose stocks that bear relatively less risk  One of the investment strategies to choose less risky stocks is to measure a company s debt level  Highly leveraged stocks are the most vulnerable ones at times of volatility 

	Since debt financing is a very common phenomenon followed by corporations to expand their operations  only a few stocks come with zero leverage  Therefore one should resort to low leveraged stocks  Using financial leverage ratio  one can easily discriminate between highly leveraged and low leveraged stocks  One of the most popular leverage ratios is the debt to equity ratio 

Analyzing Debt to Equity

	Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  Equity

	With the first quarter reporting cycle almost over  we see an improved earnings growth picture compared to the preceding quarters  In times like these  investors tend to go for stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth  overlooking the debt on their balance sheet  So it is wiser to look for low leveraged stocks that are financially more secure and immune to market upheavals 

The Winning Strategy

	Considering the aforementioned discussion  it is imperative for a sensible investor to choose stocks that have a low debt to equity ratio 

	However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria 

	Here are the other parameters 

Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers 

Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above 

Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median   Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation 

Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation

128308,349823,DRI,4 Reasons Why You Should Buy Yum China  YUMC  Stock Now,opinion,On Nov 1  2016  Yum  Brands  Inc    NYSE YUM   announced that it has spun off its all important China division into an independent  publicly traded company Yum China Holdings  Inc    NYSE YUM   Post separation  Yum China holds exclusive rights of the KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China  and also has the provision to add new brands  At the end of Feb  2017  Yum China had more than 7 600 restaurants in more than 1 100 cities mostly under the KFC and Pizza Hut brands  Taco Bell too opened its first restaurant in China at the end of 2016  Additionally  Yum China owns the Little Sheep and East Dawning concepts outright  The company is expected to be able to triple its unit count in the long term Notably  each of the companies   Yum  Brands and Yum China   is expected to return about 15  annually to shareholders through earnings growth and dividends  after the separation  The spin off has thus certainly led to the establishment of two powerful  independent companies  each well capitalized with long runways for growth and value creation Meanwhile  focusing on Yum China  we can say that the stock has been on a hot run ever since its formation  rising 29 9  in comparison to the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 17 8  We believe that this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company has good prospects  given its strong fundamentals and clear growth opportunities  and should thus make a value addition to your portfolio  You can see  Why is Yum China a Solid Choice Expansion   Other Initiatives  The company s continual expansion of its geographic footprint in China and existing operational expertise are driving growth  In 2017  Yum China seems to be confident about opening 550 600 new restaurants  while delivering double digit growth in operating profit  excluding the foreign currency impact  Yum China is also hoping to fuel growth with Taco Bell brands and plans to open more units this year Meanwhile  the company has been successful in attracting customers with its loyalty program  digital leadership and more delivery options  thereby driving comps Going forward  management believes that with a network of over 4 400 restaurants in its system offering delivery services and roughly 90 million loyalty program members  the company remains poised for continued top  and bottom line growth Growth Prospects  Integration of its brands into Chinese popular culture and consumers  daily lives has been propelling growth at Yum China  Additionally  it is to be noted that a new generation of millennials who are digitally cultured and brand driven are fueling consumption growth in China  In fact  constant growth of the middle class and urban population there is anticipated to create the world s largest market for restaurant brands  with Yum China as the market leader Moving ahead  sales growth is projected to be nearly 4   while earnings per share  EPS  are likely to improve 10 7  in 2017 Earnings History and Estimate Revision Trend  Yum China has exceeded earnings expectations in both the quarters it has reported so far Meanwhile  over the last 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Yum China s current year s earnings has moved up 4 4   reflecting three upward revisions versus none downwards  Also  next year s earnings estimates have inched up 3 2   on the back of two upward revisions versus no downward revisions  All these positive earnings estimate revisions testifies the unwavering confidence that analysts have in the company and also adds to the optimism in

128336,349851,DRI,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Secure Your Portfolio,opinion,The U S  stock market seems to be on a high right now on account of the dynamic market conditions that have been prevailing across the globe for the past few days  Two factors   reduced risk of euro dissolution in the wake of market preferred French election results and hopes for a corporate tax cut by Trump   are driving the equity market rally The global equity markets picked up pace at the beginning of the week as the first round of the French presidential election went in favor of Emmanuel Macron  On the other hand  U S  President Trump s promise to cut corporate tax by 20  and to impose a 10  tax on foreign earnings in repatriation  boosted market sentiments On top of that  Federal Reserve chairperson  Janet Yellen s consistent claim that the U S  economy is growing  pretty healthy   leads to more optimism  All these factors set the stage for investment in U S  stocks However  analysts remain concerned about low productivity growth and sluggish consumer spending  Besides  following Trump s failure to repeal Obamacare  a few are skeptical about the implementation of the corporate tax cut Therefore  it is better to be safe than sorry and invest in less risky stocks  Considering the fact that uncertainty can hit equity market any time  it is better to avoid highly leveraged stocks as they are the most vulnerable ones at times of volatility   So investors must look for stocks that are less leveraged  as only a few fortunate ones can totally escape from debt financing  Herein comes the use of financial leverage ratio  which helps one to identify highly leveraged stocks  One of the most popular leverage ratios is the debt to equity ratio Analyzing Debt to EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A lower debt to equity ratio implies a more financially stable business  thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity With the first quarter reporting cycle in full swing  the earnings growth picture seems to be improving from the preceding quarter  In fact  growth this reporting season is expected to hit the highest level in the last three years   However  to be on the safer side  we urge investors to go for low leverage stocks instead of targeting growth stocks   After all  low leverage stocks are financially more secure and immune to market upheavals The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned discussion  it is imperative for a sensible investor to choose stocks that have a low debt to equity ratio However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks to Secure Your Portfolio 

	The U S  stock market seems to be on a high right now on account of the dynamic market conditions that have been prevailing across the globe for the past few days  Two factors   reduced risk of euro dissolution in the wake of market preferred French election results and hopes for a corporate tax cut by Trump   are driving the equity market rally 

	The global equity markets picked up pace at the beginning of the week as the first round of the French presidential election went in favor of Emmanuel Macron  On the other hand  U S  President Trump s promise to cut corporate tax by 20  and to impose a 10  tax on foreign earnings in repatriation  boosted market sentiments 

	On top of that  Federal Reserve chairperson  Janet Yellen s consistent claim that the U S  economy is growing  pretty healthy   leads to more optimism  All these factors set the stage for investment in U S  stocks 

	However  analysts remain concerned about low productivity growth and sluggish consumer spending  Besides  following Trump s failure to repeal Obamacare  a few are skeptical about the implementation of the corporate tax cut 

	Therefore  it is better to be safe than sorry and invest in less risky stocks  Considering the fact that uncertainty can hit equity market any time  it is better to avoid highly leveraged stocks as they are the most vulnerable ones at times of volatility 

	So investors must look for stocks that are less leveraged  as only a few fortunate ones can totally escape from debt financing  Herein comes the use of financial leverage ratio  which helps one to identify highly leveraged stocks  One of the most popular leverage ratios is the debt to equity ratio 

Analyzing Debt to Equity

	Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  Equity

	This metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A lower debt to equity ratio implies a more financially stable business  thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity 

	With the first quarter reporting cycle in full swing  the earnings growth picture seems to be improving from the preceding quarter  In fact  growth this reporting season is expected to hit the highest level in the last three years  However  to be on the safer side  we urge investors to go for low leverage stocks instead of targeting growth stocks  After all  low leverage stocks are financially more secure and immune to market upheavals 

The Winning Strategy

	Considering the aforementioned discussion  it is imperative for a sensible investor to choose stocks that have a low debt to equity ratio 

	However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria 

	Here are the other parameters 

Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers 

Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above 

Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median   Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation 

Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation 

Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success 

  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

	Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen

128344,349859,DRI,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  McDonald s  Domino s Pizza  Wendy s  Darden Restaurants And Restaurant Brands International,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 28  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Restaurants  Part 1  including McDonald s Corp   NYSE        Domino s Pizza  Inc   NYSE         The Wendy s Company  NASDAQ         Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI   Inc   NYSE        and Restaurant Brands International  Inc   NYSE        

	Industry  Restaurants  Part 1

	Link  

	The U S  restaurant space had a dismal run over the past few quarters in spite of economic growth  lower energy prices and higher income  Consumers increased their spending only modestly on dining out  with the situation taking a turn for the worse  thanks to higher health care costs and tightened credit availability  As a result  traffic has been weak and same store sales growth has been dull 

	In fact  the first quarter of 2017 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of negative comparable sales  comps  for the restaurant industry as a whole  making the mood somber  This is further reflected in the industry s stock price performance  Over the past year  the stock price performance of the Zacks classified Retail Restaurants industry compared unfavorably with the broader S P 500 index  While the industry stocks gained a mere 2 2   the broader index was up 13 4  

	Despite the loud buzz about the restaurant industry hitting recession  it is to be noted that sustained strength in the labor market on the back of a steady rise in wages will likely encourage consumers to dine out more  Restaurateurs are undertaking various sales building and digital initiatives to drive traffic and comps  Also  they are increasingly adapting to the changing tastes and preferences of their consumers to entice them once again 

	Increased focus on refranchising bodes well while remodeling efforts should enhance guest experience  Moving ahead  the restaurant industry is thus positioned to get its mojo back 

What s Spooking the Restaurant Industry  

	Restaurants have been witnessing solid sales growth ever since the Great Recession and 2016 wasn t any exception  Moreover  in its 2017 Restaurant Industry Forecast  the National Restaurant Association revealed that it expects sales in the restaurant industry to reach  799 billion  So  then what s really bothering the industry 

	It is to be noted that though this will mark the eighth consecutive year of real growth in restaurant sales  the rate of growth continues to be limited  Additionally  even though total sales are up  foot traffic at individual restaurants is waning fast 

	Same store sales that account for traffic dropped in each of the four quarters of 2016  0 2   0 7   1 1  and 2 4   respectively   per TDn2K s Black Box Intelligence  In fact  the 2 4  fall in Q4 was the worst experienced by restaurants in over five years  Also  same store sales declined 1 6  in the first quarter of 2017  highlighting the difficult operating environment currently facing many operators 

	We note that the prime reason for such a drop in same store sales is essentially the increased number of new restaurants amid restricted growth in eating out budgets  Supply glut and limited demand are thus hampering traffic as well as stock prices for restaurants as instead of generating added sales  each new restaurant is eating up share from other restaurants  This has in fact resulted in bankruptcy for many public and private restaurants 

	Another major challenge that restaurants are facing of late is increase in menu prices at a much quicker rate than the prices for food at grocery stores  This is adding to the competitive pressure for restaurants  as preparing food at home has become much more attractive from a cost perspective 

What Can Possibly Drive Growth 

	Nevertheless  some of the big names like McDonald s Corp   NYSE        Domino s Pizza  Inc   NYSE         The Wendy s Company  NASDAQ         Darden Restaurants  Inc   NYSE        and Restaurant Brands International  Inc   NYSE        seem to be unperturbed by the plight and continue to do well on the back of strong fundamentals and innovative offerings  While McDonald s  Domino s and Papa John s carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Darden holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Restaurant Brands sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see   

	This signifies that all is not lost for the U S  restaurant space and investors should thus not shy away from putting money into this space and cash in on the bountiful opportunities 

	In fact  long term trends favoring eating out over eating at home are still in place  Moreover  operators willing to evolve and stand out in a competitive market will continue to reap profits  Thus  restaurants with solid fundamentals and sufficient capacity for innovation will remain compelling bets 

	More importantly  long term factors supporting the sector remain firmly in place  Per the USDA  spending on food outside homes has risen from 10  to 50  of total food purchases over 1904 to 2013  In addition  sales at food services and drinking places have increased more rapidly than retail sales since 20 14  This trend is also far more stable and will continue to lift the sector once the current weakness subsides 

Wave of Consolidation

	Consolidation is the name of the game to survive the prevailing restaurant recession  Evidently  though it s just the fourth month of the year  we have already witnessed four noteworthy M A activities in the restaurant space 

	Notably  another vital rationale behind these consolidations is rising labor expenses and other costs  Now that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay  restaurateurs could be looking to increase scale of operations so as to benefit from economies of scale  Additionally  consolidation is convenient for overseas expansion 

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

	Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  Its average gain has been a stellar  26  per year

128368,349883,DRI,5 Retail Growth Stocks To Withstand Market Gyrations,opinion,Betting on a stock is more like an attempt to hit the jackpot  But one needs a fair amount of luck for it to work every time  So  how to go about it  Instead of being a mute spectator and waiting for a convincing investment scenario  one should try and identify stocks that have the potential to outperform even when market conditions are not congenial Of late  major indices have fallen prey to weaker than expected March employment data  President Donald Trump s airstrike against Syria and a decline in U S  Manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index to 53 3 in March from 54 2 in February  signaling concern over the economic outlook Trump s failure to keep his campaign promise of revamping U S  healthcare was also a major setback and raised doubts as to whether he will be able to give shape to his revolutionary ideas that had led markets to new highs  Further  the notes of Fed s March meeting unveiled that policy makers are contemplating on paring the balance sheet that has inflated to approximately  4 trillion of government  and mortgage backed bonds  This did not go well down with investors We note that the Dow Jones Industrial Average  S P 500 and NASDAQ declined 1 1   0 83   and 0 15   respectively  in the past month Where to Focus Target  Growth Stocks   These are generally hot and flourishing stocks with earnings growth potential  Among the 16 Zacks categorized sectors  we are focusing on  today  The sector has gained 8 1  so far in the year and has comfortably outperformed the S P 500 index that advanced 5 2  The recent rebound in oil prices  decelerating unemployment rate  4 5  in March  and a gradual improvement in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode  Undoubtedly  the retail sector presents itself as a lucrative investment hub amid such a backdrop  These factors are playing a crucial role in raising buyers  confidence  U S  consumer confidence leaped in March to the highest level since Dec 2000 amid growing labor market optimism We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending  which accounts for about two thirds of the U S  economic activity  Personal consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2016 improved 2   while the U S  economy expanded at an impressive rate of 2 1   Although consumer spending inched up 0 1  in February  following a 0 2  jump in January  it does not indicate that the economy is devoid of momentum All these factors call for investing in some rock solid stocks that have the potential to touch new highs as validated by their  5 Prominent Picks Here we have highlighted five Retail Wholesale stocks that have a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  with a Growth Score of  A  or  B   These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals  surging share price and a track record of better than expected results  Not only this  these stocks have outperformed their respective industries We suggest investing in The Children s Place  Inc    NASDAQ PLCE    with a long term earnings growth rate of 8  and a Growth Score of  A   In the past six months  the stock surged roughly 50 3  and outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  which declined 18 3   This specialty retailer of children s apparel delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 39  over the trailing four quarters and flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Another stock worth considering is Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY    which has a long term earnings growth rate of 10 5  and a Growth Score of  A   This retailer of technology products  services  and solutions delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 27 7  in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank  1  We note that in the past six months  the stock advanced approximately 22 2   while the Zacks categorized  industry gained 17 8  Investors can count on Rush Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ RUSHA    an integrated retailer of commercial vehicles and related services with a long term earnings growth rate of 15   The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 12 8  over the trailing four quarters and has a Growth Score of  A   In the past six months  this Zacks Rank  1 stock exhibited a bullish run and surged 54 8   while the Zacks categorized  industry gained 0 6

surprise of 3 4  in the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 10 4   The stock surged 33 4  in the past six months and comfortably outperformed the Zacks categorized

128369,349884,DRI,Is It Time To Add Diversified Restaurant Holdings  SAUC  Now,opinion,Though the restaurant industry is passing through its worst period since the end of recession  a few players from the same space can offer some respite  Diversified Restaurant Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ SAUC   is one such company  It is the largest franchisee of Buffalo Wild Wings  Inc    NASDAQ BWLD   restaurants  with 64 locations across Florida  Illinois  Indiana  Michigan  and Missouri  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company has good prospects and should be value additive to your portfolio  You can see  Earnings   Revenue GrowthDiversified Restaurant Holdings is an attractive pick in terms of growth investment  Investors always put the greatest importance on earnings growth as surging profit levels indicate the bright prospects  and stock price gains  of the company in question Diversified Restaurant Holdings has a historical  3 5 year  EPS growth rate of a whopping 223 1   compared with the Zacks categorized  industry s average of 10 2   Moreover  the stock has a long term  3 5 years  expected EPS growth rate of roughly 19   which is higher than the industry average of 14 4  The company also boasts historical sales growth  5 years  of 27 5   compared with the industry average of just 4 6  Given such positives  the company currently has a Growth Score of  A  on our   This is quite meaningful as it helps us identify potential outperformers Valuation Looks RationalDiversified Restaurant Holdings has a Value Style Score of  B   The Value Style Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of  value traps  and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount A look at the sales figures shows that the company is currently trading at a P S ratio of 0 39  significantly lower than the industry average which stands at 1 15  Some people prefer this metric over other value focused ones because sales are harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings An often overlooked ratio that can still be an important indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio does not take amortization and depreciation into account and therefore  can give a more accurate picture of the financial health of a business  Diversified Restaurant Holdings has a P CF of 5 70  which is lower than the industry s average of 9 52 The PEG ratio is also important as this metric shows investors how much they are paying for each unit of earnings growth  Diversified Restaurant Holdings impresses on this count as well  The company has a PEG ratio of 1 60  while the industry average is 1 65 Based on these factors  the stock seems to be undervalued than its peers at the moment  Hence  it may be a good idea to invest in Diversified Restaurant Holdings  stock now Stock Price MovementDiversified Restaurant Holdings stock is seeing solid activity on the price front right now  As a result  the company currently has a Momentum Style Score of  B   Shares of Diversified Restaurant Holdings have returned 73 6  year to date  outperforming the industry s increase of just 2 3  in the same time frame  In fact  we noticed that Diversified Restaurant Holdings has outperformed the industry in each of 1 week  4 week and 12 week and 52 week time frames Notably  currently the stock is trading extremely cheap at  2 43 per share  This makes it a lucrative buy as it does not require a high amount of investment to be a part of the company s profits Earnings History and Estimate RevisionsDiversified Restaurant Holdings has beaten met earnings estimates in each of the trailing five quarters with an average beat of 108 33  in the last four quarters Furthermore  upward estimate revisions reflect optimism about the stock s prospects  Analysts have raised earnings estimates for the current quarter and the current year by 100  and 60   respectively  over the past month Bottom LineGoing by these statistics  Diversified Restaurant Holdings is expected to perform well in the quarters ahead  However  investors should be cautious of higher labor costs and investments in initiatives that could hurt the company s margins  Further  a challenging sales environment is hurting most restaurateurs like Brinker International  Inc    NYSE EAT    Darden Restaurants  Inc    NYSE DRI   to name a few  and could deter top line growth at Diversified Restaurant Holdings too  Nevertheless  we are hopeful on the stock s prospects as it continues to reflect strength in several areas The Best   Worst of ZacksToday you are invited

The upside can be attributed to the turnaround plan announced by CEO Steve Easterbrook in May 2015  However  currency headwinds continued to keep profits under pressure 
Earnings and Revenue Discussion
McDonald s earnings of  1 23 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 16 by 6   Meanwhile  in constant currencies  it surged 51  year over year 
 The upside reflects a decline in total costs and expenses  and a lower share count 
Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 4 cents per share on quarterly earnings  Including the impact of foreign exchange  earnings registered a 46  year over year upside 
Revenues of  5 90 billion dipped 1  year over year mainly due to currency headwinds  However  in constant currencies  the figure improved 3  driven by comps growth at all of its segments  Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 87 billion by a marginal 0 5  
Behind the Headlines Numbers

U S comps grew 5 4  in the first quarter  reflecting the success of the All Day Breakfast platform  launched in 2015  and the popularity of the company s national value platform   McPick 2  However  comps growth was marginally lower than the prior quarter improvement of 5 7  
Segment operating income soared 15  driven mainly by higher sales driven franchised margins and a rise in gains from restaurant refranchising 
The company remains focused on the long term value platform  menu innovation and simplifying restaurant operations to improve guest experience 
Comps at the International Lead Markets segment grew 5 2   higher than an increase of 4 2  last quarter  Comps were driven by strong performance in Australia  the UK and Canada  The upside reflects multiple menu  service and value initiatives across most of the segments  which led to positive consumer response 
Operating income soared 12   including the impact of foreign exchange headwinds  In constant currency  the figure was up 16   However  macroeconomic concerns in France and Germany continue to pose risks

Comps in Foundational Markets jumped 11   higher than the prior quarter improvement of 5 9   primarily on the back of strong sales in Japan

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the last full week of August  sees the Equity markets looking horrible  ready for more downside 
Elsewhere  look for gold to continue in its uptrend  while crude oil continues lower  The US dollar index is consolidating sideways with a downward bias  while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside with risk of the Chinese market running sideways in consolidation 
Volatility looks to remain elevated above the prior stable period  but usually does not hold these levels long  This will keep the bias lower for the equity index ETF s NYSE SPY  NYSE IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  in the short run  Their charts suggest the downside move is not over  but all are very oversold and could see short term bounces early in the week  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

The Estimize consensus calls for revenue of  1 629 billion and EPS of  0 42  coming into the company s FQ2 2016 earnings report
Under the tutelage of Starboard Value  Darden Restaurants are undergoing a company wide makeover
Despite the costs of implementing a new strategic plan and increasing restaurant wages  Darden is expected to yield profitable growth 
Best known for its breadsticks at Olive Garden  Darden Restaurants is a premier full service company operating leading chains around the United States  Given how much fast casual has cannibalized the casual dining experience  Darden Restaurants has performed remarkably well  beating analysts estimates the past 4 quarters  In that time  the restaurant group has undertaken a significant overhaul of menus  marketing  digital advertising and customer services in many of their most popular restaurants  This makeover has come to the pleasure of shareholders  yielding positive results and profitability  With the last four quarters being favorable  the Estimize consensus calls for revenue and EPS of  1 629 billion and  0 42 respectively coming into their FQ2 2016 earnings  This reflects a year over year increase of 65  in EPS and 4 4  in revenue  With that said  expectations are that Darden will continue its positive momentum for the remainder of the fiscal year 

Following a disappointing fiscal 2014  Darden Restaurants implemented a strategic plan to overhaul all restaurant operations  Activist hedge fund  Starboard Value  facilitated an increase in sales  same store growth  and overall profitability in Darden Restaurants  Their flagship  Olive Garden restaurants  successfully underwent a renaissance plan encompassing simplifying kitchen systems  developing core menu items  updating the online platform and revamping the restaurant s design  The other main change led by Starboard was the spin off of 430 restaurant properties into a REIT  With a strategic plan in action  investors can consider Darden Restaurants for dividends and growth going into their earnings report ",2015-12-18,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-darden-restaurants-serve-up-strong-earnings-this-quarter-376281,376281
128615,350130,DRI,A Different Kind Of Yield To Consider,opinion,"U S  corporations are more profitable than ever  leaving many firms flush with cash  Deciding what to do with that excess cash is a good problem to have 
Companies have several options when it comes to deploying their extra dough  They can make acquisitions  fund organic growth  pay down debt  or return it to shareholders through dividends or stock buybacks 
Of course  a company can just let that money sit in the bank and grow its cash hoard  But with interest rates near record lows  they re generating very low returns for their shareholders 
Ideally  a company should use its capital to maximize long term value for its shareholders  But clearly some managers understand this concept better than others  Many corporate executives are more concerned about empire building than producing high returns on capital and often make reckless decisions with shareholders  money that destroys value over time 
If you own a company for the long run  make sure you know how it is managing its cash 
Shareholder Yield
It s not uncommon for companies to distribute more and more cash to shareholders as they mature  Bigger companies have less growth opportunities and compete in crowded markets  so they plow back less of their earnings into the company and more into shareholders  wallets  And dividends  along with stock buybacks  are the quickest and surest way to return value to shareholders 
The total amount of cash a company spends on dividends and share buybacks as a percentage of its market cap is referred to as shareholder yield  While many growth investors might scoff at companies that return a lot of cash to shareholders   
Buyer Beware
When a company actually buys back its shares  it has a direct benefit in that it reduces the number of shares outstanding  This means that earnings are divided among fewer shares  In other words  your piece of the pie just got bigger 
If a company has the excess funds and their stock is undervalued  buybacks can add tremendous value over time  But make no mistake  stock buybacks don t always add value  In fact  companies are often bad at timing their repurchases  buying when their share price is expensive and hoarding cash when it is cheap 
The cash allocated to their overvalued stock would have been better spent investing for growth  paying a higher dividend  or just leaving it in the bank 
So make sure the underlying business is sound and the stock is reasonably priced before investing in a company that s buying back its own stock  Because all the buybacks in the world won t save a company headed off a cliff 
One way to avoid stocks heading over a cliff is to look at the direction of consensus earnings estimates  When analysts revise a company s estimates lower  it s usually a sign of weakening underlying fundamentals  So look for stocks with at least stable consensus estimates   or better yet  look for ones with rising estimates  And there s no better gauge of a company s earnings momentum than the Zacks Rank 
4 Shareholder Friendly Companies
With that in mind  here are 4 companies with high shareholder yields and a Zacks Rank of 3 or better 
Caterpillar  NYSE CAT 
Market Cap   55 2 billion  Net Share Buybacks  Trailing Twelve Months    3 97 billion  7 2  of market cap   Dividends Paid  Trailing Twelve Months    1 59 billion  2 9  of market cap   Shareholder Yield  10 1   Zacks Rank  3
Western Union  NYSE WU 
Market Cap   9 0 billion  Net Share Buybacks  TTM    509 million  5 7  of market cap   Dividends Paid  TTM    269 million  3 0  of market cap   Shareholder Yield  8 7   Zacks Rank  2
Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX 
Market Cap   21 1 billion  Net Share Buybacks  TTM    1 806 million  8 5  of market cap   Dividends Paid  TTM    562 million  2 7  of market cap   Shareholder Yield  11 2   Zacks Rank  3
Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI 
Market Cap   7 7 billion  Net Share Buybacks  TTM    442 million  5 8  of market cap   Dividends Paid  TTM    289 million  3 8  of market cap   Shareholder Yield  9 6   Zacks Rank  2
The Bottom Line
Companies have several options when it comes to deploying their excess cash  These 4 firms are choosing to return value to shareholders through solid dividends and big stock buybacks

Enterprise software producer Oracle  NYSE ORCL  is scheduled to report its third fiscal quarter earnings after the close on Tuesday  Investors will be looking for growth after 2nd quarter profits came in flat back in December 

 contributors are predicting that Oracle will report earnings of 72 cents per share  That would be 4 cents better than the Wall Street forecast of 68 cents which matches results from the comparable period of last year 
Wednesday   FedEx 
Logistics giant FedEx  NYSE FDX  is set to report fourth quarter earnings Wednesday morning  In January rival UPS guided lower for its holiday period  citing the costs of delivering a high volume of packages on time  FedEx came out and reaffirmed its 2015 guidance  shoring up its investors  confidence amid uncertainty 

Contributing analysts on Estimize expect FedEx to beat the Wall Street consensus by 3 cents  1 6   per share  Wall Street is forecasting that FedEx will earn  1 89 in EPS  Meeting either group s expectation would put the company on track to reach its yearly goal of  8 50 to  9 00 in EPS 
Thursday   Nike
The front of Nike s investor relations page tells us that Nike  NYSE NKE  is a growth company  With earnings per share and revenue both increasing steadily over the past two years  the sportswear king has a claim  In its two most recent 3 month periods Nike has posted year over year earnings growth of 27  and 25  

Nike s competitor Under Armour  NYSE UA  dove into fitness tracking this quarter with its acquisition of MyFitnessPal and its newly opened digital headquarters in Austin  Tx 
Nike has been on the other side of the fitness tracking spectrum  winding its hardware experiments down  Last year Nike fired the majority of its Fuel Band team and pledged to back out of device production  Under Armour may have loftier ambitions in technology  but Nike s sportswear continues to sell phenomenally well around the globe  Analysts on Estimize are looking for a 16  increase to the bottom line Thursday and a 10  boost to total sales 
Friday   Darden Restaurants 
There have been some major shakeups this year to the parent company of Olive Garden  The changes at Darden  NYSE DRI  come after a period of sustained pressure from activist investment fund Starboard Value 
Last summer longtime CEO Clarence Otis stepped down from Darden s top post  satisfying one demand from Starboard s lengthy list  Starboard has been critical of Darden s cost saving measures and replaced the entire board of directors after winning a nearly year long battle back in October  Now that Starboard s Jeff Smith has his way  we ll see if he Starboard can pare down costs as much as the firm claimed it would 

The Estimize community is expecting Darden s revenue to come in slightly below the Wall Street consensus while earnings per share remain in line with Wall Street s estimate 
Friday   Tiffany s
In January Tiffany s  NYSE TIF  released preliminary holiday period sales  warning investors of a slow quarter  Asia Pacific region sales were a bright spot  increasing 7  despite a 16  drop in Japan in part due to the country s high consumption tax  Revenues in Tiffany s largest market  the US  fell 1  

Tiffany s reported  1 02 billion in global sales for the 2 month period ending on December 31  That s down 1  from their holiday sales last year  Estimize contributors are setting their sights high for Tiffany s expecting the luxury company to tack on an additional  342 million in sales during January bringing total quarterly revenue to  1 344 billion  a 3 5  improvement compared to last year ",2015-03-17,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-3-16-15-245239,245239
128617,350132,DRI,Darden Restaurants Hits 52 Wk  High Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI   the owner and operator of casual dining spots in the U S  and Canada  is set to report its third quarter 2015 results before Friday s opening bell  The Estimize EPS consensus is calling for  0 85  just a penny higher than the Street  while revenue expectations of  1 73B are actually slightly below what Wall Street is expecting 

Anyone that follows this space knows that Darden has been struggling for the last couple of years  but the industry itself has been doing wonderfully  Trends in casual dining continued to improve during the second half of 2014 as the middle class  typically the target for casual dining spots  saw higher disposable incomes due to lower gas prices  rising employment and lower inflation  As such  competition has been fierce  with Darden losing market share to its peers for the last several quarters 

Recognizing this  Darden decided to spin off it s weakest link  Red Lobster  in the summer of 2014  The move was done in order to focus on the company s largest unit  Olive Garden  which now boasts more than 800 locations and is responsible for nearly half of the sales generated by Darden  That tactic seems to be paying off  with Olive Garden topping same restaurant sales estimates in fiscal Q2 2015 and helping the company post it s first quarter of profit growth after 8 consecutive quarters of negative growth  As a result  Darden Restaurants raised the low end of its previous 2015 profit guidance  It now expects adjusted EPS to be in the range of  2 25    2 30  up from the earlier projection of  2 22    2 30

128644,350159,DRI,Looking Ahead To Q3 Earnings Season,opinion,"We are still a few weeks away from the end of the September quarter  but the Q3 earnings season will have gotten underway by then  The reason for that is that we and other researchers count companies with fiscal quarters ending in August as part of our Q3 tally 
 Using this definition  Darden Restaurants Inc  NYSE DRI  will be the first to come out with Q3 results later this week followed by 8 S P 500 members next week  including such industry leaders as Oracle Corporation  NYSE ORCL   FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  and Nike Inc  NYSE NKE   In fact  by October 1st  we will have seen Q3 results from almost 20 S P 500 members  In all fairness however  the reporting cycle wouldn t get heated up till mid October  The chart below shows weekly reporting calendar for the S P 500 companies   Estimates for Q3 have come down as the quarter has unfolded  with current expectations of  3 1  total earnings growth in the quarter down from  5 6  growth expected in early July  Estimates for most sectors came down  though Medical  Basic Materials  Aerospace  and Transportation experienced modest positive revisions during the quarter  The negative revisions trend for Q3 has been in keeping with what we have been witnessing for quite some time  though the pace and magnitude of negative revisions for Q3 compares favorably with what we have been used to in the recent past  The chart below compares the revisions trend for 2014 Q3 with what we witnessed in the year earlier period  Final Q2 Scorecard We will officially close the books on the Q2 earnings season following Kroger Company  NYSE KR  tomorrow morning  But for all practical purposes  the reporting cycle is over now  This was a strong earnings season after a long time  with total earnings up  8 1  from the same period last year on  4 4  higher revenues and with 62 5  beating EPS estimates and 58 3  coming out with positive revenue surprises  We have two sets of charts below   one compares the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates with what these same companies reported in 2014 Q1 and the 4 quarter average and the second chart compares the beat ratios for these companies 
Better Growth  The aggregate growth picture is actually even better once the Finance sector s anemic growth numbers are excluded  Excluding Finance  total earnings are up  10 1  from the same period last year on  4 7  higher revenues   And More Positive Revenue Surprises  The Q2 earnings performance was a notable departure from what we have been seeing in other recent reporting cycles  But was it a one off bounce from the anemic Q1 level or the start of something more enduring  We don t know yet  though the coming Q3 earnings season will give us a good sense of how to answer that question

128645,350160,DRI,What Will The Q3 Earnings Season Bring ,opinion,"The 2014 Q3 earnings season for companies in the S P 500 index got underway with the Friday morning release from Darden Restaurant  NYSE DRI   We will get some more Q3 reports this week  with a little over two dozen companies coming out with quarterly results  including 7 S P 500 members like Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE   FedEx  FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX   and Oracle  NYSE ORCL   All of these early reporters have fiscal quarters ending in August and their earnings reports form part of our Q3 tally  By the end of this month  we will have seen Q3 results from roughly 30 S P 500 members  But as you can see in the chart below  we will have to wait till the middle of next month for the Q3 reporting cycle to really ramp up 

This earnings season will give us a good sense of whether the profitability strength on display in the last reporting cycle was a one off event or the start of something enduring  Please recall that part of the Q2 strength was a bounce back from the extremely low levels to which all activity levels had fallen in the weather disrupted first quarter of the year  As such  one could argue that none of the last two earnings seasons represented truly normal conditions  which we will most likely see for the first time this year only in Q3  The table below shows a summary picture of current Q3 expectations compared to what was actually achieved in Q2  As you can see  total earnings are expected to be up  3  from the same period last year on  1 4  higher revenues and modest margin gains 

As has been the trend each quarter for quite some time  estimates for Q3 have come down as the quarter has unfolded  The chart below shows estimates for 2014 Q3 have evolved over the last 10 or so weeks 
  The negative revisions trend has been broad based  with most sectors suffering downward adjustments in estimates  But the trend has been most pronounced for Oil Energy  Retail  and Consumer Staples  The chart below shows the sectors with the biggest revisions  As you can see  estimates for Basic Materials and Transportation have gone up 

Estimates for the Finance and Technology sectors have come down  but not by that much  For the Finance sector  total earnings are expected to be up  4  while the Tech sector earnings are expected to be up  3 6   Total earnings for the S P 500 reached an all time quarterly record in 2014 Q2 and current estimates for Q3 put the quarterly total as the second highest ever  But given the historical trend of roughly two thirds of the companies beating earnings estimates  the final Q3 tally will likely be right in the preceding quarter s record vicinity  The chart below shows that current consensus estimates reflect record tallies in the following quarters  

For these estimates to hold  we need an improvement on the guidance front  which has been persistently been weak for almost two years now  There was modest improvement in tone of management guidance on the Q2 earnings calls  but the majority of companies providing guidance still guided lower  That said  continuation of even the modest improvement in guidance will be a net positive in the overall earnings picture  For a detailed at overall earnings picture  please check out our weekly  Note  Want more articles from this author  Scroll up to the top of this article and click the FOLLOW AUTHOR button to get an email each time a new article is published Monday 9 15

128664,350179,DRI,European Equities Head Lower After Chinese Trade Data Misses Estimates,opinion,Equity markets in Europe are lower after Trade Balance data out of China came in much worse than market estimates and this is seen weighing on risk sentiment as confidence in the global economic recovery remains sluggish  Prior to the release  however  European markets had posted 5 straight days of gains but this latest move is dragging down equity values in the US as Asia as well  so it appears as though investors were looking for an excuse to take profits and the Chinese Trade figures were the latest reason to start selling In stock specific news  German telephone company Drillisch AG  DRI  dropped 1 4 percent after the company released its latest earnings report  which showed that second quarter income fell by a massive 43 percent  The largest steelmaker in Germany  Thyssen Krupp AG  TKA   helped to balance this news and rose by 2 percent after their latest earnings report showed a positive number for the first time in four quarters  Today s activity showed led the Stoxx Europe 600 Index lower by 0 4 percent to trade below the 270 level On the whole  the Stoxx 600 benchmark has made gains of 1 4 percent this week  which is the 10th consecutive week of gains  This is coming largely as a result of stronger earnings reports from European companies  This performance is not being matched in the US  however  as the Standard   Poor s 500 Index is lower by 0 4 percent  and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index is also posting losses of 0 6 percent For the most part  recent stock gains have mostly been seen as a result of market expectations that global central banks will be forced to inject additional rounds of quantitative easing stimulus  But there has been little in the way of direct confirmation of this by voting members of global central banks  and investors have started to consider the possible that this will not be happening before the end of the year  So  as long as central banks refrain from making stimulus comments  investors will be forced to focus on economic data and so far  these figures have remained relatively weak The latest examples have come from China  where yesterday s inflation numbers showed that consumer prices are declining but this was nowhere near as market moving as the Trade Balance figures today  which showed that outbound shipments rose by 1 percent relative to this point last year  while imports were higher by 4 7 percent during the month of July  The market estimates were calling for a rise of 8 percent in monthly export growth  after the 11 3 percent increase previously  Imports were expected to rise by 7 percent  so these reports are coming along with previous data suggesting that China s industrial output growth dropped to its lowest levels in three years  Given these negative reports  expect a weak close on Friday  as investors take profits from the rallies seen previously The USD JPY is starting to flatten out in the 78 50 region and if prices do not see a drop before the end of next week  the daily downtrend line from the end of March will be removed and suggest a bottom is in place  Look to buy dips to a slow rise back to the highs at 79 80 The DAX is showing a nicely formed rally and prices are now testing the upper end of the symmetrical triangle seen on the weekly charts  At this stage an upside break is expected  given the break through Fibonacci resistance previously  Buy dips into 6540 ,2012-08-10,Spread Betting,https://www.investing.com/analysis/european-equities-head-lower-after-chinese-trade-data-misses-estimates-132622,132622
