20777,242292,BUSE,Is First Busey Corporation  BUSE  Stock A Good Pick Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put  First Busey Corporation   NASDAQ BUSE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  First Busey Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 87  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 06  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level First Busey Corporation puts current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 16 97  over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 07  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that First Busey Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 31  so it is fair to expect an increase in the stock s price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  First Busey Corporation has a P S ratio of about 3 36  This is slightly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 64 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  First Busey Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BUSE a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other metrics make it clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 11 23  which is slightly better than the industry average of 11 28  Clearly  BUSE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall 
Though First Busey Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of A  This gives BUSE a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current year has seen two estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to four higher  while full year 2020 estimate has seen five downward and one upward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current year consensus estimate has fallen 8 7  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has declined 1 8   in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below  First Busey Corporation Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineFirst Busey Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 40  out of more than 250 industries  and Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8   five of our screens returned  38 0    61 3    61 6    68 1   and  98 3  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   2018  while the S P averaged  4 8  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  56 2  per year ",2019-11-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-first-busey-corporation-buse-stock-a-good-pick-now-200483885,200483885
