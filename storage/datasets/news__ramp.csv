9239,230754,RAMP,Acxiom Plunges To 52 Week Low  What s Pushing It Down ,opinion,"Shares of Acxiom Corp    NASDAQ ACXM   touched a new 52 week low during trading session on Aug 18  The company s stock fell to as low as  22 03  eventually closing at  22 10 
Notably  Acxiom s shares have lost 17 5  year to date  against the  s gain of 18 4  

Estimates Going South
Further  the company has witnessed negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter as well as the current year over the past 30 days 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter fell 3 cents to 16 cents  while the full year estimate fell by a penny to 81 cents  The declining trend can be primarily attributed to the disappointing first quarter fiscal 2018 results  announced earlier this month  
Acxiom reported non GAAP earnings of 3 cents per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents  Revenues of  212 5 million also declined 1  from the year ago quarter and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  217 million 
Following the unimpressive quarterly earnings results  the company provided a downbeat forecast for fiscal 2018  Management now expects slower bookings in its Marketing Services business segment 
Further  management anticipates pricing model changes in its Audience Solutions segment to hurt top line growth Acxiom Corporation Price

   Diminished Profitability in Competitive Landscape
Acxiom operates in the highly competitive and broad industry of data analytics that is becoming more complex with low barriers to entry  This has led to increased price competition  negatively affecting its business  Competition from the likes of Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    Epsilon  owned by Alliance Data Systems   NYSE ADS     NeuStar  CoreLogic and even Oracle  NYSE ORCL   which owns Datalogix and BlueKai  remain headwinds 
Also  despite serving some of the largest and most profitable firms in the United States  Acxiom s client base consists primarily of companies in the financial services sector  Hence  any slowdown in the financial services industry is likely to adversely impact the company s overall performance 
Acxiom currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

9278,230793,RAMP,Facebook releases new privacy safeguards after ceding to pressure from advertisers,news,"By Joel Schectman WASHINGTON  Reuters    Facebook is installing new controls it says will better inform its members about the way companies are targeting them with advertising  the latest step to quell a public outcry over the company s mishandling of user data  Starting on July 2   Facebook Inc   O FB  for the first time will require advertisers to tell its users if a so called data broker supplied information that led to them being served with an ad  Data brokers are firms that collect personal information about consumers and sell it to marketers and other businesses  Facebook has also set up new procedures for the handling of names of potential customers supplied by data brokers  Advertisers seeking to upload lists of these prospects onto Facebook s platform will first have to promise that the data vendor obtained any legally required consent from those consumers  Facebook says the new policies will create more transparency for its users and require more accountability from advertisers   We are not taking a position on whether third party data is inherently good or bad   said Graham Mudd  a director of product marketing at Facebook   We are taking a position on the importance of having the right to use the data and for it to have been sourced responsibly   The new policies are the second big push by Facebook this year to shore up its policy regarding data brokers  On March 28  Facebook moved to banish data brokers from its platform as part of efforts to burnish its image  But the company quickly softened its stance after big marketers threatened to pull their ad dollars from Facebook  according to three people familiar with the decision  Advertisers said the restrictions on data brokers would hurt their ability to aim their ads at customers most likely to buy their products  Details of advertisers  pushback  and Facebook s retreat  have not been previously reported  A Facebook spokeswoman confirmed that the company shifted its position within days because of  feedback from advertisers   She said sponsors will still be able to use information purchased from third party vendors to target Facebook users with ads  albeit under stricter conditions than before  REPAIRING A REPUTATION Wednesday s move is another effort by Facebook to repair its reputation amid a series of scandals  Among the most damaging was the revelation that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of 87 million people without permission  In recent public appearances by executives and new television spots  Facebook has been promoting its efforts to keep its users safe and protect their personal information  But the initiatives present the Menlo Park  CA company with a tricky balancing act  While it is touting greater protections for its users  its advertisers are demanding the ability to target potential customers with ever greater precision   Facebook is caught between tremendous pressures from marketers  and privacy demands from policy makers and the public   said Kathryn Montgomery  an American University communications professor  who specializes in media and privacy issues  Data brokers are firms that have made billions of dollars gathering and selling Americans  personal information  including how much money they earn  what they buy and how many children they have  They get their data from a variety of sources  including public records as well as transaction histories compiled by credit card companies  retailers and other merchants  Many consumers have no idea they are being tracked in this way  And while the practice is legal in the United States  it has fueled concerns among privacy advocates about the accuracy of this highly personal information  as well as the methods by which it is collected  bought and sold  HOW BANNING BROKERS FAILED Since 2013  Facebook had collaborated with major data vendors including Experian Plc  L EXPN  and Acxiom Corp  O ACXM   Using personal information about consumers provided by the brokers  Facebook built an ad targeting tool on its site known as Partner Categories  Advertisers using the system could pinpoint their ads to Facebook users who met certain criteria  say  those who owned their own homes  just had a baby or drove luxury vehicles  Partner Categories was particularly powerful because it allowed marketers to direct their ads based on information that users may never have disclosed to their friends on Facebook  Facebook announced March 28 it was shutting down Partner Categories  That same day  the company told ad agencies they would be prohibited from uploading lists of potential prospects acquired from data brokers into Facebook  Together  those two steps would have effectively amounted to a total ban of data brokers from the site  Facebook s initial move was a blow to consumer goods manufacturers that lack direct relationships with the people who buy their products  marketers said  Car makers  for example  often know little about consumers who walk into dealerships  Ditto for food manufacturers  which sell to supermarkets  not grocery shoppers  To target customers on social media  these companies rely on data brokers to guide them to the best prospects  according to interviews with current and former data broker executives  Ad agencies besieged Facebook to reconsider  according to three people familiar with the situation  One executive conveyed a blunt message to Facebook    Dollars would go to other places if we can t find suitable alternatives    she recounted to Reuters  On March 30  just two days later  advertiser complaints persuaded Facebook to allow them to continue to target Facebook users with ads based on uploaded customers lists purchased from data brokers  The company told Reuters its Partner Categories tool will still be phased out by October  Arkansas based Acxiom  one of the nation s largest data brokers  told Reuters it researches the sources of its consumer information carefully  using methods that are  not only legal  but also just and fair to the individual   Experian  another major vendor based in Dublin  Ireland  did not respond to multiple requests for comment on their privacy policies  Many Americans are mistrustful of data brokers  A Reuters Ipsos poll of 1 780 people in the United States found that  of those who were familiar with the brokers  68 percent said they were opposed to social media firms working with those information vendors  The poll found 59 percent of those who were familiar with the data brokers said they would use a social media site less if they knew the tech firm was partnering with them  The poll     The poll conducted between May 15 21 found 751 were  somewhat  or  very  familiar with data brokerages  The poll has a credibility interval  a measure of the poll s precision  of 4 percentage points

ReWalk Robotics Ltd   RWLK  is a new stock  so we ll take a look at the 15 minute chart  It had a slow run up and then a slow declining channel  The earlier pop on Monday reached 32 00  The overall structure is good  and potentially  it could be forming an ascending channel very nicely  There s a platform going on  with sideways consolidation  and it looks like it wants to break out of it  It may very well gap up tomorrow  The overall look it that it came down in a 4 day decline  and popped out on Monday  There s a little bit of resistance at 32 3 4  The target is 37 8 zone 
GoPro Inc  NASDAQ GPRO  is still looking good  After it came down  it was in a consolidation type pattern  This stock twice held key support around 63 1 4 3 4  but it has to get through 71 1 2  It needs to get running  first into the high 70 s  and then the mid 80 s 
Stocks on the Short Side  
Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd  NYSE QIHU  is very interesting  It has a very large  massive head and shoulders pattern that came down steadily for 4 5 weeks  and Monday morning it hit right under 73  and then rallied a little bit  but it was still down 1 69  or 2 2   It s right on the 74 94 line  The next stop is 64 00 
Waddell   Reed Financial Inc  NYSE WDR  is a Boxer Swing short  It broke through the bear flag last week  rallied for a couple days  and then rolled over  Watch the support at 51 1 4  and beyond that  this stock could go all the way down to the 45 7 zone

9310,230825,RAMP,Stocks On The Short Side,opinion,"The stock market wasn t so great on Tuesday  although some of the stocks we follow did wonderfully  and some of the shorts did  too  so let s start by taking a look at some of the longs 
Cyberark Software Ltd  NASDAQ CYBR  is a new issue that s doing well  Taking a look at it on a 15 minute chart and the 5 minute chart  it finished strong after hours at 32 01  The way it acted Tuesday morning  and the overall short term pattern  it broke out with a falling wedge  and I wouldn t be surprised to see it get through resistance at about 32 3 4  and then run up to 35 35 1 2 36 
Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation  NASDAQ TKMR  has exploded big time  It s in a falling wedge  on low volume  and is looking good  After hours  after the FDA approved the use of their drug for Ebola vaccines  this stock exploded from 21 00 to as high as 28 33  and closed at 27 65  but still it s up about 6 1 2 points  It looks like it can hold a pullback  There is some resistance at about 31 00 
Stocks on the Short Side 
Hi Crush Partners LP  NYSE HCLP  is a new addition to the Boxer Shorts  and if you look at the chart you can see why  It cracked  snapped back  and on Tuesday  it rolled over again  down 1 50  It looks like it could test the 51 range  and then maybe run down to the mid 40 s 
Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd  NYSE QIHU  is down again  another 3 15  or 4 5    on 6 million shares  closing at 67 47  It s increasing in volume as it goes down  Look for it to get down to the 64 64 1 2 range short term for a swing trade

9311,230826,RAMP,Stocks I m Looking At In An Ugly Market  ALNY  CYBR  QIHU  WDR,opinion,"Wall Street is getting ugly  but we nailed some nice trades intraday  We ll try to keep that up and keep the mojo going in the trading room  But  for now  it s an ugly market  I do want to point out stocks that are doing well  as well as stocks that aren t doing so well 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ALNY  was a big winner for us on Monday  As a swing trade  it s working out very nicely  It broke out over key resistance on Monday  The trading zone over the last three weeks looks like it was cracking on Friday  and then it had a big gap up and run up  jumping 13 83  or 19   on 3 6 million shares  That s the best volume all year on an upside going back to Jan  There s resistance up at the 92 1 2 range  It may get a test of 99 as early as today  Tuesday  but there may be some resistance  It has 4 waves up and may go a 5 wave up  That s why I am giving the 99 zone  I m still maintaining that as a possibility  and that will be my swing trade 
Cyber Ark Software Ltd   NASDAQ CYBR  is a new issue  After popping  and then coiling  it s trying to make it out  but it has to get through 32 32 15  or thereabouts  to really get it going  In this market it s sure acting fabulous  It was up 1 41  or 5   on 26 million shares  If there s any turnaround in this market  and the futures are up tonight  this one could pop across 32 50  60 range  and run  So keep this in mind 
Stocks on the Short Side  
Qihoo 360 Technology Co  Ltd   NYSE QIHU  made another low on Tuesday to 60 82  When I first gave it to you  it was up in the 80 s  My targets have been met  If the line at 63 00 breaks  it could go all the way down to the 50 area  We could see a substantial additional drop on this one 
Waddell   Reed Financial  Inc   NYSE WDR  is still working its way down  The Boxer Shorts I gave you in August quickly has dropped from 56 down to 44  It looks to me like the 41 2 zone is support  If it gets through that  it could go lower
