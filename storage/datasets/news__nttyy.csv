21249,242764,NTTYY,Should Value Investors Pick Nippon Telegraph  NTTYY  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation   OTC NTTYY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of nearly 12 0  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 9  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone s current PE level puts it marginally below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone has a P S ratio of about 0 9  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5 right now  As we can see in the chart below  this is just marginally below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years NTTYY is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Nippon Telegraph and Telephone a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone is just 1 6  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 4  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 9  which is far better than the industry average of 7 2  Clearly  NTTYY is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Nippon Telegraph and Telephone might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B  This gives NTTYY a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending higher  The current fiscal year as well as the next year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower As a result  the current fiscal year s consensus estimate has risen by 6 5  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has increased 1 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Price and Consensus    This favorable trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term   Bottom LineNippon Telegraph and Telephone is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors  as it has a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 34  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are

21250,242765,NTTYY,Refine Your Portfolio With These Low Price to Sales Stocks,opinion,When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are

21257,242772,NTTYY,5 Top Stocks With A Handsome Net Profit Margin,opinion,Investors flock to a business that reports profits on a regular basis  And to gauge the extent of profit there is no better metric than net profit margin A higher net margin reflects the company s efficiency at converting sales into actual profit Net Profit Margin   Net profit  Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company s operations and cost control measures Net margin helps investors assess the risks of investing in a company  Creditors also view it as a major factor in determining a company s ability to pay off debts Moreover  the strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees who eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin as compared to peers lends a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that crucial for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective for the analysis of a company s performance The Winning StrategyA healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought after elements in a business model Apart from these  we have added a few other criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy Screening ParametersNet Margin 12 months   Most Recent     greater than equal to 0  High net profit margin indicates solid profitability Percentage Change in EPS F 0   F 1  greater than

21261,242776,NTTYY,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include   United Natural  Rocky  ArcelorMittal  Daqo New Energy And Nippon Telegraph,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 11  2018   Stocks in this week s article United Natural Foods  Inc    NASDAQ UNFI    Rocky Brands Inc    NASDAQ RCKY    ArcelorMittal   NYSE MT    Daqo New Energy Corp    NYSE DQ   and Nippon Telegraph And Telephone Corporation   OTC NTTYY   Buy These Low Price to Sales Stocks that Promise GrowthWhen considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment versus a stock with a high price to sales ratio Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation can t do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit

21336,242851,NTTYY,Tap 5 Value Stocks With Impressive EV EBITDA Ratios,opinion,Price to earnings  P E  enjoys greater popularity among the metrics in the value investing world and is preferred by many while uncovering bargain stocks  A widely favored approach by value investors is to hunt for stocks that have a low P E ratio  However  even this straightforward  easy to calculate multiple has a few  is a Better Option  But Why P E is by far the most popular metric used by investors due to its simplicity  But a more complicated and less used metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential and has a more complete approach to valuation  While P E just considers a firm s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total    also known as the enterprise multiple   is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In essence  it is the entire value of a company The other element of the ratio  EBITDA  gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it strips out non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice versa   Unlike the P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into account  Due to this reason  it is typically used to value potential acquisition targets  The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear  Stocks flaunting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making company  Moreover  a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the contrary  EV EBITDA is less amenable to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels However  EV EBITDA is not without its limitations and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital requirements So  instead of solely banking on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for true value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry

21338,242853,NTTYY,Finish 2016 Strong With These 5 Unbeatable Stocks,opinion,"With the commencement of the final quarter of 2016  a year of surprises and uncertainty is nearing its end  So far  while continuing to exhibit a bullish streak  the markets faced volatility due to economic as well as political reasons 
However  the uncertainty still persists due to the upcoming November elections as well as the expected Fed rate hike in December  Moreover  formalization of the Brexit procedures is scheduled to start from next year 
Before finding stocks that are likely to perform well in the still uncertain market  let s take a look at the major factors that impacted the year 
Fed Rate Hike
Just before the year began  in Dec 2015  the FOMC raised the interest rate by 0 25  after seven years of keeping it stable at zero  Moreover  the committee stated that further hikes would take place gradually  as the domestic economic scenario improves  Several times in 2016  analysts and investors expected the rate to be increased further  but so far no hikes have taken place 
A rate hike was particularly expected in the September meeting  post relatively good economic data and hawkish comments by some Fed officials  However  the committee did not raise rates  pushing expectations of a hike to Dec 2016  No hike is expected in the November meeting considering its proximity to the general elections as well as the lack of news conference with Fed Chair  Janet Yellen  scheduled after the meeting 
Brexit
Another surprise this year was the vote results favoring Brexit on Jun 23  While the call was close  the results were highly unexpected  increasing market volatility  The U K  s then Prime Minister stepped down and Theresa May took charge to guide the country through this uncertainty  The country is expected to begin its two year exit procedure in Mar 2017 and until then expectations regarding the economy remain relatively mixed  While most projected the economy to turn sluggish  some economic indicators point otherwise  leaving it relatively unstable 
Oil Prices
The year began with a free fall in oil prices  which remained volatile for a long time  The prices hit new lows in over a decade as supply remained high  Expectations of an output freeze at the Doha meeting of the OPEC nations was also proved wrong as the nations continued to increase production  Moreover  the extra output available globally from Iran  after the sanctions were removed increased supply further  Oil prices continue to be volatile  creating significant impact on domestic companies 
5 Prominent Picks
In such an uncertain environment  it is difficult for investors to bet on stocks that may perform well  To increase the probability of a good return  we have banked on certain criteria that indicate favorable movement of the stock price  We have chosen large cap companies  with a market capitalization of  5 billion or higher  Large cap companies tend to be more resilient and stable even in a volatile environment 
Additionally  the selected stocks carry a  of  A   The VGM score is a weighted combination of Value  Growth and Momentum in a stock  It highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  
Moreover  the stocks we have selected fall under industries carrying a good Zacks Rank  This is important as often a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  As a reference point  the outlook for industries with a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral   and  177 and higher is  Negative  
These five stocks have delivered good year to date returns  which raise expectations for the remainder of the year  Moreover  these stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

21361,242876,NTTYY,5 Bargain Stocks With Exciting EV EBITDA Ratios ,opinion,Price to earnings  P E  multiple  without a shadow of doubt  enjoys great popularity among investors seeking stocks that are trading at bargain prices  A widely preferred approach by value investors is to chase stocks that flaunt a low P E ratio  But even this straightforward  ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few downsides What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Option While P E is the most commonly used metric in the value investing world  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA does a better job in working out the fair market value of a firm  Often viewed as a better alternative to P E  it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and its earnings potential Also known as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is a more comprehensive one than P E in stock valuation  EV EBITDA  in essence  is the enterprise value   EV   of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and

constituent of the ratio  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it strips out non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is undervalued and vice  has a more complete approach

firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the contrary  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  also determines the total value of a company while P E solely considers its equity portion  It is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies with a debt laden balance sheet and substantial depreciation and amortization expenses  Moreover  the ratio allows comparison of companies with different debt levels But EV EBITDA is not without its flaws and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance  The ratio varies across industries  a high growth industry typically has higher multiple  and is generally not appropriate for comparing stocks in different industries due to their diverse capital expenditure requirements So  a strategy solely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired outcome  But you can

21363,242878,NTTYY,5 Utility Stocks Still Worth Buying In September,opinion,"The global market is a little choppy at the moment  thanks to a likely hike in interest rates and the uncertainty surrounding the Presidential Election in the U S   as well as volatile oil prices and sluggish growth in China  Due to these concerns  the World Bank recently lowered its 2016 global growth forecast to 2 4  from the January projection of 2 9  Developing countries that export commodities are having a tough time with soft prices  Naturally  the growth prospects in developing and emerging markets are bleak  Back home  manufacturers are suffering due to a strong dollar  which is increasing the price of their products  If the dollar continues its post Brexit bull run  export prospects of U S  manufacturers could be significantly hampered Utilities have been facing their own share of problems from increasingly stringent emission regulations and rate hike speculations  In Dec 2015  the Fed increased interest rates for first time since 2006 and stated plans to further raise the same as and when conditions are suitable On the brighter side  the U S  economy is seeing definite signs of improvement  which prompted Fed chair Janet Yellen to reconsider a rate hike in the near future  And  as we know  a high rate environment typically hurts the prospects of utility companies By their very nature  utilities routinely seek help from capital markets for upgrades and maintenance of their infrastructure  Even though regulated utilities are known for their cash generating capacity  funds generated from their internal operations are often less than enough to execute long term projects  This means that a rise in interest rates will increase the cost of capital for utilities However  turmoil in the global economy could divert investor focus toward domestically oriented utilities  which are immune to the international market volatility and impact of the strong dollar  The year to date return from Dow Jones Utility Average  DJU  was 15 4   compared with the S P 500 s 6 2   We have considered five utilities that are likely to provide solid returns in September Picking the Right StocksRecognizing a stock with good prospects is no mean feat  But thanks to our new   we have been able to identify a few stocks with incredible near term growth potential Our research shows that stocks with a VGM score of  A  or  B   when combined a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   offer the best investment opportunities for investors Spark Energy  Inc    NASDAQ SPKE   is an independent retail energy services company  The company is involved in the retail distribution of natural gas and electricity This Zacks Rank  1 stock  with a VGM Score of A  registered a positive earnings surprise of 3 50  in the last reported quarter and has returned 39 9  year to date SPARK ENERGY Price

21370,242885,NTTYY,5 Great Price to Sales Stocks For Your Portfolio,opinion,It is essential to assert the value of stocks before investing  Following this principle  investors always compare the value of stocks using various valuation metrics at disposal  While Price to Earnings is the first to cross one s mind when using valuation metrics  Price to Sales has emerged as a useful measure in narrowing down the list of valuable stocks Price to Sales helps to determine the value of stocks that are suffering losses or are in the early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative Price to Earnings ratio falls out of investors  favor  its Price to Sales ratio could indicate the hidden strength in its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify recovery situations or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to Sales is often preferred over Price to Earnings  as companies and managements can fiddle with their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable A stock s Price to Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the Price to Sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So it goes without saying that a stock with Price to Sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth Also  a stock with a low Price to Sales ratio is a more suitable investment choice than one with a high ratio However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and a low Price to Sales ratio is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price to Sales ratio In any case  the Price to Sales ratio used in isolation can t do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book  Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the Price to Sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry  A company with less debt should have a stable Price to Sales ratio Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Zacks Rank  1

21397,242912,NTTYY,Tap 5 Bargain Stocks With Attractive EV EBITDA Ratios ,opinion,Price to earnings  P E  is hands down the most commonly used metric in the value investing world  This straightforward  easy to calculate ratio enjoys greater popularity among valuation metrics in the investment toolkit and is preferred while uncovering bargain stocks  A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase stocks with a low P E ratio  But even this equity valuation multiple is not devoid of shortcomings Why EV EBITDA is a Better Alternative Although P E is by far the most popular valuation metric  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA does a better job in working out the fair market value of a firm  Often viewed as a better substitute to P E  this ratio offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and its earnings potential Also dubbed as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is the enterprise value   EV   of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization   EBITDA    EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In a nutshell  it is the entire value of a company EBITDA  the other constituent of the ratio  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice versa However  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Companies with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another downside of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making company  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  EV EBITDA  in contrast  is less amenable to manipulation and also can be used to value firms that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA side Moreover  EV EBITDA determines the total value of a company while P E only considers its equity portion  EV EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels But EV EBITDA is not without its limitations  The ratio varies across industries  a high growth industry typically has higher multiple and vice versa  and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital requirements Thus  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for true value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5

21416,242931,NTTYY,7 Ultra Safe Stocks To Wait Out Brexit Results,opinion,Stocks closed marginally lower on Wednesday after opinion polls suggested that it was difficult to determine which way the referendum over Brexit would go  With only hours to go for the results  market watchers believe that a vote in favor of Britain exiting the E U  would result in major losses At this point  you would be better off by adding safe stocks to your portfolio  This is why picking value stocks that have a low beta might be a prudent option  Beta measures the tendency of a stock s returns to respond to market swings  Low correlation stocks provide protection during turbulent times as they are less prone to day to day fluctuations Economic Losses for BritainSeveral economists  market watchers and major investors have issued warnings over the economic impact of a vote in favor of  Leave  on the United Kingdom  The latest major figure to speak out about the detrimental economic impact of Britain leaving the E U  has been billionaire investor George Soros A plummeting pound  a decline in household income an even a recession could be in store for the U K  if citizens voted in favor of a Brexit  according to Soros  read    Larger British companies have also opposed the idea of a break with the E U  Most of their arguments are centered on the fact that Britain s imports from the economic zone exceed exports  read     This is why they argue that a decline in the pound in the event of a Brexit could have disastrous effects on the economy Global Impact LikelyHowever  the impact of a Brexit is unlikely to remain insulated to Britain  It is nearly certain that the undeniable and immediate fallout would include a plunge in the value of the pound  This would lead to a flight toward safe haven currencies like the yen and of course the dollar A stronger dollar would create multiple challenges for a Federal Reserve which has just wound up a program of monetary easing and is looking for opportunities to raise rates  In Japan s case  negative rates are already in place and further reductions are highly unlikely   EU Project under ThreatThe not so obvious impact of a Brexit would be similar demands from other member nations  read     Voices from the likes of the Netherlands  France and Italy are already calling for a break with the E U  And a Brexit could provide them with the perfect opportunity to undertake such an exercise Further uncertainty could then be in store for the economic bloc  Naturally  the euro also stands to lose from the events that could follow  Misgivings already exist about the reforms demanded by the ECB in exchange for financial aid  This is particularly true for countries like Spain  Italy and Greece  More immediately  they will be confronted with a flatter yield curve  making debt servicing extremely tough Our ChoicesWhichever way the referendum goes  a significant amount of uncertainty has been created for the event  Markets will breathe a sigh of relief if the  Remain  camp wins  However  the global economy will still face a number of challenges This is why it would be better to pick safer bets at this point  In such a situation  picking value stocks with low beta would be a good option  Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Value Score and Zacks Rank We narrowed down our choices with the help of our new  Our

21418,242933,NTTYY,5 Low PEG Stocks That Are A Good Fit For Your Value Portfolio  ,opinion,Value investing is conventionally believed to be one of the finest ways of investing in any kind of market situation  And this is especially proven during times of market crash or global downturn  After all  Buffet had once said   The best thing that happens to us is when a great company gets into temporary trouble We want to buy them when they re on the operating table  In today s world of economic turbulence  such moments are no longer rare  leading to the enormous popularity of value investing  However  things are not that simple as they seem when it s the investors  turn to pick the right value stocks utilizing the right strategy from  n  number of ratios and metrics available in the market Failing to choose the right strategy that will give investors the perfect idea of the intrinsic value of a stock may lead to  value traps     a situation when these picks start to underperform over the long run as those temporary problems which once drove the share price down may turn out to be persistent To avoid such value traps  Buffet has advised investors to keep a focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock  And here comes the importance of a not so popular value investing metric  the PEG ratio The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings   Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks of using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose  Zacks Rank of 1 Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy

21419,242934,NTTYY,5 Near 52 Week High Stocks Set To Soar Even Further ,opinion,Trading like a pro requires a dependable investment strategy that can help you rake in some good money  Some of the sliest tricks of successful investing are hidden in plain sight which are often disregarded One such tried and tested technique is picking stocks nearing their 52 week highs  as it seldom disappoints when clubbed with the right set of parameters  Why 52 Week High is a Good IndicatorAt the core of the 52 week high investment strategy lies the much debatable  adjustment and anchoring bias   Stemming from a psychological stance  this phenomenon asserts that investors generally use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor  They shy away from buying stocks if they are near their 52 week highs even if there is positive information  Investors think that these stocks may under react to any news and thus lose their sheen This opens up the other side of the argument that such under reaction leaves these stocks somewhat undervalued  particularly in the context of their growth drivers  Investors are jolted awake by encouraging news from these stocks and rush in to take positions  The renewed confidence propels prices even higher  As a result  these stocks begin to soar beyond their 52 week highs  eventually attaining higher price levels  There may be a broad set of factors including impressive sales  robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects driving the stocks up  Recent major developments may also send these stocks soaring Another theory put forward by market watchers and experts is that the price level of these stocks reflects their momentum more transparently than past changes in prices  It means if a stock is trading close to its 52 week high  chances are that it will perform better in subsequent periods  So investing in stocks near their 52 week high is akin to following the momentum strategy  which is based on the understanding that once a trend is established it is most likely to continue However  betting on these high flying stocks without a clear investment blueprint may be risky  There is no denying the fact that these stocks are trading near their 52 week highs and bear the risk of falling fast as the market might consider them overvalued And for that very reason we ve added a few other parameters to devise a foolproof strategy We will screen for stocks which are close to their 52 week highs  but still have strong growth prospects relative to their respective industries  In addition  we ve made sure these stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales With positive momentum in the stock price  blended with strong earnings growth expectations and great value metrics  we believe these stocks will continue their uptrend for quite some time to come A Safe and Sound StrategyCurrent Price 52 Week High     80 This simply measures the ratio between current price to the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading only within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week threshold soon    Change Price   4 Weeks   0 It ensures that the price of the stock has moved north over the past four weeks    Change Price   12 Weeks   0 This metric ensures that the stock has continued its upward price momentum over the past three months we well  Price Sales    XIndMed Lower the ratio  the higher is the benefit for investors as they have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company  P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMed This metric measures the amount that an investor will invest in a company to obtain one dollar of that company s earnings  One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMed This metric will help in zeroing in on stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism  Zacks Rank   1 No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank  which has proved its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperformed the market  Current Price    5This parameter will help in screening

In the second quarter  WTI crude hovered mostly between  40 per barrel and  50 per barrel  making a gain of nearly 26  sequentially  The surge in benchmark crude was also driven by supply outages in Nigeria  Libya  Venezuela and Canada   countries that hold some of the world s major sources of crude 
Improved Job Statistics
As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   upward revision in the U S  GDP growth estimate by 1 8  as well as 287 000 job additions in Jun 2016   as against the consensus estimate of 180 000   has raised optimism in the markets 
Is July Hike in Fed Rates Possible 
Although the rebound in labor market might raise expectations of the Fed refraining from further policy tightening in the near term  analysts remain skeptical as the pay growth at best is modest  We believe that the Fed would wait for the job market to stabilize further before reviewing its policy 
Also  the impact of Brexit on the global economy is yet to be realized and seems strong enough to keep the Fed away from hiking rates

21422,242937,NTTYY,5 Low Beta Stocks To Protect Your Gains ,opinion,The Dow set new records on Tuesday but the two other major benchmarks closed in the red  following dismal results from Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX    Market watchers seemed pensive ahead of further earnings  which are likely to determine the course of market movements in the near future  But the big question at this point is  is the recent set of market gains petering out Though it is difficult to predict whether this will indeed happen  it may be a good idea to protect the gains you ve made recently  The best way to do this would be to add low beta stocks to your portfolio  Beta measures the tendency of a stock s returns to respond to market swings  And this type of stock would be your best bet to protect yourself from potential losses Record Winning Streak for the DowThe Dow ended in the green for the eighth consecutive session on Tuesday following Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   commendable quarterly performance  The health care giant beat expectations and raised its guidance for the year  which eventually helped the Dow post its longest winning streak in three years Reports that McDonald s   NYSE MCD   is teaming up with Nintendo also led the blue chip index higher  The S P 500 and the Nasdaq  however  closed in the red as investors digested a sharp drop in Netflix s shares and lowered expectations of global economic growth Is the Rally Running Out of Steam At this point  the market s fear gauge  the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   has fallen to 11 62  This is usually a sign that all is well with markets  and downsides may not be awaiting investors in the near future  However  one point of view is that market sentiment is at an extraordinarily low level These market watchers are utilizing a measure called the Hulbert Nasdaq Newsletter Sentiment Index  This is a gauge utilized to measure the desirable level of average equity exposure to time markets in the short run  Since this particular benchmark is the quickest to respond to investor sentiment  the index is usually the most sensitive gauge of the market s mood A week after the surprise Brexit vote  the average had fallen to  55 6  which indicates a larger level of short term equity holdings are being shorted  This indicates a substantial level of pessimism  Now  despite the record busting run of the stock markets in recent times  the gauge is at 77 8   This means that a sudden and substantial shift has taken place in terms of market sentiment The moot point here is that swings in market sentiment now take weeks  not months  as was the case earlier  And this level of excitement about the markets  a complete turnaround from June end  can only mean one thing  The going could be tough in the weeks ahead Our ChoicesThe record busting run for markets may have reached its end  feel some investors  Even though you could think that is a somewhat pessimistic view  it may be a good idea to shore up your markets against any possible downside This is why it would be better to pick safer bets at this point  In such a situation  picking value stocks with low beta would be a good option  At the same time  it would be a good idea to pick winning stocks  in case the rally continues  even after a few hiccups This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation   NYSE NTT   provides a variety of telecommunications services within Japan and other countries Nippon Telegraph and Telephone has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a VGM Score of A  The stock has a

21479,242994,NTTYY,Top 10 Asian Tiger ETFs,opinion,Excluding Japan  the area formerly known as the Asian Tiger countries has never been more important  These countries are blessed with excellent demographics and natural resources  Some are industrial powers like Singapore  Taiwan and South Korea while others also offer good commodity plays  like Malaysia  Philippines and Indonesia  But  as with most investing schemes from our view  timing is everything  Japan certainly is in decline  Its debt burdens combined with poor demographics suggest a country that has more long term problems than the eurozone currently  For them these issues are becoming better known throughout the investment world  Clearly most know the markets there have been in a bear market since the 1990 peak with the exception of a few impressive bear market rallies  Nevertheless  large and even small Japanese companies have become multinational in scope and highly dependent on exports  Most are diversified and may do well given their global exposure away from domestic bear markets or conditions The former Asian Tiger markets have more volatility  beta  compared with other more established markets  When markets and global economies are stronger  these markets generally will outperform  and  conversely when global economies are weak they will underperform  The Philippines  Indonesia  Malaysia and Vietnam are blessed with both good demographics  younger population  and are rich in natural resources  Longer term these economies could decouple from other markets given their own domestic demand and needs Lastly these countries particularly benefit from economic growth and demand for resources from China  When China grows so too do these countries and vice versa In this sector there really are only 10 ETFs worth evaluating now  But as these economies grow  and no doubt many will  ETF offerings will expand into various subsectors within each country  beginning with small caps and then moving on to others  consumer  financial  natural resources and so forth  Simplistically  we recommend longer term investors stay on the right side of the 12 month simple moving average  When prices are above the moving average  stay long  and when below remain in cash or short  Some more interested in a fundamental approach may not care so much about technical issues  preferring instead to buy when prices are perceived as low and sell for other reasons when high  but  this is not our approach VNM follows the Market Vectors Vietnam Index which includes companies either domiciled in the

prospects than any other  But the country s equity market has struggled  It should be noted that inflation and currency devaluation have crippled equity performance  Further the economy and country

21481,242996,NTTYY,4 High Yield Telecom Stocks To Cushion Your Portfolio,opinion,"Telecommunications is a necessary utility and its need in both rural and urban areas as well as its role in the infrastructural development of an economy is of utmost importance  The U S  telecom industry has developed into an intensely contested space where success largely depends on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability 
Thus  in order to stay abreast  existing players need to introduce innovative products or merge with other companies despite strict vigil by regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC  
Momentum to Continue
The U S  telecommunications industry is presently riding the growth trajectory and the momentum is likely to continue in 2015 as well  Telecommunications is one of the few industries to have seen rapid technological improvement even during recession  Owing to the significance of telecommunications as an infrastructure product  we expect the overall economic dynamics to shift in the industry s favor 
The rising demand for technologically superior products has been the silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment  Uninterrupted advancement in telecom technologies has helped telecom operators to adopt newer business models in order to boost revenues  These include new pricing plans  a shift from unlimited data to tier based data usage plans  and higher upgrade fees for smartphones and tablets 
In fact  the average revenue per user  ARPU  for most telecom carriers has been on the rise over the last two years  It is also expected to grow over the long term on the back of massive growth in mobile data usage 
Our Choices
While the telecom growth momentum is expected to be maintained in the U S  over the near term  the major impetus is likely to come from the emerging markets of Asia Pacific and the Latin American region  At this stage  we believe investors should choose stocks which promise strong dividend yield and carry a favorable Zacks Rank to cash in on future growth 
The choices could be narrowed down based upon a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  and promising value metrics  Value Score of  A  or  B    The Value Style Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of  value traps  and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount  Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2  offer the best upside potential
