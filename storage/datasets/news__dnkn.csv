1361,222876,DNKN,Have Faith In Rising P E  Play 5 Top Ranked Stocks,opinion,"Wall Street is off to a dwindling start to 2020 thanks to escalating geopolitical tension  Though it may unsettle investors  nerves in the near term  the long term picture of the investing world appears pretty decent  Several market experts are of the view that stocks are   before this bull cycle is over  
Against this bullish backdrop  investors can definitely bet on stocks with a rising P E  Agreed  it is a bit unnatural investing practice  Generally  investors love stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio  The general perception is that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  The simple logic is that a stock s current market price does not justify its earnings potential and therefore has room to run 
But stocks with a rising P E can be equally enticing  We ll tell you why 
Why Rising P E a Valuable Tool 
Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price 
So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals  Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 13 
Here are five of 38 stocks that passed the screen 
Dunkin  Brands Group Inc    NASDAQ DNKN   This quick service restaurant chain belongs a favorable Zacks industry  placed at the top 25  of 250  industries  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

6982,228497,DNKN,KFC  YUM  Announces Plan To Serve Meatless Chicken ,opinion,"Fried Chicken giant KFC  operating under Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM    announced that they are planning on serving vegan fried chicken with the help of Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND    The company will begin trial running their vegan chicken in an Atlanta restaurant on Tuesday  The trial run will make KFC the first US fast food chain to introduce a Beyond chicken item  beating Chick fil A and Popeyes  Beyond Meat s stock has skyrocketed 487  since its IPO in early May  while YUM has gained 15 1  YTD  outperforming the broader food and restaurant market 
Can This Propel KFC on the Homefront  
KFC has seen most of its growth come from its international business because of the tough competition it faces in the US from the likes of Popeyes and Chick fil A  China accounts for 27  of KFC s total sales compared to US sales of 17  
KFC has been contemplating about implementing a meatless option for some time now as they had meetings with major meatless meat suppliers back in May  The company hopes the new meatless chicken can drive some buzz around the restaurant  their same store sales have been relatively stagnant  only up 2  YTD  After a five year turnaround  KFC expects a net annual gain in US restaurants for the first time since 2014  The implementation of meatless options helped Del Taco   NASDAQ TACO   in its time of need  Del Taco saw its same store sales return to growth after introducing its vegetarian food menu 
KFC s meatless chicken will be fried in the same fryers as chicken but KFC stated that they are targeting a more flexible demographic that is trying to lower their meat intake  Ethan Brown  CEO of Beyond Meat  stated  To be able to bring Beyond Fried Chicken  speaks to our collective ability to meet the consumer where they are and accompany them on their journey  
The meatless chicken is set to debut in Smyrna  Georgia and will offer nuggets and boneless wings  A six  or 12 piece combo meal will run about  6 49 and  8 49  respectively  The combo meals are priced at a discount relative to other KFC combos  which will likely drive the trial of the product  Earlier this year  Dunkin  Donuts   NASDAQ DNKN   and Subway began offering Beyond Meat products like meatless breakfast sandwiches and meatless meatballs 
Takeaway 
KFC is hoping the new meatless chicken will revamp its business in the US as the stiff competition from other fast food fried chicken chains have hindered its US sales  KFC is attempting to accommodate its business to the contemporary health conscious consumer  Beyond Meat s test run with KFC can serve as a reminder to investors of the potential the company has with big fast food chains  If the Beyond Fried Chicken product commercializes well  other fast food restaurants will want to get in on the meatless craze  BYND is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and Yum Brands is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

guest experience by retraining workers  technology driven convenience  and more aggressive brand marketing  Roll out of queso substantially spurred sales  Additionally  Chipotle has been working on a new pipeline for its menu offerings On Jan 2  the company launched its first menu innovation called Lifestyle Bowls for mobile and web orders that resonated well with consumers  It generated over 1 3 billion earned media impressions in the first few days of January  Recently  the company introduced new kitchen ovens  which are improving the quality of its latest Quesadillas Notably  it s robust marketing activities  including a combination of brand building efforts as well as transaction driving promotions and advertising  are resulting in a steady inflow of new customers  For 2019  the company s priorities will revolve around the five key initiatives namely  digital system investments such as pickup shelves  digitized make lines  loyalty and delivery  marketing programs focusing on cooking techniques  and menu innovation and operational excellence Meanwhile  the company is aggressively trying to make digital ordering more appealing to customers and more efficient for its restaurants to drive digital sales and retain customers  In the regard  Chipotle redesigned and simplified its online ordering site  enabled online payment for catering  customized online meals and collaborated with several well known third party providers for delivery The second quarter saw particularly strong traction in delivery sales  In the second quarter  digital sales grew 99  year over

7007,228522,DNKN,4 Stocks To Benefit From Boom In Plant Based Meat Demand,opinion,Meatless alternatives have witnessed an uptick in demand of late as more health  and environment conscious US citizens grow increasingly skeptical of the amount of meat they put on their plate  Needless to say  several companies have begun to address this issue  introducing a range of plant based meat products Given the increasing number of consumers switching to a diet devoid of meat products  investors could invest in companies focusing on meat alternatives for decent returns in the long run    Meatless Meat  Can Go Mainstream  Here s WhyPer an by the Food Revolution Organization in 2018  the number of vegans in the United States soared 600  between 2015 and 2018  After all  more consumers are steering clear of consuming animal products with millennials being the primary drivers As more consumers shift to plant based products  many companies are offering the kind of  meatless  meat products that flexitarian consumers seek  At present  Americans consider themselves flexitarian  These consumers tend to avoid meat on the basis of health issues  environmental and ethical concerns  In fact  per the NPD Group  18  of American consumers are trying to consume more plant based products However  although these companies are targeting consumers  who follow a flexitarian diet  the plant based meat products are gaining popularity among other consumers  who also avoid meat  for instance vegans and vegetarians  This is because plant based meat products tend to mimic the taste and flavor of meat despite being fashioned out of soy Following the popularity of plant based meat products  many U S  restaurant chains are now offering the same to their consumers  For example  Dunkin  Brands Group  Inc    NASDAQ DNKN   is rolling out its Beyond Sausage sandwich across the country early in November  And Dunkin  isn t the only one  According to the 2018 report from the Good Food Institute  55 of the top 100 American restaurant chains currently offer a plant based entr e In addition  since big brands are now offering  meatless  meat products  the popularity of plant based meat could grow further owing to its large consumer bases and distribution channels Finally  the products are available across major U S  grocery stores  which increase the reach further  Products by Beyond Meat  Inc    NASDAQ BYND   and Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   etc are quite popular  courtesy of the variety in meat alternative products they offer These aren t the only companies trying to dominate the plant based meat market  even primarily a meat producing company  namely San Diego based Jensen Meat Co is also trying to enter this space  Jensen Meat acquired meat alternatives producer Before the Butcher in June this year in a bid to offer meat alternative products Given such a huge craze  it won t be a surprise if plant based meat products become mainstream ahead Future of Global Plant Based Meat Market Holds PromiseThe global plant based meat market  valued at about  12 1 billion in 2019  is estimated to reach  27 9 billion by 2025  The concerned market is expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 15  during the 2019 2025 forecast period going by  Among other factors driving this market s growth are some segments that offer a significant push to this growing demand  Soy and burger patties segments accounted for the majority of the plant based meat market in 2019  Our ChoicesWe have picked four stocks that are involved in the process of producing plant based meat or use it as an ingredient to prepare other food products  All these stocks are poised for growth ahead  given the plant based meat market s upbeat projection  Each stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

The tech giant is struggling to satisfy growth hungry investors amid the lingering trade dispute between the U S  and China  In the previous quarter  Apple reported that quarterly sales dropped 5  from a year earlier  mainly due to weak growth in China where iPhone sales fell by 17  
The biggest risk that Apple is facing is a possible disruption of the company s massive supply chain system in China if the two countries fail to resolve differences 
Despite these challenges  investors still sent Apple s shares higher this year  mainly encouraged by the company s push to broaden its revenue base by offering new services   Apple stock price has climbed 33  this year  closing Friday s session at  207 74 





The services segment  which includes app store sales  mobile payments and streaming music subscriptions  will be closely watched by investors as the number of iPhones the company sells stagnates 
2  Procter   Gamble
Consumer staple giant Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  is scheduled to report earnings for fiscal Q4 before the market opens Tuesday  Analysts on average expect earnings per share of  1 05 up from  0 94 a share a year ago  Sales for the same period are forecast to have increased 2  over the period to  16 86 billion 
P G s organic sales  which exclude items like acquisitions and currency effects  gained 5  in the company s fiscal third quarter that ended in March  At that time  P G had revised its organic growth guidance for this year to  a solid 4      up from a previous range of 2 4   helped by robust growth in its two biggest markets  the U S  and China 
Despite it being a mature and often slow moving stock  P G shares  which finished the trading week at  114 73  have outperformed the broader market this year  The stock has surged 25  in 2019 compared with the S P s increase of about 20  





What s propelling the maker of Tide detergent  Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste higher is the growing belief among investors that the company s turnaround plan has started paying off and the bearish spell in its revenue growth is over 
To counter smaller disruptive competitors who have started chipping away at PG s market share  the company has been focusing on 10 big product segments to help streamline both focus and profits

The stock  which closed at  234 90 on Friday  has been the darling of investors  surging more than 900  since going public  Behind this massive rally are expectations that the company s vegetable based products have huge market potential 
Beyond Meat s biggest attraction is that its products come surprisingly close to real meat in taste  smell  texture and appearance 
Beyond Meat s second quarter earnings will serve as a key test as investors would like to see evidence that the share price surge isn t a bubble and it s actually backed by sales momentum  Shares have rallied more than 20  in the past five trading days as the company has won another top restaurant partner  Dunkin Brands Group Inc  NASDAQ DNKN  ",2019-07-28,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-in-the-coming-week-apple-procter--gamble-beyond-meat-200446089,200446089

7032,228547,DNKN,Starbucks  SBUX  Reports Q2 Earnings Thursday  What To Expect ,opinion,"Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   stock is up over 41  YTD  But  will this uptrend continue after the coffee giant s earnings report is released after the market closes on Thursday  July 25 
Overview
Starbucks is the largest player in the U S  coffee chain industry  with a The next largest U S  coffee chain is Dunkin  Brands   NASDAQ DNKN   at 21 9   Last year  Starbucks brought in  24 72 billion in revenue  The company currently has around 30 000 stores worldwide  with about half located in the U S  and Canada 
Starbucks reached an agreement with Nestle   OTC NSRGY   in May of last year to create a  global coffee alliance   This deal gave Nestle the exclusive rights to market  sell and distribute Starbucks  packaged coffees and teas around the world in exchange for  7 2 billion  Nestle started by simply selling Starbucks products in global markets  which has produced strong growth  Last week  the two companies announced a line of creamers designed to imitate popular Starbucks drinks  These creamers are targeted to customers who want to make specialty coffees themselves 
Starbucks  largest overseas competitor is currently Luckin Coffee   NASDAQ LK    a Chinese firm listed on the NASDAQ through an   The firm currently has about 3 000 stores in China and plans to have 4 500 by the end of the year  Luckin announced Monday that it has reached a partnership with the Americana Group to open and run stores in the Middle East and India  Luckin s mounting global challenge comes at a time when Starbucks is also trying to expand in foreign markets  creating competition and making investments riskier 
Outlook
From 2010 onward  Starbucks has only had one quarter  Q4 2017  where year over year quarterly revenues and earnings fell  The company s financials show a history of steady  positive growth over a very long period  And these growth numbers are not small  average year over year earnings growth is at 16 13  for the past six quarters  with revenue at 9 27  over the same period 
For this quarter  our Zacks Consensus Estimates predict revenue growth of 5 93  to reach  6 68 billion  Meanwhile  earnings are projected to grow by 16 13  to reach  0 72 a share  Our estimates show earnings for next quarter  fiscal 2019  and fiscal 2020 all with growth rates in the teens  Analysts split their revisions between raising and lowering this quarter  but have almost exclusively raised estimates for the future  as you can see below 
 
Starbucks is also not sitting idle  The company announced just this week that it will take a stake in Brightloom  formerly eatsa   a tech company that offers an integrated digital platform for restaurant brands  Through the partnership  Starbucks will make an investment and acquire a board seat  Brightloom will help to speed up the adoption of technology at Starbucks stores and help improve Starbucks  platform for mobile ordering and payment  loyalty perks  and delivery 
Bottom Line
Starbucks looks set to continue its long history of impressive growth  while seeking opportunities to push even further  While the top  and bottom line financials look stellar  investors should be wary of SBUX s valuation  It is currently trading at a forward P E of 29 86x  while its peer group  containing companies like McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM    is valued at an average multiple of 25 68x 
Starbucks currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   but the stock generally does not jump just on positive earnings reports  so look for figures such as growing Asia revenues and rewards program growth to move the needle  Investors should remember  at the end of the day  Starbucks  business model has worked for the past 20  years and shows no obvious signs of slowing yet

Stocks were lower on Thursday morning as Wall Street digested a ton of fresh news impacting the market 
There was a big headline in the finance sector  as regional banking giants BB T   NYSE BBT   and SunTrust   NYSE STI   announced that they had agreed to a 57  43  all stock merger valued at  66 billion  The deal would create the sixth largest U S  financial institution if it passes through regulatory authorities

7092,228607,DNKN,Why Starbucks  SBUX  Stock Looks Like A Strong Buy At New High ,opinion,"Shares of Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   have surged over 10  since the company posted better than expected quarterly earnings and revenue on January 24  Now let s dive into why the coffee powerhouse looks like a strong buy at the moment 
Overview 
Starbucks  adjusted Q1 fiscal 2019 earnings jumped 15 4  to reach  0 75 a share  which blew by our Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 65  Meanwhile  total quarterly revenues surged 9  to reach  6 6 billion and top expectations  Maybe more importantly  SBUX s same store sales popped 4  to beat our 3  NFM estimate and outpace Q4 s 2  climb 
The coffee chain s comps growth was driven by a bump in larger average ticket size  The company was also able to post same store sales growth of 1  in China amid the broader economic slowdown that hurt the likes of Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Plus  Starbucks saw its rewards members surge 14  to reach 16 3 million 
Since Starbucks released its earnings  it  that Nestle SA   OTC NSRGY   bought the rights to sell Starbucks branded coffee and tea for roughly  7 15 billion  The move helps show Starbucks  brand power  On top of that  investors need to pay close attention to the company s continued mobile ordering and digital initiatives as they will likely prove key in its ability to stand out against rivals like Dunkin    NASDAQ DNKN   and Costa  which Coca Cola   NYSE KO   purchased last summer for  5 1 billion 
On top of that  Starbucks executives said in December that the company plans to expand delivery across the U S  with UberEats  The firm has been testing delivery in Miami and  begin to offer delivery at nearly a quarter of its more than 8 000 U S  company operated stores in 2019  At this point  Walmart   NYSE WMT    Target   NYSE TGT    McDonald s   NYSE MCD    and many others have started to offer delivery in the Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   age 
Stock Price Movement 
As we mentioned at the top  shares of SBUX have surged over the last few weeks  which helps it rest up over 26  in the past year  The company s recent climb also saw Starbucks hit a new 52 week and all time high of  71 54 a share through morning trading Thursday  This is great news for investors after a roughly three year stretch of relatively sideways movement 
Outlook   Earnings Trends 
Looking ahead  the company s fiscal Q2 revenues are projected to jump 4 54  to reach  6 31 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  SBUX s current full year revenues are projected to pop 6 3  to touch  26 28 billion  Peeking ahead to fiscal 2020  the company s top line is expected to climb 7 6  above our current year estimate 
Moving onto the bottom end of the income statement  Starbucks  adjusted Q2 earnings are projected to climb 5 66  and its full year earnings are expected to surge 12 4   Plus  the coffee power s full year 2020 EPS figure is expected to come in 11 3  higher than our 2019 estimate 
Maybe more importantly  Starbucks has experienced a ton of positive earnings estimate revision activity within the last 30 days for fiscal 2019 and 2020  This is a good sign because it means that analysts are more positive about the firm s long term earnings picture  And we know that climbing earnings are linked very closing with rising stock prices 
 
Bottom Line
Starbucks is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  based largely on its recent earnings revision trends  On top of that  the company is trading at 24 9X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  This marks a discount compared to its five year high of 36 2X and its five year median of 25 1X and means SBUX s valuation picture is hardly stretched  even at its new all time high 
Let s not forget that Starbucks is a dividend payer that has raised its quarterly payout by 125  since 2015

stretch of relatively sideways movement Outlook   Earnings Trends Looking ahead  the company s fiscal Q2 revenues are projected to jump 4 54  to reach  6 31 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  SBUX s current full year revenues are projected to pop 6 3  to touch  26 28 billion  Peeking ahead to fiscal 2020  the company s top line is expected to climb 7 6  above our current year estimate Moving onto the bottom end of the income statement  Starbucks  adjusted Q2 earnings are projected to climb 5 66  and its full year earnings are expected to surge 12 4   Plus  the coffee power s full year 2020 EPS figure is expected to come in 11 3  higher than our 2019 estimate Maybe more importantly  Starbucks has experienced a ton of positive earnings estimate revision activity within the last 30 days for fiscal 2019 and 2020  This is a good sign because it means that analysts are more positive about the firm s long term earnings picture  And we know that climbing earnings are linked very closing with rising stock prices Bottom LineStarbucks is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  based largely on its recent earnings revision trends  On top of that  the company is trading at 24 9X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  This marks a discount compared to its five year high of 36 2X and its five year median of 25 1X and means SBUX s valuation picture is hardly stretched  even at its new all time high Let s not forget that Starbucks is a dividend payer that has raised its quarterly payout by 125  since 2015 Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric

7096,228611,DNKN,3 Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Right Now  CMCSA  FB  SBUX,opinion,"The S P 500 has climbed roughly 12  in 2019  driven by growth from tech giants such as Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX    With that said  no matter how long the current rally lasts  it is always a good idea to search for strong companies that look poised to run impressive businesses for years to come  Therefore  we have highlighted three large cap giants that look like buys at the moment 
Comcast   NASDAQ CMCSA  
Comcast is coming off a better than expected Q4 and recently introduced an Apple TV   NASDAQ AAPL   style streaming box that targets cord cutters  Along with the new Xfinity Flex  Comcast s NBCUniversal unit plans to launch a free  ad supported streaming service early next year  Investors should also note CMCSA s cable revenue climbed 5 2  last quarter and it lost fewer subscribers than it did in the year ago period  And Comcast s internet business looks poised to expand no matter what happens because streaming platforms need fast Wi Fi and internet 
Plus  Comcast s Xfinity Mobile wireless business has expanded  Looking ahead  Comcast s first quarter 2019 revenue is projected to jump nearly 20  to  27 32 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  CMCSA s full year revenues are projected to pop 19  to reach  112 41 billion  boosted by its Sky PLC acquisition  Meanwhile  its adjusted full year EPS figure is expected to climb 7 8   with 2020 s earnings projected to jump roughly 11  above our current year estimate 
Shares of Comcast have surged nearly 17  this year  to outpace the S P s 12  climb and the broader media market s average  The positivity has helped CMCSA stock hit new 52 week highs recently  Yet the company is still trading at 14 3X forward Zacks earnings estimates at the moment  which falls below the Media Market s 18 1X average  the S P s 16 7X  and its own five year high 20 3X and 16 9X median  Comcast is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  based on its recent positive earnings estimate revision trends  Comcast also raised its dividend by 10  to  0 84 a share on an annualized basis for 2019 
Facebook   NASDAQ FB  
Facebook s 2018 setbacks have been well documented  Still  Facebook s global monthly active user total climbed 9  in Q4 to reach 2 32 billion  The firm has also seen its Instagram platform become more popular and Mark Zuckerberg recently detailed plans about how Facebook could start to focus on private encrypted messaging  payments  and other services in a move that would see it transition toward Tencent s   OTC TCEHY   WeChat model  Plus  shares of FB have jump over 26  this year  with miles still to run before reaching its 52 week high 
Looking ahead  Facebook s Q1 revenues are projected to jump 25  to reach  14 96 billion  with fiscal 2019 s top line expected to expand by over 23   Peeking even further ahead  FB s adjusted 2020 earnings are projected to climb 17  on the back of 20 6  revenue growth  This would clearly mark a slowdown from 2018 s 37  revenue growth  But investors should remember that last year already represented a major downturn from 2017 s 47   revenue growth  which is often the case when you reach Facebook s heights 
Facebook s recent impressive full year fiscal 2019 and 2020 earnings estimate revision activity helps FB land a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Maybe more importantly  FB could be poised to remain strong over the long haul with Facebook s share of the U S  digital ad market expected to climb to 22 1  this year  according to eMarketer behind only Google s   NASDAQ GOOGL   40   Lastly  FB is trading at 21 2X 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimate This comes in well below its three year high of 44 3X and its three year median of 27 7X  and helps show that Facebook s valuation picture has greatly improved 
Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX      
SBUX stock hit a brand new high of  74 34 per share on Friday and the coffee powerhouse s stock price is up over 15  in 2019  Starbucks also reported stronger than expected results last quarter  The company was able to maintain some growth in China  with its same store sales up 1  in the world s second largest economy amid the broader economic slowdown that hurt the likes of Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    helped by partnerships with the likes of Alibaba   NYSE BABA    Meanwhile  Starbucks rewards members jumped 14  to reach 16 3 million  This is a great sign since Starbucks rewards members  of the company s daily transactions 
Starbucks will remain focused on its mobile ordering and digital initiatives as the industry continues to trend in that direction  The company has also rolled out expand delivery offerings across the U S  with UberEats to help it better compete with rivals like Dunkin    NASDAQ DNKN   and McDonald s   NYSE MCD    Peeking ahead  SBUX s Q2 revenues are projected to pop 4 54  to reach  6 31 billion  with its full year 2019 revenues projected to climb 6 3   Investors should also be happy to see that Starbucks  full year 2020 revenues are expected to surge 7 6  above our 2019 estimate in a sign of continued strength 
At the bottom end of the income statement  Starbucks  adjusted Q2 earnings are projected to climb 5 66  and its full year earnings are expected to surge 12 4   Double digit bottom line growth is also expected in 2020  Starbucks  positive longer term earnings estimate revision activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  right now  And its valuation picture is hardly stretched compared to where it has traded during the last five years  Let s also not forget that Starbucks is a dividend payer that has raised its quarterly payout by 125  since 2015  and currently has a yield of 1 95

7102,228617,DNKN,4 Appetizing Restaurant Stocks To Bet On This Holiday Season,opinion,According to Joel Naroff  TDn2K economist and president of Naroff Economic Advisors  the restaurant industry is likely to witness robust growth this holiday season on account of strong wage gains  Further  National Retail Federation president and CEO Matthew Shay remains optimistic regarding overall economic growth during the holiday season Per a report by eMarketer  consumers in the United States are likely to spend more than  1 trillion on retail goods this holiday season  Moreover  U S  consumer confidence surged to its highest in 18 years in the month of October  per the Conference Board  Consumer confidence index climbed to 137 9 in October from 135 3 in September  Although the index slightly declined to 135 7 in November  consumer confidence is expected to remain strong in the months ahead Consequently  the ongoing economic scenario has offered a conducive environment for growth of restaurant stocks so far this year and the trend is likely to continue through the holiday season to 2019  Notably  year to date shares of the  have rallied 7 5   outperforming the sector s growth of 2 5    Meanwhile  the S P 500 s witnessed a decline of 1 5  Future Prospects Look EnticingThe restaurant industry continues on the path of recovery  According to   growth has been strong for the industry so far this year and the top line momentum is likely to continue in 2019  Comps grew 1  in the month of November  marking the sixth consecutive month of positive sales growth for the industry  In fact  except for a slight dip in May  the restaurant industry has reported positive comps in every month starting March  Same store traffic  which has been plaguing restaurant operators  declined 1 9  in November  indicating a 0 3 percentage points improvement from October Although traffic has been a concern  the industry s top line momentum is supported by strong growth in to go and other forms of off premise sales  Also  so far this year  to go sales grew 9  year over year Key Strengths of the Industry The restaurant industry is getting increasingly dependent on digital and delivery sales  With the ever growing presence of Internet and smartphones analysts expect 25  of all restaurant sales to be generated from digital ordering and delivery over the next four years  This will roughly amount to  200 billion of the  800 billion industry  per a recent report by Forbes A persistent erosion in traffic compared with comps growth indicate that it is only guest checks and not guest counts that are positively contributing to restaurant sales  This also means that consumers are not frequently visiting restaurants and instead are getting increasingly reliant on delivery services Per The NPD Group  foodservice delivery has contributed significantly to restaurant sales over the past five years  The increase of 20  in delivery sales were primarily supported by digital ordering  Consequently  digital sales are no longer a luxurious feature but dire need of the hour  Moreover  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  predicts the food delivery industry could account for 11  of all restaurant sales by 2020 The U S  quick service pizza providers can be considered as pioneers in this aspect as they were the one of the firsts to bolster digital capabilities  Per a recent study by Consumer Reports  spending on dining out has increased nominally  with greater demand for easily accessible  high quality food  Incorporation of better technologies has been a key sales driving strategy of large pizza chains in the United States Further  a tectonic shift has been witnessed in consumer behavior with online shopping being preferred over traditional brick and mortar stores  This has persuaded restaurant stocks to adapt to the changing tide as evident from Starbucks    NASDAQ SBUX   efforts in digital  card  loyalty and mobile capabilities  Starbucks  mobile app is undoubtedly one of the most widely used mobile payment app in the United States  In fact  mobile payments represented 14  of U S  transactions in fourth quarter fiscal 2018 Other high end casual dining restaurants are also deploying technology to enhance guest experiences Picking the Right Restaurant StocksWith the help of the   we have zeroed in on four restaurants stocks  which carry a

7107,228622,DNKN,Starbucks  SBUX  Fiscal Q1 Earnings Preview ,opinion,"Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   has seen its stock price jump roughly 7  since Christmas  along with giants like Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and much of the rest of the market  Now  the question is can the coffee firm s recent run of success continue with Starbucks set to report its quarterly financial results after the closing bell Thursday 
Overview 
Last quarter  Starbucks  global comparable store sales popped 3   This growth was driven by a 4  jump in the average ticket  More specifically  U S  comps popped 4   while same store sales rose 1  in China  Overall  the coffee giant s fiscal Q4 revenues surged 10 6  and its loyalty program s active U S  membership climbed 15  to 15 3 million 
On top of the firm s growing rewards program  which helps create brand loyalty  Starbucks  mobile order and pay unit accounted for 14  of total U S  company operated transactions  Going forward  Starbucks  ability to expand its mobile order business could prove key and help it take on rival Dunkin    NASDAQ DNKN   
With that said  investors should note that Starbucks executives said in December that it plans to expand coffee delivery across the U S  with UberEats  The firm has been testing delivery in Miami and  begin to offer delivery at nearly a quarter of its more than 8 000 U S  company operated stores early this year  At this point  everyone from Walmart   NYSE WMT   and Target   NYSE TGT   to McDonald s   NYSE MCD   have jumped into delivery though hot coffee does present somewhat unique challenges 
Starbucks  delivery business has already grown quickly in the vital Chinese market  through a partnership with Alibaba   NYSE BABA    With that said  some analysts and investors are worried that Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   Chinese slowdown could signal a similar downturn for everyone from Starbucks to Nike   NYSE NKE   
Fiscal Q1 Outlook 
Moving on  Starbucks  first quarter revenues are projected to climb by 6 8  to reach  6 49 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  We should note that this would mark a significant slowdown compared to Q4 s nearly 11  top line expansion  Maybe more importantly  however  our NFM estimate calls for SBUX s quarterly comparable store sales to pop 3   This would match Q4 s expansion and top the year ago period s 2  climb 
Meanwhile  at the other end of the income statement  SBUX s adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to come in flat from the prior year quarter at  0 65 per share  We should also note that the company has seen some positive earnings estimate revision activity recently for Q1 
Bottom Line
Starbucks is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  at the moment based  in part  on its recent earnings revision trends  The company also sports an overall  A  VGM score  driven by its  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  It is also worth noting that SBUX stock moved mostly sideways over the last three years until its summer 2018 surge 
Starbucks is scheduled to release its fiscal Q1 2019 financial results after the market closes this Thursday  January 24  Make sure to come back to Zacks after the coffee powerhouse reports for a complete breakdown

company expects a 60 basis point benefit in 2018  At the end of the third quarter of 2018  48  of the global system was image activated  The company expects 50  of the global system to be image activated by the end of 2018 Deepening Focus on Franchising   a BoonWendy s is benefiting from its transition to a franchised business model  In 2017  the company had several first time builders and doubled the number of franchisees from 2015 by building new restaurants  Though the reduction in ownership has been weighing on the company s revenues over the past few quarters  we believe franchising a large chunk of its system will lower its general and administrative expenses  thus boosting its earnings in turn  Moving forward  the company plans to continue facilitating franchisee to franchisee restaurant transfers through its buy and flip strategy  Such a move ensures that restaurants are in the safe hands of well capitalized franchisees  committed to long term growth  In 2017  Wendy s facilitated 540 Buy and Flip transactions with 130 in the fourth quarter  In third quarter 2018  the company completed nine Franchise Flips  Per Wendy s  it expects to complete nearly 130 Franchise Flips in the ongoing year Rising Costs HurtThe Affordable Care Act  commonly known as Obamacare  would persistently have an adverse impact on restaurant operators as the latter will have to continue shouldering increased labor costs  which in turn  might hurt margins Meanwhile  in order to compensate these costs  the company is taking steps to re align and re invest its resources  Though these initiatives are expected to benefit Wendy s over the long term  the same is likely to increase costs in the near term  denting margins in turn  Furthermore  the company anticipates labor inflation of roughly 3 4  and commodity inflation of around 1 2   This apart  it would also have to intensify its focus on cost savings and driving same restaurant sales in order to cope with these inflations Also  Wendy s would incur an additional capital expenditure in the coming years in a bid to boost the re imaging program  This might lower its free cash flow in the near term  Though the company has transitioned into a franchise based model that requires lesser capital expenditure  it will still take some time to reap benefits  In fact  the company expects a capex of approximately  75

7162,228677,DNKN,Time To Buy Coca Cola  KO  Stock Near New All Time High ,opinion,"Coca Cola   NYSE KO   shares jumped to a new all time high Monday as the larger market sunk on the back of declines from Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    and other giants  Coca Cola is coming off an encouraging third quarter that saw its traditional soda and Diet Coke businesses perform well  But the question is should investors consider buying Coca Cola stock with its shares up 11  over the last month alone 
Q3 Overview 
Coca Cola s adjusted third quarter earnings popped 14  to  0 58 per share  which beat our  0 55 per share estimate  Plus  the beverage giant s global soda volume grew by 2  from the same quarter a year ago  driven by demand for Diet Coke and Coke Zero Sugar  Investors should note that the firm revamped its Diet Coke packaging and launched new flavors in January 2018  
Meanwhile  organic revenue  which excluded acquisitions  divestitures  and currency fluctuations  popped 6  from the year ago period  Overall company revenues slipped 9  to  8 25 billion  which was driven by the refranchising of Coca Cola owned bottling operations 
Looking ahead  the company reaffirmed its fiscal 2018 guidance of at least 4  organic revenue growth 
Price Movement 
As we mentioned at the top  KO stock has surged recently  up roughly 11  in the last month  Shares of Coca Cola have also climbed 19  over the last six months  With that said  KO stock is up roughly 7  in the last year  which crushed its industry s 6  decline  Rival PepsiCo   NASDAQ PEP   stock popped nearly 3  during this same stretch 
We can  however  see from the chart that Coca Cola stock has lagged the S P 500 over the five years  Still  shares of KO hit a 52 week and all time high of  50 24 per share Monday  KO closed regular trading at  49 87 per share 
 
Valuation
Moving on  KO is currently trading at 22 7X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks a premium compared to the S P s 16 6X and its industry s 21 3X average  KO stock has traded as high as 24 2X over the last year  with a one year median of 21X 
With that said  Coke stock is currently trading above its five year low of 16 7X and its five year median of 20 8X  Clearly  KO s valuation picture has been better recently  but it does not appear that stretched at the moment  
 
 
Outlook   Industry Overview 
Coca Cola Zero Sugar saw double digit volume growth in Q3  The Atlanta based company also noted that some of its other non soda brands like Fuze Tea and smartwater performed well  Going forward  the company could get a boost from its recent investment in sports drink upstart and potential Gatorade rival BodyArmor  Plus  Coca Cola is set to purchase UK coffee giant Costa for  5 1 billion to further expand its portfolio beyond sugary drinks 
The company s acquisition  which it expects to close in the first half of 2019  will give the company a solid retail presence outside of the U S  Costa currently boasts roughly 4 000 cafes  with about 2 500 in the UK  The company also sells coffee in gas stations and grocery stores and is expanding in China 
The purchase could help Coca Cola take on Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX    Dunkin    NASDAQ DNKN    and others   Hot beverages is one of the few segments of the total beverage landscape where Coca Cola does not have a global brand   CEO James Quincey said in a statement   Costa gives us access to this market with a strong coffee platform  
The company s recent moves highlight the need to expand beyond soda and also follows PepsiCo s SodaStream   NASDAQ SODA   purchase  This summer  Dr  Pepper Snapple and Keurig Green Mountain merged to form Keurig Dr  Pepper Inc    NYSE KDP   
Q4 Projections   Earnings Trends
Looking ahead  Coke s Q4 revenues are projected to slip by 6 1  to hit  7 06 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company s full year revenues are projected to fall by 10 04  to reach  31 86 billion  But we should remember that KO stock isn t likely to trade based on its overall GAAP top line growth 
Luckily for investors  KO s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop 7 7  to touch  0 42 per share  Meanwhile  its adjusted full year earnings are expected jump by 8 9   We should note that Coca Cola has experienced mixed earnings estimate revision activity over the last 30 days  with its full year earnings trending upward and Q4 headed down  
 
 
Bottom Line
Coca Cola is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  based on its earnings estimate revision activity  But KO rarely misses quarterly earnings estimates  And we can t forget  especially amid market uncertainty  that Coca Cola is a dividend payer that has raised its dividend each of the last 55 years  The firm has paid a  0 39 per share dividend in 2018  up from  0 37 in 2017 
Therefore  KO stock might be one to consider even near its new high as it continues to climb upward on the back of strong momentum

all  right from the top brass to research analysts  If a company doesn t make money  it won t last for long  Consider a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you have earnings This metric is also considered the most important variable in influencing the share price  But  expectations of earnings also play a significant role Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinion on factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings

7174,228689,DNKN,With CFO Maw Retiring  What s Next For Starbucks   SBUX ,opinion,"Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   announced on Thursday that CFO Scott Maw would retire  effective November 30th of this year  and serve in a senior consultant role through March of 2019  Maw  who has been in the CFO role for the last four years  did not offer any explanation as to the timing of the announcement  Considering Maw s relatively young age and short tenure at the firm  analysts were caught off guard by the news 
During Maw s first two years as CFO Starbucks performed very well  with its stock value seeing nearly 73  in growth compared to an industry average of 14 3   But since then things have slowed down  with the stock seeing a 20 7  decrease in value in from February of 2016 to the present  
The news comes just weeks after Executive Chairman Howard Schultz  who oversaw the global expansion of the firm  said that he would step down from his position later this month 
The Facts
This slump is largely due to recent sluggishness in comparable store sales numbers  The firm s Americas segment  accounting for 70  of total revenues  posted 3  comps growth in fiscal 2017  representing a notable decrease from the 6  growth of the previous year  Another concern stems from the company s announcement earlier this month that it would close 150 poorly performing company operated stores next year  about three more than its typical annual numbers 
In its Q2 FY18 earnings report  Starbucks reported in line earnings and exceeded revenue estimates  posting  0 53 in earnings per share on  6 03 billion in revenues  These numbers represent 17 8  and 13 9  year over year growth  respectively 
Still  the company s 490 basis point decrease to 12 8  in GAAP operating margin is a source of concern  as this is not the first decrease in recent memory  However  according to the report  the decrease is part of the firm s larger  restructuring and impairment charges   The company is developing a product mix shift largely toward food as well as spending on efforts to streamline business operations 
Plenty of Reason for Optimism
While investor weariness is justified  there are still some shining points for Starbucks  Specifically  the firm is seeing large payoff on its investments in Asia  It continues to see benefits from its  1 4 billion purchase of East China JV at the end of last year  Starbucks initially operated in Eastern China  its most urban and populous region  through a 50 50 joint venture with local franchiser Uni President group  By the deal s close  this brought its total number of stores in China to 3 100  in late December  
As of FY17  the China Asia Pacific segment of SBUX s operations account for only 14  of its total revenues  In its earnings report  it also highlighted a 54  revenue increase in China to nearly  1 2 billion in revenue and the construction of 216 new stores  Being that China s middle class is set to double from 300 million to 600 million by 2030  there is a significant amount of earnings potential in the region  Starbucks currently operates nearly 3 300 stores in 141 cities in China  compared to over 13 000 in the US   The firm plans to build 600 net new stores per year over the next five years in the region 
Another significant initiative is its global coffee licensing deal with Nestle  under which it will receive  7 15 billion in return for giving it the exclusive rights to sell Starbucks packaged coffee and teas around the world  SBUX currently reaches consumers in about 28 countries  and through Nestle will reach consumers in nearly 190 nations 
Outlook
Starbucks is one of the most recognized coffee brands in the world  For the 12th consecutive year  it was named one of the world s most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute  The ability to get consumers to quickly recognize the brand has already proven quite useful as the firm continues to expand its reach globally  Furthermore  it is a brand that inspires loyalty  Last quarter  it announced an 11  year over year increase in membership of its loyalty program to 14 2 million active members in the US 
It will face numerous challenges moving forward  including the need to replace its CFO and competition from other large coffee brands such as Dunkin  Donuts   NASDAQ DNKN    Yet  while it has recently fallen on hard times with sluggish growth in the US  Starbucks is positioning itself well to capture the trends of an ever changing global consumer climate  Because of its resources and brand recognition  it is uniquely tooled to continue its rapid expansion abroad  which given recent trends  serves as a positive indicator  
Starbucks currently sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   and will be an interesting stock for investors to keep an eye on moving forward

7175,228690,DNKN,Fed  Equities Block Gold s Safe Haven Path  Arabica Remains On The Ropes,opinion,"Gold is unlikely to reclaim its safe haven status from the dollar anytime soon as a relentlessly hawkish Federal Reserve and rallying US stocks turn up the throttle on the USD s strength  leaving no place for gold bugs to hide 
The same may be true for Arabica bulls  who enjoyed just a slight reprieve from selling early this week on worries of Brazilian oversupply  Since Monday s spurt higher  prices of the coffee bean of choice for outlets such as Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and Dunkin  Donuts  NASDAQ DNKN  have fallen back and may remain down as the mighty dollar weighs on demand across commodities  said traders 
Conversely  oil could have its downside limited if weekly US inventories fall for a second straight week  Industry data on Tuesday suggested a US crude build for the week ended July 13  But if official stockpile numbers  due at 10 30 a m  ET on Wednesday  show a decline  then prices could climb from 3 1 2 year lows  The US s West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude benchmark traded near  67 a barrel this week and the UK global oil gauge Brent traded under  72  pressured by a host of bearish fundamentals  including an apparent Trump Administration reversal on sanction conditions for Iranian oil  Some are betting on a crude price rebound by next quarter  with Goldman Sachs seeing Brent at  80 levels by fall 
Gold s Year Low
In gold  the front month August futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange s COMEX division hit a one year low of  1 226 90 an ounce on Tuesday after US  Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said in his semi annual testimony to Congress that with the job market having strengthened and inflation meeting a 2  target  the  best way forward  was to continue raising rates 

Traders and investors widely expect the Fed to raise rates twice more this year  That has sent a horde of speculators into the dollar  the safe haven of choice lately for investors  displacing bullion s long time seat there 
 The dollar has been strong not just because of interest rates but also because of international investors using the US stock market as a hedge to offset losses elsewhere   George Gero  managing director at RBC Wealth Management in New York  told Investing com   Asset allocators are focused only on markets that are performing and gold isn t one of them   added Gero  a veteran commentator on precious metals 
Unyielding Dollar
After a volatile two quarters  US stocks are back to around record highs struck in January  with the tech heavy NASDAQ setting all time peaks Tuesday  The US dollar index  measured against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  hit a five week high in the previous session 

Some gold bulls are counting on the worsening US China trade war and its potential trouble for American industry to hurt the dollar and slow the Fed s rate hike spree  But the greenback has barely yielded any gains so far on the tariff spat between Washington and Beijing  Wall Street Journal columnist Justin Lahart said on Tuesday the impact of tariffs and trade restrictions on the economy were hard to model and unlikely to alter the Fed s plans   While tariffs could slow the economy  they could push inflation higher   even a temporary pickup in inflation could complicate the Fed s response   Lahart wrote 
With COMEX s August gold contract less than  20 an ounce from the previous front month low of  1 208 struck on July 2017  FX Street chartist Flavio Tosti put the next conceivable technical support at  1 220 00  Barring that  support could emerge at  1 204 00   a low from July 10  2017   he said  Anna Coulling says a  full blown breakdown  could take gold to as low as  1 100 
RBC s Gero concurs with the growing pessimism   The heavy open interest in gold options as well as futures amid falling prices indicates that the market prefers the downside for now  
In other precious metals  silver entered one year lows as well this week  while platinum struck a two week trough and palladium hit an April bottom 
Fresh Pounding For Coffee
In coffee  Fibonacci patterns for ICE Futures  front month US Arabica contract  September  indicate immediate support at  1 0919 a pound  and thereafter at  1 0903 and  1 0878  September Arabica settled down 1 2  on Tuesday at  1 0912  after running up 4  on Monday 

Arabica prices are down more than 10  for the year on fears of a bumper Brazilian harvest  Some investors  however  are positive on the market  citing Brazilian coffee exporting group Cecaf  s latest data showing a 10 percent drop instead to 26 16 million bags for June s end season Arabica shipments  Even so  speculators as a whole increased their bearish stance in Arabica coffee to the biggest on record in the week to July 10  official US data showed  after Friday s market settlement 
Shawn Hackett of Hackett Financial Advisors in Boynton Beach  Florida  cautioned of the possibility an end of July frost sending cold air into central Brazil s coffee regions  could disrupt crop progress  Brazil s currency  the real was also nearing a  very credible  bottom pattern likely to boost coffee prices  Hackett said 
For now  though  the strong dollar appears to wield a bigger stick over coffee  said some traders   Possibility is that if lows from Friday will keep   we would go up from current levels   commented Peter Hudec  trader and a regular participant on the coffee forum at Investing com   But currency impact will also tell  ",2018-07-18,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fed-equities-block-golds-safehaven-path-arabica-also-on-the-ropes-200331453,200331453
7176,228691,DNKN,Wall Street Hates The Coke Costa Deal  That s Why You Should Buy It,opinion,"The  5 1 billion deal to buy the Costa Coffee chain by Coca Cola  NYSE  NYSE KO  is just the latest example highlighting the great lengths to which food and drink companies are trying to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer habits that are upending traditional business models across the sector    The former owner  Britain s Whitbread  LON WTB   had said it would spin off Costa  the world s second largest coffee shop chain after Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   But the price Coke offered for Costa was simply too good to pass up    For Coca Cola  the transaction represents a full fledged leap into the global coffee market  where it has little presence currently   Hot beverages is one of the few remaining segments of the total beverage landscape where Coca Cola does not have a global brand   said James Quincey  president and CEO of Coke   Costa gives us access to this market through a strong coffee platform     This move continues Coke s process of diversifying away from the fizzy and sugary drinks that made the company famous  These type of drinks have declined in popularity among increasingly health conscious consumers  The deal is all part of the company s effort to reposition itself as a  total beverage company   As Mr  Quincey said  coffee was among the  strongest growing  beverage  categories in the world  and the company was missing out 
  As the chart above shows  the potential for growth of coffee beverages versus soft drinks is high  So with Coke now entering the market  it sets up a battle royal for coffee sales between the world s biggest beverage maker and the other giants in the sector including Starbucks  Nestl   OTC NSRGY  and privately held JAB Holdings  More on that later  
Consumer Drinks Pressure
Coke s proposed transaction is just the latest in a series by established consumer brands  which are taking divergent approaches in response to the demand from consumers globally for fresher and healthier products    Some consumer companies are expanding into territories or products with brighter growth prospects  Coke s arch rival PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  recently struck a  3 2 billion deal to buy Sodastream  NASDAQ SODA   which makes home carbonation products  This deal came mere days after Coke agreed to buy a minority stake  with a path to full ownership  in BodyArmor  a sports drink maker backed by US basketball star Kobe Bryant    Coke has struggled for years to loosen the hold of Pepsi s sports drink Gatorade business  with its Powerade drink  But it may have struck gold with BodyArmor  Its products use coconut water  have higher levels of potassium than its competitors  do not use artificial colors  allowing the company to market its products as a healthier alternative to Gatorade and Powerade  Now it will gain access to Coca Cola s bottling system  allowing it to increase production    The research firm Euromonitor said that sports drinks volumes were flat last year in the U S   as both of the big two brands struggled  The one real exception  according to Euromonitor  was BodyArmor  Analysts with Wells Fargo  relying on Nielsen data  estimated that Body Armor retail sales had climbed 90  over the past year to  288 million  Much of that market share came from Gatorade 
Both Coke and Pepsi are coming under increasing pressure from JAB Holding  a Luxembourg based investment vehicle backed by the billionaire Reimann family  As part of its international buying spree JAB bought the Keurig Green Mountain coffee business  best known for its single serve brewing machines  in December 2015 for  13 9 billion  And JAB made a more direct threat to the two incumbents when  in January 2018  it struck a  18 7 billion deal to acquire Dr  Pepper Snapple and combined it with Keurig to create a beverage group with almost  11 billion in annual revenue 
The Steaming Hot Coffee Market
Once you get to the global coffee market  the competition gets even hotter as global food and beverage giant Nestle is a major player  Its recent deals in the space include acquiring the rights to sell Starbucks products and taking a majority stake in roaster Blue Bottle 
According to Euromonitor  the global coffee industry is valued at more than  80 billion  and has been expanding at an annual rate of more than 5   Here in the United States   the world s biggest coffee market   most of the growth is coming from a resurgence in the caf  culture among millennials aged 18 to 34 
According to a recent survey conducted by the National Coffee Association  15  of millennials had their last cup of coffee in a caf  and 32  had an espresso based drink the day before the survey  the highest share for any age group  These are the type of consumers Coke is trying to reach through its purchase of Costa 
This data is also why Dunkin Brands  NASDAQ DNKN  is Wall Street s hottest takeover target  sending its stock to all time highs  Dunkin is a lot more than a donut shop today and has pushed into more upmarket coffee offerings such as cold brew and espresso drinks  It will likely be added to the  250 billion in deals in the coffee business over the past six years 
But what about Coca Cola  Was the purchase of Costa a smart move 
Coke and Coffee
Not surprisingly  I am once again in disagreement with the Wall Street consensus  They hate the deal and I love it 
Analysts are saying that Coke knows nothing about brick and mortar stores even though Coke insists  this is a coffee strategy  not a retail strategy  
Maybe the analysts are right  but they are ignoring that the entire Costa team is staying in place  When Whitbread bought Costa in 1995 it was a company that was just a small chain of 39 cafes across Britain to today having 2 400 shops in Britain and another 1 400 in more than 30 countries with a brand that is recognized in most parts of the world 
Costa has recently begun its push into China  where it pitches its drinks to Chinese consumers as a luxury treat  It still has only 460 shops there  so the potential for growth is enormous  Starbucks has 600 shops in Shanghai alone 
Costa just did not have the financial firepower for a major push into China  but now with Coke s financial muscle  it does  It will help too that surveys show Chinese consumers consider Costa to be of higher quality than Starbucks  And the trade war may play right into Costa s hands if Chinese consumers begin boycotting American products 
And I like the deal for its symmetry  Think about it   Coke started out being served as a flavor of syrup in the soda fountains of little neighborhood stores  drug stores  etc   in the late 19th and early 20th centuries  The soda was mixed by black tied  soda jerks  behind marble counters   the forerunners of today s baristas  Then Coke completely moved away from direct contact with consumers 
But now it s back with Costa s coffee houses and its baristas  Just for nostalgia s sake  I hope they succeed  And they might   after all  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  had little brick and mortar experience before it bought Whole Foods and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  does have its physical stores  Coke going back to its roots looks like a winner to me ",2018-09-18,Tony Daltorio,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wall-street-hates-the-coke--costa-deal-thats-why-you-should-buy-it-200344268,200344268

7181,228696,DNKN,Starbucks Crafts Strategies  Announces Store Closure   More,opinion,"Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   announced three strategic initiatives in order to accelerate growth and drive its shareholders  value in the long run  which are also expected to favor both the top and bottom lines of the company 
However  shares declined 1 3  in after hours trading as the company revealed plans of shutting down a few stores in the United States  The company s U S  market is currently over penetrated and stores are cannibalizing each other  Hence  Starbucks is trying to optimize its store in the United States 
Let s take a detailed look at the company s announced streamline strategies 
Strengthening Brand Footprint
Under these initiatives  the company is primarily focusing on increasing its growth rate in the United States and China  Additionally  through Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle  Starbucks plans to expand its footprint in Consumer Packaged Goods   CPG   and Foodservice  adding opportunity for another 5 million points in 189 countries  The company is also focusing on increasing its shareholders  value 
Restructuration of U S  Store Portfolio
Gauging its recent decelerating performance in the United States  the company has decided to augment its U S  store portfolio in fiscal 2019  Management s strategies will include shifting of new company operated stores to underpenetrated markets and a slowdown in licensed store growth  Starbucks announced that it would close 150 U S  stores in the densely penetrated markets in fiscal 2019  This would be nearly triple the number it usually shutters annually  The overall number of stores will continue to increase  but their growth will somewhat slow down   
Moreover  the company s Americas segment  accounting for 70  of total revenues   posted 3  comps growth in fiscal 2017  down considerably from 6  in the year ago period  In the first six months of fiscal 2018  the Americas segment posted 2  comps growth  down from 3  in the year ago period  Consequently  over the past year  the company s shares have lost 4 6  against the  s rally of 5 3  
Innovation in Product   Digital Capabilities to Drive Top Line Growth
Starbucks continues to prioritize product innovation across core beverages while leveraging the strength of its tea and refreshment category  demanded by health conscious customers  Additionally  under its strategic priorities  the company is digging deeper into its digital capabilities to connect with existing and new customers  The company announced the addition of 5 million new digitally registered customers since April 2018 and 2 million active Starbucks Rewards members  The company s loyalty membership had reached 15 million in April  up 13  year over year 
As it is  Starbucks holds a leading position in digital  card  loyalty and mobile capabilities  The company s mobile app is undoubtedly one of the most widely used means of mobile payment in the United States  Strengthening of such digital initiatives is expected to quicken service  increase convenience and enhance customer loyalty  thereby driving mobile payment transactions and spurring traffic 
In fact  the company mentioned that it expects digital initiatives to contribute one to two points of comps growth in the United States in fiscal 2019  Also  the company expects 1  comps growth globally in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 
Efforts to Enhance Profitability   Shareholders  Return
The company believes that the above mentioned initiatives would help it generate enhanced returns  Management expects to return roughly  25 billion in cash to its shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends through fiscal 2020  up  10 billion from the previously announced cash return in November 2017 
Starbucks  Board of Directors approved a 20  increase in the company s regular quarterly dividend and declared a cash dividend of 36 cents per share payable on Aug 24  2018  to its shareholders of record as of Aug 9  2018  This represents the eighth annual increase in the company s regular quarterly dividend 
The company is also trying to improve G A efficiency by consulting third parties to figure out the growing areas of opportunity 
Our Take
While Starbucks  increased focus on innovation and shareholder friendly approach encourages us  it is yet to be seen if the company s decision of shutting down stores will bring any long term synergies or not  Moreover  increasing competition from both upscale coffee houses  and lower priced fast food chains like McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Dunkin  Brands   NASDAQ DNKN   has been a potential threat to the company s top line 
Also  Starbucks is highly vulnerable to the inconsistent nature of consumer discretionary spending  Therefore  the company s strategic priorities are the need of the hour so that it can tread back on growth trajectory

7247,228762,DNKN,McDonald s expands Beyond Meat plant based burger trials in Canada,news,"By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK  Reuters    McDonald s Corp  N MCD  said on Wednesday it will expand its trial in Canada of vegan burgers made by Beyond Meat  O BYND  as the world s biggest fast food chain tests the viability of a broader rollout 
McDonald s initial 12 week test late last year of its so called  P L T   burger at 28 locations in Southwestern Ontario will grow to a total of 52 locations on Jan  14 and run for another three months 
Analysts  rival fast food companies and plant based protein producers are watching McDonald s to see whether the P L T  is popular enough to justify wider distribution  particularly in the United States  its biggest market 
While other chains have already started selling plant based meat   including Restaurant Brands International Inc s  TO QSR  Burger King  White Castle and Dunkin  Brands Group Inc  O DNKN    a McDonald s contract would likely be the biggest and put the plant based meat movement front and center in mainstream America 
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Beyond Meat rival Impossible Foods is no longer trying to win a deal with McDonald s because it does not currently have the capacity to supply the fast food giant 
Beyond Meat shares  which closed up 12 5  on Tuesday after the news  were down 1 4 percent on Wednesday 
ONTARIO TESTING GROUNDS
Graphic designer Jeff McClinchey had not been to a McDonald s restaurant since 1999  But in the last couple months  McClinchey   a vegetarian   has been twice to eat the P L T 
 I liked it  It hit that nostalgic factor   McClinchey told Reuters while shopping at a comic store in London  Ontario  last month 
A report from the Canadian newspaper Financial Post  citing a McDonald s executive  said the test would help the company determine who is buying the sandwich  but that so far the P L T  had the right name and recipe   https    McDonald s confirmed to Reuters that demand for the item was higher in urban areas  and one franchisee with more rural locations opted out of the second phase of the test 
Southwestern Ontario  particularly the city of London and surrounding areas  has long been the  guinea pig of Canada  to test new products  said Gerry McCartney  CEO of the London Chamber of Commerce 
The area  about two hours southwest of Toronto  has the perfect demographic mix as a diverse but hard to win market  according to locals and experts interviewed by Reuters 
Traditionally a farming community surrounded by conservative agricultural and industrial areas  it is close to the United States and has an urban core with more liberal pockets 
It has a big university  as well as a number of residents from Europe and other countries  and even boasts Canada s first 24 hour vegan fast food drive thru restaurant  called Globally Local 
UBS said in December that McDonald s could sell more than 250 million P L T  sandwiches annually if it rolled out the product across its nearly 14 000 U S  outlets  based on the Swiss investment bank s tests that showed McDonald s was selling nearly 100 burgers a day at some outlets ",2020-01-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mcdonalds-expands-beyond-meat-plantbased-burger-trials-in-canada-2055323,2055323

7441,228956,DNKN,Economic Calendar   Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,news,"Investing com   Political rhetoric could hang over the market in the coming week  as investors await U S  President Donald Trump s annual State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday 
The speech comes as Trump begins the second two years of his first term facing major challenges  including a long running probe into whether his 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia  as well as investigations by House Democrats of his presidency 
This week is also peppered with a handful of appearances from Federal Reserve officials  most importantly Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday  as investors look for further hints into the outlook for monetary policy in the months ahead 
The Fed last week signaled that its three year drive to tighten monetary policy is close to an end due to rising headwinds to the economy 
On the data front  market players will keep an eye out on the Institute for Supply Management s  ISM  survey on service sector activity to gauge the strength of the economy 
Meanwhile  in earnings  about 90 S P 500 companies are due to report financial results this week  in what will be one of the last big waves of the fourth quarter earnings season 
Elsewhere  the Bank of England will hold a policy meeting  though no change is expected amid growing uncertainty over the prospect of Britain exiting the European Union on March 29 with no deal in place 
Investors will also be watching for any important developments on the U S  China trade front  with the two sides racing to strike a deal before a March 2 deadline 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  President Trump s State of The Union Address to Congress
President Donald Trump will make his annual State of the Union address to Congress at 9 00PM ET on Tuesday 
Trump signaled on Friday that the speech will include extensive remarks about his standoff with Democrats over building a wall along the U S  Mexico border  the subject of an intense partisan battle that prompted a 35 day partial government shutdown that ended a week ago 
Beyond the wall  a senior White House official said that Trump will outline what he sees as areas where Republicans and Democrats may be able to find agreement  These include a plan to fund infrastructure improvements across the country  lower the cost of prescription drugs and work to resolve long standing differences over healthcare 
An excerpt of the speech released by the White House on Friday made clear Trump would strike a compromising tone in at least part of his address 
 Together we can break decades of political stalemate  we can bridge old divisions  heal old wounds  build new coalitions  forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America s future  The decision is ours to make   Trump will say 
Whether the two sides are prepared to work together in any significant way is far from clear  with tensions still high over the shutdown fight and another deadline approaching on Feb  15 
2  Fed Speakers
A number of Fed speeches will get market attention in the week ahead  as traders watch for further clues on interest rates 
Topping the agenda will be remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell  who will be speaking Wednesday at a town hall meeting for teachers  in Washington DC at 7 00PM ET 
Speeches from Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida  Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester  St  Louis Fed President James Bullard and Fed Governor Randal Quarles will also be in focus 
Last week  the U S  central bank left interest rates on hold and pledged to be patient with further interest rate hikes  It also said it could alter the pace of its balance sheet reduction  in light of economic and financial developments  
The Fed s announcement left market expectations for an interest rate hike this year hanging by a thread  and raised the chances of a cut in 2020  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
3  U S  ISM Services PMI
An ISM survey on service sector activity for January due at 10 00AM ET  15 00 GMT  on Tuesday is forecast to inch down to 57 0 from the previous month s reading of 57 6 
Besides the ISM data  this week s rather light economic calendar also features data on factory orders  trade figures  and weekly jobless claims 
Data released on Friday showed that U S  job growth surged in January  with employers hiring the most workers in 11 months  With key data from the Commerce Department  including the fourth quarter gross domestic product report  still delayed because of the government shutdown  the employment report is the clearest evidence yet that the economy remains on solid ground

The BoE s new inflation forecasts will be watched as a sign of whether it thinks investors are being too relaxed by betting on no follow up rate hike until late 2019 
Money markets have cut the probability of a BoE December rate hike to around 55   versus 62  a week ago 
Besides the BoE  political headlines will also be in focus as investors watch developments surrounding ongoing Brexit negotiations 
With around 50 days until Britain leaves the EU  the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels  as Prime Minister Theresa May s Conservative party remains split on how close the country should remain to the bloc

10535,232050,DNKN,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Papa John s International  Dunkin  Brands Group And McDonald s,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 4  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Restaurants  Part 2  including Papa John s International   NASDAQ PZZA    Dunkin  Brands Group   NASDAQ DNKN   and McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD   Industry  Restaurants  Part 2Link  The restaurant industry exhibited moderate growth in 2017  Per the National Restaurant Association  NRA   the industry generated  799 billion in revenues in the year  up 4 3  from 2016  However  this translates into a growth rate of just 1 7  when adjusted for inflation The industry remains on steady footing  thanks to the strategies adopted to counter headwinds currently hindering it  These include various sales building efforts  cost cuts  franchisee based business models  loyalty programs and  most importantly  increased usage of technology Taking the past trends and long term growth prospects of the industry into account  let s explore the strategies in detail Current Economic Backdrop FavorableA gradually improving U S  economy as reflected in the rise in wages  record low jobless rate and upbeat consumer confidence should give restaurant stocks some push  In February  Consumer Confidence Index reached its highest level since 2000  after a modest increase in January  The index rose 6 5 points to 130 8  Notably  confidence remains high among consumers  and their expectations suggest that the economy will continue expanding at a solid pace in the near term We anticipate this positive sentiment to encourage consumers to dine out more and thereby arrest declining traffic  Moreover  it is to be noted that eating out is one of the items in the family budget that has grown manifold as households get a boost  This bodes well for the restaurant sector and is likely to keep investors  appetite high for restaurants in the rest of 2018 and 2019 Deploying Technology to Enhance Guest ExperienceTechnology at restaurants has become essential   more than ever before   given the troubles plaguing this space over the past few quarters  Hence  restaurant operators are going all guns blazing with their online and digital marketing activities  These will help them to cater to consumers  increasing dependence on and penchant for online and mobile web technology and consequently lure them back While smartphone apps attract consumers  video menu boards in quick service restaurants and tabletop devices speed up sales and ensure convenience  Further  restaurant operators rely on social media for promotions and incorporate Facebook  NASDAQ FB   online review sites  Twitter and blogs aggressively into their marketing mix In fact  mobile ordering in particular is fast becoming a crucial part of many restaurants  plans  given what it can bring in enhanced sales  This is because when using a phone to order their food  customers  on an average  tend to spend more and visit more often  Going forward  mobile ordering will form the crux of customers  experience  rather than just being a point of differentiation Notably  pizza giants Domino s and Papa John s International have been the industry bellwethers in the digital ordering space  In 2017  Domino s AnyWare suite of ordering platforms that allow customers to order from various ordering apps and platforms such as Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Home  Facebook Messenger  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Watch  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Echo  Twitter and via a Pizza emoji on text  grew significantly  Meanwhile  its digital loyalty program   Piece of the Pie Rewards   continues to contribute significantly to traffic gains Papa John s aims to continue making investments in technology  focused on foundational improvements to its digital channels to increase order conversion rate  frequency and ticket average  Further  in 2018  Papa John s aims to completely redesign its digital platform and solutions capabilities  leveraging enhanced data analytics and insights to ensure that its industry leading platforms are sustainable  efficient and effective Though a few restaurants have managed to come along as far as the pizza chains  there are many who have advanced their own apps by leaps and bounds to attract more customers on the go The world s largest coffee shop operator  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty and e commerce platforms to create more revenue streams  In fact  Starbucks  mobile app is undoubtedly one of the most widely used mobile payment apps in the United States Dunkin  Brands Groupis also growing in terms of its usage of digital technology through DD card  DD mobile app  DD Perks rewards program and On the Go ordering  While BJ s Restaurants has started getting positive results from its hand held ordering tablets and slow roasted menu  Brinker is seeing increased efficiency and speed from handheld devices across California Meanwhile  Chipotle is moving aggressively to make digital ordering more appealing to its customers  The company has witnessed consistently positive guest response since the launch of its mobile app  Additionally  since the rollout of its  Smarter Pickup Times  technology  there has been a significant increase in digital orders  Guest satisfaction has also improved As the company s digital orders are made on a second make line  it allows it to deliver excellent throughput and enhance the experience for customers moving to digital ordering  Though these are still early days  the company believes that it is positioned to be a leader in digital  given the momentum and customer reaction and results witnessed so far Burger giant McDonald s Corp  continues to roll out mobile order and pay with a new curbside check in option  It is on track to launch the option in nearly all 14 000 U S  restaurants  Having witnessed continual traffic declines

EPS Surprise    Margin DownOperating margin decreased 490 basis points  bps  year over year to 12 8  in the quarter due to a product mix shift  largely toward food and restructuring costs associated with the company s ongoing efforts of streamlining business operations  Again  higher spending in its store partners  employees  along with the impact of its ownership change in East China added to the woes On a non GAAP basis  operating margin declined 170 bps to 16 2  Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas  Net revenues in this flagship segment were up 8  year over year to  4 billion Comps rise of 2  in the quarter  same as the preceding quarter  comprised a 3  increase in average ticket  U S  comps also grew 2  albeit less than the 3  increase during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Importantly  this is second consecutive quarter of 2  comps growth in Americas  mirroring concerns that its increased promotions somehow failed to attract a huge number of customers Food comps were more than 1  and food has consistently contributed in the 1  to 2  comps range for many years now  This momentum continued in the quarter with food s share of total U S  sales being 22   up 100 bps

operations  new store openings and comps growth Comps grew 3   higher than 1  in the previous quarter  China continued to post impressive comps growth  with 4  improvement in the quarter  softer than 6  in the preceding quarter   The softer sequential growth was attributed to a shift in the timing of the Lunar New Year  Meanwhile  Japan delivered its first quarter of positive comps since the first quarter of fiscal 2017  buoyed by a strong beverage lineup However  operating margin at the CAP segment contracted 570 bps year over year to 17 2  in the quarter  owing to the impact of its ownership change in East China Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA   Net revenues were up 15  year over year at  266 1 million in the segment  The improvement was prompted by higher revenues from the addition of new stores and a positive currency effect That said  comps declined 1   against a 2  decline in the preceding quarter  Operating margin declined 1 360 bps due to a partial impairment of goodwill related to the Switzerland retail business and sales deleverage on company operated stores Channel Development  Net revenues improved 8  to  500 2 million  The growth was driven by higher sales of

10569,232084,DNKN,Dr  Pepper Stock Soars After Keurig Merger Announcement ,opinion,"Shares of Dr Pepper Snapple Group   NYSE DPS   skyrocketed to a new all time high on Monday after it was announced that coffee giant Keurig Green Mountain is set to purchase the beverage maker 
The deal will see Dr Pepper shareholders receive  103 75 per share in a special cash dividend and retain 13  of the combined company  Dr Pepper Snapple shares closed Friday at  95 65 and surged over 30  on Monday to hit  126 63 following the announcement 
The new company  Keurig Dr Pepper  hopes to better compete against the likes of PepsiCo   NASDAQ PEP    Coca Cola   NYSE KO    Dunkin  Brands   NASDAQ DNKN    and Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX    This merger also comes at a time when soda companies are trying to diversify their portfolios as consumers shift away from sugary drinks 
European investment fund JAB Holding helped take Keurig private for  13 9 billion in 2016  This merger will see JAB become the controlling shareholder of Keurig Dr Pepper  while snack giant Mondelez International  MDLZ  will hold a roughly 13  to 14  stake in the new company 
The companies posted  11 billion in combined sales during 2017  Management from both firms hope that Keurig Dr Pepper  with its portfolio of brands including 7UP  A W root beer  and the widely popular single serve coffee systems  will be able to offer  unrivaled distribution capability to reach virtually every point of sale in North America  
 Our view of the industry through the lens of consumer needs  versus traditional manufacturer defined segments  unlocks the opportunity to combine hot and cold beverages and create a platform to increase exposure to high growth formats   Keurig CEO Bob Gamgort said in a statement 
The companies noted that they expect to create  600 million of annual savings by 2021  This merger comes as soda companies face more pressure to offer healthier options  Before this deal  Dr Pepper had been one of the slowest soda companies to begin to diversify its offerings  Soft drinks still accounted for about  of its annual revenue in 2016

entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy   from retail sales to housing  to international trade to consumer sentiment In fact  on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports And while the financial media does cover them  they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading For example  in the Employment Situation report  it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion  and which ones contracted I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them In fact  I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible  But  after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report  I knew the housing market had turned  And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery   for those who knew where to look But the headline number and the obligatory one or two sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile  or paragraph  Well here we are again  with more stock picking insight

10605,232120,DNKN,Restaurants Take The Digital Route  Will It Aid A Recovery ,opinion,In this digital era  as consumers increasingly look for convenience  technology has begun to play an important role in determining customer experience  This digital wave has hit the U S  restaurant space too as an increasing number of restaurant chains are deploying technology to enhance guest experience In fact  technology at restaurants has become essential   more than ever before   given the troubles plaguing the U S  restaurant space over the past few quarters Hence  restaurant operators are going all guns blazing  with their online and digital marketing activities  to meet consumers  increasing dependence on and penchant for online and mobile web technology and consequently lure them back Age of Mobile OrderingWhile smartphone apps attract consumers  video menu boards in quick service restaurants and tabletop devices speed up sales and ensure convenience  Further  restaurant operators rely on social media for promotions and incorporate Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Twitter  online review sites and blogs aggressively into their marketing mix In fact  mobile ordering in particular is fast becoming a crucial part of many restaurants  plans  given what it can bring in enhanced sales  This is because when using a phone to order their food  customers  on an average  tend to spend more and visit more often  Going forward  mobile ordering is thus set to be the core to the customer s experience  rather than just being a point of differentiation Notably  pizza giants Domino s Pizza  Inc    NYSE DPZ   and Papa John s International Inc    NASDAQ PZZA   have been the industry bellwethers in the digital ordering space   Both the companies hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Domino s continues adding to its digital capabilities with the launch of various ordering apps and platforms  The extended ways to order a pizza has thus kept this company in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience  Moreover  digital leadership is helping the pizza giant to expand its brand in the domestic market as well as overseas  In fact  at the end of 2016  the company generated over 60  digital sales in the United States Papa John s too continues to reinforce its commitment toward providing a better customer experience with enhancements to its digital ordering process  Markedly  the company s mobile ordering applications support category leading five simple  secure  and mobile friendly ways to pay online orders without using cash or credit card  In the second quarter of 2017  Papa John s recorded more than 60  online sales mix  of which around 70  was from its mobile channels  and has a long term target of eventually reaching 80  Though few restaurants have managed to come as far along as the pizza chains but still there are many who have advanced their own apps by leaps and bounds to arrest more customers on the go It is to be noted that coffee chain giant Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty and e Commerce platforms to create more revenue streams  In fact  Starbucks  mobile app is undoubtedly one of the most widely used mobile payment app in the United States Nearly 30  of all U S  transactions took place through mobile devices at the end of third quarter fiscal 2017  up 9  from the year ago quarter  Currently  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company is introducing many technology innovations to further strengthen its brand  improve efficiency and in store execution and increase profitability Dunkin  Brands Group  Inc    NASDAQ DNKN   is also growing in terms of its usage of digital technology  Dunkin  Donuts  mobile ordering service   On the Go   is available nationwide exclusively for Dunkin  Donuts DD Perks Rewards Program members  This ordering service gives the company the power to drive customer loyalty and boost efficiency as well as speed of service at its restaurants  Again  in August 2016  Baskin Robbins  launched a mobile app with a variety of interactive features Meanwhile  in order to catch up with established mobile ordering offerings from competitors  burger giant McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD   has also begun testing mobile order and pay capabilities on its app in the United States  The company is thus set to launch the option in nearly all 14 000 U S  restaurants and 6 000 others in the UK  Canada  France  Germany  Australia and China by the end of this year Both Dunkin  Brands and McDonald s currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Bottom LineThe restaurant industry s sales trends in recent quarters have been strained given the soft consumer spending environment However  often a rising tide lifts all boats in an industry as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that drive securities across the board  This could happen in the restaurants space as well  Increasing focus of operators on mobile ordering to cater to ever changing wants and needs of time crunched customers could lift the industry from its current position at the bottom 14  out of the over 250 Zacks categorized industries More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a

Dunkin  Brands  revenues in the quarter increased 8 2  year over year to  224 2 million  The improvement was on the back of a rise in franchise fees and royalty income driven by system wide sales growth as well as a boost in rental income  Also  an increase in other revenues backed by license fees related to Dunkin  Donuts K Cup pods and ready to drink bottled iced coffee  along with increased transfer fee income contributed to the same  The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  214 million by 4 9  in the reported quarter 
Inside the Headline Numbers
Dunkin  Brands operates through its Dunkin  Donuts and Baskin Robbins brands 
Markedly  the company s system wide sales increased 3 3   lower than 4 6  growth recorded in the prior quarter 
Dunkin  Donuts
Dunkin  Donuts U S  reported revenues of  165 1 million  which reflects an increase of 8 3  over the prior year quarter  The upside can be attributable to higher royalty income and rental income as well as an increase in franchise fees and other revenues  partly offset by a decrease in sales at company operated restaurants 
Comps increased 0 6  in the Dunkin Donuts U S  division comparing unfavorably with 2  growth in the prior year quarter but slightly better than 0 5  growth in the preceding quarter 
Comps at Dunkin  Donuts International division also increased 1 3   as against a 1 4  decline in the prior year quarter  In fact  the figure compared unfavorably with the decline of 2 8  in the preceding quarter too 
Baskin Robbins
Baskin Robbins U S  revenues were down 0 2  from the prior year quarter to  13 8 million  The downtrend was mainly due to lower sale of ice cream and other products  besides lower other revenues 
Comps decreased 0 4  in the Baskin Robbins U S  division  comparably better than 0 9  decline in both the year ago quarter and in the last quarter 
At Baskin Robbins International division  comps declined 4 3   worse than the 2 9  slump in the prior year quarter and 3 3  growth in the prior quarter 
Operating Margin
Adjusted operating income rose 11 5  from the year ago quarter to  127 9 million mainly as a result of higher revenues  The upside was partly offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses  Meanwhile  adjusted operating income margin was up 170 basis points to 57 1  
Store Update
In the quarter under review  Dunkin  Brands opened 137 net new restaurants worldwide  These include 67 net new Dunkin  Donuts U S  locations  18 net new Dunkin  Donuts International locations  11 net new Baskin Robbins U S  locations and 41 net new Baskin Robbins International outlets 
Additionally  Dunkin  Donuts U S  franchisees remodeled 88 restaurants while Baskin Robbins U S  franchisees renovated 24 outlets 
Guidance
For 2017  Dunkin  Brands continues to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of  2 40 to  2 43 and maintains the projection of mid to high single digit growth in adjusted operating income 
Furthermore  the company anticipates low to mid single digit revenue growth  In fact  Dunkin  Brands projects low single digit comps growth for Dunkin  Donuts U S   in line with previous expectation  On the flipside  slightly negative comp sales continue to be anticipated for Baskin Robbins U S  division 
Notably  about 30 Dunkin  Donuts U S  restaurants that were scheduled to open in 2017 will now open in 2018  This is because of the two major hurricanes that made landfall in the United States during the third quarter 
Currently  Dunkin  Brands carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ",2017-10-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dunkin-brands-dnkn-misses-on-q3-earnings-beats-revenues-200221424,200221424
10611,232126,DNKN,Is McDonald s  MCD  Growth Sustainable ,opinion,"McDonald s   NYSE MCD   last reported results were encouraging with the company bettering our expectations on both top and bottom lines  Shares are also trending up as seen in the chart below 

But to understand whether this was just a one time thing or part of a broader recovery  let s look for a moment at what was bothering the company in the first place 
The way I see it  there were two main problems that led to the decline in its share of the market from 17 5  five years ago to 15 1  last year  according to Euromonitor  The first was an inability to capture an equal share of millennial traffic as it had of earlier generations  The second is related to the persistent weakness in Asian markets  particularly China 
Of course  strategic refranchising makes headline numbers erratic and comparisons difficult because closing down company owned stores is a big hit to revenues that can t be offset by the 6  commission on sales from franchised stores  But at the end of the day  it makes sense  because both capital and operational expenses are thus taken out  with a resultant positive impact on profitability 
In this respect  other fast food chains have already moved to a model where around 95  of the stores are franchised  so McDonald s  being slightly late to react  will continue to enjoy some near term positive impact that may not be seen in the others 
Targeting Millennials
Millennials are generally more concerned about health  convenience  responsible sourcing and freshness of ingredients  And these are areas the company is doubling down on 
In what is a complete reversal of earlier policy  management announced the intention to use fresh beef instead of frozen patties  Being somewhat more difficult to handle  this increases the risk of microbe buildup and food borne disease  but the strategy has given Chipotle Mexican Grill   NYSE CMG   an advantage so it s worth trying out  McDonald s isn t taking this to all products at once  which sounds like a good idea   
Other menu changes include a reduction in the use of artificial preservatives  colors and flavors  HFCS free buns and antibiotics free chicken  in addition to the Premium Salads refresh  the margarine replacement with butter in Egg McMuffins  milk products from growth hormone free cows and localized menu options that were announced earlier  In the pipeline is 100  cage free eggs by 2025 in the U S  and Canada 
On the convenience side  the company is working on putting up digital sign boards  facilitating mobile ordering  tables with serving staff as in fast casual restaurants in some places  curbside service and delivery options both by its own staff and through partnerships with companies like GrubHub   NYSE GRUB    It will also have 2 500 Experience of the Future  EOTF  stores by year end  meaning that that s the number of stores that will have Samsung  KS 005930  tablets on the table or in kiosks that customers can use to order or communicate with staff 
Stealing from the Competition
McDonald s figures that not everyone is that health conscious however  so it seeks to lure in the diet cheaters as well  Not to mention those that would otherwise have gone to a Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   or a Dunkin    NASDAQ DNKN   outlet instead  In the 2 5 PM timeframe that has always been quiet for quick service restaurants  McDonald s is laying out croissants  muffin tops and a new sundae topping station for ice cream lovers  It also has special offers on drinks that can be purchased for as low as  1 2 
Plus there are seasonal themed coffees and environmentally friendly coffee beans  a page out of Starbucks   For this purpose  McDonald s is getting 12 000 new espresso machines  store redesigns and stepping up marketing efforts  The goal is clear  McDonald s may be looking out for the health conscious  but it isn t about to dump those wanting to indulge 
Looking for Growth in China
China is part of McDonald s  fast growing  segment  but it hasn t been growing too fast of late  Changing customer perceptions following the stale meat scandal had a notable impact on not only McDonald s but also on Yum Brands   NYSE YUM    Chinese fast food chains in the meantime have gained some ground  Families in particular have moved on from Brand America to other things like food quality  so they are frequenting the fast casual segment these days  But office goers are reportedly coming back 
McDonald s isn t taking chances  Just as it has done in other Asian markets like Japan  3 000 outlets   South Korea  600  and Taiwan  400   the company is transferring an 80  interest in 2 000 Chinese outlets to CITIC Limited  CITIC Capital Partners and The Carlyle Group  NASDAQ CG  for 10 years  In return  it s getting a cool  2 08 billion from the largest franchisee outside the U S 
There are ambitious plans afoot  with the group targeting double digit growth in each of the next five years by increasing the number of restaurants from 2 500 to 4 500  By 2022  it also intends to bring delivery hub coverage to over 75  of restaurants  This therefore looks like a very good deal by which McDonald s is refranchising the business  acquiring local talent and catering to local preferences in a highly profitable way   
Last Words
To ensure that all goes smoothly  McDonald s has brought in Morgan Flatley  formerly CMO of Global Nutrition at Pepsico  NYSE PEP   responsible for getting Gatorade back to sustained growth   as U S  Chief Marketing Officer  Farhan Siddiqi  as Head of U S  Digital  formerly worked at Bank of America  NYSE BAC   Target and GE   and Linda Van Gosen  formerly VP at Startbucks  responsible for Starbucks Evenings  VP of Brand Strategy  Insights and Menu Innovation at TGI Friday s and VP of Product Innovation at Chili s Grill   Bar  as new Head of U S  Menu 
Given the above and the possibility of President Trump s tax reforms kicking in  Mc Donald s is set for a rebound  So if results are beginning to look up at McDonald s it s very likely an indication of more to come 
McDonald s shares carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   But you can see

 1  Fundamental Points  Cheesecake Factory CAKE StockWho are they 
The Cheesecake Factory was founded by Oscar and Evelyn Overton in Woodland Hills of Los Angeles in 1972  Between 1972 and the late 1980s the Cheesecake Factory had expanded and succeeded financially  comprising of 4 restaurants and providing fast food  cheesecakes and short order items to the clients  In the 1990s the founders decided to operate beyond Southern California and eventually came up operating more than 200 restaurants in over 36 states  As of now  there are restaurants located globally in areas such as Hong Kong  Mexico City  Dubai  and Shanghai

Who are their competitors Cheesecake Factory possesses a unique position in the industry of casual dining services  Consequently  it is difficult to be compared with other companies 
However  we have included some of the most direct ones  starting with Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   which possesses almost a total of  80bn of Market Cap and approximately  3bn of Net Income  Dunkin Brands Group Inc  NASDAQ DNKN  and  interestingly  McDonald s  NYSE MCD   NYSE

The initial public offering of Cheesecake Factory CAKE stock took place in September 1992  Since then  and except for the global financial crisis period  it has been gaining ground and has an upwards sloped movement in general  with a record high of  64 14 price in April 2017  The company has a strong balance sheet and a minimal net debt position  which explains the really low cost of capital  WACC   It generates cash that adequately covers debt expenses  capital expenditures and dividend payments  so it can be considered really trustworthy and solvent company 
The fact that its net debt position is so low  makes the company attractive to buyers  since lower debt means lower default risk  meaning higher growth expectancy and profitability  One can say that CAKE is a growing stock if you see the Max charts since 1992  Today  as of 11 01 2017  the company is expected to report earnings after market close and the report will be for the fiscal quarter ending September 2017 
This brings us to the second point of the IDDA  technical analysis 
2  Technical Points  Cheesecake Factory CAKE Stock AnalysisAfter reaching a record high price of  67 26 in May 2017  Cheesecake Factory CAKE stock price saw a massive pullback  By August 2017  it dropped all the way to the lower bad of the Ichimoku cloud  testing below  40  However  on the monthly Ichimoku Kynko Hyo setup  the cloud appeared to provide support After a hammer Doji candlestick formation in August  the market reversed to a strong bullish sentiment  creating a bullish engulfing 

Cheesecake Factory CAKE Stock Technical Analysis   Monthly Timeframe
This is not the first time Cheesecake Factory CAKE stock price has behaved this way  After a long uptrend from 1997 to 2006  the share price saw a similar type of correction well into 2009  However  the stock was able to recover and conquer new highs by 2017  However  this doesn t mean that we won t see further drops in the medium term before the stock price picks up again 
Daily Time Frame  On the daily chart  we can see that the stock price is trapped inside the Ichimoku cloud  It was unable to break above it during its first round of correction in October  Ichimoku s Kijun line has crossed below the Tenkan on the other hand  So although the future cloud appears to be bullish  we are seeing a short term mixed signal for the Cheesecake Factory CAKE stock price 
Cheesecake Factory CAKE Stock Technical Analysis   Daily Time frame 3  Market SentimentFour Wall Street analysts rate the Cheesecake Factory CAKE Stock with  Buy   One rates it with  Sell  and eleven of them rate it with  Hold   Moreover  Piper Jaffray maintained the stock with  Buy  rating in their latest report  Americans love eating out  so it is possible that revenues will be stable and profits will be generated in the upcoming years by Cheesecake Factory 
Casual dining demand derives from the fundamental human need for nutrition  Operating a business in such an industry increases demand  as long as the quality of the products and services provided meet and exceed the requirements  Consequently  if the company continues to operate at such a high level of quality and services  I would suggest company growth and market capitalization expansion in the short term future

 While we remain the number one retailer of donuts in the country  as part of our efforts to reinforce that Dunkin  Donuts is a beverage led brand and coffee leader  we will be testing signage in a few locations that refer to the brand as simply  Dunkin   the company said 
This follows news that Dunkin  Donuts will simply its menus at 1 000 locations by October  Afternoon sandwiches and some bagel and muffin varieties will be eliminated as the company works to make the restaurants  simpler and easier to operate   according to President David Hoffman 
Dunkin  Brands chairman and CEO Nigel Travis said that these new choices are a part of a larger strategy to  transform Dunkin  Donuts U S  into a beverage led  on the go brand  
Travis said on Thursday that delivery will dominate the food industry in the coming years   The whole industry is under some pressure from changing demand   he said   Consumers are demanding it instantly  they want it delivered  they re pressured for time  
To address this new trend  Dunkin  Donuts has increased the number of new franchises equipped with drive through windows by fifteen percent  The company has also announced a plan to implement curbside pickup at many of its locations 
 We are giving the consumer everything they re looking for   Travis said

10632,232147,DNKN,What s In The Cards For J M  Smucker  SJM  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   is set to report fiscal first quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Aug 24  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this food products manufacturerwill be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  The company delivered an average earnings beat of 4 00  in the trailing four quarters 
However  fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results of Smucker failed to impress investors  While earnings during the quarter fell 19  year over year due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits  sales dipped 1  due to lower net price realization 
The dismal quarterly performance was also reflected in the share price performance of the company  If we look into the company s last six months performance  we will notice that shares of Smucker underperformed the   In the said time frame  shares of the company have declined 13 4   compared with the industry s fall of 6 2   Notably  the industry is part of the bottom 28  of the Zacks Classified industries  185 out of the 265   The broader  sector  which is at top 25  of the Zacks Classified sectors  4 out of 16   has increased 2 5  in the said time frame 

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Which Way are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has declined 3 0  over the last 30 days and is currently pegged at  1 61 per share  which is also down 13 4  from  1 86 per share delivered in the year ago quarter  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  1 82 billion  almost in line with the prior year period Estee Lauder Companies  Inc   The  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Factors to Consider
Of late  the U S  Retail Coffee segment  which is Smucker s biggest revenue generating segment  is going through a rough patch  Owing to escalating coffee costs  Folgers brand has been witnessing reduced volumes  Not only this  Smucker s Pet Food business has also been facing several challenges  Heightened competition from premium brands and challenges in dry dog food against a deflationary macro environment is weighing on Kibbles  n Bits brand s performance  Sourcing challenges have also posed a concern in this segment 
The introduction of Nature s Recipe premium pet food in second quarter fiscal 2017 is anticipated to stabilize Kibbles  n Bits brand  as well as benefit the entire dog food portfolio  The acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brand and the launch of Dunkin Donuts K cup pods are also fueling sales  Notably  Dunkin Donuts is part of Dunkin  Brands Group  Inc    NASDAQ DNKN   
Smucker also remains hopeful that its cost reduction initiatives  combined with the restructuring and innovation related efforts  would improve the company s performance in the near term  However  the company expects earnings to decline due to softness in the coffee and pet foods segments  moving ahead  Smucker s international business performance also remains under pressure due to currency headwinds 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Smucker is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Smucker has an Earnings ESP of  1 01  as the Most Accurate estimate of  1 60 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 61 per share  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  its  1 01  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Conversely  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
Stocks with Favorable Combination
Here are some companies in the consumer staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
SunOpta  Inc    NASDAQ STKL   has an Earnings ESP of  33 3  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Est e Lauder Companies  Inc    NYSE EL   has an Earnings ESP of  2 03  and a Zacks Rank  3

Skechers  NYSE SKX    Apparel  The shoemaker was a hidden gem in 2015 but a rough fiscal Q4 2015 started a tailspin that would last for the better part of 2016  The tide finally turned last week when CEO Robert Greenberg snapped up 500 000 shares and one analyst at Buckingham decided to upgrade the stock from neutral to buy  In response to the news shares jumped 19  and look well on their way to reversing the stock s year long losses  Fundamentally speaking   still remains challenged given the evolving retail environment and increasing competition from Nike  NYSE NKE  and Under Armour  NYSE UA   Another earnings season blunder will likely send this stock back to the bottom  but until then investors can rejoice in their gains  Forcerank user s pushed the shoe retailer up to third in the retail contest after multiple weeks of being the worst ranked 
JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Investment Banks  The entire financial sector has boomed in the month following Trump s shocking election victory  Shares of the Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF   which tracks major banks and financial institutions  are up 18 5  over the past 30 days after a relatively flat year beforehand  No bank has benefited more than Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  though  The stock is up nearly 26  since the election with no signs of dropping off anytime soon  On balance volume and the MACD continue to form new peaks as shares make new 52 week highs  Forcerank user s positioned the investment bank atop the financial contests with an average ranking of 3 6  compared to 4 8 the week prior  Investors would be wise to remain cautious on  though given that the relative strength index has broken 80  the threshold that indicates a stock is overbought 
Time Warner s  NYSE TWX    Media  Shares have soared in the past 3 months after AT T  NYSE T  agreed to purchase  for  85 billion  marking one of the largest deals in history  Many aspects of the deal are still under scrutiny by regulators that believe it creates a media monopoly  Even though the arrangements of the merger are pending approval the stock continues to take out previous resistance levels  This is supported by steadily improving on balance volume and MACD technical indicators  Forcerank users are also enthusiastic that TWX can continue to push higher  The media conglomerate ranks highest in its respective contest this week  sporting an average user rank of 4 from 5 33 the week prior 
Dunkin Donuts  NASDAQ DNKN    Restaurants  Shares of the coffee maker have edged higher this year despite a slew of downgrades and perpetually weak business fundamentals  Whats helped  turn the corner is a wide range of partnerships and new menu items that continue to drive foot traffic  Some of its most notable partners include Smuckers  NYSE SJM   Kellogg s  NYSE K  and the NHL all of which help promote the Dunkin brand  Meanwhile the departure of Howard Schultz as Starbuck s CEO will help close the gap that had otherwise been growing in recent years  From a technical standpoint the stock appears well positioned to make future gains  The stock currently trades above its December pivot point which typically indicates ongoing bullish sentiment  Given the recent happenings surrounding DNKN  Forcerank users decided it was time to push them above Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  in the restaurant contest  Average user rank came in at 3 4 compared to 4 87 posted last week

10661,232176,DNKN,Hope For The New Year,opinion,"In the early decades of the 19th century  a new cultural and philosophical movement emerged that embodies all that makes America great  Led chiefly by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau  American transcendentalism praises the purity of the individual and stresses the importance of self reliance 

 The great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude   Emerson wrote 

I recognized these uniquely American values early on when I made the move from Canada to Texas  Individualism  non linear thinking  a rebellious streak without them  the U S  might not have been the birthplace of world changing innovations such as the locomotive  automobile  airplane and microprocessor 
Today we have these same values to thank for the creation of Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and other tech giants  without which we can hardly imagine our lives now 
They ve also helped make many people fabulously wealthy  Of the 400 Americans on Forbes  wealthiest list  about two thirds can be labeled as self made  including Jan Koum  a Ukrainian immigrant raised on food stamps who became an overnight billionaire when he  to Facebook in 2014 
Other countries have little choice but to emulate America s economic and cultural biosphere that allows such innovations to flourish  In an effort to become a leader in autonomous driving  Germany based Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  is currently in the process of recruiting as many as 1 000 experts in artificial intelligence  virtual reality and big data many of whom  and other American tech hubs  According to Volkswagen Chief Information Officer Dr  Martin Hoffman  research teams in Berlin and Munich  work the Silicon Valley way  We have brought the Valley to Volkswagen  with over 20 experts from San Francisco and Boulder  Colorado  
As I ve pointed out many times before  the reason Silicon Valley must be imported from the U S  instead of built in house is largely because the European Union s crushing regulations and policies of envy stand in the way of ingenuity and entrepreneurship  Their best brains  therefore  end up in the U S   the land of opportunity 

 If anybody believes Europeans will create a better business environment than Americans  they re completely dreaming   Mark Tluszvz  CEO of a Luxembourg based venture capitalist firm    We don t have this in our culture  

It s essential we don t lose it in our culture  either  Many U S  lawmakers and bureaucrats  however  seem intent on significantly weakening our ability to innovate and stay competitive  The more rules and layers of regulations that businesses must contend with  the more the U S  will resemble Brussels 
We can t allow that to happen 

 Any fool can make a rule  and every fool will mind it   Thoreau sagely wrote nearly 200 years ago 

Although  fool  might not be the word I would use  it must be recognized that the U S  became the innovative powerhouse it is today not because of rules but because of the values of individualism espoused by the transcendentalists all those years ago 
Trump Pushing Back on New Rules I m convinced this is one of the key reasons why U S  voters elected Donald Trump  despite his rough edges  Trump has pledged to streamline or altogether eliminate many financial regulations that have stymied the creation of capital over the years  from Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform to the Sarbanes Oxley Act  SOX   We add can to this list the Department of Labor s  DOL  new Fiduciary Rule 
Signed by President George W  Bush  SOX seeks to prevent massive corporate fraud such as we saw from Enron and WorldCom in the early 2000s  Although a noble mission  SOX has had the unintended consequence of barring small to medium public companies from getting ahead  It s also prevented retail investors from getting in on the ground floor  Because the requisite internal control procedures are so costly and cumbersome necessitating additional compliance and accounting positions  not to mention hundreds of hours spent on compliance driven tasks smaller firms are inevitably at a disadvantage 
As a result  many small to mid sized companies are delaying going public  or avoiding it altogether  to escape the regulatory burden  Before SOX  there were an average 528 IPOs a year  Since it was enacted  that number has fallen to 135  a decline of nearly 75 percent 

As for Dodd Frank  signed by President Barack Obama  market experts ranging from Warren Buffett to Alan Greenspan support its repeal  with Buffett saying the legislation  has taken away the Federal Reserve s ability to act in a crisis   Many banks have done away with free checking  giving lower income customers fewer and fewer banking options 
Joining the chorus in calling for deregulation is billionaire CEO of Koch Industries  Charles Koch  Speaking to ABC s  This Week  back in April  he called our political and economic system rigged  in favor of  multibillion dollar  companies like ours   and criticized  corporate welfare that benefits established companies and makes it difficult for somebody to get started  
Protecting the Little Guy  These rulings  among others  have been detrimental to the formation of capital  especially for the little guy  whom they purport to be protecting 
But it doesn t exactly help or protect the little guy if his investment  banking and business options are dramatically limited  See  I shared with you back in July  which shows how retail investors have been locked out of participating in the best performing asset classes 
Or consider the DOL s new Fiduciary Rule  When it goes into effect in April 2017  it will inevitably limit the number of investment products available to retail investors  The ruling states that all retirement planners  advisors and broker dealers must now  act in the best interests of clients  and charge only  reasonable  fees  This all sounds fine  but what s naturally going to happen is financial professionals in an effort to remain compliant with the rule will recommend only the least expensive products  regardless of whether they re a good fit  Many mutual funds which might be better performing but have higher expenses than other investment vehicles will fall off of brokerage firms  platforms 
It would be like the DOL telling consumers they can only shop at Walmart  NYSE WMT  and buy their coffee from Dunkin Brands Group Inc  NASDAQ DNKN  because anything more expensive Target Corporation  NYSE TGT  or Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   say is  riskier   even though they re of higher quality 
This type of anti capitalist mindset is expected in the EU  not the U S  Trump s win certainly puts a target on the DOL s Fiduciary Rule  which he has pledged to repeal  but like Sarbanes Oxley and Dodd Frank  we ll have to wait and see 
And Yet  Business Owners Are Optimistic Whether Trump can succeed at reversing some of these rules remains to be seen  If you remember  Obama failed to roll back and  in fact  he extended Bush era legislation he strongly campaigned against  such as the Patriot Act and Bush tax cuts  The same might very well happen under Trump  Even Carl Icahn whom Trump named as his special advisor on deregulation has commented that Dodd Frank is needed 
But Trump is a pragmatist  as Obama himself described him   He is coming into this office with fewer set hard and fast policy prescriptions than other presidents   Obama said 
Indeed  Trump isn t guided by ideology from the religious right  as Bush was  or the socialist left  as Obama was  Remember  he long identified himself as a Democrat and has supported Democratic candidates  including Hillary Clinton   So I think that  after 16 years of Bush and Obama  the pendulum is finally swinging back to the center  The question is  Can Trump make it work 
Many small to mid sized business owners seem to believe he can  In a Business Journals survey taken the day after the election  82 percent of businesses said they felt confident their prospects would improve over the next 12 months  That s the highest reading in nearly a decade 

How Markets Are Betting As I ve pointed out before  investors seem to be betting that  despite the uphill battle ahead  Trump can deliver on financial deregulation  Below  the chart shows sector performance before Trump s election compared with performance since the election  As you can see  financials jumped seven places to become the top performing sector  What s more  health care turned positive  suggesting investors are confident Trump and the Republican controlled Congress can dismantle Obamacare 

Small cap stocks  as measured by the Russell 2000 Index  are also way up on bets that Trump s protectionist policies will benefit domestics with limited exposure to foreign markets  more so than multinational blue chip stocks 

It might be too soon to tell  but I expect these trends to carry on into 2017 
Rising Rates Ahead in 2017 With economic conditions and expectations improving  especially since the election  it s very likely the Federal Reserve will continue to tighten throughout 2017  Rate hikes will be limited  but 3 percent mortgage rates are probably a thing of the past 
Lenders are already slashing their refinance volume expectations for 2017 and beyond  according to a mortgage lender sentiment survey conducted in December by Fannie Mae 
In addition  Kroll Bond Rating Agency  KBRA  believes we ve likely seen peak lending   While 2016 has been an excellent year for the U S  mortgage industry  with almost  2 trillion in new loan originations  we believe that this year is also likely to be the peak in terms of lending volumes for years to come  

As I ve pointed out several times before  when interest rates are on the rise  short term municipal bonds are the place to be  since they re less sensitive to rate increases than longer term bonds  whose maturities are further out 
I want to wish all of my loyal readers  investors and shareholders a most Happy New Year  As we begin a new American chapter in 2017  complete with a new series of challenges both big and small  remember to hold fast to H O P E  Have Only Positive Expectations

10662,232177,DNKN,Cheap Burgers Are Still Selling  Just Not At McDonald s,opinion,"McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports January 23  Before Market Opens
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 45 on  6 05 billion in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  50 million in revenue
McDonald s faces tougher comparisons as McPick 2 and All Day Breakfast sales dry up
This year the focus shifts to growing the McCafe brand  expanding internationally  and revamping some of its classic menu items
McDonald s success in 2016 was largely the result of two key promotional campaigns that drove earnings and sales higher  the McPick 2 and all day breakfast  Both initiatives helped attract a wider audience and were more appealing to value focused consumers  This year the focus shifts to growing the McCafe brand  expanding internationally  and revamping some of its classic menu items  Many of these initiatives  which are already underway  provide a much needed level of support to McDonald s fourth quarter report scheduled to take place early Monday morning 
The consensus estimate at Estimize pegs earnings for the golden arches at  1 45 per share  about 13  higher than the same period last year  That estimate edged higher by 3  since the most recent report at the end of October  Revenue for the period is expected to drop by 5  to  6 05 billion  marking 8  consecutive quarters of negative top line growth  Americans  newfound adoration for healthier lifestyles clearly put a dent in McDonald s sales growth in recent years 
Still  the stock continues to make gains  In the past 3 months share prices increased by 10  on increased business optimism  but during the earnings period the stock historically doesn t move  If the numbers come in strong though  shareholders can expect to receive a healthy boost

1  McDonald s
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports January 23  before the open 
The Estimize consensus on   NYSE MCD  is looking for earnings per share of  1 45  four cents above the sell side consensus and 13  higher than the same period a year earlier  That estimate has increased 2  since McDonald s last quarterly report  Revenue is anticipated to decrease 5  to  6 05 billion   62M above Wall Street 

What to Watch  McDonald s success in 2016 was largely the result of two key promotional campaigns that drove earnings and sales higher  the McPick 2 and all day breakfast  Both initiatives helped attract a wider audience and were more appealing to value focused consumers  This year the focus shifts to growing the McCafe brand  expanding internationally  and revamping some of its classic menu items  Many of these initiatives  which are already underway  provide a much needed level of support to McDonald s fourth quarter report scheduled to take place early Monday morning 
McDonald s strategy to boost sales in the last year included greater marketing promotions  newer menu items  expanding the mobile app  and improving the customer experience  In the third quarter same store sales rose by 3 5  with across the board improvements in both the global and domestic sector  Sales in the United States gained 1 3   mostly from the 3 menu promotions

2  Boeing
Industrials   Aerospace   Defense   Reports January 25  before the open 
The Estimize consensus on   NYSE BA  is looking for earnings per share of  2 48  14 cents above the Wall Street consensus and up 55  from the same period last year  That estimate has stayed flat since Boeing s most recent report in October  Revenue is anticipated to be inline YoY at  23 59 billion  as compared to the sell side s consensus of  23 45 billion 

What to Watch  After a rough start to 2016  Aerospace   Defense stocks ended the year on a high note  with President Trump vowing to increase spending  However  the President has thrown the industry some curve balls  often pitting defense companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  against each other  and tweeting about the high cost of products made by the two 
In one such tweet  Trump proclaimed  cancel order  in reference to the Boeing Air Force Ones meant to be delivered in 2022 for  4B and caused the stock to fall  but it quickly rebounded  At the end of the year another tweet addressed the high cost of the Lockheed Martin F 35  in favor of the Boeing F 18 Super Hornet  LMT stock dropped  only to rise back to previously held levels 
Boeing continues to show strong order bookings and order backlog  recording a defense backlog of  53B at the end of Q3 2016  For 2017  Boeing is focused on expanding internationally  recently penning a  16 6B deal with Iran Air for 80 jetliners 
3  Microsoft
Information Technology   Software   Reports January 26  after the close 
The Estimize consensus on   NASDAQ MSFT  calls for EPS of  0 81  3 cents above the Wall Street consensus  The Revenue expectation of  25 35 billion is  147M above sell side consensus  Expectations have increased 2  since last quarter  putting YoY growth expectations at 2  for EPS and  1  for sales 

What to watch  Microsoft posted impressive results in its most recent report  recording a 5 cent beat on the bottom line and nearly  600 million on the top  A majority of these gains came from its cloud computing and productivity segments  MS Azure is now firmly the second best cloud computing platform only behind Amazon Web Services  NASDAQ AMZN  Personal Computing only declined 2   most of which came from waning phone and gaming demand  A shocking 38  increase in tablet sales during the first quarter have Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  investors questioning what the company can do to jumpstart iPad sales 
The Q3 report also caused a huge breakout in its technicals which could be the start of a lengthy run  A new peak in the on balance volume  bullish crossover in the MACD and 20 day moving average all indicate positive upside 
More recently  the company released two new products  Microsoft Teams and the large studio tables  both of which are expected to compete with established players in their respective spaces  Slack and Apple  If Microsoft can establish any sort of foothold that would be enough to justify shares moving higher 

4  Starbucks
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports January 26  after the close 
The Estimize consensus on   SBUX  calls for EPS of  0 53  1 cent above the Wall Street consensus  Revenue expectations of  5 85 billion are in line with the sell side consensus  Expectations have decreased 3  since last quarter  putting YoY growth expectations at 16  for EPS and 9  for sales 

What to watch  Starbucks was dealt a massive blow last month when its renowned CEO Howard Schultz decided to step aside from his position for a smaller role in the company  Many believe this will turn out to bite the coffee chain as it did nearly 10 years ago  Despite the shakeup in management  the company is still moving forward with its massive expansion plans  with the main focus on China  In their fiscal Q4 Starbucks opened 690 net store  bringing the store total to 25 085 in 75 countries worldwide  The quarter also features a SSS increase of 4   and an even higher 6  in China 
A revamped customer loyalty program earlier this year is proving to be the most successful initiative  In April  Starbucks updated its reward program which now rewards customers for every dollar spent instead of the number of visits  making it one of the most popular loyalty programs of any retailer  The coffee chain also has introduced wildly popular mobile initiative  such as mobile order and pay which reached 5  of US transactions last quarter 
However  competition is stiff  McDonald s recent initiative to expand its McCafe brand will put pressure on the near term outlook of Starbucks  The golden arches is claiming it will sell coffee anywhere between  1 and  2  roughly half the price of any Starbucks  beverage 

5  Alphabet
Information Technology   Internet Software   Services   Reports January 26  after the close 
The Estimize consensus on   NASDAQ GOOGL  is looking for earnings per share of  9 80 on  20 66 billion in revenue  above Wall Street by 17 cents on the bottom line and  150M on the top  Compared to a year earlier  this reflects a 12  increase in earnings and a 19  increase on sales  Earnings estimates have remained flat since the last quarter  while revenues increased 2  

What to Watch  Google started off the second half of 2016 on a strong note  topping analysts  expectations by a whopping 38 cents in the third quarter  Investors are hoping the tech giant can keep the momentum going in the fourth quarter after stalling some what in the first half of 2016 as losses from its moonshot investments piled up 
Those concerns appear to have been put to rest after the most report which featured a surge in their core mobile search and video businesses  Paid clicks increased 42  from a year earlier  roughly 10  higher than the industry average of 32   New devices  YouTube and other strategic initiatives are expected to help diversify Google s revenues and enrich its capabilities  So far the Google Home and Pixel have been well received and should shift the heat back to Amazon and Apple which offer comparable products ",2017-01-23,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-1-23---mcd,-ba,-msft,-sbux,-googl-200173181",200173181

the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line lagged the same Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 60 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents by 3 4  and increased 15 4  year over year mainly due to decrease in shares outstanding and an increase in adjusted net income  The quick service restaurant operator s revenues in the quarter decreased 1 3  year over year to  207 1 million  Primary causes for the fall were a decline in sales at company operated restaurants  a decrease in franchise fees as well as a drop in sales of ice cream and other products primarily to the Middle East  Revenues  thus  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  213 million by 2 8  These declines were however somewhat offset by higher royalty income and increased license fees related to the Dunkin  K Cup pod licensing agreement  Inside the Headline NumbersDunkin  Brands operates through its Dunkin  Donuts and Baskin Robbins brands System wide sales increased 6 3   comparing favorably with 3 8  growth in the prior quarter Dunkin  DonutsDunkin  Donuts U S  reported revenues of  152 4 million  reflecting a decline of 1 3  over the prior year quarter  The

 in the Dunkin Donuts U S  division  comparing favorably with 1 1  growth in the prior year quarter and 0 5  growth in the preceding quarter Comps at Dunkin  Donuts International division declined 1 4   as against 0 8  growth in the prior year quarter  The figure compared favorably with a decline of 3 1  in the preceding quarter Baskin RobbinsBaskin Robbins revenues were up 1 5  from the prior year quarter to  13 8 million mainly due to rise in rental income  sales of ice cream and other products  and franchise fees  offset by a decrease in royalty income Comps decreased 0 9  in the Baskin Robbins U S  division  weaker than 7 5  growth in the year ago quarter and 0 6  growth in the prior quarter However  at Baskin Robbins International division  comps declined 2 9   wider than the 2 4  slump in the prior year quarter but better than the 6 6  fall in the prior quarter DUNKIN BRANDS Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Operating MarginAdjusted operating income rose 8 3  from the prior year quarter to  114 8 million mainly due to the increase in royalty income  as well as gains from company operated restaurants and a reduction in general and administrative expenses  Meanwhile  adjusted operating income margin rose 490 basis points to 55 4  Store UpdateIn the third quarter  Dunkin  Brands opened 115 new restaurants worldwide  These include 56 Dunkin  Donuts U S  locations

Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA    has had its troubles in recent quarters  despite being one of the largest pharmacy chain in the country  Revenue has consistently fallen below expectations while also accelerating on a year over year basis  Walgreens is still in the process of seeking regulatory approval for its Rite Aid takeover in late 2015  The merger would form the largest drug chain in the country and has led regulators to rethink the merits of the deal  Meanwhile  Walgreens is implementing new technologies and forming partnerships to strengthen its market position  A deal with Prime Therapeutics will help expand its retail pharmacy business thereby boosting top line growth 
American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL   Disappointing earnings from Delta  NYSE DAL  and United  NYSE UAL  earlier this season set an unfavorable tone for   Both airlines recorded mid single digit declines in unit revenue which reflects weaker travel trends  American Airlines is fortunately in a better position than its peers  Its efforts to return to profitability and growth have begun to pay off  The airline recently raised its key PRASM guidance to a 2 3  decline  a much bigger improvement from the 6 1  decline last quarter  This is largely due to its presence in regions with favorable consumer trends  That said  discount retailers like Southwest  NYSE LUV  and Spirit Airlines  NASDAQ SAVE  will put a dent on revenue this quarter  As ticket prices continue to come down in the industry  we will also see margins begin to edge down 
Dunkin  Brands  NASDAQ DNKN    has performed well recently despite Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX  dominant position in the coffee market  New initiatives such as more drive through locations  menu innovation  comprehensive mobile app and a loyalty program have helped engage and attract customers  Furthermore  licensing deals with Keurig and J M  Smucker  NYSE SJM  to sell Dunkin  branded K cups will continue to boost top line growth  The company may have missed its revenue target in the second quarter but analysts are confident that a rebound is in store later today  Shares are up 18  year to date but historically remain flat through the print ",2016-10-20,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-stocks-to-watch-before-the-market-opens-tomorrow-200159659,200159659
10676,232191,DNKN,Buy Some Dunkin  Donuts Stock For National Coffee Day,opinion,"Thursday is National Coffee Day  and following Wednesday s National Drink Beer Day  it seemed very appropriate early this morning  But with the afternoon rolling around it is time for many of us to go find that pick me up for the rest of the day  Here in North East Ohio it is raining and 65 degrees  so our mood has turned to fall and when you think of fall and coffee your mind naturally goes to Pumpkin Spice          fill in the blank  
Until recently you would then walk or drive to Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   But today instead why don t you head to Dunkin  Donuts  They also have a full line of Pumpkin Spice coffees now  And while you are there you may want to pick up some shares of their stock as well  The chart below explains why 


The chart shows how the price of Dunkin Brands Group Inc  NASDAQ DNKN  went from a high around  56 July last year to a low at  37 in January  After losing 1 3 of its value it started back higher to a top at  50 in April  Another pullback found support at  42  a higher low  in June before another leg higher  This also stalled at  50 but pulled back again to a higher low at its 50 day SMA  The reversal from there moved up through  50 for the first time in a year  It has consolidated over that break out  since 
Momentum has remained bullish since early August and reinforced recently with a fresh cross up in the MACD  With the Bollinger Bands  opening to the upside and the SMA s turning up it looks like a good time to pick up some shares along with that Pumpkin Spice Latte

10678,232193,DNKN,How Does Q3 Earnings Taste To Restaurant ETF ,opinion,"The restaurant industry is in shambles for quite some time now with the current Zacks Industry Rank in the bottom 34   Soft comps and increasing labor costs and still tepid consumer spending have been weighing on the sector 
As a result  the industry has been displaying sluggish trends after prolonged strength  As per   Restaurant Performance Index  RPI  dropped below 100 in August  marking the first below 100 reading in eight months  Notably  a figure below 100 indicates  a contraction for key industry indicators  
This makes it more important to look at how restaurant stocks are performing this earnings reporting cycle and find out if it can write the turnaround story for the sector 
The fast food behemoth McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD   beat on both lines  Earnings per share of  1 62 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 48 and improved 15 7  from the year ago quarter  Revenues of  6 42 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 29 billion but were down 3   Global comps grew 3 5   backed by positive comps across all segments 
Another key player of the industry  Yum Brands Inc    NYSE YUM    reported third quarter 2016 earnings of  1 09 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Earnings were up 9  year over year  Total revenue of  3 32 billion declined 3 2  year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 51 billion by 5 5  
Domino s Pizza Inc  s   NYSE DPZ   third quarter 2016 earnings and revenues surpassed expectations  Adjusted earnings of  0 96 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 90 and climbed 43 3  year over year  Revenues increased 16 9  year over year to  567 million and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  543 million 
Dunkin  Brands Group Inc    NASDAQ DNKN   reported mixed third quarter 2016 results  wherein the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line lagged the same 
We are just in the middle of the restaurant earnings reporting cycle  which looks moderate as of now  Investors must be interested in knowing how the sector might be performing throughout the cycle  so that they can take investment decisions on it As we have a pure play ETF on the restaurant industry  namely Restaurant ETF   the investing task becomes easier  Investors expecting the sector to turn around but still confused about which stock to pick  even from the pack of the top rated ones   can easily play BITE  see   For them  we have highlighted our earnings prediction of some of the holdings of BITE  read    A Bite out of Surprise PredictionPapa John s International Inc    NASDAQ PZZA   has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an  of 0 00   making an earnings beat unlikely  However  the stock has a favorable Growth Style Score of A  though it fails on the Value score and Momentum score of D  The company is expected to report on November 1  2016  PZZA is the top holding of BITE with 3 09  weight 
Wingstop Inc    NASDAQ WING   has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   again making surprise prediction difficult  WING  which is also expected to report on November 1  takes the second spot in BITE with 2 78  weight 
Jack in the Box Inc    NASDAQ JACK   has a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   The company is likely to report on November 15  JACK gets 2 75  of the fund 
El Pollo Loco Holdings Inc    NASDAQ LOCO   has a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   again putting the odds of earnings beat in jeopardy  LOCO  which is also expected to report on November 3  takes the second spot in BITE with 2 71  weight 
Bottom Line 
Overall  the situation is still subdued  Only a pickup in economic growth and further improvement consumer sentiments can offer sustained relief to the sector  The fund gained about 0 4  in the last one month  as of October 24  2016   read

10679,232194,DNKN,Recession Risk Rises  Bull Market Still In Play  But Not By Much ,opinion,"This week I want to discuss several risks I am currently watching starting to manifest  behind the scenes  so to speak  But first  let s take a quick review of the markets which currently are flashing some very troubling signs 
Last week  I discussed the ongoing consolidation and struggle as the markets remain  trapped  between downtrend resistance and the crucial support levels of the previous breakout to new highs  The S P 500 charts below have been updated through Friday afternoon 

 Note  as I am writing this Jason Chaffetz just confirmed the FBI was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails based on new evidence  This has caused the market to panic a bit and the battle to hold support is being waged as I write this  



 If we zoom in we can get a little clearer picture about the breakdown  


The two dashed red lines show the tightening consolidation pattern more clearly 
Importantly  while the market has remained in suspended animation over the past three months  the deterioration of the market is quite evident  However  despite the ongoing political circus  weak corporate earnings  considering the massive reductions in expectations since the beginning of the year   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  both missing expectations  which really goes to the heart of the consumer   and consumer sentiment waning  it is surprising the markets are still holding up as well as they are  As long as the markets can maintain support around 2125  the bull market is still in play  but at this point  not by much 
More importantly though  despite the ongoing defense of support at current levels  the deterioration in momentum and price action has now triggered intermediate and longer term  sell signals  as shown below 

Importantly  notice that both of the previous bullish trend lines  depending on how you measure them  have now been violated  Previously  when both  sell signals  have been triggered  particularly with the market overbought as it is now  the subsequent decline has been rather sharp  

Lastly  as stated above  the 50 dma moving average has begun to trend lower  the downtrend resistance from the previous market highs remains present and the  sell signal  occurring at high levels suggests the risk of a further correction has not currently been eliminated 
As stated last week  and remains this week 

 It is important  as an investor  is not to  panic  and make emotionally driven decisions in the short term  All that has happened currently is a  warning  you should start paying attention to your investments   

Just be cautious for the moment 
Economy About To Hit The Dollar  Wall 
Since early May  I have continued to maintain an outlook for a stronger dollar as higher U S  interest rates continue to attract foreign inflows 
As I wrote several weeks ago 

 As shown below  a stronger dollar will provide another headwind to already weak earnings and oil prices in the months ahead which could put a damper on the expected year end  hockey stick  recovery currently expected  


Of course  the real problem of a stronger dollar at this juncture is that it weighs on exports which comprise about 40  of corporate earnings  As I stated last week 

 The dollar rally could be a real problem with respect to the earnings recovery story going into the end of the year  With an already weak economy  a stronger dollar means weaker exports for companies and a drag on corporate profitability  

The chart below shows the relationship between exports and the dollar 

Of course  despite the  whooping and hollering  over the advance print of GDP at 2 9  on Friday  such exuberance may be a tad premature as the next chart shows the relationship between the dollar and the economy itself 

This is particularly interesting given the recent number of companies trying to lay off weak earnings reports on the election  As Paul La Monica  

 This contentious and seemingly never ending presidential election campaign makes me want to eat more comfort food to boost my spirits 
But maybe I m alone  Executives from several food companies   as well as other big consumer brands   have warned in recent weeks that the Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton battle for the White House is actually hurting their results  

Whether it was the CEO of Dunkin  Brands  NASDAQ DNKN   which owns both Dunkin  Donuts and ice cream chain Baskin Robbins  McDonald s  NYSE MCD   YUM  Brands  NYSE YUM  or Popeye s Louisiana Chicken  NASDAQ PLKI   they all pulled the excuse the election was hurting their results 
As Paul goes on to state 

 Really  It seems hard to imagine that people are passing up the opportunity to have an iced coffee and a cronut or some fried chicken and cheeseburgers just because they are scared of what either a President Trump or Clinton would do to the economy  

Paul is absolutely right  The poor results from restaurants or consumer good related companies like Apple and Amazon aren t missing results due to the election  but rather these are early signs of a consumer that is being impacted by they triple whammy of rising borrowing costs  weak wage growth and spiraling health care costs thanks to the  Un Affordable Care Act  
Of course  this is clearly seen in the report from the  as consumers are forced to choose between eating out or paying for health care costs 

 Due in large part to declines in both same store sales and customer traffic  the National Restaurant Association s Restaurant Performance Index  RPI  fell below 100 in August  



 The RPI fell below 100 for the first time in eight months  as a result of broad based declines in the current situation indicators  Restaurant operators reported net declines in both same store sales and customer traffic in August  along with corresponding dips in the labor indicators  
The RPI is constructed so that the health of the restaurant industry is measured in relation to a steady state level of 100  The Restaurant Performance Index consists of two components   the Current Situation Index and the Expectations Index  Current Situation Index Fell 1 9 Percent in August to a Level of 98 6  Expectations Index Edged Down 0 2 Percent to a Level of 100 6  


While no one is watching or worrying about the dollar right now  I can assure you they will be soon if the rise continues 
10 Year Treasury Beats Yellen To The Punch
Wall Street has put pretty high odds on Janet Yellen hiking rates come December  

 While the probability of a November rate hike has collapsed to just 8 5   as December holds around 65   it appears regional Federal Reserves have a very different perspective of when Janet should hike  Nine of the Fed s 12 regional banks sought a quarter point increase in the discount rate in September  up from eight in August  based on minutes of their board meetings published by Fed  This is the same number as right before the December hike in 2015  


The problem  however  is that every time the Federal Reserve has tried to hike rates over the last couple of years some form of  global instability  has cropped up that has kept them on hold  The problem  this time  is the  instability  may be domestic as the recent surge in the 10 year interest rate has front run the Fed in tightening monetary policy and putting the brakes on economic growth  
As shown in the chart below  while rates remain in a very defined downtrend  each push to higher levels resulted in an economic slowdown with a bit of a lagged effect  With rates now as overbought as at any prior point  it is likely the  brakes  are already being applied and will show up in weaker retail sales  consumer spending  and capital investment reports in the not so distant future 

As I pointed out in this past week s report  Better Hope Rates Don t Rise   there are a litany of problems with higher rates 

1  Sharply rising rates will immediately curtail that growth as rising borrowing costs slows consumption 
2  The Federal Reserve currently runs the world s largest hedge fund with over  4 Trillion in assets  
3  People buy payments  not houses  and rising rates mean higher payments 
4  An increase in interest rates means higher borrowing costs which lead to lower profit margins for corporations  
5  One of the main arguments of stock bulls over the last 8 years has been the stocks are cheap based on low interest rates  
6  The massive derivatives market will be negatively impacted 
7  As rates increase so does the variable rate interest payments on credit cards  
8  Rising defaults on debt service 
9  Commodities  which are very sensitive to the direction and strength of the global economy 
10  The deficit GDP ratio will begin to soar as borrowing costs rise sharply  

You get the idea  The problem is that with economic growth already running at extremely weak levels  it won t take much of a rise to put the overall economic underpinnings at risk 
Recession Risk On The Rise
Just recently  Deutsche Bank Chief U S  Economist Joseph LaVorgna  

 That s only the eighth time in nearly 40 years the index was down on a year over year basis  Of the seven previous occasions  four were soon followed by recession   In the three other cases  two were false alarms  in 1986 87 and 1995 96  and in 1981 the recession began shortly before the annual change in the LMCI  Labor Market Conditions Index  turned negative  
The weakness in the LMCI indicates a rising possibility of recession  The upshot is that the economic outlook remains fragile despite the ostensible robustness of the labor market  

I take a little different look at the LMCI by using a 12 month average of the monthly changes  What is notable is despite all of the cheering over monthly labor reports  which has been  quantity  over  quality   what has been overlooked is the declining trend in the data 

It s not just Deutsche Bank that is warning about the fact we are very late in the current economic cycle  but also by former raging bull David Rosenberg in 

 The yield curve is flattening  Leading economic indicators are sputtering  Uber tight credit spreads and ultra low cap rates in real estate serve as confirmations of late cycle pricing 
Traditional valuation metrics for equities are every bit as high if not higher than they were in the Fall of 2007  
We are well past the peak in autos and just passed the peak of the housing cycle  Not just that but the broad measures of unemployment have stopped going down as well  
And the mega  Merger Mania  we are seeing invariably takes place at or near cycle peaks  as companies realize that they can no longer grow their earnings organically  We have just witnessed five multi billion dollar deals this past week alone    207 billion globally  AT T   TimeWarner  TD Ameritrade   Scottrade  in what has been the most active announcement list since 1999   what do you know  near the tail end of that tech bull market too 
We also were at the receiving end of a really disappointing consumer confidence report out of The Conference Board   sliding to a three month low of 98 6 in October from 103 5 in September  the sharpest slide of the year 
And it wasn t just the politics or gas prices   just a general malaise 
Assessments of business conditions now and perceptions for the next six months deteriorated significantly  as they did for the jobs market and spending intentions for homes and appliances 
This sentiment index generally peaks between 60  and 70  of the way through the cycle and so if that traditional pattern holds for this one  it would mean bracing for a recession to start any time from October 2017 to May 2018 
Forewarned is forearmed  

This analysis confirms my previous suggestions we are approaching a recession sometime next year  With rising labor costs  interest rates and a stronger dollar  the Fed is on a collision course with a recession  This was noted by ECRI s Lakshman Achuthan just recently 

 In a recent interview with Financial Sense  Achuthan  explains how demographics and slowing productivity are key to understanding long term trend growth  something that monetary and fiscal policy may do little to change  
 We ve been in a growth rate cycle slowdown for almost two years now  where the broad measures of current economic activity  which define the business cycle or the economic cycle are in a slowdown   

As I have repeatedly stated  you can not support higher interest rates  or have an inflationary pickup  without underlying economic growth 

 As you can see there is a very high correlation  not surprisingly  between the three major components  inflation  economic and wage growth  and the level of interest rates  Interest rates are not just a function of the investment market  but rather the level of  demand  for capital in the economy  When the economy is expanding organically  the demand for capital rises as businesses expand production to meet rising demand  Increased production leads to higher wages which in turn fosters more aggregate demand  As consumption increases  so does the ability for producers to charge higher prices  inflation  and for lenders to increase borrowing costs   Currently  we do not have the type of inflation that leads to stronger economic growth  just inflation in the costs of living that sap consumer spending   Rent  Insurance  Health Care  



 However  in the current economic environment  this is not the case  

While many are predicting  no recession  in sight  the economic data currently does not support that call 
Why do we care  Because during recessions stocks have historically lost about 1 3rd of their value  After two previous bear markets since the turn of the century  you really can t afford the risk of going through a third one 
As David said  above   forewarned is forearmed  

THE MONDAY MORNING CALL
The Monday Morning Call   Analysis For Active Traders
This Market Needs Traction
 had a very interesting post this past week in which he looked at the deterioration of the market  He noted 

 Here s something else to consider  For the past two years  the market has been in a sideways pattern  i e   it s eked out a small gain  Investors are getting anxious to generate any return on their money  just one of the many reasons they are dumping managed funds  and the reason they are desperately seeking yield  In my opinion  this is the time to be patient while waiting for the right opportunity  Anyone trying to force the market to give them money is going to be sorely disappointed in the near future 
Because Halloween and the election are drawing near  I don t want to scare you  Nevertheless  the warning signs are everywhere  Once again  the strongest case for the bulls is the  invisible hand   the entity that frequently spikes the indexes higher whenever the market starts to sell off  As I ve said before  fear will overwhelm the invisible hand one day  but until then we can expect to get this drip drip drip type of selloff on low volatility 
Bottom line  The odds favor the bears in the near future  Keep your eye out for 2 130 on the S P 500  If we drop below that level and the 200 day moving averages on the S P 500  it could get nasty  Raise cash as we move closer to a correction  The biggest surprise is that we haven t had one yet  

I couldn t agree more  and the market needs to get some traction quickly as crucial support is currently being tested  As shown in the chart below  bullishness remains high despite the recent sideways action of the market  This provides fuel for a correction should something panic investors 

Furthermore  the deterioration in the breadth of the market is also concerning as shown above and below  With relative strength  momentum and breadth all on the decline  Michael is correct in stating the short term outlook favors the bears momentarily  so caution is advised  

With multiple sell signals in place  as shown throughout the entirety of this week s newsletter  the call for next week remains higher cash levels and reduce levels of equity risk for now  When market dynamics change to a more constructive backdrop there will be plenty of time to increase allocations to equities with a more favorable risk reward potential

10700,232215,DNKN,5 Reasons Why You Should Invest In J M  Smucker  SJM  Now,opinion,"As Britain voted in favor of leaving the European Union or what is widely called Brexit  the overall global economy could sense the aftershocks  Such a move has increased uncertainty and fueled volatility in world markets  We have already witnessed the pound crashing to its lowest level since 1985  with the sterling falling below  1 35 
In such a scenario  it seems unlikely that the Fed will hike rates anytime soon and may seek alternative monetary measures to stimulate the economy  Fed s delay in raising interest rates will make investors jittery about investing in high risk stocks  Further  this would elevate demand for government bonds and gold 
Consumer Staples Provides Stability
Amid these macro issues  investing in a safe haven sector is important and consumer staples is one such defensive sector  It fared well in the first quarter of 2016  Lower gas prices and increasing consumer confidence did the trick for these stocks  In fact  it should be kept in mind that the consumer staples sector has the potential to face the headwinds coming from continued Federal Reserve uncertainty  global market turmoil and continued volatility in the equity market 
Let us focus on one consumer staples stock   The J M  Smucker Co    NYSE SJM     which can be a good choice for investors  amid global issues SMUCKER JM Price and Consensus   Why Smucker Is a Good Choice 
Low Beta Stock  Smucker has a beta of 0 53  A stock with less than 1 beta suggests that the price movement of the stock is not highly correlated with the market  Since they are less volatile than the market  they are safer bets at the moment 
Rank and Estimates  Seven out of eight estimates for Smucker   a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock   have moved north for fiscal 2017 over the past 30 days 
Quarterly Results and Outlook  J M Smucker posted better than expected fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results primarily driven by gains from the acquisition of the Big Heart Pet Brands  gains from canned milk divestiture and favorable volumes owing to lower green coffee costs  Earnings of  1 86 per share were impressive as against a loss in the prior year quarter owing to solid top line growth and improvement in operating profits  Net sales increased 25  year over year benefiting from the acquisition and Dunkin  Donuts K Cup pods launched in May 2015   Smucker licenses Dunkin  Donuts from Dunkin  Brands Group  Inc    NASDAQ DNKN   
Strong organic sales growth  product innovation and constant efforts to expand through acquisitions have remained Smucker s strong points  The recent acquisitions  the launch of Dunkin Donuts K cup pods  expanding distribution for the Natural Balance pet brand are fueling sales and the trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2017 
Recovery in Coffee Business  Smucker s coffee business exceeded expectations in 2016  driven by several factors including the successful launch of Dunkin  Donuts K cups  the implementation of the planned Folgers canister downsize  a moderation in competitive activities  and the net benefit of lower commodity costs and pricing  Lower pricing on Folgers roast and ground coffee  due to lower green coffee costs  resulted in improved performance for the mainstream coffee business in 2016  In fact  the company expects momentum in the coffee business to continue in 2017 
Strategic Acquisitions  Smucker actively pursues strategic acquisitions both in the U S  as well as overseas  The company completed the acquisition of pet food maker Big Heart Pet Brand in Mar 2015  which has exposed it to the fastest growing pet food and snacks category in the U S  The acquisition significantly contributed to the top line in fiscal 2016 
In the past too  the company had added meaningful brands to its portfolio  For example  with the acquisition of Seattle  WA based Sahale Snacks  Inc  in Sep 2014  the company received a new snacking brand of premium  branded nut and fruit snacks  The acquisition of Enray Inc   a manufacturer and marketer of premium organic  gluten free ancient grain products   in Aug 2013  gave the company the ownership of Enray s flagship brand truRoots  which has helped it to grow across the rapidly growing gluten free market  The acquisition is expected to add sales in excess of  50 million on an annual basis  thus increasing the scale of the company s natural foods and specialty businesses 
Other Key Picks
Investors may also have a look at these other well ranked food stocks such as Omega Protein Corp    NYSE OME   and B G Foods  Inc    NYSE BGS    both sporting a Zacks Rank  1 ",2016-06-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-reasons-why-you-should-invest-in-j.m.-smucker-(sjm)-now-200138448,200138448
10701,232216,DNKN,J  M  Smucker  SJM  Increases Quarterly Dividend By 12 ,opinion,"The board of The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   has approved a quarterly dividend hike of 12 0   thereby maintaining the trend of rewarding its shareholders consistently  The new dividend of 75 cents is up from the previous quarterly dividend of 67 cents per share  The dividend will be paid on Sep 1  2016 to shareholders of record as of Aug 12 
Smucker has been increasing its rate of quarterly and annual dividends consistently and this dividend hike represents the fifteenth consecutive year of dividend growth  This year the rate of dividend hike is much higher than last year s hike of 5   In Jul 2015  the company had increased its quarterly dividend from 64 cents to 67 cents 
Apart from increasing dividends  Smucker also repurchases shares consistently  In fiscal 2016  the company reduced its total debt by nearly  750 million  reflecting strong free cash flow  The company also returned over  750 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends 
Regular dividend payments and share buybacks reflect the company s confidence in its fundamentals  Regular share buybacks help the company reduce outstanding share count  thereby increasing earnings per share and return on equity  Apart from bolstering shareholder value  this strategic move will also lift the relatively undervalued share price SMUCKER JM Price   Last month  J M Smucker posted better than expected fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results  wherein both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  primarily driven by gains from the acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands  gains from canned milk divestiture and favorable volumes owing to lower green coffee costs  The increase was also driven by the contribution from Dunkin  Donuts K Cup pods  launched in May 2015   Smucker licenses Dunkin  Donuts from Dunkin  Brands Group  Inc    NASDAQ DNKN   
We note that strong organic sales growth  product innovation and constant efforts to expand through acquisitions have remained Smucker s strength  Recent acquisitions  the launch of Dunkin Donuts K cup pods  and the expansion of distribution for the Natural Balance pet brand are fueling sales and are expected to do the same in fiscal 2017  The divestiture of its US canned milk brands and operations to Eagle Family Foods Group will allow the company to focus on key brands and growth opportunities 
Encouragingly  the Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company is witnessing growth in coffee volumes owing to further lowering of coffee price and increase from sales of Dunkin Donuts K Cup pods 
However  currency headwinds remain a concern for Smucker  The company also remains concerned about heightened competitive activity in the pet food business

Well there are sharks swimming in Dunkin  Brands stock price at least  The chart below shows the pullback in the stock from July 2015 to a low in February  Since that low the stock ran higher into mid April 
Since then the back and forth action has done two things  It retraced 61 8  of the leg higher  And it created a Harmonic Shark pattern  The Shark carries two Potential Reversal Zones  PRZ   one at 88 6  of the XA leg and the second at 113  of that leg  That gives an upside target to about 48 84 to 50 50 


But if that were not enough to look for upside  all of this price action is nested with in an even bigger Gartley pattern  yellow   This harmonic carries a PRZ at 52 47  So take your pick for a target  48 84  50 50 or 52 47 
The momentum indicators also support the upside  The RSI is moving into the bullish zone and the MACD is crossed up and rising  With the move over the B level in the Shark the trigger is active against a stop at about 44 50

Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2 33   In fact  the company has delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters  translating to an average positive surprise of 3 12  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Dunkin  Brands operates through the Dunkin  Donuts and Baskin Robbins brands  The company s strategic initiatives to boost sales such as more drive through locations  menu innovation and breakfast menu optimization should boost second quarter results  Meanwhile  the newly launched digital initiatives and global expansion  mainly in the emerging markets  are likely to aid the company s international sales 
Further  the company s renewed multi year partnership with Keurig Green Mountain and J M  Smucker  signed in 2015  to manufacture  market  distribute and sell Dunkin  K Cup pods at retailers in the U S  would continue to benefit the top line 
Nevertheless  like other restaurant chains  Dunkin  Brands  upcoming results are likely to be hurt by high labor expenses   Also  the breakfast segment   historically one of Dunkin  Brands  most profitable divisions   is facing immense competition with more companies grabbing market share  This would hurt the company s top line in the near term 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dunkin  Brands is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Its Earnings ESP is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 56 cents   DUNKIN BRANDS Price and EPS Surprise
   Zacks Rank  Dunkin  Brands  Zacks Rank  3 when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some stocks in the restaurant industry that investors may consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Papa John s International Inc    NASDAQ PZZA    with an Earnings ESP of  3 7  and a Zacks Rank  2

10720,232235,DNKN,J M  Smucker Tops Q4 Earnings   Sales On Buyout  Volume,opinion,"The J M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM    a leading manufacturer of food products  posted better than expected earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  primarily driven by gains from the acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands  Mar 2015  and favorable volumes owing to lower green coffee costs 
Adjusted earnings  including amortization  of  1 86 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 19 per share by 56 3  in the fourth quarter  It was also much better than the prior year loss of 41 cents per share  Adjusted earnings  excluding amortization  were  2 23 per share  as against prior year quarter s loss of 20 cents owing to the benefit from Big Heart operations and a gain from the U S  canned milk divestiture  Impressive top line growth and improvement in operating profits also aided earnings growth SMUCKER JM Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Revenue and Margin Details
Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 25  year over year to  1 81 billion  It also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 74 billion by 3 9  
The increase was driven by the acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands and contribution from Dunkin  Donuts K Cup pods  launched in May 2015   Smucker licenses Dunkin  Donuts from Dunkin  Brands Group  Inc    NASDAQ DNKN   
The acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands contributed  336 9 million to fourth quarter sales  Excluding Big Heart  the impact from foreign currency exchange  and the impact of the U S  canned milk divestiture  net sales increased 5  
The company witnessed a favorable volume mix driven by the contribution from Dunkin  Donuts K Cup pods  However  net price realization was slightly lowerdue to lower net pricing on coffee  which was mostly offset by increases in several other categories 
Adjusted gross profit increased 48  to  681 7 million owing to the addition of Big Heart and favorable volume mix  Net price realization was lower and was offset by a reduction in commodity costs  mainly green coffee 
Despite higher selling  general and administrative expenses  adjusted operating profit increased a significant 102  to  280 8 million owing to the Big Heart acquisition 
Segment Performance
U S  Retail Coffee Market The company s biggest segment  U S  Retail Coffee Market  reported 9 4  growth in sales to  512 6 million  mainly driven by the Dunkin  Donuts K Cup pods  which led to favorable volume mix  The Folgers brand also contributed to net sales growth as volume gains on mainstream roast and ground offerings more than offset declines in Folgers K cup pods  Favorable volume mix for the segment was slightly offset by lower net price realization for the Folgers brand 
The lower price realization was due to reduced packaged coffee prices of the majority of its products sold in the U S  recently  primarily consisting of items under the Folgers and Dunkin  Donutsbrands  While lower coffee costs resulted in lower price realization during the quarter  it also led to an increase in coffee volumes 
Segment profit increased 39 4  to  153 2 million  reflecting the net benefit of lower commodity costs and pricing and the contribution from Dunkin  Donuts K Cup pods  These factors were slightly offset by an increase in marketing expense 
U S  Retail Consumer Foods U S  Retail Consumer Foods segment sales declined 2  to  473 7 million due to the U S  canned milk divestiture  Excluding the impact of the divestiture  net sales increased 5   Net price realization was higher  primarily attributable to the Jif and Pillsbury brands  Volume mix was also favorable driven by Jif peanut butter and Smucker s Uncrustables frozen sandwiches 
Segment profit decreased 6  to 89 million  primarily reflecting the loss of U S  canned milk profits 
U S  Retail Pet Foods Segment net sales were  562 9 million in the quarter  which represented an approximate 3  increase compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year  including Big Heart s sales occurring prior to the completion of the acquisition  The net sales increase was primarily driven by growth in the Natural Balance brand and pet snacks  partially offset by declines in mainstream dog food 
Segment profit was  116 6 million in the fourth quarter 
International and Foodservice Net sales in the International and Foodservice segment increased 0 9  from the previous year quarter to  258 4 million  as currency headwinds and lower net price realization more than offset the contribution from Big Heart acquisition  favorable volume mix 
Segment profit grew 8  to  33 million  benefiting from favorable volume mix  partially offset by higher costs attributed to sourcing certain products from the U S  and currency headwinds 
Fiscal 2016 Results
Adjusted earnings  including amortization  of  6 57 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 76 per share by 14 1  in the fiscal year  It also increased significantly by 69 3  from the prior year earnings

10725,232240,DNKN,Top Trade Ideas For The Week  CPHD  DNKN  NAT  OLED  TSO,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Cepheid  Ticker  O CPHD
Cepheid  CPHD  has been moving sideways in a channel since a gap down in October  The RSI has climbed into the bullish zone but may be rejecting while the MACD is leveling after a rise  Last week saw the price bounce off the top of the range  Continuation Monday can be followed lower 
Dunkin  Brands  Ticker  O DNKN
Dunkin  Brands  DNKN  fell from a high at 56 in July  losing over 28 before a bounce near 40 in October  Since then it has been consolidating  At the start of December it moved back over the 50 day SMA and that has acted as support since  The RSI is holding over the mid line while the MACD is leveling  Look for a move over resistance to participate to the upside 
Nordic American Tankers  Ticker  N NAT
Nordic American Tankers  NAT  had been pulling back from a double top at 16 5 in a downtrending channel since October  until it broke the channel to the upside last week  The price is now consolidating with a rising RSI and MACD  both supporting a push higher  Look for a push over resistance to participate to the upside 
Universal Display  Ticker  O OLED
Universal Display  OLED  pulled back from a peak near 56  losing over 40  of its value before jumping back higher  It topped again at a slightly higher high before the recent shallow pullback and then turn higher  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD is turning towards a cross up  Look for a new high to participate in a continued move higher 
Tesoro  Ticker  N TSO
Tesoro  TSO  has trended high with falling oil prices  rising since October 2014  Closer in the price broke a bull flag last week to the upside and has support for more from a bullish and rising RSI and a MACD about to cross up  Look for continuation to participate to the upside 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Thursday which  as the books closed on 2015 and we started prep for 2016 saw the equity markets showing a lack of strength at best and some weakness short term 
Elsewhere look for consolidation to rule the short term  In Gold look for consolidation in the downtrend with Crude Oil also consolidating its move lower  The US Dollar Index looks to consolidate in the uptrend while US Treasuries just continue broad consolidation sideways marking time  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue its sideways motion while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside in consolidation 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  Their charts look to move into the New Year showing further consolidation in the long run but with some weakness in the short run  especially in the SPY  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

10728,232243,DNKN,Weak Jobs Report And Earnings Sink Equities,opinion,"The secret to happiness is to lower your expectations    that is what you compare your experience with  If your expectations and standards are very high and you only allow yourself to be happy when things are exquisite  you ll never be happy and grateful  There will always be some flaw  But compare your experience with lower expectations  especially something not as good  and you ll find much in your experience of the world to love  cherish and enjoy  every single moment   Charlie Munger
Coming off of a few positive weeks in stock markets  it was probably too much to expect a third good week in a row  especially with investor sentiment so poor  On Friday  when the January jobs number came in at a soft 151k  the initial reaction was not too bad  As the day progressed  however  selling accelerated based on the idea that more interest rate hikes could be coming 
Thursday s poor guidance and earnings reports from NASDAQ heavyweight LinkedIn  N LNKD  and security firm Tableau Software  N DATA  might have been the bigger concern  and everything in the tech heavy index took it on the chin  The reaction by the markets is just brutal  and one only has to look at these two companies for a typical example  They each lost over 40  of their value yesterday  which is an astonishing number  The rational investor could make the argument LinkedIn never had any business being valued at 30 billion anyway  and even at 15 billion it still has a ways to go  Ditto for Tableau  now given a value of 3 billion  as well 
The thrashing of these entities highlights one of the biggest problems the market has had for a long time  which is the excessive valuations placed on tech firms when they go public  and the low number of shares outstanding  With institutions now controlling over 90  of the stock  if they get disappointed  look out below  No kidding  huh  There are plenty of public companies facing a similar predicament  or should I say  their shareholders do  Silicon Valley has long been delusional about valuing their companies  and public markets have a way of getting rid of the froth  It further illustrates the need to be very careful about where one allocates capital 
The ramifications of the commodity collapse and currency volatility continue to ripple through markets  Barron s does an excellent job of explaining the relationship between countries running deficits and how the governments and sovereign wealth funds of these countries  China  Saudi s  Norway  may be selling assets to help bolster capital outflows  With respect to black gold  down another 8  last week  Still  in an effort to provide a little bit of sunshine  the same edition of Barron s has this nice story on oil bouncing back  no extra charge   A lot of investing is patience and fortitude  and holding anything related to oil proves it 
On the earnings front  plenty of companies reported and like always  the results were specific to the individual company  The drug sector performed nicely  although many investors are concerned about political scrutiny for pricing  Yum  Brands Inc  N YUM  and Dunkin Brands Group Inc  O DNKN  showed unhealthy food remains tasty for investors  though their stock prices did not necessarily fatten up 
Yahoo  O YHOO  remains unloved after taking billions in write downs from previous acquisitions  The story of Yahoo will ultimately play out as a negative value for a business which generates a billion bucks of cash cannot last indefinitely  though it seems like it already has  Finally  Mattel  O MAT  reported a good number and the stock popped nicely  showing the market the long popular Barbie remains a great asset  One only needs to have a little girl to understand this generational truth 
Long ago  my brother introduced me to a quote about NASCAR   If you ain t cheatin  you ain t tryin   The same could be said for politics  and last week in Iowa  it seems the campaign associates of Ted Cruz adopted the aggressive philosophy when reading about the clothing habits of Ben Carson  As Donald Trump lost the caucus  quite naturally he feels cheated  Don t you feel sorry for now victimized Mr  Trump  No mention of the hundreds of people who feel the same way about Mr  Trump when he took their real estate deposits or tuition down payments from the infamous Trump University  Oops  sorry to bring up the unfortunate incident 
As we head into tonight s debate and Tuesday s New Hampshire primary  all eyes will be on Mr  Rubio to see if he can withstand the heat from his fellow competitors  Like Mr  Munger advises  my expectations are low in the hope of a favorable outcome Thanks for reading the blog this week 
 Oops  one other thing  in my newsletter last week  there was an error in that I stated there were other places which looked better than the equity market if interest rates stayed the same and GDP remains at 2 2 5  annualized  What I meant to say was the equity market looks better than anywhere else if those conditions held  I am always a buyer of stocks  and will be for the rest of my days  Sorry about the potential confusion

10739,232254,DNKN,3 Stocks To Watch  FSLR  HA  LABU,opinion,"It was a fantastic rally after a really sharp  early opening drop  and then the market came on and closed at the highs for the day on a strong steady rally with just a little bit of pullback here and there to consolidate  It was strong  and the technicals turned around nicely as well  So  let s take a look and see what s going on with some of these stocks 
First Solar  Inc   O FSLR  had a stellar day on Wednesday on good earnings  as this stock rocketed 7 66 to 69 45  or 12 4   on 8 million shares  There was some resistance from the Jan high that came in at 69 70  and Wednesday s high was 70 57  so it made a nominal high on that  However the spike high  the highest level in a couple years  was 72 12  Let s see if it can get through that on Thursday  Going back multiple highs in the 74 range will be the key test on this one  Should that be broken  a massive basing for a couple years will have been broken 
Hawaiian Holdings Inc   O HA  is probably the strongest chart for any airline  This stock is incredible  It has gone from the 2013 low around 5 00 to nearly 43 00  On Wednesday  it was up 2 85 to 42 62  or 7   on 1 7 million shares  with an all time high of 42 84 ever reached in that stock s history  It s been up ten days in a row  Fantastic movement  good volume  great OBV  That tells me this is not done yet  Eventually  this stock could get to 56 57  Look for pullback opportunities on this one 
The Direxion Daily S P Biotech Bull 3X ETF  N LABU  is interesting  up just 14 cents to 6 19  or 2 3   on 10 million shares  But if biotech s are going to turn  this could be a big winner  because this stock has come down from the 50s to under 5 00  The double bottom moved up to resistance  backed off  and on Wednesday it had a nice reversal  The OBV is moving straight up  indicating a lot of accumulation is going on  If this stock gets through 7 70 7 75  this is a 10 dollar  eventually  and perhaps to 14 15  That will take a big rally in biotech  so keep an eye on this one

Probably not  but the chart does warrant a closer look at the print  It has built a Shark harmonic pattern  The Shark looks for a possible reversal at the  D  point at 54 75  which is nearly 20  higher  The momentum is bullish despite the sideways price action these last 3 weeks  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD is flat and positive  The squeeze in the Bollinger Bands  confirms the stock is prepped for the catalyst to come

10741,232256,DNKN,J M  Smucker  SJM  Lowers Packaged Coffee Prices By 6 ,opinion,"The J  M  Smucker Co    NYSE SJM   recently lowered packaged coffee prices of the majority of its products sold in the U S   primarily consisting of items under the Folgers and Dunkin  Donutsbrands  Smucker licenses Dunkin  Donuts from Dunkin  Brands Group  Inc    NASDAQ DNKN   
All Folgers fans will benefit from the lower pricing on an everyday basis  Ohio based Smucker has slashed prices by an average 6  on all products under the Folgers and Dunkin  Donuts brands  in response to the continuous decline in green coffee futures market  However  the price decrease does not affect K cup pods 
We note that this is the second time within a year that the biggest U S  coffee roaster has lowered its coffee prices   of the majority of its products sold in the U S  by 6   That means there has been a sustained decline in green coffee costs since July 
Per Reuters  the arabica and robusta prices were almost the same as in July  which signals that the move to cut packaged coffee prices was more than a response to declining raw material costs 
Of late  the company is struggling to compete with lower priced private label brands like Safeway Select  The Kroger Co  s    NYSE KR   Kroger and Costco Wholesale Corporation s   NASDAQ COST   Kirkland Signature  which have grabbed higher market share in recent years  In such a competitive environment  Smucker s move to slash coffee prices will help it to win more customers and boost sales 
Smucker s profitability largely depends on the price of green coffee  Coffee prices are highly volatile and are affected by weather and pest infestation  Also political decisions in coffee producing countries  worldwide supply and demand  the relative strength of the dollar  and speculative trading also influence coffee prices 
Since Jan 2014  Smucker has been witnessing a rise in green coffee costs  largely due to increasing prices of Arabica coffee due to a drought in Brazil  As a result  in Jun 2014   branded coffee products by an average 9   In Dec 2014   in the U S  by an average 8  
A hike in coffee prices led Smucker to raise the pricing of its branded roast and ground coffee offerings  which eroded its sales volume  Higher pricing of Smucker products also resulted in customers switching to cheaper brands and delaying purchases  This significantly hurt the company s coffee segment 
Nevertheless  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company experienced favorable volumes in the third quarter of fiscal 2016  driven by the cut in coffee prices in July  The recent cut in coffee prices will further boost volumes in the coming quarters ",2016-05-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/j.m.-smucker-(sjm)-lowers-packaged-coffee-prices-by-6-200132167,200132167

10743,232258,DNKN,Is This Restaurant The Next Chipotle ,opinion,"Danger Zone  El Pollo Loco  NASDAQ LOCO 
El Pollo Loco is a restaurant chain based in California that serves Mexican style grilled chicken with an emphasis on a  healthy  image  The company was founded in 1975 in Mexico  and sold to private equity firm Trimaran Capital Partners in 2005  Trimaran took Loco public in July 2014 for  15 share and investor optimism took the shares to over  41 share in August 
Since then  Loco has dropped to below  20 share  but a strong fourth quarter in 2014 took the shares up to  26  We believe that shares still have much further to fall  and that investors who think this restaurant is going to become the next Chipotle  NYSE CMG  are willfully ignoring the company s history and its current growth track 
How Good Was That Earnings Report 
Shares of El Pollo Loco had been something of a disappointment to investors since the company s IPO  but the stock received an 8  pop a week ago after a positive annual earnings report  However  this pop seems to be a case of investors thinking that any news is good news 
We looked into Loco s 2014 filing  and here s what we found 
Total sales were up almost 10  and same store sales were up 7  in 2014   not bad  but considering this company is billed as  the next Chipotle   it has a lot of slack to pick up  as we ll show later  Loco opened 15 new stores in 2014  representing 3  store growth 
Loco s net operating profit after tax  NOPAT  fell 37  in 2014 year over year  and also sits below the company s 2012 NOPAT  This fall in profits is in stark contrast to the company s reported growth in net income  which shows an increase from   8 million in 2012 to a profit of  42 million in 2014  We ll go into details of why there is such a large discrepancy between thee amounts later in this report 
While Loco s sales grew last year  its margins sank from 16  in 2013 to 9  in 2014  In line with its decline in profits  Loco s return on invested capital  ROIC  fell to 6  in 2014  down from 11  in 2013  The company generated a free cash flow loss of   13 5 million in 2014 due primarily to expenditures on new restaurants 
One Huge Issue
Aside from Loco s lackluster growth in 2014  a large problem here is that 80  of revenue was derived from the greater Los Angeles area  Furthermore  86  of Loco s stores are in California  with the rest in Nevada  Arizona  Texas  and Utah 
Why is this concentration of revenue an issue  outside of the obvious reasons  First is the coming increase in labor costs in Southern California  The minimum wage in California is increasing from  9 to  10 beginning next year  Loco s labor expense is 25  of current sales and wage hikes have already affected labor costs  raising them 7  in 2014 while the number of stores rose just over 3   Expect labor costs to continue to rise as further wage hike initiatives take effect in Los Angeles and San Diego  the latter of which just passed a resolution raising the minimum wage to  11 50 by 2017  and the former of which is considering boosting its minimum wage to over  15 
The second issue with this extreme localization is that Loco faces a 90 degree uphill battle in its expansion efforts  In the west  demographics and tastes are much different than other parts of the country and food and brands that work in one culturally distinct area of the country may not work in another  The Mexican born Loco has tried to expand out of the western U S  before  In 2009 it had 12 stores east of the Rockies in places like Atlanta  Georgia and Bergen  New Jersey  Both of these states are in the top 10 for total Hispanic population 
However  by 2012 all of those stores had closed  Expansion to the east may be even harder during Loco s second attempt  We ve learned that local tastes and incumbent restaurants can stop national expansion plans in their tracks  like  Dunkin  Brands  NASDAQ DNKN   What makes Loco think that its second expansion attempt will work any better than its first 
Another note from the earnings report is Loco s chain wide remodeling initiative  In an effort to boost its lackluster growth  Loco has remodeled 214 out of 415 total stores at end of 2014  Cost per store is estimated to be   270 000  and amounted to  8 million in 2014  a lot of money when profits are  32 million   The goal with this initiative is a  strengthened brand   but this is far from a guarantee  as we saw  
The Next Chipotle 
With headlines like  Investors Think El Pollo Loco Could Be The Next Chipotle  floating around  we d be remiss not to compare the two companies on profitability and valuation to see if expectations like these are justified 
Figure 1 shows how Loco stacks up against its closest competitors in terms of ROIC and price to economic book value  PEBV   It compares Loco against Chipotle and YUM  Brands  YUM  owns Mexican inspired chain Taco Bell and chicken restaurant KFC 
Figure 1  No True Competitor

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Not only does El Pollo Loco have the lowest ROIC among its competition  a case that should be reversed for a growing restaurant   but it is also the most highly valued stock  Loco stands at a huge disadvantage to these two companies  Not only is its food competing very closely with the offerings of Chipotle  but both Chipotle and YUM  have enormous amounts of resources at their disposal  This allows them to expand and take market share from new Loco restaurants  but also to adapt more quickly to any change in consumer tastes 
These Adjustments and Red Flags Are Why El Pollo Loco Gets Our  Very Dangerous  Rating
There are a few items that most investors are probably missing that reinforce our call on Loco 
We removed  69 million  20  of revenues  in reported non operating expenses from Loco s reported earnings in 2014  mostly due to a tax receivable agreement with Trimaran  However  we had to subsequently increase Loco s cash taxes by  89 million  to tax the higher income   which results in Loco s 2014 NOPAT being  32 million  as opposed to its GAAP net income of  42 million  Investors thinking Loco is growing profits need to look closer at the details of the financial statements  as NOPAT has actually declined since 2011 
Loco also has  136 million in off balance sheet debt due to operating leases  32  of net assets and 45  of total debt   This significantly raises Loco s total debt over its reported debt of  166 million 
Asset write downs have increased every year since 2012  from  2 million to over  14 million  3  of net assets  in 2014  If this pattern of value destruction continues  shareholders should be worried about management s capital allocation skills 
Loco is Priced for Perfection
At its current price of  27 share  LOCO has a PEBV 7 6  the fifth highest out of the 34 restaurant stocks we cover  We think it s clear that Loco doesn t have the chops   in terms of profit or profit growth   to back up its valuation 
To justify its current valuation of  26 share  Loco must nearly track the growth of Chipotle and grow NOPAT   This takes into account the company s rate of fixed assets growth to reflect Chipotle s  This 20  growth rate still doesn t quite match Chipotle s 29  NOPAT growth rate since going public  but it gets close 
What about if Loco can t match Chipotle s track record  If Loco can grow NOPAT by a still impressive 14  compounded annually for the next nine years    a 37  downside  This is what we call  priced for perfection   and anything less than perfection could mean disaster for shareholders 
Weak Bull Case
The bull case for Loco seems to rest mainly on the company becoming the next Chipotle  The two restaurants serve Mexican inspired food that appeals to the  healthy  set  The valuation reflects this  but as we ve discussed  the odds of this one becoming the next Chipotle are slim to none 
Loco is expecting to add 27 restaurants in 2015  for a growth rate of 7  and targets 8 10  annual growth in stores long term  The much more mature Chipotle expects to grow new stores by 11  12  next year  Also  Chipotle s revenue has grown at a 22  compounded annual growth rate  CAGR  since 2011  Loco s revenue CAGR is only 8  since 2011 
In addition  Chipotle s same store sales still rose in 2014  while El Pollo Loco s are falling  7 0  in 2014 to guidance of 3 5  for 2015   Loco is not growing at anywhere near the pace of Chipotle  historically or going forward 
Several Likely Catalysts
The restaurant industry is fast moving and complex and there are a number of catalysts that could stop Loco s stock in its tracks  We ve already mentioned that increasing labor costs will impact Loco s bottom line and panicky investors and institutions could dump the stock after any more minimum wage hikes 
Finally  if Loco attempts another expansion on the east coast  and this expansion fails once again  we think this will be the nail in the coffin for Loco s stock  as there will be little hope after this that the company can make good on its  and its stock s  growth promises  We d like to ask  What makes investors think this time  Loco s expansion will turn out any differently 
Little Stupid Money Risk
With its paltry cash balance and high valuation  we don t think it s likely El Pollo Loco will be acquired anytime soon 
At the moment  the company doesn t pay a dividend or issue a buyback  We think this is an unlikely strategy given the company s limited resources 
Insiders Selling Is Big
In the past 12 months  there have been no insider buys  but seven insider sells worth  184 million  which represents 19  of the company s market value  Some of this is due to insiders jumping ship  but much of this is due to El Pollo Loco s private equity firm Trimaran Capital Partners cashing in its gains after the company s IPO 
Short Interest
Short interest stands at 3 8 million shares  or over 28  of float

10745,232260,DNKN,Top Trade Ideas For The Week Of July 6  2015  CBOE  DHR  DNKN  JOE,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
CBOE  Ticker  NASDAQ CBOE
CBOE had a long pullback guided by falling trend resistance until finding a bottom in May  It broke that trend with a move higher and has been consolidating against resistance since  Friday saw the price back at resistance and above the rising 200 day SMA  It has support for more upside from a rising and bullish RSI and a MACD about to cross up 
Danaher  Ticker  NYSE DHR
Danaher rose off of the October 2014 low quickly  but then consolidated for the last 7 months  It has a false break out over resistance in May that did not last even one day  but continued a broad series of higher highs and higher lows  The RSI remains in the bullish zone and is rising with the MACD crossed up and rising 
Dunkin  Brands  Ticker  NASDAQ DNKN
Dunkin  Brands was on the radar for a trade higher after the Cup it formed in May  The price did move higher but stopped short of the target of the Cup and Handle pattern at 56 75  Or has it  Now the price is consolidating against resistance with a bullish and rising RSI and a rising MACD  Not how all the SMA s are rising and parallel  a great trend 
St  Joe  Ticker  NYSE JOE
St  Joe had a long run lower to a bottom in January  It looked to be consolidating then and broke out to the upside  But the move back higher out of consolidation turned out to be a Dead Cat bounce and it started back lower  Now it has consolidated again for the last 6 weeks and is back against resistance  As it arrives the RSI is pushing into the bullish zone and rising while the MACD is rising 
Qlik Technologies  Ticker  NASDAQ QLIK
Qlik Technologies started a move higher out of consolidation in February  The rise stalled out in May and it moved sideways until a pullback that ended last week  The last red candle  out of the Bollinger Bands  makes it interesting as a possible reversal  The following Harami Hammer doji adds to it  the confirmation higher and back into the Bollinger Bands with follow through Friday seals the deal  The RI is rising as well now with only the MACD diverging  But even that is starting to slow its descent 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the heat of Summer sees the Equity markets looking vulnerable on the short time frame and just sideways on the longer timeframe Elsewhere look for gold to continue the broad consolidation with a downward bias while crude oil looks to move lower  The US Dollar Index looks to continue to consolidate in a tightening range sideways while US Treasuries are consolidating but biased lower  The Shanghai Composite is crashing and shows no sign of letting up yet while Emerging Markets may be bouncing in their downtrend  Volatility looks to remain low but above recent levels and with a risk of more upside easing the tailwind it has given the equity indexes The ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  themselves all appear vulnerable on the daily timeframe with the QQQ the strongest looking flat  On the longer timeframe the QQQ is also looking the strongest but has pulled back to trend support with the IWM looking weaker  Perhaps some rotation out of small caps and into technology and larger caps to come  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

10746,232261,DNKN,Are Cost Control Measures Driving Consumer Staples ,opinion,"The global financial crisis of 2008 threatened the existence of a number of key industry players  But many companies in the consumer staples sector managed to survive on the back of effective cost control initiatives  inorganic growth and share buybacks  A gradual recovery in the European economy last year and the strengthening of the U S  dollar are also showing up in the results of these companies 
For example  soda giants the Coca Cola Company  NYSE KO   PepsiCo  Inc   NYSE PEP  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group  Inc   NYSE DPS  have outperformed expectations in the first half of 2014 driven by aggressive marketing initiatives  cost containment and improved productivity  A sequential improvement in beverage volumes in the second quarter of 2014 was the highlight of the quarter  which impressed investors  Buoyed by the strong performance in the reported quarter  Dr Pepper Snapple and Pepsi raised their earnings outlook for full year 2014  We also believe that these companies will keep the momentum going in the second half 
Food company McCormick   Co   Inc   NYSE MKC  has also been benefiting from significant cost savings and share buybacks  The company has also raised its fiscal year earnings forecast on the back of solid fundamentals 
Below  we discuss some of these key reasons and what investors in the consumer staple sector can look forward to seeing in the coming months 
OPPORTUNITIES
 Innovations
In a crowded and competitive space  consumer product companies need to regularly innovate and upgrade their brands to create differentiated value propositions for their customers and to remain successful 
Innovation has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter   Gamble Co   NYSE PG   P G believes that consistent product innovation  supported by strong marketing and commercialization  will help deliver stronger results over the long term  Notably  the company spends around  14 billion on marketing annually 
Cereal maker General Mills Inc  NYSE GIS  and global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co  NYSE TAP  also has been launching new products to boost revenues  Meanwhile  Keurig Green Mountain  Inc  s  NASDAQ GMCR  newly launched Keurig 2 0 brewing machine is expected to counter competition as only its licensed K Cups work in the model 
Shifting Focus on Health and Wellness and  Good for You  Products
The companies are also shifting focus to make healthier and nutritious products in view of increasing health consciousness  rising obesity concerns and growing regulatory pressures 
Most recently  on Sept  24  three of America s largest soft drink makers    The Coca Cola Company  PepsiCo  Inc  and Dr Pepper Snapple Group  Inc     pledged to reduce calories in their beverages by 20  by 2025  Accordingly  the companies agreed to promote bottled water  no or lower calorie beverages and smaller portion sizes to its consumers  Coca Cola s bottler Coca Cola Enterprises Inc   NYSE CCE  is also slowly shifting its product mix from colas to energy drinks and other non carbonated beverages 
Food company B G Foods  Inc   NYSE BGS  and General Mills also plan to roll out more nutritious products in 2014  Natural and organic food beverages maker The WhiteWave Foods Company  NYSE WWAV  and United Natural Foods  Inc   NASDAQ UNFI  have been benefiting from strong demand of natural organic food products and expects to continue to gain from the natural organic food revolution 
Food and beverage companies are not the only ones trying to shift to healthier options  Tobacco companies like Lorillard Inc  NYSE LO   Altria Group Inc   NYSE MO  and Reynolds American Inc  NYSE RAI  are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes  e cigarettes  
Divestitures and Restructuring Initiatives
Most consumer staples companies are divesting low margin brands and implementing cost reduction initiatives in order to boost profits  These initiatives help companies to reduce the effects of inflating commodity costs and other input costs  which have remained a drag on margins of most companies in this sector 
The Procter   Gamble Company recently announced to divest 90 to 100 brands over the next two years whose sales and profits have been declining over the past three years in order to be a more focused company  Consumer giant Unilever NV  NYSE UN  has divested many businesses since more than a year to concentrate on its core products portfolio 
Kimberly Clark Corp   NYSE KMB  has also decided to spin off its health care business  which has been operating on low margins and has been witnessing decelerated sales growth since the last few quarters  In May  snacking giant Mondelez International  Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ  announced a spin off proposal for its coffee business to Netherlands based coffee company  D E Master Blenders 1753 in order to concentrate on its core snacks business 
Expansion in Emerging Markets
Besides costs saving initiatives  many consumer staples companies are shifting their focus to emerging markets to boost sales  Relative to the mature North American and European markets  emerging markets such as Brazil  India  China  Mexico  Russia and Southeast Asia are still untapped  Moreover  consumer spending in these markets is also increasing  The rising pool of middle class consumers in emerging markets represents a huge opportunity for these companies 
Tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  has a significant presence in a large number of markets and enjoys robust growth in Asia  Indonesia  Pakistan  China  Philippines and Korea  while PepsiCo generates around 45  of its revenues outside the U S  Cereal maker Kellogg Company  NYSE K  has tripled its emerging market business over the last decade  The Pringles acquisition in June 2012 consolidated its position in some of the fast growing regions 
Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships
Many consumer staple companies are regularly carrying out acquisitions both domestically and internationally to expand their existing customer base and product lines into new markets  Some of them are also forming partnerships to take a lead in this challenging environment 
In late August  Tyson Foods  Inc  NYSE TSN  completed its much talked about merger with packaged meat producer  The Hillshire Brands Company  thereby inking the biggest deal in the meat industry 
Likewise  cigarette maker Reynolds American is close to acquiring the third largest U S  cigarette company  Lorillard  While a combination of these two tobacco giants will possibly create one of the strongest global tobacco companies  regulators could object to the deal to protect the U S  tobacco industry from becoming a duopoly 
Food distributor Sysco Corp  s  NYSE SYY  merger with US Foods   the second largest player in the foodservice distribution industry   is also undergoing a regulatory review process by the Federal Trade Commission and may require Sysco and US Foods to divest assets to competitors  The merger can create one of the largest food companies in the country giving Sysco increased size and scale in this low margin business and will also provide significant cost savings opportunities 
A new wave of consolidation in the brewing industry is also expected in the near term  Speculations are rife that the world s largest brewing company  Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV  NYSE BUD  aka AB InBev  is seeking finances to buy the second largest  SABMiller plc  OTC SBMRY  
Keurig Green Mountain has also formed several strategic agreements with coffee and beverage companies like The Coca Cola Co   Kraft Foods Group  Inc   NASDAQ KRFT   The J  M  Smucker Company  NYSE SJM   Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX   Unilever plc  NYSE UL   Eight O Clock and Dunkin  Donuts by Dunkin  Brands Group Inc   NASDAQ DNKN  to offer signature hot drinks of these companies in its K cups and Vue packs 
Bottom Line
As you can see  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the consumer staples industry over the long haul  How about investing in this space right now ",2014-10-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-cost-control-measures-driving-consumer-staples-228913,228913
10747,232262,DNKN,Weak September Jobs Report Confirms Lower For Longer,opinion,"Whenever a family goes on a road trip  or perhaps a gentleman persuades a lovely female for a leisurely drive along a breathtakingly scenic place near a natural wonder of the world  there is the chance a bit of discord can enter in these best laid plans  As someone who experienced the phenomenon more than once  the uncomfortable words of the proverbial back seat driver can be a bit difficult for someone who  as Mr  Rubio has famously mentioned of the Donald  might be  thin skinned   So  when thinking about the big event in financial markets yesterday  the September jobs report  it was only natural there would be plenty of second guessing from market participants  Sure enough  when the anticipated number came in at 142 thousand jobs created  well short of the expected 190k  oh boy  the jackals were out in force  Way too much government involvement  too little clarity  too many voices  too much regulation  too much debt  and on and on they went  Very much  like  yes  the proverbial back seat driver  Imagine that 


The vast implications from the jobs report for all global markets was felt immediately  Here in the states  equity futures markets dropped dramatically  and the market opened down over two hundred points  Bond yields  which had been inching up  fell hard as the ten year fell below 2  to finish at a whopping 1 99   down 2 6  on the day   The dollar  which has been strong  stronger  and strongest  sold off against nearly every major currency  the euro  the pound  the yen  and even the Brazilian real  which does not ever go up  ever  never  Even oil rallied  which is in the same camp as the real 


As market participants digested the report  it occurred to them  that  low and behold  maybe dreaded lift off was not inevitable  and the equity market not only recovered  but finished the day up two hundred points  If ever the schizophrenic nature of equity markets was on display in one day  yesterday was it  Looking forward  if yesterdays trend towards dollar weakness continues  it certainly will help the energy sector and anything tied to emerging markets  Financials will suffer some  because lift off is what that area has been patiently waiting for quite some time  So  in sum  we leave the week where we started the week  which is with uncertainty  The more things change  the more they stay the same 


So  where does this now leave us  especially those of us not in the back seat  but driving the car  er  portfolio  Well  for those of you friends who have been reading the blog for a while  you know the prediction of lower for longer  especially with respect to interest rates  has been a dominant theme  In the futures market  the heaviest odds have moved for interest rates to begin lifting in March of 16  versus some time this year  Some believe the jobs report was misleading and future revisions will show it  though when labor force participation rates hover at a bit above 60 ish  at nearly 10 year lows  hard to be impressed with job growth  It also means the idea of inflation popping up any time soon is totally wrong  The fed is fighting deflation  and has been for a long time  Many professionals have long accurately diagnosed the predicament  Those of you part time economists out there  or maybe friends of yours who fit the description  might do better to pack up the car for the annual road trip  Sorry if that one stings  no offense meant 


News from individual companies was sparse this week  Micron Technology Inc  NASDAQ MU  reported a better than expected number but revenues were down because of weak personal computer demand  Dunkin Brands Group Inc  NASDAQ DNKN  had it s annual investor day and reported they are closing 100 stores over the next few years  On a store base of 19 000  the news really is de minimus and when the stock lost 12  that day  it again shows the market shoots first and ask questions later  If you are trying to find mispriced assets  the constant negativity helps provide a fertile environment for these dislocations  As an example  a few years ago a company called Diamond Foods Inc  NASDAQ DMND  was bashed on accounting concerns  and the stock fell from a high of 73 down to below 15 bucks  It reported earnings this week and it is considering breaking itself up  It closed yesterday above 30  Did we buy it on the dip  I don t usually kiss and tell  but no  I did not  However  it is reflective of the opportunities the market does present  Of course  you have to make the decision you want to own these companies  which is tough when the world is ending 

I noticed this week the Senate Banking Committee voted to approve energy exports after the South Dakota Senator made the motion  Earlier in the year  the same situation happened with the Energy Committee  only the motion was made by the Senator from Alaska  All other Democrats voted no  same as the banking panel  Naturally  the big O said he would veto both bills if they passed  and Democrats in the Senate filibustered the bill  Just a small example of why people are a bit frustrated at the current administration s hostility toward the energy industry  Of course  those on the other side of the aisle would just say the other party are back seat drivers  Thanks for reading the blog this week ",2015-10-04,Yale Bock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weak-september-jobs-report-confirms-lower-for-longer-267008,267008

What to watch  This week we get a further read on the core health of the US consumer and their willingness to make large ticket purchases for their homes  The housing sector performed well throughout the third quarter  however New Home Sales fell in September  Homebuilders such as DR Horton  N DHI  released better than expected results last week  also boding well for the home improvement retailers  While consumers have more money in their pockets due to an improving jobs situation and lower oil prices  they have been very choosy with how they allocate their discretionary income  Home prices remain high  and as prices appreciate consumers typically invest in their properties  During the first half of the year  Home Depot reported solid same store sales of 6   as well as increased customer traffic and average guest spend  The home improvement retailer continues to steal market share from it s main competitor  Lowe s  N LOW   which is still dealing with negative headlines from carrying Chinese laminate flooring that contained formaldehyde  a possible carcinogen  Home Depot also only has domestic locations  while Lowe s has stores in Mexico and Canada and could suffer from the stronger dollar

The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 98  in line with Wall Street  but one penny below corporate guidance  Revenues are nearly in line at  117 64 

What to expect  On October 14 the world s largest retailer announced that full year sales would be flat  a drop in what was previously expected  The company blamed the decrease in guidance on the strong U S  dollar and increases in costs such as employee wages  Wal Mart announced in February that they were raising their entry wage to  9 an hour  and that by February 2016 all employees would earn at least  10 hour  In the wake of the announcement on lower guidance  the stock plunged 10  to a three year low as investors became leery of the excuses given by the retailer  Competition from Amazon  O AMZN  has become almost too much for Wal Mart to bear  and as such they are planning to funnel over  1B into ecommerce and digital platforms next year in order to combat sluggish sales and slowing traffic  Wal Mart began offering an unlimited shipping membership for  50 annually  but does not offer the other perks of Amazon Prime  Since the October 14 announcement  Estimize EPS expectations for fiscal Q3 2016 have dropped 3 cents and revenues are down  553M

What to watch  Salesforce continues to show solid growth in the cloud space despite its maturity  This year  CRM has been on a spending spree  however  heavily investing in new data centers and digital marketing efforts and covering costs related to international expansion and headwinds from currency fluctuations  all impacting gross margins and the bottom line  The third quarter is expected to benefit from the success of popular products such as Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform and the recently launched Salesforce 1 Customer Platform  Salesforce is also making a play for social  launching a new set of tools in Q2 to help marketers engage with customers on Instagram by using their suite of Marketing Cloud products  The most important number to watch for is Salesforce s is their backlog of booked business  which stood at  9 2 billion as of the August quarter  a 26  growth rate YoY  Being a pioneer in the cloud space means that Salesforce trades at a premium  with a forward P E of 104  much higher than competitors

The Estimize community is looking for EPS of  0 72  only a penny better than the Wall Street consensus  but a penny behind corporate guidance  Revenues of  1 023B are actually behind the Street s  1 030B 

What to watch  Keurig Green Mountain has reported three consecutive quarters of missed earnings and revenue results due to lower sales in the portion pack category this year  The new Keurig 2 0 brewer that launched a year ago was not received well due to the high price point  and only works with licensed K cup pods  not other brands as previous models did  While GMCR still remains dominant in the single brew category  it is losing market share to the likes of Starbucks  O SBUX  and Kraft Heinz  O KHC   As a result  the company has made several strategic partnerships this year with the likes of Laughing Man Coffee  and in the past year with Target s  N TGT  Archer Farms brand  BJ s Wellsley Farms brand and Nestle  VX NESN   and earlier this year expanded partnership with Dunkin Brands  O DNKN  and JM Smucker  N SJM   The company was hoping it s newest product  Keurig KOLD  would help regain sales  but it was not as well received by the public as hoped  Complaints around the first iteration of KOLD ranged from the machine being too large and loud  taking too long to cool down  pods that don t always work  and flavors that are off  As a result the stock is down 67  this year ",2015-11-16,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-11-16---hd,-wmt,-dks,-crm,-gmcr-271532",271532
10749,232264,DNKN,Earnings Watch  High Stakes For Keurig Green Mountain,opinion,"After today s closing bell  Keurig Green Mountain  O GMCR  will release results for FQ4 2015  and the stakes are high  After three consecutive quarters of missing earnings and revenue expectations  investors are looking for improved fundamentals  Currently the Estimize community anticipates EPS of  0 71  a cent higher than the Wall Street consensus  yet two cents lower than company guidance  Adding to the mounting pressure is the fact that earnings estimates have fallen 5 cents in the last month as analysts have continually revised downward  Revenues expectations are in line at  1 025B  a decrease of  177M since the Q2 report 

Keurig seems to be struggling in a couple of areas  Reverberations of the Keurig 2 0 flop are still felt nearly a year and a half after its initial launch  The latest brewer was not well received due to its high price point and the fact that it was only licensed to work with K cup pods  not third party brands as previous models did  Even though the company reissued new models that now accept other pods  the backlash continues  with brewer sales plunging 26  last quarter 
K cup pod sales also fell 1  last quarter  While the decision to allow the second iteration of Keurig 2 0 to accept competitor pods was made in order to sell brewers  it came at the expense of selling K cup pods  Competition for pods continues to heat up from the likes of Starbucks  O SBUX   Kraft Heinz  O KHC  and others  The company s strategy has been to keep their enemies close  even partnering with Target s  N TGT  Archer Farms brand  BJ s Wellsley Farms brand and Nestle  VX NESN   and earlier this year expanding its partnership with Dunkin Brands  O DNKN  and JM Smucker  N SJM  

While trying to increase their product offering  Keurig seems to have hit another wall  Keurig Kold was officially introduced on September 29  a machine that promises  Chilled beverages at the push of a button   Once again  this product was not well received by the public  Complaints around the first iteration of Kold ranged from the machine being too large and loud  taking too long to cool down  pods that don t always work  and flavors that are off  The biggest complaint  once again  is around price  At  300 for the machine  and then  1 per pod  the price alienates a large swath of potential consumers  Compare that to it s nearest competitor  Sodastream  O SODA   which prices a similar offering between  80    200 
We ll be listening in for FY 2016 guidance this afternoon  as the company continually lowered fiscal 2015 guidance after the last few failed reports  As a result of all these troubles  the stock has fallen nearly 70  this year

Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports December 8  after the close 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 21  4 cents above the Wall Street estimate  Even revenue estimates of  132 89 are higher than the Street s expectation for  132 77 

What to watch  In five of the past seven quarters  Krispy Kreme has missed earnings expectations  Despite showing total revenue growth of 5 6  last quarter  revenues still missed analyst projections by more than  4M  As health concerns are taking over the US  sugary indulgences like donuts have an uncertain future as demand continues to wane  Despite this uncertainty  the company continues to expand as new stores are popping up and same store sales increased annually by 5 5  
If the company is experiencing revenue and sales growth  what is the problem  Part of Krispy Kreme s earnings dilemma is its business model  Unlike major competitor Dunkin Brands  O DNKN   Krispy Kreme does not operate a full franchise model  Rather  a majority of stores are company owned  Furthermore  operating margins are weak  hovering around 10   Krispy Kreme shares are down roughly 30  year to date 
Smith   Wesson  O SWHC 
Consumer Discretionary   Leisure Equipment   Products   Reports December 8  after the close 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 23  three cents above the Wall Street consensus  Revenues of  139 68M are slightly above the Street s expectation for  137 90M 

What to watch  For a good part of 2012 and 2013  fears in the US that tighter firearm laws were on the horizon helped drive sales for Smith   Wesson  As those fears began to dissipate in 2014  sales of guns and ammunition suffered  This year  however  Smith   Wesson has returned to year over year earnings and revenue growth  putting up double digit EPS growth of 23  and sales growth of 12  in their latest quarter 
During that period the company saw higher sales in both the firearm and accessories divisions  with firearms driven by robust orders for  M P 15 Sport rifles  Thompson Center Venture bolt action rifles and M P Shield polymer pistols   That growth should have carried over into the reporting quarter  as Q3 2015 Federal background checks were up 4  year over year  with the FBI processing a record of 1 98M applications in October alone  Even so  competitors such as Sturm Ruger   Company  N RGR  reported a 13 cent miss on EPS when they reported two weeks ago  yet beat on sales

The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  1 20  three cents above the Wall Street consensus  Revenues are a little more muted  with Estimize looking for  27 81B   only  179M  or less than 1   above the Street s expectation 

What to watch  Costco will have some momentum heading into its report   Just yesterday the bulk grocery chain posted better than expected same store sales for the month of November  Comparable store sales for the last month of the fiscal Q1 2016 only came in flat  but that was better than the  1  analysts were anticipating  The retailer has been hurt by lower gasoline sales due to price deflation  as well as the negative impact of foreign currency translation 
Excluding both of those factors  same store sales ended up at 6  versus the year ago period  Costco has been able to maintain a steady traffic pattern due to its loyal membership base  although there have been concerns around deep discounts and promotions as they engage in a pricing war with competitors such as Wal Mart  N WMT  and Target  N TGT   American Express  N AXP  was recently dropped as the exclusive credit card accepted at Costco due to the high transaction fees  the company instead striking a deal with Visa  N V  and Citigroup  N C   This new deal will cut credit card fees close to zero and the savings will not be minuscule by any means 
Investors should expect updates on the massive E  Coli scare that has affected Costco and many of its competitors  as well restaurants such as Starbucks  O SBUX  and Chipotle  N CMG   and has lead to the recall of over 155k items

10758,232273,DNKN,Smucker s At 52 Week High On Strong Q4 Earnings   Volumes,opinion,"Shares of The J M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   reached a new 52 week high of  147 19 on Jun 22  since the company announced upbeat fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jun 9  Shares of this food company eventually closed at  147 09 
Strong Results
J M Smucker posted better than expected fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results  wherein both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  primarily driven by gains from the acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands  gains from canned milk divestiture and favorable volumes owing to lower green coffee costs 
Earnings of  1 86 per share were significantly better than a loss in the prior year quarter owing to the benefit from Big Heart operations and a gain from the U S  canned milk divestiture  Impressive top line growth and improvement in operating profits also aided earnings growth 
Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 25  year over year to  1 81 billion  The increase was driven by the acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands and contribution from Dunkin  Donuts K Cup pods  launched in May 2015   Smucker licenses Dunkin  Donuts from Dunkin  Brands Group  Inc    NASDAQ DNKN   
The acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands contributed  336 9 million to fourth quarter sales  Excluding Big Heart  the impact from foreign currency exchange  and the impact of the U S  canned milk divestiture  net sales increased 5  
The company witnessed a favorable volume mix driven by the contribution from Dunkin  Donuts K Cup pods  However  net price realization was slightly lower due to lower net pricing on coffee  which was mostly offset by increases in several other categories SMUCKER JM Price    
We note that strong organic sales growth  product innovation and constant efforts to expand through acquisitions have remained Smucker s strong points  The recent acquisitions  the launch of Dunkin Donuts K cup pods  expanding distribution for the Natural Balance pet brand are fueling sales and are expected to continue the trend in fiscal 2017  The divestiture of its US canned milk brands and operations to Eagle Family Foods Group will allow the company to focus on key brands and growth opportunities 
Encouragingly  the Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company is witnessing growth in coffee volumes owing to further lowering of coffee price and increase from sales of Dunkin Donuts K Cup pods 
However  currency headwinds remain a concern for Smucker  The company also remains concerned with heightened competitive activity in the pet food business 
Meanwhile  investors may also have a look at these well ranked food stocks such as Omega Protein Corp    NYSE OME   and B G Foods  Inc    NYSE BGS    both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ",2016-06-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/smucker's-at-52-week-high-on-strong-q4-earnings---volumes-200137891,200137891

10784,232299,DNKN,The Breakfast Wars  McDonald s  Yum  Brands  Starbucks,opinion,"The battle for breakfast is heating up in microwave ovens and deep fryers all across the country  Taco Bell recently rolled out an ad campaign featuring men named Ronald McDonald professing their love for Taco Bell s new breakfast menu including the Waffle Taco and AM Crunch Wrap 
The army of Ronald McDonalds singing their praises of Taco Bell is aggressive  but it isn t original  Jack in the Box introduced the idea in an ad campaign back in 2002 which showcased a Ronald McDonald and a Vopper family  like Whopper  get it    commenting about how delicious Jack in the Box burgers are  Taco Bell s attack on McDonald s and the rollout of its breakfast menu are first strikes in a fast food war over breakfast  McDonald s has countered swiftly and decisively by offering its breakfast customers a free cup of McCafe joe 
McDonald s has held onto a substantial piece of the breakfast market since it introduced the Egg McMuffin back in 1975  Market research firm Technomic estimates that McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  s currently controls about 31  of the fast food breakfast market  However  last quarter the Big Mac seller missed analyst estimates on revenue by  18 million dollars citing lousy weather and  challenging industry dynamics   
 
Taco Bell restaurants are a part of Yum  Brands company  Yum  also licenses or operates KFC  Pizza Hut  and WingStreet restaurants  Since none of these chains have viable breakfast options  launching a breakfast menu through Taco Bell offers a great way for YUM  to compete with McDonald s on the most important meal of the day 
But if McDonald s thought last quarter was challenging  things are really going to get tough this quarter  Breakfast sales account for 31  of McDonald s revenue and that segment is under siege  Taco Bell has initiated a fast food duel while red hot Starbucks continues to add food options to its menu  Starbucks already attracts millions of customers each morning for coffee so offering food to its java addicted faithful is an attractive possibility  
At the beginning of this month Businessweek reported that Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX  is adding  four new breakfast sandwiches  ham and swiss on a croissant  spinach  sun dried tomatoes  and cheese on ciabatta  egg and cheddar on toast  and a lower calorie egg white  bacon  and cheese on English muffin   McDonald s is getting squeezed on breakfast by both higher end competitors and fast food peers  

Starbucks has grown both EPS and revenue on a quarter over quarter basis in each of the past 8 quarters  Dunkin  Donuts  Dunkin Brands Group Inc  NASDAQ DNKN   has also been on fire reporting increased earnings and sales on 15 16 opportunities over the past 2 years  The popularity of getting coffee at fast restaurants has surged and McDonald s wants a piece of that pie   When new competitors enter your industry one of the most effective ways to fight back is by offering sales and promotions to lower prices and attract both new and returning customers  Giving away a small cup of coffee is cheap and it may help McDonald s get more customers in the door  McDonald s could also be making a broader play by attacking the thriving coffee business of both Dunkin  Donuts and Starbucks  McCafe coffee isn t too shabby after all and a lot of people will be trying it for the first time because its being given away for free

10785,232300,DNKN,S P 500 Back And Fill  1900 On Tap,opinion,"The S P 500 closed lower yesterday for the first time in seven trading days  losing 4 16 or  0 22   The Dow Jones Industrials fell 12 72 points or 0 08  and the NASDAQ Composite lost 34 49 points  or  0 83  

Several times during yesterday s early selloff I told the MrTopStep trading room that while the S P may sell off a bit I didn t get the feel that it would be very broad  It was clear that despite that  minor  selloff there was little to no volume attached to the decline  In fact  total volume including Globex pre market volume was 998 000 contracts traded or  less than 1 mil   a common trader s benchmark  It s a rarity to see volume that low  but in the new world trading order that seems to be the way the game is worked  When the S P sells off hard the volumes return but once the E mini  CME ESM14  starts going back up the volume disappears 
Yesterday it was clear to see that some of the big name stocks like Dow Chemical Company  NYSE DOW   which closed up  0 90  after it reported a 65  gain in first quarter profits  or Boeing Company  NYSE BA   which closed up 2 4  after the company beat core earning forecasts and ended up the best  gainer  in the Dow  were major drivers  But it wasn t just those two names that kept the markets together  It was the big name earnings like Facebook and and Google  that reported after the close  which led to a big push higher for the S P in the aftermarket 
I have said many times that I am not here to supply you levels  I am here to provide you with a feeling  and that feeling is telling me the S P is on its way to S P 1900  Despite the Fed cutting back on its quantitative easing   bond buying program  the S P closed less than 1 2  from its all time contract high of 1897 28  As I said to the Pit Bull yesterday  there is no place for investors to go but stocks

It s my feeling that  based on the low volume and overall price action of the S P  it wants to continue higher  At 2 30AM  when I wrote the first draft of today s View  the E mini  CME ESM14  was up 7 bucks at 1880 00  Our call is you can sell the rallies and buy weakness or you can just wait for the S P to pull back and buy it  There are several areas of stops from 1879 00 to 1884 00 and above 1886 00 all the way up to 1896 00  As always  please keep an eye on the 10 handle rule and please use stops when trading futures and options  Given the ranges we ve seen the past week  10 handle moves in either direction  1870 or 1890  are a distinct possibility

I have a lot of names that could possible trigger today   I don t look at charts in your conventional cookie cutter manner  or have rules as to where the stock should be whether its 15  off its 52 week highs or above or below certain moving averages etc 
Every morning I go through a few of my scans to find buy candidates for the day   Depending on the current state of the market the size of the list will vary  usually its no more than 50 names   My process is based on market structure not on beliefs or myths of what works  or what doesn t work   They are certain behavioral patterns that have been around for 100 years that are based on market structure  these behavioral patterns are recognizable  observable  and quantifiable   On daily basis we have 5 000 liquid stocks that we filter based on certain market structures that gives us an edge of a higher probability than a random outcome   Once the list is narrowed to a handful of names the market will further narrow down the list by getting us in or keeping us out of these names with a range expansion move 
These are what I consider very  tight set ups  that will trigger if  and only they break yesterday s high   On a regular trading day I would indiscriminately take every trigger because you just don t know which one will be the big winner  you might have an idea but in the end you don t know 
Put these names on your trading platform  set the alerts at yesterday s high for each name  once the alert goes off take a look at the chart  decided within 3 seconds whether or not you are going to buy it  decide how much you want to risk on the trade and your stop loss  hit the buy button  and leave the rest up to the market  wash  rinse  repeat

10794,232309,DNKN,How Will The Rising Cost Of Coffee Affect Your Cup Of Joe ,opinion,"With the World Cup just over a week away  hordes of revelers are about to descend upon Brazil  The party is about to get started  but Brazilian farmers may be more excited about rain than incoming soccer fans  After a drought in Brazil and a devastating fungus known as rust swept Central American ravaging the coffee crop  there are concerns that the coffee supply will not keep up with international demand this year  causing a spike in prices  On Tuesday some of those fears were realized as J  M  Smucker Co   NYSE SJM  announced it s raising the price of its packaged coffee products sold through the Folgers and Dunkin  Donuts  NASDAQ DNKN  brands by an average of 9   Fear not Dunkin Donuts regulars  the price hike only applies to packaged products sold in grocery stores  not the cup you get each morning from a Dunkin  Donuts location 

Coffee Arabica Price data by YCharts
Brazil has been the largest supplier of coffee in the world for the past 150 years  Typically the largest company in South America and the 5th most populous country in the world provides about one third of the global coffee supply  Brazil usually produces between 50 and 55 million bags of coffee weighing 60 kilograms each  Because of the drought this year Brazil s coffee industry association  ABIC  cut its national production estimates to as low as 47 million bags  The coffee production outlook doesn t look much better in Central America either as the coffee rust fungus may destroy up to 40  of the crop there 

The J  M  Smucker company sells a variety of food products in addition to coffee including jams and jellies  peanut butter  ice cream toppings  beverages  baking mixes  and others  So making inferences about the effect of rising coffee prices on the company s overall fundamentals can be tricky 
With all other things being equal  raising the price of end coffee products sold should result in a higher gross margin  the key question is  how will Smuckers s sales be affected  The question is a matter of the price elasticity of demand for coffee  The price elasticity of demand for a good is the   change in quantity demanded over the   change in price of that good 
Common economic wisdom holds that the most important factor in determining if consumers will spend more money overall  display inelastic demand  with a price hike is a lack of viable substitute goods  Coffee drinkers tend to get characterized as fiends  but it could be true that with a 9  hike in the price of coffee would result in more than 10  of J  M  Smucker s consumers satisfying their java demand by switching to other brands  or an entirely separate caffeinated commodity like tea  This would result in lower quarterly revenue for J  M  Smucker if their other food categories performed exactly as expected 


On the other hand  coffee shop chains like Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and Dunkin  Brands will probably be less willing to change their consumer coffee prices because of an increase in the cost of the coffee commodity  In their most recent quarterly earnings releases Starbucks and Dunkin  Donuts reported year over year EPS gains of 17  and 14  respectively  The fundamentals at both of the companies are performing very well right now and all coffee shop chains benefit from the higher margins consumers are willing to pay for coffee  a relatively inexpensive beverage 
Dunkin  Donuts  Starbucks  and a few other smaller players are in a coffee war though  and raising prices 9 10  at the counter could be a kiss of death  Coffee buyers tend to be loyal and habitual customers that purchase their cup of joe from the same spot before work each morning  or once every week on either Mondays or Fridays  Bumping up the price of daily coffee runs by 25c per cup could be enough of a change to get customers curious about giving the other coffee shop chain a shot  And that s the last thing in the world Dunkin  Donuts and Starbucks want to deal with right now  so it s more likely that will suck up the higher cost of arabica coffee and take a hit in their profit margins and EPS  with all other things equal 
Do you agree with the thesis that Starbucks and Dunkin  Donuts will leave consumer prices alone despite the rising cost of coffee this year  And how will rising costs at the grocery store affect the financial performance of coffee products like the ones sold by J  M  Smucker  Head over to the Estimize com platform to submit your own estimates and see how you stack up to Wall Street and the pros in predicting the year ahead in java ",2014-06-05,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-will-the-rising-cost-of-coffee-affect-your-cup-of-joe-215012,215012
10805,232320,DNKN,Coffee Wars Intensify As Coffee Prices Rise,opinion,"If you cannot get through the day without that cup of coffee  you may need to prepare to spend a little more to get it 
Coffee prices have been surging  up more than 30  year over year  The cost to have that morning cup of java has edged higher  but not at the same rate as the cash price of coffee 
The coffee industry is a multibillion dollar industry in the United States and is a competitive marketplace  but at the top of the coffee heap is Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX   which has developed into an iconic brand both domestically and worldwide  In Asia  Europe  and Latin America  no matter where you are  it seems there s a Starbucks near you  In China  the brand is rapidly growing  and the company plans to expand in this region with thousands of outlets 
Starbucks has also expanded into providing more menu alternatives and is involved in the tea market via its acquisition of the Teavana chain  The company is also marketing juices and operates a small chain of hamburger outlets in California 
For long term investors  you cannot go wrong with Starbucks  which could serve as a good core holding in your portfolio 

However  in the traditional coffee and donut market  the top player at this time is the Dunkin Donuts chain  operated by Dunkin Brands Group  Inc   NASDAQ DNKN   The company also operates the Baskin Robbins ice cream chain  Unlike Starbucks  Dunkin is primarily a U S  brand that doesn t have much recognition outside American borders  albeit  the company is looking to expand to the United Kingdom via the planned opening of 50 outlets in Greater London within five years  The company has also indicated a possible presence in Moscow  For the investor  I highly doubt Dunkin will become a global brand to the same degree as Starbucks or even close to that 

A rapidly growing direct rival to Dunkin that is expanding in the United States is Canada based Tim Hortons Inc   NYSE THI   Tim Hortons dominates the Canadian coffee market and is seen as a direct competitor to Dunkin  As of December 29  2013  there were 4 485 Tim Hortons outlets overall  including 859 in the U S 

Tim Hortons is aggressively targeting the lucrative U S  market for coffee  donuts  and meals  In my view  the company is a bigger threat to Dunkin than Starbucks due to their similarities in products and target consumers  Of course  Tim Hortons has a long way to go to catch up with the more than 10 000 Dunkin outlets in the U S 
On a comparative valuation basis  Tim Hortons is more attractive  trading at 14 87 times  X  its 2015 earnings per share  EPS   Dunkin Donuts is trading at 21 88X its 2015 EPS 
My view is that it s a toss up between Dunkin and Tim Hortons  but if Tim Hortons can expand into the U S   then it s the stock that needs to be monitored

This quarter 27 contributing analysts on Estimize com have come to a consensus earnings expectation of  1 44 EPS and  7 297B in revenue compared to a consensus of  1 43 EPS and  7 293B from Wall Street  This quarter contrbuting analysts on the Estimize com platform expect McDonad s to beat the Wall Street consensus by 1c per share and come in  4M ahead of revenue estimates 


Competition came gunning for McDonald s last quarter and the golden arches missed earnings estimates from both Wall Street and the Estimize community  Notably and perhaps unexpectedly  Taco Bell  NYSE YUM  declared a war on breakfast  rolling out a new menu featuring breakfast burritos and waffle tacos  McDonald s still holds about a 30  share of the breakfast segment and will look defend its AM dominance this quarter  
Although McDonald s is under siege in the breakfast wars  it s throwing punches back too by offering promotions on coffee in an attempt to wrestle the morning crowd away from coffee shops like Dunkin  Donuts  NASDAQ DNKN  and Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX

The new technology will soon have Keurig competing for that morning cup of brew at the office  It is easier than ever to see GMCR move into the office environment  I like everything about Keurig Green Mountain and feel the company s best brewing days are ahead  I like GMCR now and in the long term

10845,232360,DNKN,Dunkin  Brands  DNKN  Long term Prospects Bright  Woes Stay,opinion,We issued an updated research report on Dunkin  Brands Group  Inc    NASDAQ DNKN   on Jun 6  Headquartered in Canton  MA  the company is a franchisor of quick service restaurants under the Dunkin  Donuts and Baskin Robbins brands OpportunitiesBanking on its already established namesake  the company has undertaken the implementation of a six part plan to fuel Dunkin  Donuts  strategic growth in the US and better position itself as a beverage led On the Go brand  The plan includes building its coffee culture  faster and improved product innovation  targeted values and smart pricing  being a leader in digital  improving the restaurant like experience  and driving consumer packaged goods and new channels Furthermore  the company s licensing deals with Keurig Green Mountain and J M  Smucker to sell Dunkin  K Cup pods to retailers as well as online customers continue to expand Dunkin  Brands  reach  Recently  it also announced a partnership with Amtrak Corporation per which Dunkin  hot coffee will be available to the 3 4 million annual customers on board Amtrak s high speed trains Moreover  given its growing popularity  the company is expanding its footprint in the emerging markets of Asia and the Middle East  The company also considers the untapped market of South Africa to be of great potential and opened its first store in Cape Town in 2016 Also  the company is prioritizing stabilization of its international business in some key markets  Dunkin  Brands continues to undertake initiatives to improve customer experience  expand convenience  and increase transactions  In fact  Baskin Robbins has expanded its delivery program in Saudi Arabia to include more than 30 delivery hubs  Dunkin  Donuts debuted in the Netherlands in the first quarter of 2017 Meanwhile  the company is emphasizing on the improvement of its core menu  introduction of more customization options and promotional offers as well as adding further variations to the value and premium segments  which should boost comps We believe that increased focus on establishing itself as a beverage leader should further drive sales going forward  as beverages offer Dunkin  Donuts the greatest growth opportunity  In keeping with this strategy  the brand launched ready to drink bottled iced coffee  Fruited Iced Teas  Dunkin  Energy Punch powered by Monster Energy and frozen coffee in the first quarter of 2017 Meanwhile  DD Perks Loyalty Program continues to be a major sales driver  primarily on the back of the company s brand recognition  The loyalty program currently has over 6 5 million members and accounted for more than 10  of the total transactions in the first quarter Further  the company is growing in terms of its usage of digital technology through DD card  DD mobile app  DD Perks rewards program  On the Go ordering and delivering  In fact  these initiatives make Dunkin  Donuts more convenient and accessible to customers  On the Go gives the company the power to drive customer loyalty and the power to drive efficiency as well as speed of service at its restaurants It should be noted that Dunkin  Brands operates mainly on a full fledged franchise model like some of its peers including McDonald s Corporation   NYSE MCD   and Domino s Pizza  Inc    NYSE DPZ    We believe re franchising a large chunk of the company s system reduces its capital requirements  and facilitates earnings per share growth as well as return on equity expansion HeadwindsDunkin  Brands  international comps growth has mostly suffered over the last few years at both its Dunkin  Donuts and Baskin Robbins divisions  Discretionary spending is under pressure due to a number of factors including sluggish local economies  currency devaluation and oil prices  Even in the most recent quarter  both its brands posted negative international comp sales Further  over the past few quarters  the U S  restaurant space has not been too enticing  Same store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment  Traffic too has been weak  In fact  the first quarter of 2017 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole  thereby continuing the somber mood  As a result  the company s sales have come under pressure In addition  Dunkin  Donuts faces competition from fast casual giants like Panera Bread Company   NASDAQ PNRA    which offer healthier menu options and are gaining popularity among consumers  Competition also arises from other well established coffee makers and breakfast serving restaurant chains  both of which are Dunkin  Brands  huge revenue generating segments Bottom LineWe note that shares of the company have rallied nearly 30  over the last one year  comparing favorably with the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 14   Meanwhile  although current quarter estimates have moved slightly

Early Wednesday morning  Dunkin  executives presented at the Jefferies 2017 Global Consumer Conference  where CEO Nigel Travis discussed the competition Dunkin  has been facing  He said that convenience stores have challenged Dunkin as they have been forced to shift focus from cigarette  e cigarette  and gas sales to food and coffee offers 
Travis also said that McDonald s and Burger King cut into Dunkin s afternoon sales  Dunkin s brand revolves around being a beverage on the go  which encourages customers to buy their products in the morning when they re busiest  However  customers tend to not come back later in the day 
McDonald s and Burger King also have best selling breakfast items on their menus  McDonald s  in particular  has shifted in the last two years to selling breakfast food all day  challenging Dunkin s all day breakfast food staples like donuts  Both companies also offer low coffee prices comparable to Dunkin  
To challenge this competition  Travis said that Dunkin  will focus on their On the Go app  The company reported that consumer research from last summer has shown that customers want to use Dunkin as a quick  convenient option  so they will continue to emphasis this part of their company 
 I think once we get people to try it  they realize that this is true convenience  And this is a really strong competitive weapon against be it McDonald s  convenience stores  because people want speed and convenience   Travis said

33493,255008,DNKN,Why Beyond Meat Shares Are Soaring,opinion,"Beyond Meat  NASDAQ BYND  is regaining its momentum after a dramatic fall from grace last year  Indeed  the producer of plant based  meat  has surged more than 60  in the first two weeks of trading in 2020 
The latest upswing in its share price is the result of many positive developments that show that the El Segundo  California based company is rapidly gaining market share at a time when consumers are increasingly purchasing plant based products that have the look and taste of meat 
Investors bid up Beyond Meat stock Tuesday after Executive Chairman Seth Goldman said the company plans to expand to China this year as part of its global plans   We haven t announced anything  but we are expected to do something this year   Goldman said at the U S  National Retail Federation show 
According to Goldman  sales of plant based protein could come to represent 13  of total supermarket meat sales in the next decade  increasing production to meet these levels would require the overseas expansion  The news sent BYND stock surging about 17  at one point on Tuesday to trade at  134 78  It closed up 2 4  for the day at  117 05 
Beyond Meat has been on a roller coaster ride since going public in early May at an IPO price of  25 a share  Despite the stock s impressive run this year  the shares are still down more than 40  from their peak in July last year 
Earlier this month  the shares surged after fast food giant McDonald s  NYSE MCD  said that the Beyond Meat patties that have been tested at some Canada locations are  exclusive  for the fast food chain  Another restaurant chain  Dunkin Brands Group   NASDAQ DNKN  announced this week that rapper Snoop Dogg would star in a TV ad campaign  promoting a sausage sandwich made from Beyond Meat s plant based protein 
Lofty Valuations
But Beyond Meat s eye popping rally is also raising questions in the minds of cautious investors who try to justify these lofty valuations  After this year s surge  the plant based  meat  supplier s market valuation is more than  7 billion  putting it in the league of established food companies with billions of dollars in sales 
 Tyson Foods  Inc  NYSE TSN   the largest U S  meat producer  has a  33 76 billion market cap with  43 billion in expected sales for the current fiscal year  Before yesterday s surge  Beyond Meat was trading at the enterprise to 12 month forward sales multiple of 29   a huge premium when compared to other packaged food companies which are trading at the low single digit valuations 
Of course  these comparisons don t make much sense when we are dealing with a high growth company like Beyond Meat  but investors should take into account the threats which might damage this highly ambitious expansion scenario 
After seeing Beyond Meat s success  some major players have already entered the plant based food market  Nestle  SIX NESN  launched its plant based Awesome Burger in the U S  in September  Supermarket chain Kroger Company  NYSE KR  is the latest company to join the group with its launch of plant based patties under its Simple Truth brand 
Bottom Line
Beyond Meat has grabbed the attention of a market which was left open by the big food companies  But that space is becoming crowded  with many established players joining the fray 
We don t believe Beyond Meat has a big economic moat to defend its turf once the competition is firmly established  Investors who had a chance to buy this stock low should trim their positions and book profit ",2020-01-15,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-beyond-meat-shares-are-soaring-200498826,200498826

33543,255058,DNKN,U S  states probe fast food franchise deals not to poach workers,news,"By Diane Bartz and Alana Wise
WASHINGTON  Reuters    A group of U S  state attorneys general is investigating whether Five Guys  Panera  Burger King and other big fast food chains are using  no poach  rules in franchise agreements to hold down wages and limit employee advancement  the officials said on Monday 
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey  along with attorneys general of nine other states and Washington  DC  sent letters to Arby s  Burger King  which is owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc  TO QSR   Dunkin  Donuts  O DNKN   Five Guys Burgers and Fries  Little Caesars  Panera Bread  NASDAQ PNRA   Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and Wendy s  O WEN  to ask for franchise agreements and other documents that relate to no poach provisions 
Under a no poach pact  companies agree to not hire away each other s workers 
The companies were asked to detail any no poach pacts  including being asked whether they informed employees of potential agreements 
Restaurant workers make a median of  9 81 per hour and  20 410 annually  according to the Labor Department s Bureau of Labor Statistics 
 By limiting potential job opportunities  these agreements may restrict employees  ability to improve their earning potential and the economic security of their families   the attorneys general said in the letter 
Wendy s spokeswoman Heidi Schauer said the company did not have an anti poaching provision in franchise agreements 
 Wendy s does not impose any restrictions that prohibit franchisees from hiring or soliciting employees from other franchisees   she said in an email 
Arby s  Burger King  Dunkin  Donuts  Five Guys  Little Caesars  Panera and Popeyes did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
The U S  Justice Department has said that no poach agreements are illegal under antitrust law since they restrict competition for employees and potentially deprive workers of better job opportunities  They have been found previously in the railroad industry and among some tech companies 
The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this probe 
In June  a former McDonald s  N MCD  employee  Leinani Deslandes  filed a lawsuit against the chain alleging the restaurant s no poach agreement violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and had prevented her from obtaining a better position with a rival franchise 

Jurisdictions in the probe include California  District of Columbia  Illinois  Massachusetts  Maryland  Minnesota  New Jersey  New York  Oregon  Pennsylvania and Rhode Island ",2018-07-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-states-probe-fastfood-franchise-deals-not-to-poach-workers-1522723,1522723

1  Facebook Misses on Revenue
The tech sector faces tough going Thursday morning after Facebook reported second quarter revenue that was shy of what Wall Street was expecting

Monthly active users were 2 23 billion as of June 30  up 11  year over year  Daily active users were 1 47 billion

33883,255398,DNKN,Burger King has maneuvered to cut U S  tax bill for years,news,"By Tom Bergin LONDON  Reuters    Burger King may have taken a lot of flack in the past week for a deal that should curb its U S  tax bill but in many ways it is consistent with the burger chain s aggressive tax reduction strategies in recent years 
Some U S  lawmakers and other critics attacked the company that is the home of the Whopper for deciding to move its tax base to Canada from the U S  through its proposed purchase of Oakville  Ontario based coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons  TO THI   They say it will allow Burger King  N BKW  to avoid paying some U S  taxes 
That would be nothing new  A Reuters analysis of Burger King s regulatory filings in the U S  and overseas  which was also reviewed by accounting experts  shows that it has been making major efforts to reduce its U S  tax bill for some time 
By massaging down U S  taxable profits while maximizing the profits it reports in low tax jurisdictions overseas  Burger King is able to operate one of the most tax efficient businesses in the U S  fast food industry 
The chain s effective tax rate of 26 percent over the past three years compares with rates above 31 percent at McDonalds Corp  N MCD   Starbucks Corp  O SBUX  and Dunkin Brands Group Inc  O DNKN   KFC and Pizza Hut owner Yum Brands  N YUM  did have a similar tax rate to Burger King though this reflects the 74 pct of its revenues that were generated outside the U S   in markets where tax rates are typically around 25 percent 
The Burger King rate is 30 percent lower than the average tax rate it paid in the five years before it was bought in 2010 by private equity group 3G  still  the company s majority shareholder 
The accounting experts say the Canadian move will allow Burger King to double down on those efforts as it will open up new tax saving opportunities for the company  It could  for example  apply the tax structures it currently employs in major markets like Germany and Britain  and which allow the group to operate almost tax free in those places  to its business in the United States  they said 
And that could mean Uncle Sam will lose corporate tax income that Burger King would have to pay under its current structure 
 I would be surprised if in five years  time  their tax rate does not come down reasonably dramatically   said Professor Stephen Shay  from Harvard Law School  who has testified to Congress on corporate taxation 
Burger King declined to comment on its current U S  tax arrangements  But it has said the so called  inversion  deal to buy Tim Hortons for  11 5 billion  and move the headquarters to Canada  was based on Canada being the combined company s biggest market  It said the deal was about international expansion   particularly of the Tim Hortons  brand and not about tax savings 
 We don t expect our tax rate to change materially  As I said this transaction is not really about tax  it s about growth   Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz said in a call with analysts last week 
It would be perfectly legal for Burger King to reduce its U S  tax bill through the Canadian move  Chas Roy Chowdhury  Head of Taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants in London  said companies all over the world manage their tax bills so they don t have to pay more tax than necessary 
 If the U S  doesn t like inversion deals  it should change the law to prevent them  The U S  has a leaky corporation tax system which encourages companies to park profits offshore   he said

Finding ways to report less income to the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  and more to overseas tax authorities is a particular focus for companies with a headquarters or big operations in the U S  because of the headline federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent on profits  It is the highest headline corporate tax rate in any major developed country  and can be even higher once state and local taxes are added on  There is an incentive for companies to shift U S  generated profits overseas  where rates can be very low  the experts say 
Burger King generated almost 60 percent of its revenues in the United States between 2011 and 2013  regulatory filings show  but the chain reported just 20 percent of its profits in the country over the period 
By contrast  the percentage of their profits that McDonalds  Starbucks Corp  Dunkin Brands and Yum reported as being earned in the United States was in line with the percentage of their total revenues generated in the country 
Those companies all declined to comment 
Shay said Burger King s large debt load could explain why it has more ability to manage its U S  tax bill than less leveraged peers 
Burger King s low reported U S  profit translates to domestic profit margins of just an average 4 percent between 2011 2013   a fifth of the level it recorded in overseas markets in that time  The company declined to say why its U S  operation enjoyed such low margins over the period   it reported a small U S  loss in 2012 and a tiny profit for 2011  though the profit was up to a much healthier level by 2013 
There could be explanations other than tax driven moves for the low margins  The U S  fast food market is the most competitive in the world  and prices for fast food offerings are lower than in some other major markets as a result  However  a lot of the burden  including increased labor costs as the minimum wages rises in some states and spending on a refurbishment program for Burger King restaurants  would be borne by the company s franchisees  Burger King operates very few of its own restaurants 
Professor Daniel Shaviro from New York University Law School  who was previously Legislation Attorney at the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation  said tax planning likely had a lot to do with the low levels of income reported in the U S  
The company s accounts show the low reported U S margins are due  at least in part  to how hundreds of millions of dollars in group overheads  such as head office and debt costs are spread across the company each year 
Before such costs are applied  profit margins at Burger King s United States and Canada division  the U S  produces 91 percent of that unit s revenue  are in line with international operations  at around 39 percent  its filings show  But after these costs are applied  the North American unit ends up with its rock bottom margins 
Most of these costs are taken in the U S  because it is where cash is borrowed  and senior managers and product innovators are based  But tax rules state that such costs should be evenly spread across international divisions  said Kimberly Clausing  a Professor of Economics at Reed University 
Reed said the gap between Burger King s gross and pre tax profit figures for the United States suggested such group wide costs are being disproportionately offset against U S  income 
 That s one way of shifting income abroad     it s a common problem   for the IRS  said Reed 
TAX FREE IN GERMANY
Burger King also operates a tax efficient operation overseas  By channeling income through Switzerland it has managed to pay an effective tax rate of 15 percent on foreign income over the past three years  company filings and statements show 
Experts said this arrangement could become a template for how Burger King  as a foreign company  could shave its U S  tax rate further 
The impact in Germany shows how that could cost the U S  Treasury 
Germany has historically been Burger King s largest market outside North America  generating over 10 percent of total sales  In 2011 and 2012  the last two years for which figures were available  the German operation had combined sales of  501 million   over half the total for the Europe  Middle East and Africa region  regulatory filings show 
In 10 conference calls with analysts covering the two year period  transcripts of which Reuters reviewed  then Chief Financial Officer Schwartz mentioned the German market eight times  and each time spoke of its  strong performance  or  positive  results 
EMEA operating profits for 2011 and 2012 totaled  356 million  Yet  Burger King Beteilligung GmbH   the entity which consolidated earnings for the group s main German operating units   reported losses in 2011 and 2012  totaling over  10 million and recorded a net income tax credit of more than 200 000 euros 
Burger King Germany s taxable income was reduced partly because German stores pay around five percent of their turnover to an affiliate in Switzerland  Burger King Europe GmbH  the company told Reuters in 2012 
Burger King Europe GmbH owns brand rights for Europe  the Middle East and Africa   which also allows profits from other places  not just Germany  to be at least partly funneled through Switzerland 
Burger King declined to say why the group declared no profits in Germany at the same time as it boasted to investors about the market s strength  but a spokeswoman said the tax structure in Europe pre dated New York based 3G s acquisition of the chain in 2010 
Almost all of Burger King s restaurants are now run on a franchise basis rather than directly by the company  and more than 80 percent of the company s revenue comes from franchise fees and property revenue  At the end of last year  it had 7 384 franchised restaurants in the U S  and 52 company owned and run   the latter are in the Miami area near the company s current headquarters so it can test new food offerings and other changes to the way it operates 
Under U S  tax rules  Burger King cannot currently cut its American tax bill by routing franchise fees from its U S  franchisees via Switzerland  But these rules would not apply to a Canadian company  The company spokeswoman said Burger King had no plans to shift franchisees into contracts with offshore subsidiaries
