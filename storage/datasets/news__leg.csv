3899,225414,LEG,Legget   Platt  LEG  Reports Next Week  What To Know Ahead Of The Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when Legget   Platt  LEG  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 28  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This engineered component manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 67 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  1 21 billion  up 11 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Legget   Platt 
For Legget   Platt  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Legget   Platt will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Legget   Platt would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 64  delivering a surprise of  1 59  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Legget   Platt doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/legget--platt-leg-reports-next-week-what-to-know-ahead-of-the-release-200475735,200475735

118952,340467,LEG,In a U S  manufacturing hub  no illusions about tariffs and jobs,news,"By Howard Schneider
THOMASVILLE  N C   Reuters    In a town where a 30 feet tall chair is the chief landmark  and which is synonymous with a U S  furniture industry decimated over the years by imports from China  many greet the possibility of tariffs on Chinese goods with a shrug 
No wonder  Of three once bustling Thomasville furniture plants in the city limits  one is being demolished and cleared for parkland  another may become the site of a new police station  and a third is being converted into apartments 
President Donald Trump is threatening to levy tariffs of up to 25 percent on  500 billion of goods imported from China each year  including roughly  20 billion of furniture  as a way to bring back hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs lost to China and other low cost competitors 
Yet  the transformation of U S  industries since China s emergence as the world s low cost producer almost two decades ago means many no longer directly compete with Chinese imports  so tariffs may not translate so easily into more U S  jobs 
At family owned Bernhardt Furniture in Lenoir  some 90 miles west of Thomasville  executives say it would take about  30 million in capital investment   some 10 percent of annual sales   to resurrect standard wood furniture lines now mainly made in countries like China and Vietnam 
That is too much to commit based on a policy that a future administration could reverse 
 The theory is you turn  imports  off  the jobs come back  That s not really true    The buildings don t exist  The people don t exist  The machinery does not exist   to make the sorts of furniture that now gets imported  said Alex Bernhardt Jr   chief executive and the company founder s great grandson 
What the company needs now  executives say  is the open markets and steady economy that have allowed it to grow its workforce from below 800 at the end of the 2007 2009 recession to almost 1 500 today   partly on the basis of exports to China 
DIFFERENT COMPANY
That growth has been largely driven by demand for more customized  higher end furniture  In expanding  the 129 year old company has been hiring not only factory workers  but also designers  marketing experts and other professionals  In all  it is a different firm from what it was three decades ago when it first began dividing product lines between the United States and Asia 
Economists say the same is true across much of U S  manufacturing  To invest and hire more workers  executives would need certainty  for example  that consumers would prefer U S  made products at a potentially higher price  They would need confidence that tariffs would last beyond the Trump administration and that production could not be shifted to other more cost competitive countries 
Even then  there may be little incentive to go back to old product lines for industries that have changed dramatically because of globalization 
Across the Rust Belt and the former factory towns of the south  the transformation is apparent  In Buffalo  an old steel mill is now a solar panel factory  and a retail goods manufacturer now houses an office and restaurant park 
In Cleveland  a shuttered GM plant has reopened as a Chinese owned auto glass company  Abandoned factories throughout North Carolina have landed on the Environmental Protection Agency s list of  brownfield  sites that need cleanup 
Some companies are considering moving production from China as a result of the tariffs  but the jobs are unlikely to head home 
Illinois based CCTY Bearing  for example  said it planned to move U S  bound production from Zhenjiang  China  to a new plant near Mumbai in India to keep labor costs down 
JLab Audio s China made Bluetooth products are not being taxed yet  but its chief executive Win Cramer had been scouting for suppliers in Vietnam and Mexico 
 I would love to build products onshore  but consumers have proven time and time again that  Made in America  isn t as valuable a statement as it once was   Cramer said   They make decisions based on the cost  
The price of  say  its Bluetooth earbud would jump from  20 to as much as  50 if it was made in the United States  Cramer said  far more than what tariffs would add to the cost of imports 
To be sure  early reactions suggest that foreign companies that make U S  bound goods in China may move some of that production to the United States  Still  countries such as Vietnam may ultimately benefit the most from Trump s tariffs 
Japanese construction and mining equipment maker Komatsu Ltd  T 6301  has said it has already shifted some of its production of parts for U S  built excavators from China  Part of that production moved to the United States  but some also went to Mexico and Japan 
In South Korea  LG Electronics  KS 066570  and its rival Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  are considering moving parts of U S  bound refrigerator and air conditioner production to Mexico  Vietnam or back home  but not to the United States  according to company sources and local media 
STEADY RECOVERY
The responses to Trump s tariffs on steel and aluminum show how such steps create both winners and losers 
Producers such as U S  Steel and Century Aluminum have said they will add at least several hundred jobs as a result of the higher prices they can charge  Mid Continental Nail  however  laid off 130 workers because of those higher steel prices  and furniture parts maker Leggett   Platt  N LEG  has warned that rising metal prices would prompt it to shift production abroad 
So far  Washington has imposed duties on  250 billion of Chinese imports and Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on all Chinese goods 
Many economists project new tariffs would on balance either slow down hiring or cause job losses in a manufacturing sector where employment has grown by 10 percent over the past eight years without special protection  Graphic   
The furniture industry  among the hardest hit by Chinese imports  has added 43 000 jobs since its employment hit a low of 350 000 in 2011  helped by the recovering housing market and strong consumer demand 
Industry officials say skilled upholsterers and other workers are hard to find  echoing the Federal Reserve s concern about the impact of worker shortages on the U S  economy 
In Thomasville  few expect that tariffs will bring furniture manufacturing back to its heyday  nor does the community need it  says city manager Kelly Craver  whose parents worked in the furniture and textile industries 
Since the recession  Thomasville has become a residential hub for growing nearby cities such as Greensboro and Charlotte  It also has its own mix of manufacturing and white collar jobs   Mohawk Industries   N MHK  recently expanded its Thomasville laminate flooring facility while the Old Dominion Freight Line transportation firm  O ODFL  and the fast growing Cook Out burger chain have corporate headquarters there 

 We  for the very first time in this city s existence  are going to have a diversified economy   Craver said ",2018-09-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/in-a-us-manufacturing-hub-no-illusions-about-tariffs-and-jobs-1623921,1623921

119170,340685,LEG,Legget   Platt  LEG  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Legget   Platt  LEG  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 3  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This engineered component manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 16 billion  up 10 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Legget   Platt 
For Legget   Platt  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Legget   Platt will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Legget   Platt would post earnings of  0 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 76  delivering a surprise of  13 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Legget   Platt doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/legget--platt-leg-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200501886,200501886

119221,340736,LEG,Leggett   Platt  Positive Long Term Growth Outlook,opinion,"The Dividend Aristocrats are widely considered to be the best of the best when it comes to dividend growth stocks  Indeed  the Dividend Aristocrats are an exclusive group of 57 stocks in the S P 500 Index with at least 25 years of annual dividend increases  The Dividend Aristocrats have long lasting brand power  competitive advantages  and shareholder friendly management teams that are committed to growing profits and dividends over the long term 
But on occasion  even the Dividend Aristocrats experience downturns  Leggett   Platt  NYSE LEG  is a Dividend Aristocrat  having raised its dividend for 48 years in a row  But the stock has declined 12  in the past three months and has underperformed the broader S P 500 Index by a wide margin to start 2019 
However  Leggett   Platt has a plan to overcome the recent challenges and continue to grow for the long term  The stock has an attractive valuation and a high dividend yield above 4   Therefore  Leggett   Platt is one of the best dividend stocks for long term dividend growth investors 
Business Overview   Recent Events
Leggett   Platt Incorporated is a diversified manufacturing company  It designs and manufactures a wide range of products  including bedding components  bedding industry machinery  steel wire  adjustable beds  carpet cushioning  and vehicle seat support systems  The company has a large and diverse product portfolio 

Source  Investor Presentation
Leggett   Platt reported its first quarter earnings results on April 30  The company reported revenues of  1 16 billion for the first quarter  which represents a 12 6  growth rate compared to the prior year s quarter  Revenues nevertheless missed the consensus analyst estimate  The company s revenue growth was based on a 13  sales gain thanks to the impact of acquisitions  while organic revenues declined by 1  year over year  Sales volumes were down 3  when acquisitions are backed out  but improved pricing offset those volume declines partially  Leggett   Platt generated earnings per share of  0 49 during the first quarter  which represents a decline versus earnings per share of  0 57 during the previous year s first quarter  Leggett   Platt s earnings per share for the first quarter also missed the analyst consensus estimate by  0 03  or roughly 5  
Leggett   Platt s guidance ranges for sales as well as for earnings per share were maintained at the previous level  The company forecasts revenues of  4 95 billion to  5 10 billion during fiscal 2019  which represents a revenue growth rate of 16  to 19  compared to the revenues that the company generated during fiscal 2018  Revenue growth will be positively impacted by the acquisition of Elite Comfort Solutions that closed earlier this year  and that has already positively impacted Q1 s reported revenues  This takeover should generate additional revenues of about  675 million during fiscal 2019  which means that organic revenues will likely grow by 0  3  during the current year  Leggett   Platt guides for earnings per share in a range of  2 45 to  2 65 for fiscal 2019 
Leggett   Platt has maintained a long history of steady growth  thanks in large part to the company s durable competitive advantages  Coming into 2019  Leggett   Platt held an expansive intellectual property portfolio  consisting of 1 500 issued patents and nearly 1 000 registered trademarks  These competitive advantages separate Leggett   Platt s various brands from the competition and allow the company to be a category leader across its product portfolio 
Valuation   Expected Returns
Using the midpoint of management guidance  Leggett   Platt is expected to generate earnings per share of  2 55 for 2019  Based on this  the stock trades for a price to earnings ratio of 14 8  Over the past 10 years  the stock had an average P E ratio of 18 8  a reasonable target P E ratio could be 18  based on the company s strong profitability and steady EPS growth  As a result  a higher valuation is warranted  due to the company s steady growth over many years  and long dividend history  If the P E ratio expands from the current level of 14 8 to 18  the expansion of the valuation would add approximately 4  to annual shareholder returns 
In addition  Leggett   Platt s dividend will add to shareholder returns  Leggett   Platt recently increased its dividend by 5   to a new quarterly rate of  0 40 per share  The new annual payout of  1 60 per share represents a hefty 4 2  dividend yield  This makes Leggett   Platt a high yield stock  as the S P 500 Index on average yields just 2  right now 
Leggett   Platt should have little trouble continuing to raise its dividend each year going forward  as it has done for nearly five decades  Based on the expected EPS of  2 55  the forward annual dividend payout of  1 60 per share represents an expected payout ratio of 63  for 2019  This is a manageable payout for Leggett   Platt  In other words  the company is projected to distribute less than two thirds of its EPS this year  which leaves enough cash flow left over to pay down debt and invest in growth  As a result  Leggett   Platt s dividend appears secure 
Combining valuation changes with 6 0  annual earnings growth and the 4 2  dividend yield results in total expected returns of more than 14  per year over the next five years  This is a high expected rate of return that indicates Leggett   Platt is an undervalued dividend growth stock 
Final Thoughts
Leggett   Platt has had a difficult year  Rising cost inflation has put pressure on the company s margins  while the threat of geopolitical conflict and escalating trade tensions threatens its growth in the international markets  However  Leggett   Platt has experienced even worse periods before  such as the Great Recession  Even in very difficult economic climates  Leggett   Platt has generated enough cash flow to continue raising its dividend each year 
Leggett   Platt is a beaten down Dividend Aristocrat  but the company has a positive long term growth outlook  Acquisitions  international growth  and share repurchases should allow Leggett   Platt to reach its revenue growth targets in the years ahead  In the meantime  an attractive valuation and compelling 4 2  dividend yield make Leggett   Platt a top dividend stock to buy today

119222,340737,LEG,Legget   Platt  LEG  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Legget   Platt  LEG  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 29  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This engineered component manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 28 billion  up 15 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Legget   Platt 
For Legget   Platt  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Legget   Platt will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Legget   Platt would post earnings of  0 52 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 49  delivering a surprise of  5 77  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

119283,340798,LEG,Is Leggett   Platt Incorporated A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Leggett   Platt Inc    NYSE LEG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Leggett   Platt has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 9x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Leggett   Platt s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Leggett   Platthas a forward PE  ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Leggett   Plattstock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Leggett   Platthas a P S ratio of about 0 9  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 2 8x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Leggett   Plattcurrently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Leggett   Platta solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Leggett   Plattmight be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives LEG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been favorable  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen four up and one down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has decreased by 4 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Leggett   Platt  Incorporated Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLeggett   Plattis an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 18  of more than 250 industries  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure

119284,340799,LEG,7 Stocks To Buy For Big May Dividend Hikes ,opinion,"While most income investors are reaching for big yields right now  a small group of  hidden yield  stocks are quietly handing smart investors growing income streams plus annual returns of 12   27 1  and even 54  or more per year 
So if you want to double your money every few years   and double your income as well   then you need to focus on the seven stocks I m about to share 
 All seven are about to hike their dividends  Yet the  forward looking market  hasn t yet priced in these payout raises  This is free money the market is giving us  thanks to the most  underrated  shareholder return vehicle  
The Most Lucrative Way Shareholders Get Paid
There are three   and only three   ways a company s stock can pay us 

A cash dividend 
A dividend hike 
By repurchasing its own shares 

Everyone loves the dividend  but investors usually don t give enough love to the dividend hike  Not only do these raises increase the yield on your initial capital  but also they often are reflected in a price increase for the stock 
For example  if a stock pays a 3  current yield and then hikes its payout by 10   it s unlikely that its stock price will stagnate for long  Investors will see the new 3 3  yield  and buy more shares 
They ll drive the price up  and the yield back down   eventually towards 3   This is why your favorite dividend  aristocrat    a company everyone knows and has paid dividends forever   never pays a high current yield  Its stock price rises too fast 
For example let s look at Verizon  VZ   it pays a generous dividend   but doesn t raise it meaningfully  This lack of payout upside caps the stock s price upside 
Frustrated Verizon investors need not look further than this chart for an illustration of why their money is underperforming 
Verizon s Sleepy Dividend Slows the Stock
Verizon s stock and dividend have increased by roughly the same amount  That s no coincidence   it happens all the time 
You ll also notice that the firm s track record of  yearly dividend raises  means little because the raises themselves weren t meaningful 
This a common mistake dividend aristocrat fans make when they flock to track records  They re not that far off the scent of 100   gains  however  They just need to look ahead  rather than behind  Let me explain 
The Path to Fast 162  Gains From Safe Blue Chips
Have you always wanted to buy a safe blue chip stock like Coca Cola  KO  and get rich from it like Warren Buffett 
It s doable  But most investors  live in the past  and fixate on dividend track records rather than a payout s forward prospects  And looking ahead is the key to yearly gains of 12   27 1  or even 54  or more with blue chip stocks 
Let s first consider the case of Coke  which achieved its dividend royalty status in 1987  its 25th straight year with a dividend hike   The firm hit its coronation with a head of steam  rewarding investors with a 362  payout hike in just five years  from 1986 to 1991   Its stock price raced to keep up with its dividend  rising 234  over the same time period 
Great Dividend Growth  Great Returns
It didn t really matter if you bought shares before or after the company was officially a dividend aristocrat  The driving factor for profits was the dividend s velocity   it was moving higher quickly  so its stock price followed 
Fast forward to the last five years  and we see that Coke s youthful exuberance has slowed considerably  The firm still hikes its payout every year  but it s a slower climb   totaling 45  over the past five years  Which means its stock price merely plods along too   25  in five years  
Average Dividend Growth  Average Returns
If you re looking for great dividend growth in 2018  you should focus on these seven firms about to raise their payouts 
Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF Dividend Yield  2 1 
Luxury goods company Tiffany   Co   TIF   like many other retail stocks  is struggling to find any positive momentum whatsoever in 2018  The stock is off more than 9  through the first few months of the year   far worse than the broader market s 1 9  declines 
That said  it s not all thorns for Tiffany 
Just a few months ago  the company reported a solid holiday season quarter that included a 5  jump in comparable store sales and an 8  improvement in the top line  largely bolstered by impressive performances from the Asia Pacific region and Europe  That led Tiffany to upgrade its own outlook for the fiscal year s profits 
Sometime near the end of May  shareholders should be on the receiving end of another dividend hike  Tiffany has upgraded its payout by nearly 50  over the past five years  and is likely to tack on an additional bump during the last week of the month 
Phillips 66  NYSE PSX Dividend Yield  2 9 
Phillips 66  PSX  is a welcome breath of fresh air in the energy space  That s because while many energy stocks were slowing dividend growth down to a trickle during the oil price collapse starting in summer 2014   or even cutting payouts   Phillips 66 has kept the income pipeline flowing 
Namely  since 2014  this refiner and midstream company has juiced its dividend by nearly 80   including a substantial 11  hike last year 
PSX should have plenty of ammunition for another dividend increase come early May  when it typically makes an announcement  That s because the company reported yet another excellent quarter a couple months ago that beat the pants off analyst estimates   profits of  1 07 per share were well ahead of the consensus estimate of 86 cents 
But the spending won t end there  Phillips 66 also plans to spend  500 million more on capital expenditures in 2018 than it did in 2017  which should fuel growth over the coming years 
Southside Bancshares  SBSI Dividend Yield  3 2 
While the run up in banks has left yields in the financial space awfully dry  Southside Bancshares  SBSI  offers a respectable yield of above 3   That s in some part thanks to an aggressive dividend policy that has seen the company raise payouts multiple times a year over the past few years 
Southside  by the way  is the bank holding company behind Texas community bank Southside Bank  which controls about  6 5 billion in assets across 60 branches within the state  There s nothing out of the ordinary about this bank   it provides typical services such as mortgages  personal loans  and checking and savings accounts 
What is unusual about SBSI is its dividend program  which has featured varying numbers of increases across the past few years  But one thing that s pretty consistent is the company announcing a dividend hike sometime in mid May 
Leggett   Platt  NYSE LEG Dividend Yield  3 2 
What would a list of potential dividend increases be without a  
Leggett   Platt is one of the more diversified manufacturers out there  producing a swath of products used in businesses  in homes and even in transit  Just a few examples  Its residential products include bedding  carpet cushions and furniture fasteners  its industrial products include various types of wires and sterling steel rods  and it even boasts an aerospace division that includes tubes and ducts 
That diversification has allowed Leggett to build a 47 year history of interrupted dividend increases  and No  48 should be on the way in May  The company typically makes an announcement during the middle of the month 
Agree Realty  ADC Dividend Yield  4 2 
Agree Realty  ADC  is a net lease retail real estate investment trust that owns 458 assets in 43 states  making up about 8 8 million square feet of gross leasable space  Tenants include the likes of Walgreens  WBA   McDonald s  MCD  and JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  
It s also a dedicated dividend raiser  Agree Realty has actually doled out a pair of dividend increases in each of the past couple years  and if history repeats itself  the company should be due for another dividend hike sometime in May 
Of course  the question is  when   The company s declaration dates have been all over the place   sometimes at the end of the month  sometimes at the beginning  and it has even stretched the announcement out into June before 
Stag Industrial  STAG Dividend Yield  5 9 
Stag Industrial  STAG  is a highly respected  that plays in the single tenant industrial real estate space  That includes warehouse  distribution and light manufacturing facilities 
At the moment  the portfolio includes 356 buildings in 37 states  spread across numerous industries  including automotive  air freight  containers   packaging  food   beverages and business services  among others  The tenant list is diverse  too  and spread out   the largest tenant  the U S  General Services Administration  makes up just 2 6  of ABR  Other tenants include XPO Logistics  XPO   Deckers Outdoor  DECK  and Solo Cup 
While Stag s dividend increases tend not to take effect until the dividend paid out in August  it tends to announce said increase sometime in the first week of May  The company typically hikes its payout twice a year  though it did keep it to  just  one increase in 2016 
Spectra Energy Partners  F SEP Dividend Yield  8 7 
Spectra Energy Partners  SEP  is one of the largest energy master limited partnerships  MLPs  in the country  boasting more than 15 000 miles of transmission pipelines  170 billion cubic feet of nat gas storage and about 5 6 million barrels of crude oil storage  according to its own most recent data 
Spectra also is one of the more prolific payout raisers in energy 
The company has raised its distribution by about 50  over the past five years  which is plenty respectable  But Spectra has done it in style  announcing its 41st consecutive quarterly increase to its distribution in February 
No  42 is likely coming sometime in the first week of the month 
Forget a 2  or 3  Yield  Grab These 8  Payers Before They Take Off
These seven are all strong companies  but why mess around with 2  or 3  payouts when you can nearly triple that right off the top and still pocket dividend growth and double digit gains too 
I m talking about a safe 8  payout  starting today  That s enough to best the market s average long term gain  around 7  a year  in cash 
I know that sounds too good to be true  but I assure you it s the real deal 
Hundreds of Americans are collecting this safe 8 0  income stream and watching their income and their nest eggs balloon higher as I write this  They re doing it through the 6 investments in our new    
The best part is that as I write this  these solid dividend payers trade at 10  to 15  discounts to what they re really worth  But that won t last  As more folks buy in  they ll start to move these off the radar investments higher and that gap will snap shut fast

119285,340800,LEG,Why Is Leggett   Platt  LEG  Down 2 6  Since Its Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Leggett   Platt  Incorporated   NYSE LEG    Shares have lost about 2 6  in that time frame 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is LEG due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts Leggett Lags Q1 Earnings   Sales  Trims 2018 EPS ViewLeggett   Platt reported lower than expected sales and earnings in first quarter 2018  Also  the bottom line declined year over year  Notably  this marked the company s fourth consecutive quarter of sales miss  while earnings lagged estimates for the second time  Further  management trimmed its earnings view for 2018 but raised the sales outlook The company s quarterly adjusted earnings of 57 cents per share decreased 8 1  year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents  The year over year decline was due to increased raw material expenses On a GAAP basis  earnings per share came in at 57 cents compared with 62 cents in the prior year quarter Delving DeeperAlthough net sales increased about 7 1  to  1 028 8 million  it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 044 million  Including inter segment sales  total sales came in at  1 107 4 million  up 6 6  year over year Improved sales were backed by 1  rise in volume and a 5  gain from raw material price inflation and currency  Furthermore  acquisitions contributed around 2  to sales  however  somewhat compensated with divestitures While gross profit dropped 4  year over year to  217 4 million  gross margin contracted 250 basis points  bps  to 21 1   Also  the company s adjusted EBIT margin declined 170 bps to 10 4  in the first quarter  In dollar terms  adjusted EBIT was down 7 3  to  107 4 million  due to the pricing lag and commodity inflation Segment DetailsResidential Products  sales  excluding inter segment sales  of  398 1 million increased 1 7  from last year  driven by a marginal improvement in same location sales along with contributions from buyouts  Also  contributions of 4  from raw material price inflation and currency aided results  However  volumes dropped 3  on lower demand in Geo Components and Flooring Products as well as weak pass through sales of adjustable beds  Including inter segment sales  total sales for the segment rose 1 7  to  402 7 million The Industrial Products segment s sales improved 17 5  to  82 million  Total sales  including inter segment sales  were up 12 6  to  152 4 million  mainly driven by raw material price inflation Sales at Furniture Products increased 6 2  to  281 3 million  courtesy of benefits from higher Adjustable Bed sales and a 3  rise in same location sales  Additionally  the segment gained from a small acquisition in Work Furniture  This was somewhat negated by declines in Home Furniture and Fashion Bed  However  total sales for the segment  including inter segment sales  grew 4 8  to  284 2 million The Specialized Products segment s sales rose 14 1  to  267 4 million  Same location sales climbed 11  backed by solid Automotive volumes and favorable currency impact  Also  the Precision Hydraulic Cylinders   PHC  acquisition added nearly 6  to sales growth  which was offset by a 4  impact from the divestiture of CVP  Total sales for the segment  including inter segment sales  climbed 13 5  to  268 1 million FinancialsLeggett ended first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  494 6 million  and long term debt of  1 239 million  Furthermore  the company generated  44 1 million in cash flow from operations in the same period The company had net debt to net capital ratio of 38  at the end of the first quarter  within the company s 30 40  target range  Moreover  Leggett s debt was 2 4 times of trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA In addition  management repurchased nearly 1 2 million shares for an average price of  45 09 and issued 0 5 million shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises  Also  it declared a quarterly dividend of 36 cents per share  reflecting an increase of two cents from the year ago period  This marks Leggett s 47th consecutive year of dividend increase GuidanceLeggett has been significantly gaining from inflation and currency  which have been aiding its top line  Further  management remains optimistic about growth opportunities in the Bedding business and projects market improvements as the year progresses  However  the ongoing steel costs inflation has been largely weighing on its margins  which is likely to continue hurting margins in the second quarter Following the soft quarterly results  management updated its guidance for 2018  Sales are now projected to grow nearly 9 12  year over year to  4 3  4 4 billion  up  100 million from the previously guided range of  4 2  4 3  The raised top line guidance was backed by continued steel inflation  The company s solid sales view is backed by expectations of mid single digit volume growth  raw material price increases and favorable currency  Additionally  the PHC acquisition is likely to contribute 2  to sales growth Consequently  EBIT margin is envisioned to be nearly 11 5 12  compared with 12 12 5   guided earlier  However  on assuming that costs will stabilize  Leggett predicts margins to improve through the second half of 2018 Based on above iterations  management projects earnings from continuing operations in the range of  2 60  2 80 per share  down 5 cents from  2 65  2 85 projected earlier  The downside can be attributed to adverse impacts of continued steel cost inflation as well as the pricing lag for recovering greater costs  Notably  this guidance takes into account an effective tax rate of 22  Additionally  the company seems to be continuing with its trend of generating more cash to fund dividends and capital expenditures  For 2018  Leggett expects operating cash flows of about  450 million compared with  500 million anticipated earlier  Capital expenditures for the year are still projected at  160 million  while the company intends to spend  195 million toward dividend payouts  The company also outlined the target dividend payout ratio to be 50 60  of adjusted earnings  Furthermore  it expects payout for 2018 to be near the midpoint of the aforementioned range Meanwhile  management plans to continue with its share repurchase program  having a standing authorization to buy back up to 10 million shares every year  after fulfilling all priority requirements  For 2018  the company also intends to repurchase nearly 2 3 million shares and issue about 1 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans

119286,340801,LEG,Furniture Stock Outlook  Out Of The Woods Soon ,opinion,"The U S  furniture industry is expected to see moderate growth through 2018 supported by rising consumer sentiment and discretionary spending  Broader economic recovery along with solid wages and employment opportunities no doubt bode well  According to Furniture Today  the furniture industry is expected to grow 3  to  111 4 billion in 2018 from  108 2 billion in 2017 The strengthening millennial market is an added positive since it represents the largest consumer cohort in the furniture market  Millennials were the largest and most active generation of homebuyers in 2017 for the fifth consecutive year  per the National Association of Realtors However  furniture retailers operate in a landscape that is changing from a generational point of view  The millennial approach toward home buying is different from older generations  Added to these are housing affordability concerns in a rising interest rate environment In addition to a sluggish market  furniture companies need to continuously address a maturing omni channel environment  as shoppers are more looking for online purchase  The growth in online sales will continue to fragment the traditional retailer market as brands such as Etsy  Things Remembered  Costco  NASDAQ COST  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  are finding their way into the furniture market Higher raw material expenses and the pricing lag in case of commodity cost inflation are already affecting bottom line  Further  margins remained under pressure mainly due to commodity inflation and steel cost inflation Moreover  the threat of tariffs on imports and retaliatory tariffs on exports spell trouble for the industry  If tariffs are implemented  sourcing difficulty faced by home furnishing manufacturers will end up increasing costs Industry Lags on Shareholder ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past year  it appears that the strengthening economy and better job prospects weren t enough for enhancing investors  confidence in the industry s growth prospect The   which is an eight stock group within the broader   has underperformed both the S P 500 and its own sector over the past year While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 20 1   the Zacks S P 500 Composite and Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector have rallied 12  and 10 9   respectively  One Year Price Performance Furniture Stocks Trading CheapThanks to the underperformance of the industry over the past year  the valuation looks really cheap now  One might get a good sense of the industry s relative valuation by looking at its price to earnings ratio  P E   which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing Consumer Discretionary stocks because their earnings are effective in gauging performance Generally  the price of a stock rallies on a rise in earnings  As forecasts for expected earnings move higher  demand for the stock should drive its price  If the P E of a stock is rising steadily  it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company s inherent strength This ratio essentially measures a stock s current market value relative to its earnings performance  Investors believe that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P E ratio of 18 6  near the lowest level over the past year  When compared with the highest level of 21 2 and median level of 19 8 over that period  there is apparently plenty of upside left The space also looks quite cheap when compared with the market at large  as the trailing 12 month P E ratio for the S P 500 is 20 and the median level is 20 2  Price to Earnings Ratio  TTM  The chart below compares the industry s valuation picture with its sector  Such a comparison ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount  The Zacks Discretionary Sector s trailing 12 month P E ratio of 27 3 and the median level of 25 2 for the same period are significantly above the Zacks Furniture Industry s respective ratios  Price to Earnings Ratio  TTM  Underperformance May Continue Due to Bleak Earnings OutlookExpectations of increasing demand buoyed by robust economic fundamentals and solid wage growth build hope for the industry and in turn positive shareholder returns in the near future But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead  Although the above ratio analysis shows that there is value oriented path ahead  one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a near term rebound One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry s prospects of a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies  Empirical research shows that a company s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock One could get a good sense of a company s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with last year s reported number  but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates While the consensus loss estimate for the Zacks Furniture industry of  2 06 per share implies a decent 25 6  year over year improvement  the trend in earnings estimate revisions has not been favorable lately  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that the loss estimate of  2 06 per share has widened from April 2018                         Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Cloudy ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates continued outperformance in the near term The Zacks Furniture industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  224  which places it at the bottom 13  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Now  looking at the past revenue performances  the prospect of the industry also looks bleak 
 
Bottom LineSolid economic recovery and a strong labor market with rising consumer spending should favor the performance of the furniture industry  Further  the Fed s upbeat economic outlook presents a solid scope for the consumer driven furniture space Currently  there is only one stock that is cashing in on the positive economic fundamentals and is witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions with a bullish Zacks Rank You can see  American Woodmark Corp   AMWD   Headquartered in Winchester  VA  American Woodmark sports a Zacks Rank  1  The stock has  however  lost 5 5  over the past year                                       Price and Consensus  AMWDA slow market growth rate  commodity price inflation and looming tensions over a trade war could drag down the prospects of the furniture industry  Below are four stocks that carry a bearish Zacks Rank that we would recommend investors to stay away from for the time being Leggett   Platt  NYSE LEG   Inc   LEG   Carthage  MO based Leggett carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   The stock has lost 14 9  over the past year  The consensus earnings per share estimate for the company has moved 3 6  lower for the current year  over the last 90 days                                       Price and Consensus  LEG

119288,340803,LEG,LEG Stock Lost 38  In Two Years  Time To Buy ,opinion,"Less than two years ago  in February 2017  the price of Leggett   Platt  NYSE LEG  shares was hovering above  49 a share  LEG stock was still thought to be in an uptrend  following a steady rally from  10 03 in March 2009 
However  stocks get more risky as they rise  not less  Following a 400  rally in just 8 years  many might have started thinking LEG was a sure bet  Unfortunately  as the great Peter Lynch once wrote   stocks are most likely to be accepted as prudent at the moment they re not  
So instead of joining LEG stock bulls above  49 a share  we decided to put our Elliott Wave glasses on  As it turned out  while everyone was still in love with Leggett   Platt  its weekly chart already had  danger  written all over it  This chart was included in an article called  Leggett   Platt Not Done Falling   published on February 27th  2017  It revealed that LEG s entire rally from  10 to almost  55 had the structure of a textbook five wave impulse  The five sub waves of  1  and  3  were also clearly visible  In addition  waves  2  and  4  obeyed the guideline of alternation  Wave  2  was a sideways expanding flat correction  while wave  4  was a sharp zigzag 
LEG Stock Not a Wall Street Favorite Anymore
The reason for our pessimism rooted in the Elliott Wave postulate that a three wave correction in the opposite direction follows every impulse  Since wave  5  seemed to be over already  we thought a three wave decline to the support of wave  4  can be expected in LEG stock  The updated chart below shows the suffering Leggett   Platt investors had to go through recently 
Wave  b  led LEG stock to a new all time high of  54 97 in April 2017  only to make wave  c  even worse  The share price fell to as low as  34 07 last month  which translates into a 38  selloff in just 18 months  Fortunately  Elliott Wave analysis helped us dodge that bullet 
What to expect from now on  Well  the new high in wave  b  means LEG stock is most likely drawing an expanding flat correction  Wave  c   currently in progress  needs to evolve into a complete impulse pattern  Waves 4 and 5 of  c  are still missing so it makes sense to expect more weakness in the mid term  The support area near the 61 8  Fibonacci level is a reasonable bearish target 
On the other hand  once the stock approaches  30 a share  we should get ready for a bullish reversal  Leggett   Platt is a profitable company  which managed to maintain revenue growth despite all the headwinds in the industry  The current weakness looks like the opportunity long term investors have been waiting for

119317,340832,LEG,Should Value Investors Consider Leggett   Platt  LEG  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Leggett   Platt  Incorporated   NYSE LEG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Leggett   Platt has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 1  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Leggett   Platt s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 20 4  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Leggett   Platt has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Leggett   Platt s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Leggett   Platt has a P S ratio of about 1 7  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Leggett   Platt currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes LEG a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Leggett   Platt might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of D  This gives LEG a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and four downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 4 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined about 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Leggett   Platt  Incorporated Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLeggett   Platt is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 20  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  10 Minute Stock Picking SecretSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars But here s something even more remarkable  You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar  And then you can apply it to your portfolio in as little as 10 minutes a month ,2017-09-03,Zacks Investment

better than expected earnings in the third quarter of 2016  However  sales remained soft and missed estimates for the sixth consecutive quarter  While bottom line gained from unexpected deflation in raw material prices in the third quarter  top line results were hurt by divestitures  Further  management raised its EPS outlook for full year 2016 The company s quarterly adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 67 cents per share was flat year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents  The bottom line was primarily aided by lower tax rate due to the new accounting standard for stock based compensation  However  lower sales and reduced gain from commodity deflation were hindrances Delving DeeperNet sales from continuing operations of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company dropped nearly 6  to  948 9 million  falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 015 million  The decline can be attributed to the sale of four small businesses in the past

third quarter performance and the current lower commodity costs  the company raised its earnings per share forecast for 2016  despite lower sales  The company anticipates generating record EPS  robust

119352,340867,LEG,Leggett  LEG  Regains Strength  What s Driving The Stock ,opinion,Leggett   Platt Inc    NYSE LEG   shares have regained momentum of late primarily as the company returned to positive earnings trend in the last reported quarter  Further  the company s focus on developing its business portfolio  solid outlook  strategic initiatives and a disciplined capital allocation strategy bode well for future growth  The company s potential to grow is further supported by a long term earnings growth rate of 10  and  of  B  Notably  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock jumped 4 5  in the past three months  outperforming the Zacks categorized  sector s growth of 1 6  What s Aiding Stock Performance Much of the recent growth in stock price can be attributed to its solid earnings trend as evident from the earnings beat delivered in six of the preceding seven quarters  Consequently  the company has an average positive surprise of 2 3  in the trailing four quarters Leggett   Platt  Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Further  Leggett s confidence in delivering solid 2017 results backed by volume growth through content gains  new products  enhanced market share and overall market advancement  is providing a boost to sentiments  Following first quarter 2017  the company reiterated previously issued outlook for 2017  wherein it expects solid profit margins and earnings per share growth  largely driven by expected sales growth of 5 8  Additionally  Leggett recently chalked out its goals for 2019  based on the achievement of its top third TSR target over the next three years  These targets include revenue of about  4 75 billion  EBIT margin of 13 3   earnings per share of  3 25 and a dividend of  1 70 per share  The company intends to achieve these goals  given a stable macro environment with decent demand enhancement along with persistent content gains and product introductions  Further  the company anticipates these targets to be fueled by organic growth  which in turn is expected to be backed by strategic buyouts  with the absence of any non recurring factors Further  the company remains on track with its long term strategic plan  which was announced in Nov 2007  The company has successfully completed the first two parts of the strategic plan  wherein it divested low performing businesses in the first part and boosted margins as well as returns in the second part  Leggett is now working on the third part of the plan  which aims to achieve top line growth of 4 5  annually  Moreover  we believe Leggett has significant operating leverage to accomplish the third part of its plan as it has a considerable amount of retained spare production to meet the demand of  4 billion  Solid market demand  along with market share gains  has been enhancing capacity utilization over the years  Hence  the company will not require any large capital investment Moreover  Leggett s disciplined capital allocation strategy remains noteworthy  The company s capital strategy has always remained focused on making investments to develop business  while using excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks Going forward  Leggett expects to continue with its share repurchase program  having a standing authorization to buy back up to 10 million shares every year  after fulfilling all priority requirements  Also  the company plans to repurchase 3 4 million shares in 2017 in particular  while issuing nearly 2 million shares for employee benefit plans  As for dividends  the company outlined the target dividend payout ratio to be 50 60  of net earnings  in 2017  Moreover  the company is rationalizing capital expenditures  including store remerchandising efforts to improve its return on investment Possible DeterrentsThe company s performance remains prone to the fluctuations in raw material prices  particularly steel  Moreover  management expects the inflationary pressure on steel prices to persist in 2017  which may hurt Leggett s earnings  Further  currency woes and stiff competition pose significant threats Bottom LineThough the company s impediments cannot be ignored  we believe that its strategies and future targets indicate that it is surely poised for growth  However  we would suggest holding on to the stock to reap the benefits of the company s long term plans Stocks to ConsiderBetter ranked stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector include Marriott International   NASDAQ MAR    G III Apparel Group  LTD    NASDAQ GIII   and

119413,340928,LEG,LEG  44 Straight Years Of Dividend Growth And A 3 1  Yield,opinion,"Leggett   Platt  N LEG  is a blue chip dividend stock that has rewarded investors with 44 consecutive dividend increases 
With operations dating back to the 19th century and a 3 1  dividend yield  LEG is an interesting company for dividend investors to analyze Business OverviewLEG was founded in 1883 and patented the first steel coil bedspring  Over 130 years later  the company has grown into a diversified manufacturer of a broad variety of engineered components and products  e g  innersprings  recliner mechanisms  adjustable beds  steel wire  seat frames  carpet cushion  armrests  etc   used in bedding  furniture  carpet  cars  planes  and more around the world 
By end market  21  of LEG s 2014 revenue was bedding  16  fabric   carpet cushion  15  automotive  15  steel wire  11  furniture  7  consumer products  5  work furniture  3  aerospace  3  steel tubing  2  machinery  and 2  commercial vehicle products 
Overall  LEG s pegs its macro market exposure as follows  55  consumer durables  25  commercial   industrial  and 20  automotive 
By geography  approximately 69  of LEG s production was in the United States  11  in Europe  10  in China  6  in Canada  and 4  in other countries Business AnalysisAfter learning more about LEG and its industry  coming up with the competitive advantages that have driven the company s outstanding long term performance was still challenging  We believe that the company s management team has done an excellent job managing the business  and it s worth mentioning the incentive system in place 
LEG s management team receives bonus compensation that is based on incentives targeting annual return on capital employed  growth in margins  and achievement of a 3 year total shareholder return in the top third of the S P 500  Insiders also own more than 10  of LEG s outstanding shares  further aligning their capital allocation decisions with the best interest of the company s shareholders  The company s culture has certainly helped its longevity 
Back to LEG s actual operations  its strongest advantages are its long standing customer relationships and reputation for quality  LEG has been in the industry for over 100 years   its economies of scale as the largest player in the market  LEG is also vertically integrated   its focus on innovation to improve profits and growth  and its global distribution system 
Manufacturing components used in mattresses  furniture  cars  and other products is usually a tough business  Buyers are focused on keeping their costs low  and many components can easily become commoditized and purchased for less overseas 
LEG s entry into its key markets many decades ago helped it acquire number one or number two market share positions  which it has successfully maintained through innovation  LEG has issued over 1 300 patents  and conservative capital allocation  As the biggest player with vertically integrated operations  LEG owns its own steel rod mill and machinery   LEG is often one of the lowest cost providers of its products  It has also developed innovations to adjust to shifting market trends  including adjustable beds and a  Comfort Core  innerspring used in hybrid mattresses that replaces traditional foam cores and innersprings 
Beyond product innovation and cost efficient operations  LEG has successfully expanded the scope of its business well beyond bedding components with the help of acquisitions  For example  LEG formed its Aerospace Products business unit with the acquisition of Wester Pneumatic Tube  a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems  in January 2012  The company has also increased its focus on automotive markets  15  of sales   helping grow its global content per vehicle by 50  since 2009 
Through acquisitions  LEG has diversified its business into a number of niches that offer higher growth and profitability  In 1960  bedding components represented nearly 100  of LEG s sales  In 2014  the company s revenue from bedding was just 21  of sales  underscoring LEG s expansion into adjacent markets over the last 50 years 
Finally  LEG s markets are generally slow changing in nature  The problems solved by mattresses and furniture are timeless  and about two thirds of bedding and furniture purchases are made to replace existing products  This is a mature market with low single digit growth  The manufacturing processes and materials used to produce these goods are evolving  e g  foam mattresses  but at a mild pace 
LEG ultimately targets 4 5  annual revenue growth and consistent margin improvement driven by cost savings  new product development  and modest market growth Key RisksLEG s business is sensitive to several macroeconomic factors that are beyond its control  Changes in raw material costs  steel  and consumer spending trends have materially impacted LEG s sales and earnings in the past  and we expect them to remain important factors going forward over short term periods 
The best time to buy macro sensitive stocks is when demand is weak and sentiment around the business is overly pessimistic  This is not the case with LEG  Its operating margin reached its highest level since 1999 last quarter  and strong growth in automotive markets have helped fuel LEG s sales growth over the last five years  Additionally  sales of existing homes have been very strong  generating decent demand for mattresses and furniture 
While these factors impact LEG s business over the near term and seem to indicate lower timeliness for the stock today  they are less relevant to the company s 10 year outlook 
Our primary concerns with LEG are its margins  As a component supplier to price sensitive markets like furniture and automobiles  LEG s customers are always looking to save costs  With the bulk of its production in the U S   it s hard to imagine LEG maintaining a cost advantage over international players with cheaper labor  resources  and currencies 
Many of LEG s customers could also be forced to relocate or outsource more of their furniture and mattress manufacturing overseas to remain competitive in an increasingly global economy  LEG doesn t have nearly as large of a manufacturing footprint outside of the U S   which represented about 70  of its capacity last year  and could gradually be left behind with underutilized factories 
LEG s sprawling operations could eventually come back to hurt the company as well  LEG has 18 business units  which is a lot to manage and try to be great at  If the company loses focuses or has to reorganize  it could erode some of LEG s advantages  However  its business diversification also protects it from missing out on consumer trends  such as the move to memory foam mattresses 
It s also worth noting that LEG s top 10 customers accounted for 27  of its sales   if a major customer decides to source its components somewhere else or fundamentally change a product  LEG could experience a near term earnings hit Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
We think LEG s dividend is reasonably safe and have assigned the company a Dividend Safety Score of 66  While the company is somewhat cyclical and has slightly above average payout ratios  it is a great free cash flow generator in practically every market environment 
LEG s earnings and free cash flow payout ratios over the last 12 months are 68  and 57   respectively  LEG s earnings payout ratio was impacted by non cash goodwill impairment charges in recent years  so we will look at the company s free cash flow payout ratio instead  As seen below  LEG s payout ratio has increased a bit over the last decade but has otherwise remained between management s 50 60  target for most of the last five years  providing some cushion  no pun intended  and room for modest growth Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As we mentioned  LEG s business does have some cyclicality to it  During the last recession  LEG s sales fell by 25  in fiscal year 2009 as consumers put off big ticket discretionary purchases like furniture and mattresses Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Despite the cyclicality of LEG s revenue  the company is a free cash flow machine  Even during the worst of the financial crisis  LEG easily generated enough free cash flow per share to cover its current annual dividend payment   1 28 per share   As a matter of fact  LEG s free cash flow has more than covered the company s dividend payment for over 25 straight years  adding to the dividend s safety Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The company has also generated a decent return on invested capital each year despite the competitiveness of its markets  The company s scale  vertical integration  and efficient operations have helped it create value for shareholders  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Finally  it s very important to scrutinize the balance sheet for cyclical businesses  No one has a crystal ball  and macro conditions can quickly turn when management least expects it  If a company like LEG found itself with reduced cash flow and heavy debt or interest payments needing to be paid  the dividend could become at risk 
As seen below  LEG s balance sheet is reasonable  The company has enough cash   251 million  to cover its dividend payments and interest expense  and its free cash flow generation safely covers both items as well  All of the company s book debt could also be covered with cash on hand and 1 7 years of earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   Source  Simply Safe DividendsDividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
LEG s dividend growth potential is somewhat below average with a Dividend Growth Score of 43  The company has been a very reliable dividend grower with 44 consecutive years of increases  including a 3  raise in August 2015  but this dividend aristocrat has seen its growth decelerate over the last decade 
As seen below  LEG s dividend compounded by 7 2  per year over its last 10 fiscal years  but growth has slowed to about 3  per year more recently  The company targets a 50 60  payout ratio  which is right where it sits today  Going forward  we expect low single digit dividend growth to continue Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationLEG trades at about 18x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 3 1   which is lower than its five year average dividend yield of 3 9  
We view LEG as a well managed business  but we don t perceive it to have a substantial moat or long runway for earnings growth  For those reasons  we aren t overly excited about the company at 18x earnings and a dividend yield that is below its historical average 
However  management has done an excellent job of meeting the company s target to achieve a total shareholder return in the top one third of the S P 500  For the three year period that ended on 12 31 15  LEG delivered a 23  annualized total return  which placed it in the top 29  of the S P 500 
Management targets an annual total shareholder return  TSR  of 12 15  as follows 

4 5  TSR from revenue growth  half from GDP growth  half from acquisitions   share gains   new products
2 3  from EBIT margin improvement  20 30 basis points annually 
3 4  TSR from dividend yield
2 4  TSR from lower share count  via stock buyback 

Given our valuation concerns and lower conviction in LEG s business quality  we would prefer to wait for a cyclical downturn in the company s markets before getting more interested ConclusionLEG appears to be a well run business that has made the best of its positioning in very competitive markets  We believe the company s dividend payment has above average safety characteristics but below average growth prospects  While we aren t interested in buying the stock for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio today  we will keep an eye on it as we await an inevitable cyclical pullback ",2016-02-02,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/leg:-44-straight-years-of-dividend-growth-and-a-3.1-yield-382903,382903
