111616,333131,ECL,PQG Or ECL  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Chemical   Specialty sector might want to consider either PQ Group  PQG  or Ecolab  ECL   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
PQ Group and Ecolab are sporting Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that PQG likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ECL has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
PQG currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 73  while ECL has a forward P E of 32 12  We also note that PQG has a PEG ratio of 1 05  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  ECL currently has a PEG ratio of 2 58 
Another notable valuation metric for PQG is its P B ratio of 1 18  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ECL has a P B of 6 60 
Based on these metrics and many more  PQG holds a Value grade of B  while ECL has a Value grade of D 
PQG sticks out from ECL in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that PQG is the better option right now ",2019-10-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pqg-or-ecl-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200471868,200471868

111618,333133,ECL,Ecolab  ECL  Misses Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Ecolab  ECL  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 71 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 72 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 53 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  0 58   A quarter ago  it was expected that this cleaning  food safety and pest control services company would post earnings of  1 41 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 42  delivering a surprise of 0 71  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Ecolab  which belongs to the Zacks Chemical   Specialty industry  posted revenues of  3 82 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 77   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 75 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Ecolab shares have added about 30  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 3  
What s Next for Ecolab 
While Ecolab has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Ecolab was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 76 on  3 96 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 91 on  15 21 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Chemical   Specialty is currently in the bottom 13  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ecolab-ecl-misses-q3-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200479448,200479448

111655,333170,ECL,Ecolab  ECL  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Ecolab  ECL  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cleaning  food safety and pest control services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 41 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11  
Revenues are expected to be  3 78 billion  up 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ecolab 
For Ecolab  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ecolab will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ecolab would post earnings of  1 02 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 03  delivering a surprise of  0 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ecolab doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ecolab-ecl-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200443213,200443213

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook

111678,333193,ECL,Ecolab  ECL  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Ecolab  ECL  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cleaning  food safety and pest control services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 02 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 1  
Revenues are expected to be  3 57 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 08  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ecolab 
For Ecolab  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ecolab will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ecolab would post earnings of  1 54 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 54  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ecolab doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ecolab-ecl-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200409515,200409515

111718,333233,ECL,Ecolab  ECL  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Ecolab  ECL  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 19  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cleaning  food safety and pest control services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 55 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 5  
Revenues are expected to be  3 76 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 5  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ecolab 
For Ecolab  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 19  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ecolab will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ecolab would post earnings of  1 55 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 53  delivering a surprise of  1 29  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ecolab doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ecolab-ecl-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200386948,200386948

111820,333335,ECL, 2 Stocks Set To Soar 25   In 2018  And 3 To Sell Now ,opinion,"Interest rates are soaring   so dividend stocks are yesterday s news  Right 
Yes and no 
While some double digit paying dogs should be sold immediately  other dividend growers should be bought today for 25   upside in 2018 
The truth is  the 10 year Treasury yield s recent run to 2 7   a 13  rise since January 1  has tapped the brakes on the stock market rally and hit high yield plays like REITs hard 
10 Year Rises  High Yielders Wobble

If you hold high yielders in your portfolio  you likely know what I m talking about 
So should you be worried  No way 
In fact  now is the time to buy  I ll show you two dividend plays that should be high on your list shortly  including a bargain real estate play with a 5 5  yield and incredible dividend growth  
First  if you ve followed my articles on Contrarian Outlook  you probably know what I m going to say next  while a rise in rates may temporarily hit dividend payers  they re actually a long term plus because they signal a strong economy  And that way more than cancels out the higher borrowing costs these companies will face 
It s been proven over and over  including the market in the last rising rate period  from 2004 06 
Some Dividends Are Still Sucker s Bets
But we still need to be careful  because some companies pay out more than they bring in through earnings per share  EPS  or free cash flow  FCF   And others are so hobbled by debt   and feeble growth   that even slightly higher rates could tip their payouts  and stock prices  over the cliff 
We ll look at three of these toxic stocks now  Then we ll move on to those two dividend champs I mentioned earlier 
Toxic Dividend Stock  1  CenturyLink  12  yield 
If you need proof that dividend hounds are getting desperate  check out the beating CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  shares have laid on the S P 500 since January 1 
A Fool s Rally
There s one number driving this pile on  12   That s the absurd dividend yield this telecom stock pays  And   CenturyLink s payout is having a classic Wile E  Coyote moment 
That s because the company can t count on rising sales  revenue dropped 8  in the third quarter   EPS  down 39   or FCF  down 41 4   to backstop its dividend  No wonder it s paying out a totally unsustainable 253  of trailing twelve month FCF and 373  of EPS as dividends 
My take  Don t be taken in by CenturyLink s eye popping yield and deceptively cheap forward P E of 13  This stock is cheap for a reason  its payout is on borrowed time 
Toxic Dividend  2  Tupperware Brands  4 9  yield 
Tupperware Brands Corporation  NYSE TUP  dividend yield has lurched to 4 9   but that s not because the plastic container peddler just gave investors a fat raise   it s because the stock cratered 13  over 3 days last week 
Not the Payout Pop You Want
The reason  TUP s Q4 earnings report left the herd cold  even though adjusted EPS jumped 10   to  1 59  revenue fell 2   meaning cost cuts  not sales growth  puffed up the bottom line 
The company s forecast was also bland  the midpoint of expected 2018 EPS   4 58  was just 4  higher than the  4 41 TUP earned last year  That s just not enough to lift the dividend 
And if TUP comes up short  a payout cut is definitely in play  given the 96  of FCF the dividend ate up in the last 12 months 
One thing that could whack TUP s earnings forecast is its high exposure to volatile emerging markets  and their currencies   around 67  of sales  That s just too risky for my taste   especially when there are fast growing  and safe  payouts available  like the two I ll show you further on 
Meantime  we need to talk about 
Toxic Dividend  3  Kraft Heinz  3 2  yield 
Kraft Heinz Co  NASDAQ KHC   To see how the game has changed for food stocks like KHC  look no further than the closest supermarket  people are clearly craving more natural food and less processed fare 
And Kraft Heinz s banners are way behind the curve 
Yesterday s Brands
Source  kraftheinzcompany com
No wonder the consumer staples giant is showing the same pattern we saw with Tupperware  rising earnings propped up by cost cuts  not growth  In Q3  Kraft Heinz s sales dipped 1 7   while adjusted EPS soared 15  
Which brings me to the dividend  in the last 12 months  Kraft Heinz paid out a worrying 92  of earnings and 126  of FCF to shareholders 
Sure  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  is a major KHC shareholder  but that s not enough to offset the company s weak growth  ho hum 3 2  yield and the very real chance payout growth will stall   if not reverse   knocking down the share price when it does 
Which brings me to 
2 Cheap Dividend Champs to Buy Now
Now that we know what to keep out of our portfolio in 2018  let s pivot to 2 dividend payers set to thrive as rates head higher  starting with one you really need to move on in the next couple days 
Dividend Champ  1 Brookfield Property Partners  5 5  yield 
I recommended Brookfield Property Partners  NASDAQ BPY   owner of malls  office towers  warehouses and apartments the world over  in a  for 3 reasons 
A healthy dividend  5 5  as I write  
Strong payout growth  with the dividend up 18  since BPY was spun off from Brookfield Asset Management  BAM  in 2013  and
Almost zero volatility  You can practically set your watch by this one 
A Steady Course
Don t take this to mean you would have lost money with Brookfield  Because when you add in that nice dividend  you get this 
BPY s True Gain
I know what you re thinking  that rise still trails the S P 500  which nearly doubled in that time  But keep in mind that BPY s return was in cash  while folks holding your average S P 500 name were stuck with a pathetic sub 2  payout 
Besides  that disrespect is what s behind our opportunity  Because BPY  technically a partnership  not a REIT  trades at 74  of book value  or what it would be worth if it were broken up and sold off today  
That s ridiculous for the company s top notch portfolio  which is throwing off high single digit growth in funds from operations  FFO  a better measure of BPY s performance than EPS  and a soaring dividend payout 

Management knows the score  they re calling for 8  to 11  yearly FFO growth through 2021  and yearly dividend hikes of 5  to 8  to match  With BPY s next payout increase set to be announced February 8  the time to buy is now 
Dividend Champ  2  Ecolab  1 2  Yield 
Ecolab  NYSE ECL  isn t the sexiest company out there  it peddles water treatment products  cleaners and lubricants  as well as services that help cut use of water and other resources  It has clients in dozens of industries  from manufacturers to food makers 
The stock s yield is also a yawner for most dividend fans  at just 1 2  
But if either so called weakness keeps you away  you re making a mistake 
For one steady demand for Ecolab s products mean the company is a free cash flow machine  with FCF more than doubling in the last decade 
A Cash Cow
And don t be fooled by that low dividend yield  it masks a payout that s surged higher every single year for the last 25 years  It s nearly doubled in the last 5 years alone  including a hefty 11  hike in December 
Those payout hikes will continue  thanks to growing sales as the global economy takes off  Ecolab saw higher revenue across all 3 of its divisions   Global Energy  Global Industrial and Global Institutional   in Q3 
Wall Street thinks the party s just starting  too  and for once  I agree  The average analyst estimate calls for EPS of  5 34 for 2018  up nearly 14  from a forecast  4 69 in 2017   ECL reports Q4 earnings February 20  
Throw in a ridiculously low payout ratio of 33  of earnings  and 41  of FCF   and further dividend growth is a lock  And that  in turn  will drive more of the market crushing share price gains ECL shareholders love 
Stock Price Climbs the Dividend Ladder
How to Make an Easy 12  a Year Forever
Dividend growth like you d get from Ecolab  and even faster  is precisely what s behind the portfolio I want to show you now  it s a set of 7 ultra conservative stocks I personally handpicked to deliver you 12  in safe  annual returns for life 
That s 3 times more income than most retirement experts say you need 
So what stocks am I talking about 
You won t find weak pundit favorites like Kraft Heinz in this  portfolio  Instead  you get these 3 picks  and 4 MORE  to boot   
A stock that has already boosted its dividend payments more than 800  over the past 4 years and has at least another decade of double digit growth left 
A  double threat  income and growth stock that rose more than 252  the last time it was anywhere near as cheap as it is right now 
A 9  plus payer that raises its dividend more than once a year and will double its payout by 2021 at its current pace 
This portfolio is perfect for retirement because it gives you the best aspects of numerous types of investment strategies income  growth and nest egg protection 
And as I said  it provides 3 times more income than most retirement experts say you need

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Kraft Heinz  KHC   EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  and CME Group  CME   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Kraft Heinz s shares have declined  26 3  over the last one year  underperforming the Zacks Diversified Food industry which is down  11  over the same period  Kraft Heinz posted lower than expected results in the fourth quarter of 2017 with both earnings and sales missing expectations  
Net sales increased by a meager 0 3  year over year  but earnings declined 1 1  from the year ago level  Sales growth continued to face challenges in the quarter due to softness in the U S  retail environment  Organic sales in the United States declined 1 1  year over year due to lower volume  
Soft consumer demand in North America and Canada along with a 4  year over year decline in gross profit affected the company s fourth quarter earnings  Kraft Heinz has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preferences toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food  Additionally  earnings estimates are trending downward for 2018 over the last 30 days 
 You can   
Shares of Buy rated EOG Resources have gained around  1 3  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks Oil   Gas E P Industry  which has declined  15 9  over the same period  EOG holds premium acreages in the Permian  Bakken and Eagle Ford oil shale plays in the United States where it has identified 17 000 premium wells that could lend access to almost 11 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves  
In the Eagle Ford alone  EOG identified 7 200 locations that will drive the firm s oil production  Meanwhile  the company continues to lower its well drilling and exploration expenses  
In the next 10 years  EOG plans to drill many premium oil wells and its strong emphasis on reducing costs has led to an encouraging outlook  In the fourth quarter  the firm surpassed both the top and bottom lines  thanks to higher commodity price realizations 
 You can   
Buy rated CME Group s shares have outperformed the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry over the last one year  gaining  34  vs   27 2   CME Group s fourth quarter 2017 results outpaced expectations but deteriorated year over year due to lower trading volumes  
The company remains well positioned for growth on a strong market position with diverse derivative product lines  Efforts to expand and cross sell its core exchange traded business via new product initiatives and global reach also support growth  
It intends to exit its credit default swap clearing business by mid 2018 and focus on over the counter clearing services on interest rate swaps as well as foreign exchange  This will free up  650 million as clearing member capital   
However  expenses remain a concern  Adjusted total operating expenses excluding license fees are projected to range between  1 10 billion and  1 11 billion in 2018   Exposure to interest rate volatility and limited credit availability might hamper liquidity

111824,333339,ECL,Value Vs Momentum    Investing s  Oil And Water   ,opinion,"Jim Cramer  a CNBC personality  created the acronym  FANG  in 2013 to describe this cycle s particular phenomena which has been a feature of every market cycle in history  FANG stands for Facebook  Apple  Netflix and Google  Every market cycle begins with Value Investor buying which creates a recession low  Value Investors create the major lows of every market cycle  Value Investors are investors who view investing through a long term lens taking into consideration the long term growth of the US economy in the context of the long term global economic growth trends and then sort out individual companies they deem undervalued enough to produce future investment gains  As the economic cycle shows signs of improvement  Momentum Investors are drawn in by rising price trends  Momentum Investors believe all they need to know is in the price trend  Every market cycle is characterized by the perception and behavior of these two investor styles  Value and Momentum 
What is lost in the daily investment frenzy is that Value vs  Momentum use the same descriptive terms  i e   value    returns    growth   but these terms mean entirely different things to each  So different is the meaning of  value  between Value and Momentum investors that neither understand the other s perspective  A Value and Momentum Investor conversation is much like trying to mix oil and water 
What is seen in the media is roughly a 95  Momentum perspective  The reasons for this is markets have many twists and turns which feeds media reporting  Momentum Investors who base investment decisions on these twists and turns are always ready with commentary which satisfies the media need for new content  The media provides a constant stream of adjustments to stock and bond price targets to gain investor viewership  This is the basic ad revenue model  The constant focus on those investments which appear to be growing faster than others causes advisors to have an opinion on these issues as a means of gaining a media appearance  By having an opinion on a media favorite  advisory firms gain free advertising by proffering an opinion and the media receives free content  In this climate  certain issues become overly reported and supported in every cycle  In the current cycle  Cramer coined the acronym  FANG  to gain attention to his own commentary and drive view ship 
Every cycle has its issues which carry a  newness  feature which make them appear different and highly desirable  Technology  Internet and Biotech issues have been those issues for recent cycles  Almost to an issue  they are more hope than substance  They carry investor expectations of gains well above average market returns and are always priced to extremes vs  market averages  Their Pr Sales  Pr Cash Flow  Price Earnings are astronomical relative to market averages and justified by many advisors with commentary that  growth deserves high pricing   In the midst of the market investment frenzy  the majority of investors come to believe that price trends and positive surprises or market commentary justifies higher prices  Ignored are the true bottom line growth metrics over time  i e  the growth of Net Income and Book Value per Share  which represent actual long term value for investors 
Every market cycle eventually incorporates the current group of  high growth  issues into the indices against which quarter to quarter performance is judged  With dominance of indices by these over priced and daily hyped issues  investors tend to judge their own performance and economic activity by index price trends  Every market cycle sucks investors into comparing their own returns with the price trends of the most discussed issues  This is the situation today as underlined by this March 27  2018  headline  True growth actually lies elsewhere 

In the media s desire to sell advertising by constantly refreshing viewership content  true growth issues are ignored  One of these is even today little known by most investors  Danaher NYSE DHR   It is the DHRs of the world which are the true value creators of the US economy 

DHR has grown more than 100x than the S P 500 in its history  It is a manufacturing company of thousands of industrial products which has made roughly 1 000 acquisitions since the 1970s and grown by making ordinary things profitably through the DBS  Danaher Business System   DHR is not the only company which has an exceptional long term growth record that is much better than the S P 500  Roughly 10  of companies have superior long term performance relative to the SP500 and they rarely receive media attention  Companies like DHR  have consistent Net Income and Book Value per Share  Shareholder Equity per Share  growth and are responsible for the long term performance of the indices  Because they have a slow news pace  they are nearly universally ignored by investors  Wall Street and the media

The secret to finding these types of companies is that it is not a secret at all  However  one does have to seek them out  One identifies them by seeking long term price performance which is coupled to long term underlying business financial performance  Market pricing always reflects cycles of market psychology which provides numerous opportunities to buy issues cheaply  Two companies which fit these criteria are Ecolab Inc  NYSE ECL  and Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   The 1st produces hygiene products and the 2nd is a railroad  The common denominator is that both companies have exceptional managements 

The key to locating great investments is the identification of very good management teams  That is the secret to exceptional investment returns over time  In the Russell 2000  there are roughly 200 companies responsible for the long term performance of this index  Owning these issues at the right price is how one out performs any index

111849,333364,ECL,MedTech Growing On Emerging Markets  M A  Stocks To Buy,opinion,"A survey report by Gallup Analytics last month revealed that U S  adults cited healthcare  the wider industry of medical devices  as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration  Given the current lack of clarity  let s concentrate on some powerful long term tailwinds of the medical device industry like emerging market expansion  mergers   acquisitions  M A   positive demographic trends and new product innovation  These have been driving the sector s impressive performance despite severe socio economic and political instability 
Let s elaborate some of the major long term drivers of the MedTech sector 
Emerging Market Openings
It has been seen that even considering the dull performance of the U S  medical device market  that still holds the leading position with almost one third of the world market share  on rising regulatory and legislative uncertainty  global growth has been strong  In 2016  this industry grew 5   a pace last seen before the financial crisis 
And when along with the health policy debacle in the United States we also consider the worsening economic condition in Europe  we can conclude that this encouraging global growth comes mainly from the emerging markets like China  India  Latin America and others 
Going by a recent BCG report  the share of emerging markets  which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues  is likely to increase to nearly one third of revenues by 2022  The MedTech market in China  currently the second largest in the world  is projected to grow about 13  annually from 2015 through 2022  India s MedTech market  the fifth largest in the world  is currently demonstrating 17  annual growth  If this continues  India may give good competition to Japan and Germany by 2022 
Among other emerging geographical regions  Latin America  even in the face of general economic stagnation  holds enormous potential  Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence  the Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare between 2008 and 2014 
Given the huge potential in these regions  long back  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  had set up manufacturing and R D centers in Brazil  China and India  The company s medical device segment of emerging markets is growing three to four times faster than the developed markets 
Abbott Labs  ABT  continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50  of sales from this region  In recent quarters  sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits  driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America  including Colombia  Mexico  Peru and Argentina 
At Medtronic  NYSE MDT   MDT   in the last reported first quarter of fiscal 2017  businesses in China  Latin America  and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength  growing in double digits  Overall  Medtronic remains confident about its long term outlook on emerging markets  The company is focused on developing new public and private partnerships as well as executing channel optimization strategies 
Boston Scientific s  BSX  emerging markets business registered 14  organic growth in second quarter 2017  reflecting a significant increase from 8  growth in 2013  Business in China was once again remarkable  up 20  year over year   The company is currently looking forward to much better performance ahead in China  banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY in China 
Major M As 
Following the company s colossal  25 billion consolidation with St  Jude Medical in January  Abbott recently closed its  5 3 billion acquisition of Alere  With the successful wrap up of this transaction  the combined company anticipates to emerge as a lead player in the  7 billion point of care diagnostic space 
Another path breaking mega consolidation is on its way  between medical device major Becton  Dickinson and Co   BDX  and medical  surgical  diagnostic and patient care devices provider C  R  Bard Inc   BCR   for  24 billion  After the completion of the deal  expected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017   Becton  Dickinson promises to create a third business segment   BD Interventional 
In August  Fresenius Medical Care AG   Co  KGAA  FMS  signed a  2 billion deal to acquire NxStage Medical  NXTM   The takeover is expected to boost revenues at the Care Coordination segment Fresenius Medical Care 
Johnson   Johnson s medical device arm  in a move to expand internationally  recently agreed to acquire Germany based Surgical Process Institute  a specialist for the standardization and digitalization of surgical workflows in the operating theatre 
This apart  Boston Scientific s acquisition of Switzerland based Symetis SA in May 2017 should fortify its structural heart business in Europe  Also  the company s recently closed  300 million deal to acquire Campbell  CA based Apama Medical should fortify the company s position in the Electrophysiology market 
Among other notable bids  worth mentioning is Integra LifeSciences  recent acquisition of Codman Neurosurgery business from Johnson   Johnson for  1 045 billion  This apart  in September  Cooper entered into an agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  to acquire the global rights and business of Teva s PARAGARD Intrauterine Device  IUD  in a  1 1 billion cash transaction 
Divestments 
Medical device majors continue to offload their non core business lines  specifically to focus on the main segments and to divest assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers  These divestures have been mandated by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and other international anti trust regulators  This restricts chances of monopoly in the market 
In order to focus on a portfolio that delivers on global strategic priorities  Medtronic decided to divest part of its PMR  patient monitoring and recovery  division within the MITG  Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  business to Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  for a deal value of  6 1 billion 
Following the announcement of its two major buyouts  Abbott divested its eyecare business  Abbott Medical Optics  AMO   to Johnson   Johnson for about  4 33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines 
A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems  Cynosure  recently sold itself to Hologic  Inc   HOLX   Notably  Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately  1 65 billion 
To sharpen its strategic focus on core businesses  Ecolab  NYSE ECL  recently decided to sell its Equipment Care business to Audax Private Equity  a Boston  MA based private equity firm  Also Wright Medical s  WMGI  recent divestiture of its large joints  hip knee  business to CorinOrthopaedics is an example of the focus that the former puts on its core businesses 
In another development  in its bid to reduce and refine its portfolio and repay long term debts  Community Health Systems  Inc   CYH  divested Rockwood Health System and the associated assets to MultiCare Health System 
Key Picks from the Space
Among the medical product stocks  Terumo Corporation  TRUMY   sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   looks attractive  Abbott  Neogen Corporation  NEOG  and ResMed Inc   RMD  are also well poised with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
In the medical instrument space  we are positive on Luminex Corporation  LMNX  and Olympus Corporation  OCPNY   both carrying a Zacks Rank  1  among others  Also  we are optimistic about Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc   NYSE TMO   Steris Plc  STE  and Mesa Laboratories  Inc   MLAB   all with a Zacks Rank  2 
The Weak Links

111863,333378,ECL,Political Uncertainty Hits U S  Markets As  Trump Trade  Takes A Pause,opinion,"While the majority of the financial world has its focus on every move in Washington D C   there is another very important development happening in the German bond market  What was once the best short bet for some very high profile investors  it s now become the next widow maker trade as German yields plunge to levels not seen before  While U S  yields have begun to reflate on higher growth and inflation potential  the German interest rate market has refused to join  as political worries across Europe have made German fixed income the place to hide  In addition  the ECB continues to buy bonds monthly as part of their continuing QE  All the buying and lack of selling has driven the two year German bond yield to less than  0 9   Not sure how anyone without a forex bet makes money in two year paper from here  but it does tell me that there are many worried European investors  This can be great news if you are a distressed or value buyer of European risk assets  But with yields falling so precipitously  one has to think that prices could get even cheaper  The rising uncertainty has been great for day to day volatility and noise which my international counter trend algorithms enjoy  But for most global investors  the action in German bonds only raises the hair on the back of our necks  So keep an eye on those bonds trading in the clouds  Their direction might be your sign to buy Euro risk assets or to bolt the main gate 
The yield on Germany s 2 Year bond has fallen to another record negative low this morning as bondholders snap up German assets amid escalating fears about the EU s political stability  Dubbed one of the  most sought after assets in financial markets   the price on Germany s two year  schatz  bond has been pushed to an all time high this week  driving yields head long towards the minus 1 per cent mark  Yields are currently trading at minus 0 96 according to Bloomberg and have declined 15 basis points this week   their best performance since the depths of the eurozone crisis in July 2012  The rally has been turbo charged by fears that Marine Le Pen is closing the gap on her rivals in France s presidential election and could come good on her promise to take the eurozone s second largest economy out of the single currency area 

 Back in the U S   political uncertainty also hit our financial markets last week as the  Trump Trade  took a pause 
President Trump s drive to greatness hit a few bumps last week as conflicting reports of the White House s goals hit the tape  As bold ideas get closer to specific details  the markets can tell that the policy makers are working 24 7  and not always on the same page  as they float those details to Congress  the press and to the people  While Secretary Mnuchin appeared to back away from 2017 infrastructure spending plans and corporate income tax cuts on CNBC  Gary Cohn was backing away from the Border Tax to a group of CEOs  Then within the same 24 hour period  denials of both came from others within the White House  The good news is that everyone is working on their plans  Now hopefully Congress and the White House can all get on the same page before summer with the fine details  If not  expect more disappointment and chop from the markets 
 Here is what U S  political disappointment looks like in the U S  markets 
While bond yields move to 2017 lows  the S P 500 continues to float higher 

But last week  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  began to prepare investors for future disappointment in the markets 
It has been a year since the last 10  US equity market drawdown but long periods of stability are not good indicators of drawdown risk  In recent years  investors have bled premium by hedging positions while stocks continued to climb  Looking ahead  the distribution of market outcomes appears asymmetrical  Near term downside catalysts include  1  investor recognition that lower corporate tax rates may not take effect until 2018   2  multiple Fed hikes   3  European elections 
 Goldman Sachs 
Looking at the Border Tax mechanics  would the White House really want the U S  dollar to rise by 25  
Marty Feldstein pencils out why a Border Tax would work 
The House plan calls for cutting the corporate tax rate to 20  from 35   It would also impose a 20  tax on all imports while giving a 20  subsidy to all exports  What would this mean in practice  Imports constitute about 15  of American gross domestic product  so the 20  tax would raise revenue equal to 3  of GDP  On the other side of the ledger  exports are about 12  of American GDP  meaning the subsidy would cost the Treasury only 2 4  of GDP  The net effect of the two would therefore be tax revenue equal to 0 6  of GDP about  120 billion a year and more than  1 trillion over the next decade 
Retailers and importers understandably fear that the tax would raise the cost of their products and inputs  ultimately increasing prices for consumers  But the border adjustment would also cause the international value of the dollar to rise  reducing the cost of imports by enough to offset the tax 
Here s why the dollar would rise  Without a change in the currency s value  the border adjustment would cause imports to fall and exports to rise  reducing the overall U S  trade deficit  But it is a fundamental fact of economics that the size of a country s trade deficit equals the difference between national investment and national saving  Since the border adjustment tax would not alter either investment or saving  there must be no change in the trade deficit  What would happen instead is a 25  increase in the dollar relative to other currencies  enough to offset the tax on imports and the subsidy on exports 
  
Besides the Border Tax  the other major radical idea being discussed is eliminating the interest expense deduction 
The measure would force companies to include the interest they pay on loans in their taxable income  That could pit financial services firms such as banks and insurers that have been promised relief from the proposal against private equity firms  which rely on leverage and wouldn t get special treatment 
As Ryan struggles to get support within his own party for border adjustments  the interest provision is more likely to be included in a House tax bill  according to Robert Willens  an independent tax and accounting expert  That s because eliminating interest deductions may be politically easier for Congress to support since consumers wouldn t be directly affected  as critics of border adjustability argue  Willens said 
More House Republicans are also supportive of making the tax treatment of debt equal to that of equity  which the GOP interest provision would effectively do  since companies can t currently deduct dividend payments  according to Willens 
Corporate earnings commentary continues to suggest higher growth and higher prices 

 I think everybody is optimistic it s really not specific to one particular industry  okay  It s really across the board and it s across the country  whether it be if you re on the East Coast  West Coast  the mid chapters  what have you  all of our companies are all simultaneously doing better than  frankly  we would have thought    Reliance Steel CEO  Gregg Mollins 
 We would expect that you re going to see a change  We already started to see it in the fourth quarter in some of the businesses  The price lag usually is several quarters for us we re going to have some margin pressure from inflation in the first couple of quarters there are certain markets where we ve clearly seen wage inflation driven by the low unemployment   Ecolab  NYSE ECL  CEO  Doug Baker 

And the U S  remains very far from an inverted yield curve  thus reducing recessionary fears  

And if you have been a student of the market for long  you will know that early year strength in equities tends to persist 
 If you need additional encouragement that a bear market is not just around the corner  history again may offer some more virtual Valium   says Stovall  who delivers our call of the day 
Since 1945  there have been 27 years when the S P has achieved gains in January and February  The stock index then finished up for the year  on a total return basis  in every one those years  according to Stovall  That s going 27 for 27  or batting a thousand 
The average rise in those years was 24   as shown in his chart below  and the gauge was up further in the remaining 10 months 25 of 27 times 

Junk credit prices remain stellar  But also note the continued post election recovery in emerging market bonds 

Looking across the major U S  equity sectors  the Technology chart has taken on a life of its own 

And Healthcare is rising like a phoenix 

Energy on the other hand could not be more disappointing 
The good news is that much of the pain in the chart is caused by an increase in U S  production  good for jobs  and the 10 degree above normal temps that we are all experiencing  good for household expenses

My other favorite tidbit from the Berkshire Hathaway 2016 Annual Report 

 BNSF  like other Class I railroads  uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost 500 miles  Those economics make railroads four times as fuel efficient as trucks  Furthermore  railroads alleviate highway congestion   and the taxpayer funded maintenance expenditures that come with heavier traffic   in a major way  

Opioid addiction should be a top priority in Washington D C 
A Fed Governor mentioned the negative effect of opioids on the U S  workforce last week  Now here is Goldman Sachs discussing it in more detail 
In addition to the mortality data  there are further signs of health related distress in the US prime age population  Alan Kruger has documented that nearly half of prime age men who are not in the labor force take pain medication on a daily basis and almost 20  report that their health is poor  The left hand chart of Exhibit 7 shows that Americans are far more likely to use opioids than Europeans  while the right hand chart shows that drug related problems have worsened considerably in the US  with the number of drug related deaths tripling since 2000  As with many potential contributors to reduced labor force participation  health and drug issues should probably be viewed as both cause and effect to some degree  Nevertheless  the data suggest that these factors are likely part of the explanation for why the US prime age participation rate stands out

Expect to see more stories like this one as the ban on foreign travel increases 

 I m a lot safer in Jordan   he says   You hear about people being robbed and killed  in the U S   all the time  My relatives say sometimes even in gas stations  there are bullet proof windows between people working there and the customer  You never have to worry about that here  

Most Jordanians say their biggest problems are economic  At a demonstration Friday in downtown Amman to protest price increases in fuel and public services  another recent graduate  Zina Khabbas  said she was thinking of moving to the Gulf 
Khabbas  wearing designer sunglasses and an elegant head scarf woven with gold threads  is an engineer  She says it s tough to make ends meet in Jordan  but neither she nor her friends are considering the U S 

 America was an opportunity for people here before   says the 22 year old   But now  no one is actually thinking about the United States for a future place to live  

The ban is starting to work its way into all of the U S  Int l travel data 
Following the Jan  27 ban on travel to the U S  by nationals from Iran  Iraq  Libya  Yemen  Somalia  Sudan and Syria  net bookings from those seven countries were down 80  between Jan  28 and Feb  4  compared with the same period last year  according to flight reservation transactions analyzed by the travel data company ForwardKeys 
ForwardKeys also reported a 6 5  drop in overall international travel to the U S  for the same period when compared with the equivalent eight day period the year before 
Meanwhile  Hopper  a flight app that tracks GDS searches in order to analyze fare prices and demand  also found that the number of flight searches for travel from international points of origin to the U S    a key indicator of future travel intent   was down 17  the week of Jan  27  Last year  there was only a 1 8  decline during the same time period 

You wonder if the travel ban is now becoming a drag on U S  hotel occupancy 

What could the impact be of a reduction in unauthorized immigrants 
There are 11 million undocumented workers in the U S  they make up about 4 5  of Denver  7 7  of Los Angeles and 8 8  of Houston  If all of them picked up and left one day  how would that impact real estate prices and the local economies 

The pricing for Uber s next fund raise will be interesting to watch 
If there is one quote that sums up the ethos of Uber  it might be this cut from the company s firebrand CEO Travis Kalanick   Stand by your principles and be comfortable with confrontation  So few people are  so when the people with the red tape come  it becomes a negotiation   But after a month marked by one disaster after another  it s hard to see how Uber s defiant  confrontational attitude hasn t blown up in its face  And those disasters mask one key  critical issue  Uber is doomed because it can t actually make money 
After a discombobulated 2016  in which Uber burned through more than  2 billion  amid findings that rider fares only cover roughly 40 percent of a ride  with the remainder subsidized by venture capitalists  it s hard to imagine Kalanick could take the company public at its stunning current valuation of nearly  70 billion 
And now  in the past few weeks alone  Uber has been accused of having a workplace that fosters a culture of misogyny  accused of stealing from Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  the blueprint of a successful self driving system  and has lost 200 000 customers over ties to President Donald Trump and how it responded to a taxi driver boycott

111931,333446,ECL,ECL  Outstanding Long Term Growth Outlook,opinion,"The Gates Foundation is one of the largest institutional shareholders of Ecolab  N ECL   Although its dividend yield is low  1 4    the company s long term growth outlook is outstanding and supported by ECL s moat  90  recurring revenue in the form of essential consumables  entrenched customer relationships  twice as large as its next biggest competitor  25 000 customer facing employees  
We look for these types of business for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio and believe that weak energy markets  currency headwinds  and sluggish global growth could be providing a buying opportunity Business OverviewECL s sells a wide range of sanitizers  cleaners  lubricants  cleaning systems  dispensers  water treatment products  and on site services that are used by customers in virtually every industry  e g  restaurants  hotels  hospitals  laundromats  manufacturing plants  oil wells  etc   to keep their food safe  maintain clean environments  and optimize water and energy use 
To give you an idea of ECL s scope of business  during 2014 the company helped customers wash more than 31 million hands  clean dairy operations to help process 330 billion glasses of milk  process 1 2 billion loads of laundry  manager water on 100 offshore oil platforms  wash more than 146 billion plates  and manage 14 trillion liters of water  Overall  ECL is in more than 1 million customer locations in 172 countries around the world 
The company merged with Nalco in 2011 in an  8 billion deal to become the global leader in water  hygiene  and energy technologies and services  This deal increased the company s exposure to industrial markets  which are big users of water treatment products  and helped ECL serve customers more comprehensively  In 2013  ECL acquired Champion Technologies for  2 billion to significantly enhance its position in the upstream energy services market 
By geography  ECL generated 56  of its 2014 revenue in North America  24  in Europe  Middle East and Africa  12  in Asia Pacific  and 8  in Latin America 
SegmentsGlobal Industrial  35  of 2014 sales   provides water treatment and process applications  and cleaning and sanitizing solutions primarily to large customers within the manufacturing  food and beverage processing  chemical  metals and mining  power generation  pulp and paper  and laundry industries 
Global Institutional  30  of sales   provides specialized cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice  hospitality  lodging  healthcare  government  education  and retail industries 
Global Energy  30  of sales   serves the process chemical and water treatment needs of the global petroleum and petrochemical industries in both upstream and downstream applications  The biggest piece of the business is oil fuel chemicals that treat reservoirs  e g  kill bacteria  prevent corrosion  clean water  
Other  5  of sales   provides pest elimination and kitchen equipment repair and maintenance Business AnalysisECL is a unique business  The company has a large portfolio of valuable and protected technologies  over 6 700 patents  that allow it to sell its solutions at 10 20  price premiums compared to competitors  offerings  While the initial cost is higher  the savings that these products deliver over time  e g  less waste  more energy efficient  more reliable  make them cheaper 
However  ECL s main competitive advantages are its dependable service quality and people  At the end of the day  ECL is selling service and consistency  e g  food needs to be kept safe  water needs to be kept clean  etc   
ECL has around 47 000 employees  and a whopping 25 000 are customer facing  These employees visit more than a million customer sites in 172 countries each year to provide service  These frequent touchpoints reinforce the value of ECL s unique products and systems being used by the customer 
On site visits also enable numerous growth opportunities for the company  ECL s service driven business model allows it to pursue a unique growth strategy that it calls   Circle the Customer   Circle the Globe   Essentially  ECL realizes that its customers are spending about  6 on addressable products for every  1 they spend with ECL  the company s addressable market is  100 billion in size and highly fragmented  ECL is the largest player with 14  market share share  
Once ECL establishes a relationship with a customer  it works to introduce new products and solutions from all of its business segments  For example  ECL might first win business with a restaurant with its dishwashing technology  From there  the company can try to sell products needed to clean the restaurant  help with water filtration  eliminate pests  keep food safe  repair kitchen equipment  and much more  Hotels are similar   their food services are very similar to a restaurant  and they have substantial room cleaning and laundry operations that can all use ECL s products 
With such a large service network in place  ECL is able to develop or acquire new products that can be scaled across its global operations or cross sold into related markets very efficiently  As the largest player in the market  ECL also benefits because the largest customers in the market require a supplier that can meet their needs on a national or global level  They do not want to work with 100  suppliers and systems around the world  ECL is uniquely positioned to handle their scale and complexity thanks to its breadth of products and global service team  As those big customers grow their businesses and expand into new regions  ECL grows with them 
The very nature of ECL s products further adds to the strength of its business model  Over 90  of ECL s business is a recurring revenue stream  e g  customers consume ECL s sanitizers and need to reorder   While this provides reliable cash flow and stable operating margins  see below   it also results in customer relationships that often last for decades Source  Simply Safe Dividends
With cleaning and sanitizing products representing a small cost of the customer s overall operations  ECL should retain the business as long as they don t screw anything up  Furthermore  ECL s 25 000  customer facing employees build stronger relationships with customers and gather information critical to serving their needs better through their on site visits 
Overall  ECL s leadership in the huge global markets for food  water  energy and healthcare provide plenty of long term growth potential  The company seeks to grow earnings by 15  per year and improve its return on invested capital to 20  over time Key RisksECL s acquisitions of Nalco  2011    8 billion  and Champion Technologies  2013    2 billion  meaningfully altered the company s mix  More specifically  they increased the company s exposure to industrial production and energy markets 
Some investors worried that ECL added unnecessary volatility to its otherwise stable business model  Management had to cut guidance twice in 2015  extremely rare for ECL   perhaps adding some legitimacy to these concerns 
With energy markets reeling and global growth remaining sluggish  these fears could be put to the test in 2016  The stock continues trading at a relatively high earnings multiple  suggesting that investors expect ECL to power through just about any macro environment like it always has with little fundamental risk 
However  if depressed oil prices and sluggish industrial activity disrupt ECL s results  the stock could meaningfully correct  During the third quarter of 2015  ECL s Global Energy segment saw its sales fall by 12  in the third quarter of 2015  Time will tell how the next few quarters turn out with even lower oil prices  but if the company reports a material earnings miss  its valuation multiple could contract significantly  this would be a great buying opportunity   The company s stretched balance sheet doesn t help either 
Even if ECL s business is somewhat more volatile than it was in the past  the company is still extremely durable  It is well diversified by product  geography  customer  and technology  About 90  of its sales are also recurring revenue streams in the form of consumable products  e g  soaps  chemicals   ECL is here to stay for many years to come Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
ECL s dividend payment is extremely safe with a Safety Score of 98  Over the last four quarters  ECL s dividend has consumed 36  of its earnings and 32  of its free cash flow  As seen below  these levels are remarkably consistent with the company s historical payout ratios  This means that ECL s dividend growth has been fueled by earnings growth  For such a stable business  ECL s payout ratios are extremely safe and provide plenty of room for dividend growth Source  Simply Safe Dividends

ECL s performance during the last recession also adds to the dividend s safety profile  The company s sales fell by just 4  in fiscal year 2009  and its free cash flow generation was about flat  Customers still need to keep their food safe  facilities clean  and energy use efficient regardless of economic conditions  ECL s sales mix contains more industrial and energy exposure today as a result of its acquisitions of Nalco and Champion Technologies  but we believe its fundamentals are still likely to be much less cyclical than the broader economy in the event of another recession Source  Simply Safe Dividends
ECL s business is not capital intensive  generates strong margins  and is very consistent  90  of sales are recurring consumables   For these reasons  the company has generated dependable and growing free cash flow over the last decade  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The one grip we have about ECL s dividend safety is the company s balance sheet  ECL financed its Nalco and Champion Technologies acquisitions with a lot of debt  which it is in the process of paying down  As seen below  ECL has  6 8 billion of debt compared to  185 million of cash on hand  However  the company s consistent free cash flow generation is reliable and easily covers ECL s interest expenses and dividend payments Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  ECL s dividend is very safe  The company s payout ratios are relatively low  it generates strong and consistent free cash flow  and the business is fairly recession resistant Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
ECL s dividend Growth Score is 79  suggesting that the company s dividend growth potential is excellent  The company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 79 consecutive years  Most recently  ECL raised its dividend by 6  in December 2015 and has paid more dividends every calendar year since 1986  making it a member of the S P Dividend Aristocrats Index 
As seen below  ECL s dividend has compounded at a 14  annual rate over the company s last 10 fiscal years Source  Simply Safe Dividends
ECL s objective is to increase its dividend in line with earnings growth  which was lower in 2015 due to foreign exchange headwinds  weak energy markets  and sluggish global growth  However  the company continues to believe it can compound earnings at a 15  annual rate going forward 
ValuationECL trades at about 21x forward earnings and offers a dividend yield of 1 4   which is somewhat higher than its five year average dividend yield of 1 1   Throughout its history  ECL has always looked expensive  yet the stock has outperformed the market most years  consistent 15  earnings growth will do that  
Currency headwinds and weak energy markets are impacting ECL s near term earnings growth  but the company continues to believe it can achieve 15  annual earnings growth longer term  If true  the stock appears to be very reasonably priced today considering ECL s quality and offers double digit total return potential 
However  if energy and industrial markets weaken further  an even better buying opportunity could present itself ConclusionECL is a wonderful business with a bright future  The company s massive service network  breadth of services  strong technology portfolio  recurring revenue  and long lasting customer relationships will likely serve it well for many years to come  ECL is no doubt one of the best blue chip dividend stocks that long term dividend growth investors should keep in mind ",2016-01-16,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ecl:-one-of-bill-gates'-favorite-stocks-380267,380267
