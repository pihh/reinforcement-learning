marked the ninth anniversary of the U S  stock market s bull run after the grueling slump following the Great Recession  Since then  stocks have scaled new heights on the latest Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad In the meantime  rate hike and inflation fears failed to impede the rally  Investors also breathed a sigh of relief after the recent trade war fears on Trump s tariffs plan eased  This calls for investing in some rock solid stocks that have not only outperformed in the current bull market but also have scope to scale higher Bull Market Celebrates 9th BirthdayU S  stocks bottomed on Mar 9  2009  with the S P 500 losing more than 50  to hit a low of 676 53  The selloff had provoked President Barack Obama to say that  what you re now seeing is profit and earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you ve got a long term perspective on it  Since then  the benchmark index has more than tripled  marking the second longest and second highest bull market run in its history  This record is second to the bull run that stretched through the 1990s The Dow also went past the coveted 20 000 mark in late January and then blew past the 21 000 threshold just a month later  The bull market has helped the blue chip index scale a whopping 14 300 points Stocks Outshine Other InvestmentsDuring the nine years of the bull market  U S  stocks handily beat other investments including gold and real estate  U S  stocks also easily outdid their European counterparts  U S  large cap stocks have given a return of around 325  since Mar 9  2009  This means that the investor who had  100 000 in a fund tracking large cap stocks  will now have an account balance of about  425 000 Gold  in the meanwhile  has climbed only 43  from  925 per ounce in March 2009 to the current  1 325  per the World Gold Council  This means an investment of  100 000 in gold is now worth  143 000 The return on investments in U S  homes have only risen 19  from March 2009 to February 2018  according to Zillow s Home Value Index  Thus  the price of an American home has moved up from  175 000 to  208 000 in the last nine years Meanwhile  the Europe Stoxx 600  a broad index of large European stocks  jumped 135  during the same time frame  Such gains boosted a  100 000 investment to  235 000  less than half of U S  large cap stocks Catalysts Behind the Bull MarketThe bull run was no fluke  since the current stock prices are well supported by the Trump induced rally  Trump s polices including tax cuts  repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro growth agenda that helped the broader market push further into record territory The new tax laws give companies a massive tax break as they will be paying between 8  and 15 5  instead of the earlier 35  to bring back money from overseas  This means around  1 2 trillion in foreign profits that the S P 500 companies are sitting on will be returned  This in turn can be used to create jobs and reward shareholders   something the Trump administration has been aiming for since the election campaigns  read more    Trump s economy also started 2017 on a stellar note  The U S  economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 3  last year  marking the best growth in two years  Also  Americans are getting fatter paychecks  with wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade  read more    But  there is another major factor behind the strong American growth  It s the global economic growth  with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace  According to the International Monetary Fund  the global economy expanded at rate of 3 7  last year  the fastest since 2010 A healthier global economy  in turn  lifted corporate profits  In fact  for full year 2017  total S P 500 index earnings are expected to be up 7 1  on 5 9  higher revenues  way higher than the 0 7  earnings growth on 2 2  higher revenues recorded in 2016  read more    Bull Market to Stay  5 WinnersThe tax overhaul policy  solid global economic growth and encouraging earnings picture have certainly helped dismiss the fear that the Federal Reserve embarking on a quicker route to interest rate hikes might derail the record bull run  Odds of a trade war  in the meantime  ebbed after Trump exempted Canada and Mexico from steel and aluminum tariffs and allowed other countries to negotiate exclusions Ryan Detrick  senior market strategist at LPL Financial  further said that since 1950  if the S P 500 increases 5  or more in January  the full year returns are always positive  Needless to say  the benchmark index nudged up 5 6  in January

3199,224714,CENT,5 Top Stocks To Buy As Bull Market Turns Nine,opinion,Mar 9 marked the ninth anniversary of the U S  stock market s bull run after the grueling slump following the Great Recession  Since then  stocks have scaled new heights on the latest Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad In the meantime  rate hike and inflation fears failed to impede the rally  Investors also breathed a sigh of relief after the recent trade war fears on Trump s tariffs plan eased  This calls for investing in some rock solid stocks that have not only outperformed in the current bull market but also have scope to scale higher Bull Market Celebrates 9th BirthdayU S  stocks bottomed on Mar 9  2009  with the S P 500 losing more than 50  to hit a low of 676 53  The selloff had provoked President Barack Obama to say that  what you re now seeing is profit and earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you ve got a long term perspective on it  Since then  the benchmark index has more than tripled  marking the second longest and second highest bull market run in its history  This record is second to the bull run that stretched through the 1990s The Dow also went past the coveted 20 000 mark in late January and then blew past the 21 000 threshold just a month later  The bull market has helped the blue chip index scale a whopping 14 300 points Stocks Outshine Other InvestmentsDuring the nine years of the bull market  U S  stocks handily beat other investments including gold and real estate  U S  stocks also easily outdid their European counterparts  U S  large cap stocks have given a return of around 325  since Mar 9  2009  This means that the investor who had  100 000 in a fund tracking large cap stocks  will now have an account balance of about  425 000 Gold  in the meanwhile  has climbed only 43  from  925 per ounce in March 2009 to the current  1 325  per the World Gold Council  This means an investment of  100 000 in gold is now worth  143 000 The return on investments in U S  homes have only risen 19  from March 2009 to February 2018  according to Zillow s Home Value Index  Thus  the price of an American home has moved up from  175 000 to  208 000 in the last nine years Meanwhile  the Europe Stoxx 600  a broad index of large European stocks  jumped 135  during the same time frame  Such gains boosted a  100 000 investment to  235 000  less than half of U S  large cap stocks Catalysts Behind the Bull Market The bull run was no fluke  since the current stock prices are well supported by the Trump induced rally  Trump s polices including tax cuts  repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro growth agenda that helped the broader market push further into record territory The new tax laws give companies a massive tax break as they will be paying between 8  and 15 5  instead of the earlier 35  to bring back money from overseas  This means around  1 2 trillion in foreign profits that the S P 500 companies are sitting on will be returned  This in turn can be used to create jobs and reward shareholders   something the Trump administration has been aiming for since the election campaigns  read more    Trump s economy also started 2017 on a stellar note  The U S  economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 3  last year  marking the best growth in two years  Also  Americans are getting fatter paychecks  with wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade  read more    But  there is another major factor behind the strong American growth  It s the global economic growth  with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace  According to the International Monetary Fund  the global economy expanded at rate of 3 7  last year  the fastest since 2010 A healthier global economy  in turn  lifted corporate profits  In fact  for full year 2017  total S P 500 index earnings are expected to be up 7 1  on 5 9  higher revenues  way higher than the 0 7  earnings growth on 2 2  higher revenues recorded in 2016  read more    Bull Market to Stay  5 Winners The tax overhaul policy  solid global economic growth and encouraging earnings picture have certainly helped dismiss the fear that the Federal Reserve embarking on a quicker route to interest rate hikes might derail the record bull run  Odds of a trade war  in the meantime  ebbed after Trump exempted Canada and Mexico from steel and aluminum tariffs and allowed other countries to negotiate exclusions Ryan Detrick  senior market strategist at LPL Financial  further said that since 1950  if the S P 500 increases 5  or more in January  the full year returns are always positive  Needless to say  the benchmark index nudged up 5 6  in January Banking on such positives  we have selected five solid stocks that have outperformed in the current bull market and have

3222,224737,CENT,Whirlpool To Gain From Growth Initiatives  Risks Persist,opinion,Whirlpool Corporation   NYSE WHR   has been gaining momentum lately on the back of its stringent focus on long term goals for 2020  innovation strategy as well as global cost based pricing and fixed cost reduction strategies  However  higher raw material inflation and lower volumes remain impediments Notably  shares of Whirlpool have gained 3  in the past six months against the  s decline of 11 7   Let s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock Long Term Goals  A Key Growth DriverWhirlpool is gaining significantly from its commitment toward long term goals supported by its robust product pipeline  solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives  Also  the company has outlined significant long term targets through 2020 driven by brand strength and product portfolio Through 2020  Whirlpool aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3 5  annualy  Moreover  the company targets EBIT margin to exceed 10  by 2020 and envisions earnings per share to grow by 10 15  each year  By 2018  it anticipates free cash flow generation of 5 6  of revenues Cost Productivity Programs Aid MarginsWhirlpool is striving to improve margin through several measures including cost based price increments and cost reduction initiatives  which should also boost business efficiency  The company recently introduced global cost based pricing for its trade customers in order to mitigate raw material inflation  Furthermore  it is on track with initiatives to cut down fixed overhead expenses by  150 million  which will add to the company s ongoing cost productivity program Also  Whirlpool s focus on boosting consumer demand has increased global price mix by 50 basis points  bps  in fourth quarter 2017  This marked the company s first quarter of positive global price mix since fourth quarter 2015 In 2018  Whirlpool s positive global price mix along with significant progress on cost saving initiatives is likely to result in margin expansion  Additionally  the company s renewed focus on inventory management is expected to boost earnings and free cash flow going forward Innovation Driving GrowthWhirlpool is among one of those companies that have successfully implemented its innovation strategies into the business model  It invests heavily in technologies to produce differentiated products to suit the needs of their end consumers  Also  the company is keen on boosting revenues at its core appliance business through expansions and investments  This  in turn  is expected to fuel growth of its high margin categories Bottom LineWhile all seems well with Whirlpool  it has been suffering from soft top line performance and higher raw material inflation  Notably  the company s top line has lagged estimates for three straight quarters now  Moreover  Whirlpool s operating performance continues to be impacted by raw material cost inflation and unit volume declines  This caused adjusted operating margin to contract 70 bps in the preceding quarter Though the company expects improved global price mix and cost savings to benefit margins in 2018  this is likely to be more than offset by continued raw material inflation  In 2018  Whirlpool aniticipates the combined 125 bps margin improvement from favorable price mix  fixed cost reduction and improved cost productivity  to be more than offset by nearly  200  250 million increase in raw material inflation from the prior year Nonetheless  Whirlpool s ongoing strategic initiatives and cost savings

lucrative returns  investors should bear significant risk  This is the general convention in the equity market  The strategy works well when the market is bullish  but the converse scenario should also be taken into account Following intense research  we have developed a strategy  signifying handsome return can also be earned from low risky stocks Meaning of BetaBeta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of a security s price movement relative to the market  In this article  we are considering the S P 500 as the market If a stock has beta of 1 then the price of the stock will move with the market  So  the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1  In the same way  the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1 For example  if the market offers a return of 20   a stock with beta of 3 will return 60   which is overwhelming  Similarly  when the market slips 20  the stock will sink 60   which is devastating Screening Criteria We have taken beta between 0 and 0 6 as our prime criterion for screening stocks that are less volatile than the market  But this should not be the only factor to be considered while selecting a winning strategy  We need to take into account other parameters that can add value to the portfolio Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that

3229,224744,CENT,Buy 5 Low Beta Stocks   Get Rid Of Market Volatility,opinion,The investment world believes in the idea that for getting lucrative returns  investments in risky securities are essential  The idea works well when the market is bullish but the converse scenario should also be taken into account Following intense research  we have developed a strategy that low risk stocks could also lead to handsome returns if some other specific criteria are considered Meaning of Beta Beta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market   Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market The Winning StrategyIn order to find stocks with lower than market volatility  we added beta between 0 and 0 6 as our main criterion for screening  However  we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market  Hence to reach the winning strategy  we have considered a few additional criteria Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks  We considered

3243,224758,CENT,Zacks com Featured Highlights  Stoneridge  Honda Motor Company  Turtle Beach  The Children s Place And Central Garden   Pet Company,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  August 29  2017   Stocks in this week s article includeStoneridge Inc   NYSE   NYSE SRI       Honda Motor Company Ltd   NYSE   NYSE HMC       Turtle Beach Corporation  NASDAQ   NASDAQ HEAR       The Children s Place Inc   NASDAQ   NASDAQ PLCE      andCentral Garden   Pet Company  NASDAQ   NASDAQ CENT      Ride Rising P E Investing with These 5 Top Ranked StocksGenerally  investors love stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio  The perception is that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  The simple logic that a stock s current market price does not justify  is not equivalent to  its higher earnings and therefore has room to run is behind investors  inclination toward low P E stocks But stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why Why Rising P E a Valuable Tool Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growthPercentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeksPercentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said time frames  Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100  A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers Zacks Rank Less than equals to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  can get through Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 28 Here are five out of the 28 Stoneridge Inc   NYSE        This is a manufacturer of highly engineered electrical and electronic components

higher expenditure prevails  The Conference Board s index increased to its second highest level in 17 years  Consumers  assessment of current conditions also surged to a record level Economists have attributed consumers  new found confidence to strong labor and equity markets  Steady increase in housing prices is also indicative of an increase in purchasing power  Economists believe that the report suggests that consumption expenditure will continue to increase in the third quarter  which makes this a good time to pick consumer discretionary stocks     Index at Second Highest Level Since 2000Consumer confidence increased from the downwardly revised level of 120 in July to 122 9 in August  According to the initial estimate  consumer confidence had increased from 117 3 to 121 1 in July  This marks the second consecutive monthly increase for the index  It is also the second highest level observed since the second half of 2000  Only in March did consumer confidence register a higher reading  of 125 6  than July  Additionally  the Present Situation Index increased from 145 4 to 151 2  the highest level experienced since July 2001  However  the future expectations index increased only slightly  from 103 to 104  But more significant was respondents  assessment of the labor market situation  The percentage of those who believe that jobs are  plentiful  increased from 33 2  to 35 4   Also  the percentage of those who think positions are hard to secure contracted from 18 7  to 17 3   the lowest point witnessed since August 2001  Economy s Strength Boosting ConfidenceMost

increased to 5 7   lifted by strong housing demand  Experts also believe that after the end of the  Trump Bump   consumers were being buoyed by the economy s inherent strength Fundamentals have become particularly relevant since policy expectations have largely petered out  Barclays  LON BARC  PLC s   NYSE BCS   chief U S  economist has also noted that the report reflects continuing strength in consumer confidence and indicates that expenditure could rise in the third quarter  It is quite likely that higher consumer spending would continue to be the economy s primary engine of growth in the forthcoming quarters Our ChoicesA considerable jump in consumer confidence is only indicative of the extent to which the U S  consumer s purchasing power has increased  Given the outlook of consumer depicted in this report  it is likely such trends will continue for the rest of the third quarter Adding consumer discretionary stocks to your portfolios makes great sense at this point  However

fiscal 2017  Semiconductors sales and operating revenues jumped 41 4  year over year to  204 3 billion   1 8 billion   The improvement came on the back of strong sales of image sensors for mobile

100 000 wafers by the end of March of 2018 Fiscal 2017 Outlook RaisedConcurrent with the fiscal first quarter results  Sony revised the revenue guidance for fiscal 2017  Currently  the company expects total sales to be around  8 300 billion  up 3 8  from the earlier figure of  8 000 billion  The upward revision is largely attributable to lesser than expected impact of foreign exchange rates The company reiterated its operating income guidance and continues to expect it to be around  500 billion  a jump of 73 2  from fiscal 2016  Improvements in operating income are expected to be driven by recovery of Semiconductors and Pictures segments Diligent Restructuring Efforts Raise HopeSony has also undertaken a number of measures in its Branded Product Business  which include Mobile Communications  Imaging Product   Solutions and Home Entertainment   Sound segments  to ensure stronger growth  A number of measures  including cost reduction initiatives  lower exposure in low profit

3256,224771,CENT,Peltz On Procter   Gamble  Sign of The Future For ROIC Laggards,opinion,"One of the largest activist investors in the world is taking on his biggest target yet  Nelson Peltz s Trian Fund Management is seeking a board seat at Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   Now  the Consumer Staples giant is the largest company ever to face a proxy fight  signaling that size alone is no longer enough to keep activists away from poorly run companies 
Activist investors have a mixed track record when it comes to creating shareholder value  but Peltz appears to have found an ideal situation  P G has lagged its competitors in recent years  Peltz has experience revitalizing consumer brands  and the stock trades at a discount to its peers 
Peltz has not yet released a detailed plan for P G  but any reform of the company s corporate structure should include a renewed focus on return on invested capital  ROIC   ROIC ranks as the most important metric for global investors and has demonstrable links to valuation  Linking executive compensation to ROIC could create immediate shareholder returns and drive a long term commitment to the lean and disciplined corporate structure that Peltz wants P G to adopt  This strategy should become part of the playbook for companies looking to avoid activist takeovers 
Procter   Gamble s Underperformance
The best way to understand the recent failures of P G s management team is to compare the company to one of its largest competitors  the excellently run Colgate Palmolive  CL   Figure 1 shows the ROIC earned by the two companies since 1998 
Figure 1  Colgate Palmolive s ROIC Strongly Outperforms P G

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Through the late 1990 s and early 2000 s  the two companies earned similar ROIC s  but that all changed with PG s  54 billion acquisition of Gillette in 2005  The acquisition was a big blow to P G s ROIC from which the company has never recovered 
Since the acquisition  PG stock is up just 48  vs  178  for CL and 142  for the Consumer Staples SPDR ETF  XLP   It s surprising that the Gillette deal doesn t find its way on to more lists of the worst corporate acquisitions 
Need To Focus On ROIC
The Gillette acquisition represents a classic case of executive incentives misaligned with shareholder interests  Buying Gillette helped P G grow revenue and earnings per share significantly  which led to significant increases in bonuses for top executives  even as ROIC and shareholder return lagged peers 
These misaligned incentives also helped to create the  overly complex and bureaucratized corporate structure  that Peltz criticized  Excessive focus on sales growth and earnings per share pushes managers to invest in low return opportunities  As a result  you end up with a bloated organization that can t maintain leadership in its value creating products because it s bogged down by bureaucracy and distracted by failed projects 
As Trian s proxy statement points out  P G s volume growth has trailed its peers in four out of the past five years  which would indicate the company s key brands are losing market share  The company states as much in its most recent 10 K by admitting it has lost market share in its Beauty  Grooming  Personal Health  Fabric   Home Care  Baby  Feminine    Family Care segments over the past two years 
This declining market share points to a real systematic issue facing P G  Its ROIC underperformance may have started with the Gillette acquisition  but that doesn t tell the whole story  Even if we totally wiped that  54 billion in invested capital off the books  PG would still have an ROIC of  18   behind CL s 19   Notably  CL began tying executive compensation to ROIC in 2014 
P G should follow in CL s footsteps  Tying executive compensation to ROIC would not only prevent a repeat of the Gillette acquisition  it would also lay the groundwork for a more disciplined and efficient corporate structure 
This change in executive compensation wouldn t just be good for shareholders  it would be in the best interests of management  General Motors  NYSE GM  successfully held off an activist campaign in 2015 partly through a renewed emphasis on ROIC  If P G is determined to keep Peltz off the board  a similar shift could help to placate shareholders 
Peltz s Track Record
Peltz and Trian have a solid history of helping struggling consumer brands turn their fortunes around  In the late 90 s  Trian took over Snapple  a company that had lost 80  of its value in three years  and in another three years managed to restore a good portion of that lost value 
Trian helped push Heinz to a similarly lucrative buyout and more recently it waged a large campaign against PepsiCo  NYSE PEP   Although Peltz failed to convince the company to split up  his initiatives did spur an increase in ROIC from 9  to 11  even as rival Coca Cola  KO  saw its ROIC decline 
Most importantly from our perspective  PEP began tying executive compensation to ROIC shortly after Peltz took his position in the stock  We don t know if Peltz was responsible for this decision  but the fact that Trian s white paper on the company highlighted its poor ROIC suggests he might have had a hand in it 
Either way  Peltz s track record shows that he has the expertise in brand management  cost discipline  and capital allocation required to help PG end its recent run of underperformance 
Value Opportunity
Unsurprisingly  given P G s underperformance  the stock trades at a discount to its peers  Figure 2 shows ROIC and enterprise value invested capital  a cleaner version of price to book  for PG and twelve of its peers  1 
Figure 2  ROIC Vs  Enterprise Value For Household Products Companies

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
According to the equation in Figure 2  ROIC explains over 95  of the differences in valuation for these household products stocks and PG trades at a roughly 15  discount to its implied EV IC 
Even if Peltz can t bring any operational improvements  just convincing the market to value P G at a level commensurate with its ROIC would create upside  If  on the other hand  Peltz can deliver tangible gains in sales and profitability  P G could offer significant returns to investors 
For example  Figure 3 shows the    Upside  to P G stock for a few relatively conservative scenarios  Column 2 shows 42  upside if P G can grow revenue 4  for the next 5 years  Column 3 shows 60  upside if P G s cost cutting initiatives also succeed in increasing the company s pretax margin from 22 5  to 25  
Figure 3  Implied Valuation Scenarios

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
To drive this valuation gain  Trian and P G will need to convince the market of the sustainability of its ROIC  The way to convince the market of one s commitment to ROIC is the same as we ve suggested many times

Spectrum Brands  Impressive Profit Growth
Since 2011  Spectrum Brands has grown after tax profit    by 25  compounded annually to  568 million in 2016  The company has grown revenue by 10  compounded annually to  5 billion over the same time  Per Figure 1  the company s NOPAT margin has improved from 6  in 2011 to over 11  in 2016

In addition to NOPAT growth  Spectrum generated  711 million  10  of market cap  in free cash flow    in 2016 and  672 million over the last twelve months  which equates to a 6    Spectrum Brands has also exhibited good stewardship of capital amidst multiple acquisitions aimed at diversifying the business 
Studies have shown that most   Spectrum Brands  management team has proven to be the outlier  Since 2011  SPB has improved its ROIC from 6  to 8   per Figure 2

Per Figure 3  ROIC explains 77  of the changes in valuation for the 17 Household Goods peers under coverage  Despite SPB s 8  ROIC  in line with the 8  average of the peer group  the firm s stock trades at a discount to peers as shown by its position below the trend line in Figure 3 
If the stock were to trade at parity with its peers  it would be at  149 share   16  above the current stock price  Given the firm s rising ROIC and impressive profit growth  one would think the stock would garner a premium valuation

SPB s Profitability Helps Maintain Market Leading Positions
As a manufacturer of many household products with significant brand recognition  such as Rayovac  Remington  Black   Decker  George Foreman  Kwikset  Stanley  Eukanuba  Armor All  and Spectracide  among others  Spectrum Brands faces competition from many different firms 
Competition includes Allegion PLC  NYSE ALLE   Energizer Holdings  NYSE ENR   Scotts Miracle Gro  NYSE SMG   Newell Brands NYSE NWL   Whirlpool Corporation  NYSE WHR   and Central Garden   Pet Company  NASDAQ CENT   Per Figure 4  SPB s NOPAT margin ranks near the top of its competition 
High margins have allowed SPB to invest in product development initiatives  expand its global footprint  and build a strong brand presence across its many different markets  SPB s profitability also allows it to weather economic downtimes and invest to prosper during economic growth 
Most importantly  SPB is able to withstand pricing pressures from competition  or even provide products at a lower price to take market share while maintaining above average profitability

Bear Concerns Assume Precipitous Decline In The Global Economy
Spectrum Brands  segments are tied to many different aspects of the economy  including overall consumer spending  the global battery market  the housing market  and the automotive market  In order to buy in to the bear case  one must not only ignore the positive domestic economic trends  but also Spectrum Brands  diversification into higher margin business segments  Add in effective cost controls and the bear case seems even less likely 
A strong U S  economy  where SPB generated 68  of 2016 revenues  bodes well for Spectrum Brands  profit growth potential  Most importantly    as measured by the U S  Department of Commerce  have grown 4  compounded annually since 2014 
The  has improved from 2 4  in March 2014 to 3 4  in March 2017  Lastly    which measures the level of optimism regarding the economy  reached a 16 year high in March 2017 
In order to take advantage of the improving economy  Spectrum Brands has diversified its business away from its Global Batteries and Appliances segment  40  of 2016 revenue  into higher margin segments  The company expanded into the Global Auto Care segment in 2015  with the acquisition of Armored AutoGroup  maker of Armor All products  In 2014  Spectrum Brands acquired Tell Manufacturing  a lock manufacturer that expanded its Hardware   Home Improvement segment 
Lastly  in 2014 the company expanded its Home   Garden lineup with the acquisition Liquid Fence  Per Figure 5  these three segments have greater margins than the Global Battery   Appliance segment and also grew revenues at a significantly higher rate

It s important to note that sales growth  whether organic or via acquisition  is meaningless without prudent cost management  Through operating efficiencies  maximizing manufacturing capabilities  or running plants at full capacity  Spectrum has been able to improve its operating profitability  Per Figure 6  SPB s cost of goods sold  selling  and general   administrative expenses have fallen as a percent of revenue since 2010  Furthermore  COGS  selling  general   administrative  and research   development costs have each grown less than revenue  which grew 12  compounded annually from 2010 2016 
Figure 6  Spectrum Brands  Falling Operating Expenses

Bears will also raise concerns about Spectrum Brands  revenue concentration  In 2016  Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  represented 15  of sales and was the firm s largest customer  Such concentration would be more concerning if it were based on one individual product  However  Spectrum Brands  Wal Mart concentration is spread across numerous products  Despite the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  threat  Wal Mart has still grown sales 2  compounded annually over the past five years and represents a strong retail channel for Spectrum Brands 
More importantly  Spectrum Brands  products are also sold at Amazon  Lowe s  Home Depot  NYSE HD   Target  and others  Sales concentration is less of an issue when the same product can still be purchased at another retailer 
Lastly  SPB s low valuation also undermines many bear arguments  Despite improving profitability  strong economic trends  and effective cost management  SPB s current valuation implies a permanent decline in profits  as we ll show below 
Spectrum Brands  Cheap Valuation Implies Immediate Drop in Profits
Over the past two years  SPB is up 36  while the S P is up 14   However  over the past month  SPB has fallen 9   after quarterly earnings missed expectations  while the S P is up 2   This price decline reflects investor overreaction to short term events instead of a change in the fundamentals of the business and presents a buying opportunity 
At its current price of  128 share  SPB has a price to economic book value    ratio of 0 9  This ratio means the market expects Spectrum Brands  NOPAT to permanently decline by 10   This expectation seems overly pessimistic for a firm that has grown NOPAT by 25  compounded annually since 2011 
Even if SPB were to never again grow profits from current levels  the   or no growth value of the firm is  138 share   an 8  upside from the current valuation 
However  if SPB can maintain 2016 NOPAT margins  11   and   the stock is worth  182 share today   a 42  upside  This scenario assumes SPB can grow revenue by consensus estimates in 2017  1   and 2018  4    and 4  each year thereafter  which is consistent with consumer spending growth in recent years  With an improving global economy  new product launches  and expanded manufacturing capacity  SPB could easily meet or surpass these expectations  Add in the potential yield detailed below and its clear why SPB could be a great portfolio addition 
Buy Backs Plus Dividend Could Yield Over 2 
In fiscal 2016  which ended September 2016 for Spectrum Brands  the company repurchased  43 million worth of stock  Through the first two quarters of 2017  SPB has repurchased  99 million  In January 2017  the company authorized  500 million in repurchases over the next three years  Going forward  if SPB were to average its 2016 and 2017 repurchase activity   71 million per year   the firm would not exhaust its current authorization before expiration  A repurchase of this size is 1  of the current market cap  When combined  Spectrum s 1  repurchase yield and 1 3  dividend yield offer investors a total potential yield of 2 3  
New Product Introductions Could Create Earnings Beat
In order to grow revenues faster than the economy  consumer goods manufacturers can either spend on marketing  acquire growth  or introduce new products  Spectrum Brands has excelled in all three of these endeavors  At the same time  the firm must continue to control costs in order to maximize the value of revenue growth to shareholders 
In 2Q17  Spectrum Brands announced it was expanding capacity at its alkaline battery factory in Europe as demand exceeds capacity  The firm will be releasing new products in its high margin Global Auto Care segment  including new Armor All cleaning wipes  complete with TV marketing campaign  and new fuel system cleaners  To propel revenue growth in the Hardware   Home Improvement segment  SPB recently introduced new Kwikset smart locks  In Home   Garden  SPB is introducing new aerosol and liquid pest management products and a new weed stop formula  In its Pet segment  SPB announced the acquisition of Petmatrix  a maker of rawhide free dog chews  Lastly  in the Global Batteries   Appliance segment  SPB plans on releasing new Remington shavers and trimmers in the U S  and a new Flex360 shaver along with hair care products in Europe 
Each of these new products expand SPB s footprint in retail channels while also creating revenue growth opportunities  With improving margins and revenue  beating both top and bottom line expectations could prove an effective catalyst to send shares higher  When SPB reported 1Q17 results above consensus  the stock rose 8  the following day  In 3Q16  when SPB again beat bottom line expectations  the stock rose 12  in the following two weeks 
SPB could be poised for another beat and subsequent increase in valuation  In the meantime  investors in this stock carry very low valuation risk and are rewarded with a potential 2  total yield given SPB s history of dividends and share repurchases 
Executive Compensation Plan Could Be Improved But Raises No Alarms
Spectrum Brands  executive compensation plan  which includes base salary  annual incentives  and long term incentives  is largely tied to two metrics  Both annual bonuses and equity incentives are tied to the achievement of EBITDA and free cash flow goals  A two year equity incentive program is tied to the achievement of EPS and return on asset goals  We would prefer to see executive compensation tied to ROIC  since there is a   However  SPB s current exec comp plan has not led to executives getting paid while destroying shareholder value  In fact  since 2010  Spectrum Brands    the true cash flows of the business  have grown from  135 million to  260 million TTM  a clear creation of shareholder value 
Insider Trends Are Minimal While Short Interest Highlights Market Pessimism
Over the past 12 months  there have been 49 thousand insider shares purchased and 91 thousand insider shares sold for a net effect of 41 thousand insider shares sold  These sales represent less than 1  of shares outstanding  Additionally  short interest sits at 5 9 million shares  or 10  of shares outstanding  It would appear the market is ignoring Spectrum s track record of profitability

3275,224790,CENT,Is Consumer Spending Really A Worry  5 Smart Picks,opinion,"At first glance  March s consumer spending report only adds to the recent clutch of disappointing economic data coming out of the U S  economy  Consumer spending remained virtually unchanged over the month of March  improving by less than 0 1   indicating that the economy s engine of growth might be cooling down  However  a closer inspection reveals a different story  one which even leads to optimism about the economy s prospects in the months to come 
This is because real consumption has actually increased  which  along with steady wage gains  bodes well for the economy in the months ahead  Investing in consumer discretionary stocks looks like a smart option at this point 
Real Personal Consumption Rises
In March  real personal consumption expenditure increased by 0 3   Last month s gain comes on the back of two months of declines  of 0 1  and 0 3   in February and March  respectively  Among other positive developments  personal income and disposal personal income both increased by 0 2   Both these metrics have increased for at least five successive quarters 
These figures  particularly the continuous increase in income levels  suggest that the U S  economy is ready to emerge from the slowdown which it suffered in the first quarter  Additionally  GDP declined by 0 7  in the first quarter  due to a considerable decline in consumer expenditure  But last Friday s report also indicated that the economy had gained momentum at the end of the quarter 
Sluggish Inflation Likely to Keep Rates Steady
Another worrying trend in March s consumer spending report was a decline in the PCE price index  which moved 0 2  lower  The Fed s preferred gauge of inflation also increased by only 1 8  last month  well February s level of 2  when it briefly hit the central bank s target  Core PCE also declined by 0 1  and the Fed is likely to stay away from raising rates at the two day meeting starting on Tuesday 
According to several economists  the fall in inflation was primarily attributable to unusually higher temperatures across various parts of the U S  Expenditure on utilities and gasoline declined as a result  leading to price cuts from auto dealers who tried to boost sales after a hectic holiday period 
Another possible cause is the unexpected delay in tax refunds  which cramped disposable incomes  However  strong consumer confidence  rising income levels and an increase in the net worth of households indicate that strong economic fundamentals are still in place  This is likely to lead to higher levels of spending and subsequently a rise in inflation in the months ahead 
Our Choices
The increase in real consumption levels indicates that consumers  purchasing power continues to be strong  An increase in the savings rate in March  from 5 7  to 5 9   indicates that consumers only held off spending last month 
Following the receipt of tax refunds  disposable incomes are likely to increase in the second quarter  This is likely to increase discretionary spending  which makes it imperative for you to own stocks likely to gain from this trend  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult

3276,224791,CENT,Buy These 4 Momentum Stocks For Huge Returns,opinion,When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  Translated  one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift  Thus  this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast moving train  without fretting about valuations or growth prospects  But why does the momentum strategy work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold onto losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in the prices  On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things gain clarity  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends  and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over a long period of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you benefit from both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would reflect

3294,224809,CENT,Sony  SNE  Posts Earnings In Q4  Issues Guidance For FY17,opinion,Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE   reported fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per share of  21 45  19 cents   against the year ago quarter s significant loss of  70 03 per share  The bottom line benefited from decent top line growth  as well as fall in selling  general   administrative and financial services expenses For fiscal 2016  the company s earnings per share came in at  56 89  51 cents   down 51 6  compared with the year ago figure  The earnings plunge came on the back of a  112B   962 million  write down in the company s movie business  charges for which were booked in the fiscal third quarter  The write down followed a strategic review that signaled bleak future profit expectations for the segment Inside the HeadlinesIn the quarter  Sony s sales and operating revenues were up 4 4  year over year to  1 903 6 billion   17 0 billion   Solid top line growth in six of the company s nine segments drove the quarterly sales growth However  for fiscal 2016  Sony s net sales dropped 6 2  to  7 603 3 billion   67 886 million   Currency fluctuations and steep sales drop of the Mobile Communications   MC   segments proved to be a drag on the top line performance Additionally  operating income came in at  94 4 million   843 million   in stark contrast to an operating loss of  92 9 million in the year ago quarter  Excellent rebound in the Semiconductor segment almost single handedly drove the operating income growth Sales and operating revenues at the Game   Network Services   GN S   segment climbed 21 0  year over year to  381 8 billion   3 409 million   Improvements in the PS4 software sales  including sales through the network  and impressive market traction of the newly launched PlayStationVR proved conducive to sales growth Semiconductors sales and operating revenues jumped 36 0  year over year to  201 1 billion   1 795 million   The rebound of the Semiconductors sales came on the back of solid demand for image sensors in mobile products MC s sales and operating revenues declined 14 9  year on year to  155 9 billion   1 392 million  due to decrease in smartphone unit sales Pictures Segment s sales and operating revenues were down 5 7  year over year to  302 5 billion   2 701 million   This is attributable to significantly lower SVOD revenues for Television Productions Components sales and operating revenues were up 8 4  year on year to  53 2 billion   475 million   Increase in sales in the battery business  mainly attributable to increase in demand for products used in mobile devices  drove the sales of this segment Moreover  sales and operating revenues of the Imaging Products   Solutions   IP S   segment inched up 0 9  year over year to  154 9 billion   1 383 million   While improvement in product mix  reflecting a shift to high value added models in still and video cameras  drove sales growth  this was largely offset by foreign currency headwinds The Music segment experienced a 5 4  increase in sales to  178 5 billion   177 million  on a year over year basis  This segment benefited from higher visual media and platform sales Financial Services revenues were up 5 5   year over year  to  275 1 billion   2 457 million   Healthy investment performance of the  separate account  at Sony Life proved conducive to the sales growth of this segment The Home Entertainment   Sound   HE S   segment sales and operating revenues came in at  214 7 billion   1 918 million   flat on a year over year basis  While improvement in the product mix boosted sales  this was completely offset by a decrease in television unit sales Sales of  All Other  Segments fell 11 1  to  656 billion   586 million  Sony Corp  T 6758  Ord Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Liquidity   Cash FlowAs of Mar 31  2017  Sony s cash and cash equivalents were  960 1 billion   8 573 million  compared with   983 6 billion recorded at the end of Mar 31  2016 Long term debt totaled  681 4 billion   6 084 million  compared with  556 6 million as of Mar 31  2016 GuidanceConcurrent with the fiscal fourth quarter results  Sony released the guidance for fiscal 2017  Currently  the company expects total sales to be around  8 000  up 5 2  from fiscal 2016  It believes that impressive sales at G NS  Pictures and Semiconductors segments will fuel most of the top line growth  Also  the company expects operating income to be around  500 billion  a jump of 73 2  from fiscal 2016  Improvements in operating income are expected to be driven by robust operating results in the Semiconductors and Pictures segments  These forecasts assume an exchange rate of  1   105 As per segments  increase in smartphone unit sales is expected to augment sales of MC  The GN S segment is anticipated to benefit from higher network sales  Improvement in the product mix  on account of a shift to high value added models  is expected to benefit the IP S and HE S segments  Also  increase in image sensor sales for mobile products and weakening impacts of the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquakes are expected to benefit the Semiconductor business significantly Increase in media networks and television productions sales  as well as insurance premium revenues are expected to stoke growth of the Pictures and Financial Services segment respectively  However  sales of the Music segment are likely to remain flat year on year  primarily due to a decline in the physical and digital download sales in Recorded Music Our TakeSony ended fiscal 2016 on a decent note  with both top  and bottom line growth year over year  Going forward  the company s diligent restructuring efforts  which include separation of its businesses into distinct subsidiaries and a realignment of corporate functions  are expected to boost profitability  A number of measures  including cost reduction initiatives  lower exposure in low profit geographic regions and reduction in advertising and promotion expenses  are expected to benefit this business in the long run This apart  we believe that the solid rebound of the Semiconductor and Components segments will boost the company s top line for the upcoming quarters  Most importantly  it seems that Sony has finally braved the challenges imposed by the Kumamoto Earthquakes  which significantly marred the fiscal 2016 results  However  some of these improvements are likely to be offset by steep currency fluctuations and weakness in the MC segment  thus restricting growth Zacks Ranks and Key PicksSony currently carries a Zacks Rank  3

3303,224818,CENT,Top 5 Low Beta Stocks To Sail Through A Volatile Market,opinion,Following an unprecedented stretch of calm during the summer  equities see sawed over the past three trading days  Investors remain on the edge as Fed officials differ on rate hike expectations  while oil joins the rout on weak demand growth To top it  developments like discouraging corporate earnings  stretched valuations and presidential elections are expected to keep markets choppy  Hence  in order to sidestep such bumpy proceedings  invest in stocks that are less volatile than the broader markets Volatility is BackFor 43 successive trading sessions this summer  stocks barely budged  Such a streak  however  came to an end on Sep 9 when the stock market dropped significantly  only to bounce back on Sep 12   The CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  shot up to an average of 16 4 over those two days  which was otherwise hovering at around 12 for a sustained period  The Fed s ambiguous stance regarding monetary tightening measures resulted in such gyrations In fact  Wall Street s  fear gauge  index moved north yesterday as U S  equities logged a second sharp sell off in the past three trading sessions  This time  the reason was the slide in crude prices on concerns of waning oil demand  The VIX rose 18  to close at 17 85  implying that investors foresee a further downward swings in the stock market Let us look at the major factors that fueled the market mayhem Rate Hike DilemmaRate hike indecision is creating widespread volatility in the broader markets  While hawkish comments from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren slammed equity markets last Friday  a dovish stance by Fed Governor Lael Brainard helped major indices close over 1  higher on Monday Rosengren cautioned that waiting too long for a rate hike might adversely affect some asset markets like commercial real estate  But  Brainard said that it would be wise for the Fed to keep the monetary policy loose  Muted inflation and uncertain global developments has raised caution against hiking rates too fast  Two other officials including Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari also said that the Fed shouldn t be in a hurry to raise rates Oil Prices NosediveSpell of volatility extended yesterday  thanks to slump in oil prices  Slowdown in global oil demand growth weighed on oil prices  According to the International Energy Agency  IEA   demand for global oil sank to 800 000 barrels per day  bpd  in the third quarter of this year  a 1 5 million bpd lower compared to same period last year  IEA also trimmed its 2016 demand growth forecast by 100 000 bpd to 1 3 million bpd The IEA said that demand growth has very nearly vanished in developed countries  while it slowed down drastically in Asian powerhouses such as China and India  The IEA added that weak economic growth and heavy flooding in China dented use of oil in the industries  IEA also cited that demand for oil in Europe has gone down  On Tuesday  WTI and Brent crude fell 3 1  and 2 6  to  44 90 per barrel and  47 10 a barrel  respectively More Turbulence AheadVolatility might go up further as profit expectations for this year will be trimmed in the wake of a discouraging third quarter earnings season  As of Sep 9  third quarter earnings are expected to decline 3  compared to the same period last year  read more    Moreover  stocks are pretty pricey this time around which makes us believe that the market may be facing a correction sooner than later  The broader market is

Volatility with These 5 Low Beta StocksAlong with such uncertain circumstances  we shouldn t forget that the stock market has entered the worst month this year  as far as historical data is considered

3317,224832,CENT,Looking For Growth  These 4 Consumer Stocks Are Great,opinion,While the global economic scenario refuses to return to normalcy  investors are still struggling to select the right

currencies  are far from easing  These have a significant impact on the financial markets across the globe  with the U S  being no exception With all the panic elsewhere  a recovering U S  economy offers some relief  Here  stability in the job market  housing recovery  rising wages  improved consumer spending and steady consumer confidence led to renewed optimism  Evidently  the real gross domestic product  GDP  advance estimate for the second quarter of 2016 improved at an annual rate of 1 2  against a 0 8  rise witnessed in the preceding quarter  per the Bureau of Economic Analysis The stability in the U S  labor market was palpable as the jobs data for July came in better than expected  with the unemployment rate remaining unchanged at 4 9   This along with the 0 4  rise in consumer spending ushered confidence in economic growth  indicating that consumers are now willing to spend That said  we turn to the consumer discretionary sector  which manufactures products that buyers choose because they want to and not because they need to  Companies operating in this space include fast food restaurants  providers of entertainment products and services  and makers of automobiles  textiles  apparels and luxury goods among others  These products and services will only be sought by consumers if they have sufficient disposable income Given the improvement in job market and consumers  appetite to spend  the trend noted is that people are now willing to spend on discretionary items  albeit conservatively  Hence  there is room for upside in consumer discretionary stocks  which are poised to make the best of an improving economy At this juncture  we believe that a focus on U S  based consumer discretionary stocks with growth potential will reap the best returns for investors Why Growth Stocks In the current market scenario  growth stocks can be considered as potential bets as these are believed to offer better returns than the major benchmarks  These stocks are expected to have the potential to record strong earnings growth going forward  Growth stocks  which are also called  glamor stocks   are generally well established and of a high quality Though these stocks are often regarded as more volatile than the other categories  they are also expected to fetch higher returns  Hence  investors with high tolerance to risk and preferring capital appreciation over dividend payouts may consider growth stocks to gain from the current scenario 4 Growth Stocks to Buy   Here  using our new   we have zeroed in on four home run

3341,224856,CENT,GoPro Bets Big On Debuting 360 degree Omni Camera For VR,opinion,California based technology company GoPro  Inc    NASDAQ GPRO   recently announced that its 6 camera virtual reality device  Omni  is available for sale Launched earlier in April  Omni has been the company s only major launch this year after the much anticipated 16 camera Odyssey rig s launch was stalled  Touted as an  end to end content creation ecosystem   Omni allows content creators to capture 360 degree  spherical  VR content and publish it in superb quality Inside Omni   What to Expect Omni is a cube shaped device  comprising six action cameras coupled with necessary hardware and software necessary to mesh the footage into 360 degree video  in a compact aluminum rig  The latest device is packed with a host of features including  pixel level synchronization  error proof shooting  heat dissipation  greater durability and metadata SD Card management techniques to pleasure tech savvy customers Moreover  the  Omni Importer  feature will allow users to preview  stitch and publish the content they capture seamlessly  Users can use this software wizardry to preview all shots  trim it according to their needs  chose color correction and select stabilization standard Concurrent with the shipment of Omni  GoPro also launched a VR free player called GoPro VR for desktop  web or mobile users  This application will also feature original content from GoPro and inspiring videos from the company s sponsored athletes  GoPro VR can distribute content over the web and can work with VR headsets like Oculus Is Omni for Deep Pockets Though it may dominate the wish list of many  Omni s hefty price tag of  5000 will leave some customers sulking  for sure  However  this is considerably less than the price of Omni s yet to be launched big brother   Odyssey   which is targeted to professionals and can be bought at  15 000  GoPro will also be selling the frame of Omni for  1 500 for customers who have already managed to muster six hero cameras The fact that Omni is costlier that most of its competitors like stand alone spherical cameras including Ricoh s Theta S and JK Imaging s Kodak PixPro SP360 4K can be unappealing for some customers  With Nikon s KeyMission 360 and Samsung  KS 005930  s Gear 360 slated for release latter this year  it can only be imagined that gaining a rapid traction can be an uphill battle for Omni GoPro Bets Big With VRIt is now no secret that GoPro is making some serious strides to venture into 360 degree video and aerial photography in an attempt to break free from its image of  camera maker  to a  content developer   GoPro is inching close to release its own quadcopter drone  Karma  in the coming holiday season  This is likely to open a fresh revenue stream for the company  GoPro insists that Karma will be powered with revolutionary features that will make it stand out from other drones The reception of Karma will be extremely crucial for the company s rebound that has been wobbly grounds over the past two years   rallying shortly after the IPO  steadily declining in the second half of 2014  turning around in the first half of 2015 and then going down from the second half of the year Given that GoPro has not launched any consumer level offering since the Hero4 Session last summer was met with lukewarm response  Omni s market traction will be a major determinant for the company s top line performance  However  with single camera solutions trending in the market  it is difficult to predict how GoPro s rig technology will perform in the coming months GOPRO INC A Price    From  Camera Maker  to  Content Developer Presently  GoPRo is developing various types of software solutions and hardware to curtail the complexity of managing  editing and sharing contents on different media platforms  Its decision to emphasize on software solutions that make it more convenient for users to offload  access and edit their content will prove to be a significant step in the right direction for the company  GoPro is taking steps to solidify its position in the burgeoning virtual reality  VR  market  It recently announced additional software advancements with its new GoPro VR app In fact  GoPro now offers one of the world s most comprehensive platforms for capturing  stitching  sharing and enjoying VR content  through its new VR capture rigs  Omni and Odyssey and stitching software   Kolor  We believe that these efforts will pay off in the long term  and go a long way toward opening GoPro to a wider audience and expanding the company s user base GoPro currently holds Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the sector include Cable One Inc    NYSE CABO    Central Garden   Pet Co   NASDAQ CENT   and

3349,224864,CENT,5 Cheap Breakout Stocks For Supernormal Returns,opinion,For active investors  seeking breakout stocks is often a preferred investment strategy  In order to do so  they must zero in on stocks trading within a fairly tight range and purchase them when they move out of this band and offload them whenever they fall below the band  If correctly implemented  such a strategy could deliver impressive returns Identifying Breakout StocksThe first step to selecting the right breakout stocks is to calculate their support and resistance levels  A support level is the lower bound for stock movements while a resistance level refers to the maximum price which it trades within over a considerable period In other words  the demand for a stock is at its lowest at its support level  which means most traders are willing to sell it  At the resistance level  most traders are willing to go long on the stock  which means that they would like to add them to their portfolios  The key to identifying breakout stocks is to zero in on those that are on the verge of a breakout or those that have just broken above the resistance level Determining Whether It s for RealStocks which have breached their resistance level should ideally be in high demand among traders  But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is when they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support  This is why it is important to determine whether a long term price trend is about to emerge Only a study of long term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively  This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels  If you can identify the effective channel for a stock  picking it even at a not so reasonable price would give you significant returns Screening Parameters  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10  and 20   Stocks which are showing considerable price increases  but whose gains are not

If the company doesn t make money then it won t survive over the long haul  This is the reason why the highest priority for both a fledgling and an established corporation is to secure earnings growth on a year over year basis Earnings growth more often than not leads to an increase in the share price  But  earnings expectations too play a crucial role in share price movements Earnings Estimates

This happens when a company s earnings fail to meet market expectations But what exactly do earnings estimates represent  Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins  expenses and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates are a valuable tool for investors when deciding whether or not to buy a stock We

3355,224870,CENT,These 5 Stocks Exhibit Solid Relative Price Strength,opinion,Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine whether a stock has the ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also imperative to determine whether a stock s price performance is ahead of its peers or the industry average If the stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite having impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and

3369,224884,CENT,5 Stocks To Buy On Robust Consumer Spending,opinion,"Fresh GDP data released last Friday revealed that the economy had expanded at a slower rate in the second quarter than earlier estimated  Estimates for growth during this period are currently in line with the final figures recorded for the first quarter and have led to concerns about the health of the economy 
However  one bright spot was visible amid the gloom  Consumer spending grew faster than earlier estimates  indicating that the largest contributor to GDP remained in fine fettle  Taken together with other economic indicators released recently  this has led to optimism about economic growth in the current quarter  Picking consumer related stocks looks like a prudent option at this point 
Growth Dips  Consumption Spikes
According to the Department of Commerce s second estimate  GDP grew at 1 1  in the second quarter  lower than the initial estimate of 1 2   The decline in the pace of growth was primarily attributable to a higher than expected fall in business inventories  This metric declined by  12 4 billion during the last quarter on an annualized basis  shaving off 1 26 percentage points from GDP  This was the largest such decline in a period in excess of two years 
Meanwhile  the largest contributor to U S  GDP  consumer spending  experienced a significant upward revision  Household consumption increased on an annualized basis of 4 4   higher than the rate of 4 2  that was earlier estimated  This is the fastest pace of expansion the metric has experienced since the last quarter of 2014  Consumer expenditure contributed 2 94 percentage points to GDP growth  the highest in more than a year 
Third Quarter Rebound Likely
Despite the fact that second quarter GDP has been revised downward  the outlook for the economy remains strong  Speaking at Jackson Hole  the Fed Chair sounded optimistic about economic growth  inflation and the labor market  Similar sentiments were expressed by other key Fed officials earlier  
In fact  there is enough evidence to suggest that a strong rebound is likely in the third quarter  Data released recently reveals that the trade deficit has declined considerably even as residential construction increased sharply in July  Additionally  durable orders increased substantially last month  indicating that the drought in business expenditure might be receding 
Also  the labor market continues to exhibit a high degree of strength and this should continue to boost consumer expenditure  Meanwhile  the reduction in business inventories  the primary culprit when it comes to a fall in estimated GDP  is expected to give a boost to the industry as it will result in a buildup of fresh inventories  Presently  the Atlanta Fed is projecting third quarter GDP at 3 4  
Our Choices
Despite the fall in estimated GDP growth  there are enough signs which indicate that a revival has already begun in the current quarter  A spurt in consumer spending is probably primarily responsible for this rebound  as can be seen from the strong trend that is already visible 
Picking consumer stocks would make for a smart choice at this time  At the same time  it is important to pick winning stocks   
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score

3372,224887,CENT,Play The Momentum Trend With These 5 Hot Stocks,opinion,It has been about two decades since academics identified a  momentum effect  in stock markets  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift  Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles  this strategy has barely anything to do with the fundamentals of a company  and instead works with the human penchant to extrapolate the flimsiest trends into the future Momentum versus Other StylesIt is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares to the other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has also declined radically since the 1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  become known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes However  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s Why Does Momentum Strategy Work There is a simple reason to this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold onto losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back to their previous highs  On the other hand  investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the herd and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral issues extend trends  and thus open up a huge opportunity for momentum players to make profits  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Chase the AlphaMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no mean feat Here  we have created a strategy that will

3374,224889,CENT,Central Garden   Pet  CENT  Q2 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Central Garden   Pet Company   NASDAQ CENT   is slated to report second quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 4  2016  after the closing bell  The big question facing investors is  whether this producer and marketer of lawn   garden products and pet supplies will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported 
In the trailing four quarters  the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 66 1   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 

Likely Earnings Beat in the Cards
Our proven model shows that Central Garden   Pet is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  The Most Accurate estimate stands at 61 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 59 cents for the company  So the ensuing difference  that is  an Earnings ESP of  3 39   combined with the company s Zacks Rank  2  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Central Garden   Pet is revamping both its Pet and Garden segments  The company intends to have a balanced approach to improve both its top line and bottom line through operational efficiency and targeted acquisitions  Organic growth  accretive acquisitions such as that of the pet bedding business along with divestment of non strategic assets should drive the company s earnings higher 
The company is the leading producer of garden and pet supplies products in the U S  with a diversified portfolio of brands  This has helped it develop healthy commercial relationships with giant retailers such as Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   Home Depot  NYSE HD  and Lowe s  We believe that this provides the company significant opportunity to grow

3375,224890,CENT,SeaWorld  SEAS   Soft Sales To Hit The Stock In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"SeaWorld Entertainment  Inc    NYSE SEAS   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  after the market closes 
Last quarter  it posted a negative earnings surprise of 10 00   In fact  this Florida based theme park and entertainment company has missed earnings in three of the last four quarters with an average negative surprise of 11 37  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Seaworld s has been experiencing a decline in total revenue per capita mostly due to lower attendance  Negative publicity associated with captive whales and prolonged scrutiny of its employee safety practices could hurt revenues in the to be reported quarter as well  In fact  promotional offerings have not been able to slow the decline in traffic trends  Also  costs related to marketing and reputation campaigns would eat into profits in the to be reported quarter 
On Mar 17  the company announced that it has stopped the breeding of killer whales  Although this move will salvage its reputation among activists  it will have a negative impact on revenues  especially from international visitors 
Nevertheless  SeaWorld Entertainment is making every possible effort to regain customer confidence  The company continues to organize consumer events to drive attendance  These initiatives should offset the negatives to some extent and attract customers  thereby improving attendance  First quarter attendance is expected to be driven by Easter and spring break holidays 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that SeaWorld Entertainment is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The company has an Earnings ESP of  52 73   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 84 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is a loss of 55 cents 
Zacks Rank  SeaWorld Entertainment has a Zacks Rank  3  Although this increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s negative ESP makes a surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum

3376,224891,CENT,Hyatt Hotels  H  Q1 Earnings  FX Headwinds To Hit Stock ,opinion,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation   NYSE H   is set to report results on May 3  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 12 50   Further  the company s earnings have missed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average negative surprise of  14 34  

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Hyatt has been facing major headwinds over the past few quarters mainly from a strong dollar  which is leading to unfavorable foreign exchange translation  Moreover  given its significant presence in Europe and Asia  the company s first quarter revenues are likely to be hurt by currency headwinds 
Further  a slowdown in the Chinese economy is expected to be a major blow to Hyatt s top line  as China is one of its most important markets  We thus expect revenues in the region to remain under pressure  Moreover  the company s business in New York continues to be dampened by an oversupply of hotels 
On the bright side  Hyatt s performance in the U S  is likely to continue  Economic growth  along with lower unemployment numbers and oil prices  should translate to an increase in disposable incomes in U S  households  This would  in turn  boost demand in the country  Improved group demand and greater pricing power resulted in strong RevPAR over the past few quarters   a trend that is anticipated to continue in the first quarter as well 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hyatt is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The company has an Earnings ESP of  4 17   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 23 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands higher at 24 cents 
Zacks Rank  Hyatt has a Zacks Rank  3  Although this increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

3379,224894,CENT,MGM Resorts   MGM  Q1 Earnings  Will Macau Hurt Results ,opinion,"MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  before the opening bell  Last quarter  the company posted a substantial negative earnings surprise of 114 29  
However  the company also posted positive earnings surprise in 3 out of the trailing 4 quarters  with the average earnings surprise being 106 49  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
MGM Resorts  earnings in the to be reported quarter are expected to benefit from the improving demand at its properties in Las Vegas  which reflects the improving employment rate and the rise in tourists  With the Las Vegas Strip recording high occupancy rates over the past year  the company has seen solid rise in resort revenues  which should boost the top line  Further  the diversification of its resort portfolio and non gaming options should propel first quarter revenues as well 
However  the sluggish environment in Macau is likely to keep revenues under pressure  In fact  revenues in Macau have plunged in double digits in all the three months of this quarter due to the anti graft corruption drive undertaken by the Chinese government which significantly hurt VIP business in the region 
China s crackdown on illegal money transfers  credit growth issues and tighter restrictions on visas have had a negative impact on revenues in this region  The weakening of yuan is likely to further dent Macau s gambling revenues as it gets more expensive for Chinese gamblers to place bets  Further  slowdown in the Chinese economy is hurting the mass market segment  which would in turn hurt revenues in the upcoming quarter 
Nevertheless  a comparatively better performance at main floor and non gaming segments can somewhat make up for the slowdown in the VIP gaming business in Macau 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that MGM Resorts is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP is  46 15   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 7 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 13 cents 
Zacks Rank  MGM Resorts  Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of the ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP to be sure of an earnings surprise 
Meanwhile  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

3380,224895,CENT,GoPro  GPRO   Stock To Surprise This Earnings Season ,opinion,"GoPro  Inc    NASDAQ GPRO   is slated to report first quarter 2016 results after the closing bell on May 5 

In the preceding quarter  the company disappointed investors by posting a negative earnings surprise of around 75 0   marking its second consecutive negative surprise  Though the company has managed to beat estimates in two of the last four quarters  the massive misses have brought down the average positive earnings surprise to a modest 1 2  
Let s see how things have been shaping up before this announcement 
Factors to Consider
We believe GoPro s concerted efforts to regain traction in its HERO line of capture devices with subsequent price cuts and pruning of its camera portfolio may provide the much required boost to its quarterly sales  During the fourth quarter of 2015  the company had re launched its Hero4 Session camera at a lower price and generated over three fold increase in sell through rates in December  demonstrating the market traction gained by the product  Moreover  a steady surge in the company s sale of capture device accessories is also expected to offer some respite after the precipitous sales slump over the past six months 
In addition  GoPro is making strategic investments in talent  technology  software and innovative new products via a spate of deals with athletes  sponsorship events and partnerships with several industry giants that are likely to be conducive to the quarterly results  During first quarter 2016  GoPro inked a patent licensing agreement with Microsoft Corporation  NASDAQ MSFT   renewed its partnership with National Hockey League  NHL  and the National Hockey League Players  Association  collaborated with The Recording Academy on GRAMMYcam and announced a global tie up with PGA TOUR 
Furthermore  growing popularity of GoPro app downloads  up 28  year over year during the fourth quarter of 2015  and GoPro studio installations  up 67   also signal toward the thriving easy to use software market  Moreover  impressive performance by the GoPro Channel coupled with aggressive television marketing as well as digital  out of home and in store  initiatives are expected to drive growth in first quarter 2016 
Despite these positives  GoPro s cannibalistic product launches have proved to be a major headwind hurting its financials over the past quarters  For instance  plummeting sales of HERO4 session cameras owing to increased adoption of its HERO4 black and silver products implies that such factors may continue to impact top line sales 
Other than this  a host of operational issues like escalating charges related to the re pricing of its HERO4 camera and charges in relation to piling up of excess inventory  may weigh on GoPro s margins during the quarter to be reported  Also  expected severance costs in relation to the company s plan to lay off 7  of its workers may also compound operating expenses 
Additionally  the ongoing economic slump in China  which is one of the major markets of the company  and waning sales of action sports cameras in the U S   largely attributable to the slowdown in wearable camera markets  will likely hurt GoPro s first quarter financials 
Moreover  as the company s 50  of revenues are generated outside U S   currency fluctuations may pose a significant headwind to its performance in the quarter to be reported 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that GoPro will beat estimates this earnings season  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 64 cents  This translates into an Earnings ESP of 0 00  for GoPro 
Zacks Rank  GoPro s Zacks Rank  3  when combined with a 0 00  ESP  lowers the predictive power of ESP and makes surprise predictions difficult 
Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider

The company has posted a negative average earnings surprise of 6 88  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Caesars Entertainment has not been able to record profit for a long time  The company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in every quarter  except one  since the second quarter of 2013  The losses were the result of high debt levels which drove interest expenses 
Despite following a restructuring plan  the company has not been able to improve its debt position  In fact  costs related to these initiatives have hurt profits and we expect the same to affect the results in the to be reported quarter 
Nevertheless  the company is spending heavily on renovation to boost traffic  It is enhancing hospitality and entertainment assets in the high growth markets  such as Las Vegas  Meanwhile  Las Vegas has been witnessing strong visitation pattern and high occupancy rates in the recent past  mainly aided by improving employment rate in the U S  Given the optimism surrounding tourism in this region  we expect the properties to boost first quarter revenues 
Investments in new and exciting hospitality amenities and the ongoing investments in Caesars Interactive Entertainment   CIE   are reaping significant benefits  CIE should continue to perform strongly driven by solid organic growth in its social and mobile games business 
On the other hand  the company is making efforts to cut expenses through cost saving initiatives  which has started yielding results  These efforts should continue to aid margin expansion in the to be reported quarter

Aceto Corp   O ACET   which we ve mentioned a couple times  particularly on the breakaway gap  the run up  it formed a wedge  and on Monday  it broke out of the wedge  up 1 58 to 29 61  or 5 6   on 272 100  The volume wasn t huge  It s not a heavily traded stock  It does have 3 2 days to cover  The breakout could get a retest up near the 31 90 area  maybe even 32 00 short term 
Central Garden   Pet Company  O CENT  has really been strong the last couple of months  and on Monday  it was up 96 cents to 17 27  or 5 9   on 242 600 shares traded  It has gone from 8 1 2 to 17 1 2  Doubling  yet the longer term chart shows a major breakout at the 2006 high up around 18 50  60  That could be the target short term  and then it could take it further 
JetBlue Airways Corporation  O JBLU  is one of several airlines that did great on Monday  up 76 cents to 26 86  or 2 9   on 6 1 million shares  It broke out of a consolidation pattern  and may very well be on its way to 30 31

The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF  N NUGT  ran 5 65 to 31 81  or 21 6   on 11 6 million shares on Wednesday  It has gone from a low of 17 40 to 31 94  There s a double top up there  If the short term declining topline is taken out  then it s a set up to pull back for a higher move to the high 40s  The target is in the mid to high 40s  but the declining topline has to be tested first

Factors Affecting This Quarter
Despite expectations of intense competition and currency headwinds  Church   Dwight remains optimistic about its 2016 performance  The company s robust portfolio of value and premium products  launch of innovative products  aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead expenses should bode well for its earnings and revenues

Let s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement 

Factors at Play
Black Diamond is a sporting goods company which has been witnessing a consistent growth in sales over the past few quarters  backed by higher sales of its apparel brand and the continued rollout of POC s cycling products  including the new spring 2015  Race Day  line and expanded assortment of eyewear 
During the fourth quarter the company implemented a few strategies like streamlining of manufacturing processes and overhead cost reduction  This should improve margins in the to be reported quarter 
However  a tough retail environment  combined with warmer than expected weather conditions on the East Coast  that affected categories like gloves  are likely to keep revenues under pressure

Our proven model does not conclusively show that Black Diamond is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Negative Zacks ESP  Black Diamond s Earnings ESP is  150 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 10 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of 4 cents 
Zacks Rank  Black Diamond has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Meanwhile  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum
