2859,224374,ARTX,FLIR Systems Enjoying Solid Backlog  Risks To Profit Remain,opinion,"On Nov 29  we issued an updated research report on Wilsonville  OR based FLIR Systems Inc    NASDAQ FLIR    FLIR Systems designs  manufactures and markets thermal imaging and broadcast camera systems for applications in the commercial and government markets  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Year to date  FLIR Systems  shares have recorded an average return of 25 7   slightly lower than that of the Zacks categorized Electronics Military Systems Market industry average of 28 5   The company has a dismal track record characterized by consecutive earnings misses in the four trailing quarters  largely due to rising operating costs and intensifying competition in retail channels 
Further  the company s earnings estimates have moved south over the past one month  Analysts have revised the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 earnings slightly downward over the past 30 days  from  1 62 to  1 61 per share  which is a bearish sign 
FLIR Systems  business is vulnerable to political uncertainty and currency volatility across the globe  especially given the recent strength in the U S  dollar  These apart  macroeconomic woes are also pressurizing certain end markets of the company  thus adding to its woes 
Particularly  the company s gross profit is vulnerable to a host of factors  including product mix changes  manufacturing cost absorption  adjustments in inventory and rise in competitive pressure in security retail channels  During the recently reported third quarter 2016 results  the company booked a  2 million charge for its defective SkyWatch surveillance towers  which have hurt profits  The company is still working to trace all the faulty units  and this poses a huge risk to profits as the liability could rise as high as  20 million  Thus  the profitability of this company depends on its ability to check the rise in costs in the coming quarters 
Presently  the company is focusing on improving operating efficiency and cost structure to bring margins back to the growth track  As a result of these cost control measures  operating profit margins in third quarter 2016 expanded 380 basis points sequentially 
FLIR SYSTEMS Price and Consensus
   Meanwhile  the company s Security segment is grappling with stiff competition in its retail channels and will most likely hurt its growth prospects  We believe that these short term headwinds might limit the company s growth momentum in the near term 
On the positive side  FLIR Systems is optimistic about its solid bookings and backlog during the recent quarters and believes it will fuel future growth  The company s fundamental business strength and growth prospects are reflected in its solid backlog levels  as it finished the year with total 12 month order backlog of  644 million  representing 13  sequential growth and the highest backlog level since 2008  We believe strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels indicate the company s resiliency  which will help it sail through difficult economic times and drive growth  Also  the company s improved working capital utilization is resulting in robust cash flow  which adds to its strength 
Furthermore  FLIR Systems has consistently pursued acquisitions to boost its core and non core businesses  In the third quarter  the company s commercial product revenues benefited significantly from the newly acquired products of DVTEL and Armasight 
Also  last month  FLIR Systems inked an agreement to buy Point Grey Research  Inc  for about  253 million  Point Grey develops machine vision cameras used in industrial automation systems  medical diagnostic equipment  intelligent traffic systems  people counting systems  military and defense products  and advanced mapping systems  The addition of Point Grey s capabilities will add to FLIR Systems  OEM cores and components business  and expand its range of visible spectrum machine vision cameras and solutions  This can translate into bright prospects as machine vision and retail people counting are attractive end markets and represent somewhat underpenetrated application spaces for thermal imaging technology 
We believe that the company has numerous strengths to build upon  coupled with great growth prospects  which will help it tide over short term headwinds 
Stocks to Consider

2871,224386,ARTX,Beyond Tesla  2 Lithium Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"While the market for Lithium ion  Li ion  batteries has a ton of untapped potential  Tesla Motors Inc  s   NASDAQ TSLA   decision to build a  to meet its requirement of lithium ion battery packs brought glaring focus on the shortage of supply of this emerging energy storage technology 
Li ion batteries are a type of rechargeable battery in which lithium ions move from the anode to cathode during discharge  and from cathode to anode when charging  They are a popular choice be electric car manufacturers  and are used by General Motors Co    NYSE GM    Navistar International Corp    NYSE NAV    BMW AG   NYSE F    Daimler AG   NYSE F    and Ford Motor Co    NYSE F    among many others  Li ion batteries are also used in cellphones  laptops  and other electronic devices as well as in the aerospace and defense sector 
Back in January  it was reported that Panasonic Corp    NYSE F    in Tesla s Gigafactory  Kazuhiro Tsuga  President of Panasonic  said that  We are sort of waiting on the demand from Tesla  If Tesla succeeds and the electric vehicle becomes mainstream  the world will be changed and we will have lots of opportunity to grow  
By 2020  Tesla expects the annual Li ion battery production of the Gigafactory to exceed the global production in 2013  The factory will produce enough battery packs to allow Tesla to build around 500 000 electric cars annually by 2020 
However  Tesla s Gigafactory will not start production until at least 2017  Until then  the focus will be on other Li ion battery manufacturers  Thus  it would be a good idea to invest in some companies that manufacture these batteries 
Let s take a look at two stocks that are looking good at the moment 
1  Arotech Corp    NASDAQ ARTX   has two business divisions  Training and Simulation  and Battery and Power Systems  The Battery and Power Systems division manufactures and sells Lithium and Zinc Air batteries and smart chargers for the military and to the private defense industry in the Middle East  Europe  and Asia

2872,224387,ARTX,4 Defense Stocks To Buy On Trump Victory,opinion,"In what can arguably be called the most startling electoral outcome in modern American history  Donald Trump s victory last week led to an initial meltdown only to bounce back strong later    extinguishing pre market fears of global sell offs  No doubt  the unexpected rally in the market was as surprising as the victory itself 
Coming to the Aerospace and Defense sector  the Trump win has been cheered by the stocks in this space  This is reflected by the 7  gain by both the S P 500 Aerospace   Defense  Industry  Index and the Dow Jones U S  Aerospace   Defense Index while the S P 500 climbed only 1 1  in the Nov 9 11 period 
In fact  the promises of greater spending and expansion of troops that Trump had made in his pre electoral campaign have won over defense majors  However  at the same time  Trump had hinted at a cutback in defense spending  particularly in Japan and South Korea  which played spoilsport 
Meanwhile  a quick review of the past reveals that the Conservative Republican Party has  in general  advocated in favor of increased military spending 
Considering these bullish factors and the latest request by President Obama for an additional  11 6 billion in supplemental war related funding  reflect a possibility of a higher rally by the defense stocks  in the near future   
Factors Boosting Defense Stocks
Although Trump s victory provided a boost to the defense sector  the intrinsic strength of the stocks in this space is worth a mention  We have discussed a few key points briefly below 
With geopolitical uncertainty on the rise  developed as well as emerging nations have increased their defense spending manifold in the last decade  The crisis has been particularly felt with the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  ISIS  Obviously  the direct beneficiaries of such global crisis are the aerospace and defense majors of the U S    the most successful ones in the world 
Moreover  demand for more fuel efficient aircraft  a growing international market and increasing application of unmanned aircraft in warfare today have driven sales in these sectors 
Also  low interest rate in the U S  for the past few quarters has also been favoring the defense stocks  which need substantial funding for the production of aircraft and defense equipment 
With the U S  fiscal 2016 bill emphasizing on cyber programs  cyber oriented work is expected to yield solid growth  Consequently  defense biggies like Raytheon Company   NYSE RTN   which develop various cybersecurity and special mission programs will be benefitted 
Apart from these factors  the landmark  38 billion deal that the U S  signed with Israel in Sep 2016 for 10 years reflects a crucial decision on the nation s part to substantially boost its defense sector  Per the terms of the contract  Israel has to spend as much as  1 2 billion of the  3 8 billion allotted to it per year on the advanced military equipment that only the U S  can provide 
Among other defense primes  The Boeing Company   NYSE BA   and Lockheed Martin Corp    NYSE LMT   are expected to gain the most from the deal  Per this deal  Israel will receive Lockheed s 33 F 35 jets and Boeing s 10 F 15 aircraft 
4 Stocks to Pick
With the factors working in favor of the defense sector  it is time investors consider a few top performing stocks from this space   We have picked four defense stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   which have experienced a share price hike of more than 4  in last five trading sessions  compared to the S P 500 Index s 3 6  over the same time frame

2873,224388,ARTX,TransDigm  TDG  Q4 Earnings Beat  Revenues Improve Y Y,opinion,"After a strong beat last quarter  TransDigm Group Incorporated   NYSE TDG   followed up with another beat in its fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results 
The aircraft supplier posted adjusted quarterly earnings  including stock based compensation adjustments  of  3 10 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 07 
The figures fared even better in year over year comparison  registering an increase of almost 13 6  from the year ago tally of  2 83 per share 
For fiscal 2016  the company s adjusted earnings per share were up 27 5  to  11 49  
Net income for the quarter came in at  154 7 million  up 9 2  from the comparable quarter a year ago  The increase in income was driven primarily by growth in net sales  robust operating margin resulting from the strength of proprietary products  continued gains from productivity efforts and favorable product mix  Also  lower effective tax rate proved conducive to the net income growth 
Inside the Headlines
Net sales for the quarter came in at  875 2 million  representing year over year growth of 8 1   However  the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  880 million 
The quarterly top line growth mainly came on the back of solid contribution from previously completed acquisitions namely  PneuDraulics  Breeze Eastern and Data Device Corporation  These acquisitions contributed  88 6 million to the sales 
Sturdy growth in commercial aftermarket revenues  up about 6 5  from the prior year  boosted revenues  While commercial OEM sales remained flat  Defense revenues grew 2  over the comparable period last year 
For fiscal 2016  the company s net sales came in at  3 171 4 million  up an impressive 17 2  compared with the year ago tally  This growth largely came on the back of strategic acquisitions 
TransDigm s EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  escalated 16 6  year over year to  423 3 million  driven by robust sales 
Acquisitions
During the reported quarter  Transdigm Group closed the buyout of Young   Franklin Inc  and its subsidiaries  including Tactair Fluid Controls Inc  The deal will expand its footprint in the market of highly engineered  proprietary products  with significant aftermarket content  The Liverpool  NY based Young   Franklin makes highly engineered valves and actuators  and almost all its products are proprietary 
The acquired business will add to TransDigm s revenues to the extent of about  75 million  for the fiscal year ending Dec 2016  Of this  aftermarket revenues will account about 70  of the total 
The other important buyouts made this year include the  1 billion buyout of ILC Holdings Inc   the parent company of defense firm   Data Device Corporation   DDC     and mission critical electromechanical systems manufacturer   Breeze Eastern Corporation  The ILC Holdings buyout will empower TransDigm fortify its footprint in the market of highly engineered  proprietary products  with significant aftermarket content  while strengthening its presence in the military and commercial aircraft market 
Moreover  the Breeze Eastern Corporation takeover will strengthen the company s foothold in the aerospace industry  especially in the niche markets of highly engineered proprietary aerospace components 
Liquidity
TransDigm ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  1 59 billion  significantly up from  714 million as of Sep 30  2015  At the end of Sep 30  2016  the company s long term debt was  9 94 billion  compared with  8 11 billion at the end of Sep 2015 
Also  the company completed an offering of  1 150 million of term loans that will be maturing in 2023  These proceeds were used to partially fund a special dividend of  24 00 per share paid in Nov 2016 and to repurchase  500 million of existing 7 50  Senior Subordinated Notes due in 2021 
TRANSDIGM GROUP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 
   Fiscal 2017 Guidance
Concurrent with its fiscal fourth quarter earnings release  TransDigm Group offered its fiscal 2017 guidance  The company projects net sales to be in the range of  3 515  3 565 million  Adjusted earnings are forecast to lie within the range of  11 84  12 12 per share  
Also  TransDigm Group projected net income to lie in the band of  577  593 million and EBITDA to be in the range of  1 671  1 695 million 
As per businesses  the company believes commercial aftermarket revenues to be up between middle to high single digit percentage and commercial OEM revenues to be up in the low to mid single digit percentage range  However  the company anticipates defense revenues to be flat for the fiscal year 
Our Take
TransDigm Group posted impressive fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results  mainly on the back of positive trends in the Commercial Aftermarket business  About 90  of its sales were generated by proprietary products  that is  products for which the company owns the intellectual property  This translates into consistent and sustained revenue generation capacity through all phases of the aerospace cycle 
TransDigm has been actively working toward strengthening and enhancing its position in highly engineered proprietary aerospace components  niche markets  The recent acquisitions made by the company have boosted its proprietary aerospace businesses  supplementing growth  Further  the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company s efforts to streamline costs will likely translate into solid margin expansion in the quarters ahead

3141,224656,ARTX,U S  military marches forward on green energy  despite Trump,news,"By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump and his top advisors have often scoffed at government support of green energy  His chief strategist called it  madness   But the largest U S  government agency   the Department of Defense   plans to forge ahead under the new administration with a decade long effort to convert its fuel hungry operations to renewable power  senior military officials told Reuters  The reasons have nothing to do with the white hot debate over climate change  In combat zones  green energy saves lives by  for instance  reducing the need for easily attacked convoys to deliver diesel fuel to generators at U S  bases  Mobile solar power units allow soldiers to prowl silently through enemy territory   At sea  gas electric hybrid battleships save fuel and allow for fewer stops   making them less vulnerable to attacks like the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000  when al Qaeda militants killed 17 U S  soldiers during a refueling stop in Yemen  The military s zeal for renewable power has already had broad impacts on energy contractors  generating hundreds of millions in contracts for solar companies and helping to reduce fuel consumption by the world s largest single petroleum buyer   The armed forces nearly doubled renewable power generation between 2011 and 2015  to 10 534 billion British thermal units  or enough to power about 286 000 average U S  homes  according to a Department of Defense report  The number of military renewable energy projects nearly tripled to 1 390 between 2011 and 2015  department data showed  with a number of utilities and solar companies benefiting  Many of those projects are at U S  bases  where renewable energy allows the military to maintain its own independent source of power in case of a natural disaster or an attack   or cyber attack   that disables the public grid  The White House did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the military s use of green energy  Although Trump has blasted solar subsidies  vowed to boost fossil fuel development and questioned the science behind climate change  military leaders remain confident that the president won t halt their march toward renewable power    We expect that it s going to continue during the Trump administration   said Lt  Col  Wayne Kinsel  head of the infrastructure unit of the Air Force Asset Management Division for Logistics  Engineering and Force Protection   It s really not political   Other senior officials in the Navy  Air Force and Army also told Reuters that they expected their renewable energy programs to continue  Lt  Col  J B  Brindle  a Defense Department spokesman  said the agency  spends very little appropriated funding  on renewable energy projects  but declined to give any figures or to answer additional questions about such efforts   Trump s Secretary of Defense  Jim Mattis  has long supported efforts to reduce troop dependence on petroleum  He saw first hand the vulnerability of diesel convoys to attacks by militants while serving as Commander of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s  As far back as 2003  he urged Navy researchers to find innovative ways to unleash the military from the  tether of fuel    LAUNCHED BY A REPUBLICAN The military s push into alternative energy started under Republican President George W  Bush in 2007  when he signed a law requiring the Pentagon to get 25 percent of the electricity for its buildings from renewable energy by 2025  The effort accelerated under President Barack Obama  who required the Army  Air Force and Navy to each deploy 1 gigawatt of renewable power and directed the Army to open a lab developing energy technologies for combat vehicles  In an apparent nod to Obama s efforts to curb global warming  the Pentagon also reported to Congress in 2015 that the droughts and floods caused by climate change pose a security threat   contributing to foreign political and economic instability that could require substantial troop deployments  Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in his parting memo in January that the Navy has already met its goal  producing 1 gigawatt of electricity   while the other forces are on track to meet their targets  The programs have their opponents  The conservative Heritage Foundation  for example  has railed against the military s support of renewable power and biofuels   The administration right now needs to focus specifically on combat power   said Rachel Zissimos  a Heritage researcher   Investing money on optional initiatives right now I think is problematic   HIGH STAKES FOR MILITARY SUPPLIERS Solar companies such as SunPower Corp  O SPWR  and utilities including  Sempra Energy   N SRE  and Southern  N SO  have won utility scale renewable energy contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years  according to the companies and Department of Defense documents reviewed by Reuters  Southern  N SO   for example  has 11 solar projects totaling 310 megawatts on bases in states including Georgia and Alabama  In December  Sempra  N SRE  completed the 150 megawatt Mesquite Solar 3 in Arizona to provide about a third of the power needed at 14 Navy and Marine bases in California for 25 years  SunPower has already landed a major deal under the Trump administration   a  96 million contract finalized on Feb  3 to provide power to Vandenberg Air Force base in California until 2043  according to a Pentagon database  Sempra and Southern said they were committed to serving their customers but declined to comment on whether they were discussing new contracts with the military  SunPower did not comment  Last year  the Navy began outfitting Arleigh Burke destroyers with gas electric hybrid engines developed by L3  N LLL   which won a  119 million contract in 2013  Tesla  O TSLA   which produces electric cars and batteries  is another company that analysts say could benefit from military contracts  A Tesla spokesman said the company is  supportive  of the military s interest in clean energy but declined comment on whether it was pursuing Defense Department contracts  The U S  military s use of oil  meanwhile  fell by more than 20 percent between 2007 and 2015  The bulk of the decline likely stems from declining combat operations rather than rising efficiency and use of renewable energy  But traditional military fuel suppliers   such as  Exxon Mobil   N XOM    BP   L BP   and Shell  L RDSa    nonetheless have a lot at stake if the military accelerates its move away from fossil fuels   For a graphic on Pentagon s oil purchases click   The military s average annual oil bill was about  14 28 billion between 2007 and 2015  BP is constantly reviewing its marketing strategies to ensure growth  a spokesman said   As fuel slates change  we will adapt  and continue to provide our customers with the products they demand   he said in response to questions about the potential impact of the military s increased use of renewable fuels   SOLAR POWERED SOLDIERS Hauling fuel to the battlefield has been a hazard for militaries since at least World War I and continues to take a grim toll  One in nearly 40 fuel convoys in Iraq in 2007 resulted in a death or serious injury  according to a study commissioned by the Defense Department  In Afghanistan the same year  one in 24 fuel convoys suffered casualties  Marines in Afghanistan began carrying solar panels in 2009 to forward bases in battles with Taliban fighters  They used them to power batteries for communications  GPS and night vision goggles  The panels not only reduced the need for convoys  they allowed marines to shut off generators  hushing operations and making them harder for enemies to detect  Arotech  ARTX  subsidiary UEC has sold  25 million worth of the solar arrays and expects a bigger business in systems working with batteries and solar to slash dependence on generators  said business manager Nancy Straight  Col  Brian Magnuson  the head of the Marines  expeditionary energy office  established in 2009  said his office aims to replace diesel powered generators on the battlefield with solar power  and to reduce energy use with efficiency measures such as insulated tents and the deployment of advanced batteries  
 These technologies are a way to become more effective in combat   Magnuson said   This is about war fighting capability    For a graphic on a boom in military green energy projects  click  ",2017-03-01,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-military-marches-forward-on-green-energy,-despite-trump-462852",462852

per share of 36 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The figure rose 12 5  over the prior year quarter tally  as top line growth and higher gross margin boosted profits    GAAP net earnings for the quarter came in at  42 6 million  significantly higher than the year ago quarter s tally of  1 1 million Inside the HeadlinesThe company s top line grew a remarkable 7 2  year over year to  406 8 million  However  revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  408 million by a whisker  Recent acquisitions and several product launches in existing businesses bolstered the top line Phenomenal growth in the company s OEM   Emerging Markets segment and strength in the Detection segment drove the overall top line  and more than offset the decline in sales experienced in the four remaining segments As for the segments  OEM   Emerging Markets revenues continued their striking growth trajectory  rising an impressive 77 2  over the prior year quarter to  84 8 million  whileDetection revenues recorded growth of 8 7  year over year to  31 8 million  The revenues of OEM   Emerging Markets were partially driven by the addition of the Integrated Imaging Solutions line of business from the recent acquisition of Point Grey Research However  all other segments reported a decline in sales Maritime segment revenues were down 6 1  year over year to  48 6 million Surveillance segment revenues also contracted 4 4  year over year to  118 7 million In addition  Instruments revenues had another quarter of decline  decreasing 2  year over year to  77 9 million Revenues from the Security segment also had a disappointing performance this quarter  falling 4 2  over the prior year quarter to  45 1 million FLIR Systems  backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next 12 months came in at  608 million  reflecting an increase of 3  from the tally at the end of year ago quarter Adjusted operating income came in at  69 6 million compared with  62 2 million in the prior year quarter  Sturdy top line growth drove the rise in income Liquidity   Cash FlowAs of Mar 31  2017  the company s cash and cash equivalents were  397 4 million compared with  361 3 million a year back  Long term debt fell to  494 7 million compared with  501 9 million as at Dec 31  2016 Cash flow generated from operating activities in the quarter came in at  75 1 million  significantly higher than  45 9 million generated in the year earlier quarter  The rise can be largely attributed to sustained improvements in productivity of working capital FLIR Systems  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Dividend   Share RepurchaseConcurrent with the earnings report  FLIR Systems announced a quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents per share  payable on Jun 9  2017  to

1 81  1 91 per share  on revenues of  1 78  1 83 billion  The figures represent year over year growth of about 7 13  in adjusted earnings and 7 10  growth in revenues In fact  the company expects to see an uptick in organic growth second quarter onwards Going ForwardFLIR Systems has been expanding its market share in nearly all of its served markets  The company anticipates to build up on the strong backlog going ahead in 2017  Also  it has several new product platforms in the pipeline  which it expects to launch this year  which should drive growth In addition  the company s improved working capital utilization is resulting in robust cash flow that supplements its strength However  some of the company s segments are currently under pressure  which might continue to hurt the company s operations  Moreover  profitability of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company depends on its ability to check the rise in costs during the second half of the year  You can see  FLIR Systems

 Arotech s first quarter 2017 results  as anticipated  include revenue for the quarter that was less than a year ago  though better than the previous quarter  The engineering based development programs we are currently executing have required us to add engineering staff in both of our US operations to meet demand  but are absent the typical hardware components that help to immediately drive higher revenues   said acting Arotech CEO Dean Krutty 
 We continued to invest in the quarter in important hybrid power developments  bringing our total investment over the last five quarters to more than a million dollars in this technology  which we expect to be very meaningful to our future  Additionally  our contributions to the US Marine Corps  Amphibious Assault Vehicle Survivability Upgrade program during the quarter supported important test milestones that have led to the beginning of low rate initial production
