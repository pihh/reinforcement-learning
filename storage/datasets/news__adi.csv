99626,321141,ADI,Earnings Preview  Analog Devices  ADI  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Analog Devices  NASDAQ ADI  reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 26  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This semiconductor maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 22 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 45 billion  down 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Analog Devices 
For Analog Devices  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Analog Devices will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Analog Devices would post earnings of  1 22 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 26  delivering a surprise of  3 28  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Analog Devices doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-11-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-analog-devices-adi-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200486389,200486389
99629,321144,ADI,Analog Devices  ADI  Lags Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Analog Devices  NASDAQ ADI  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 19 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 21 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 55 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  1 65   A quarter ago  it was expected that this semiconductor maker would post earnings of  1 22 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 26  delivering a surprise of 3 28  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Analog Devices  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor   Analog and Mixed industry  posted revenues of  1 44 billion for the quarter ended October 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 63   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 60 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Analog Devices shares have added about 31 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 25  
What s Next for Analog Devices 
While Analog Devices has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Analog Devices was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 16 on  1 41 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 23 on  6 02 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Semiconductor   Analog and Mixed is currently in the bottom 28  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-11-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analog-devices-adi-lags-q4-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200488063,200488063
99634,321149,ADI,Northrop Grumman  Analog Devices  D R  Horton  Lennar And NVR Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 2  2020    Shares of Northrop Grumman Corporation   NYSE NOC   as the Bull of the Day  Analog Devices   NASDAQ ADI   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI    Lennar Corp    NYSE LEN   and NVR  Inc    NYSE NVR   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  With an annual budget north of  4 4 trillion  The U S  is the largest single consumer of virtually everything it purchases  The defense portion of U S  expenditures naturally rises in time or war  but with conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan greatly reduced  had settled into a range between  560 and  600 billion annually during the second term of the Obama administration As of 2016  the United States accounted for more than a third of global defense spending and it s been on the rise since then President Trump campaigned on a promise to  rebuild our depleted military  and in office  he s living up to that promise Trump signed into law the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act  committing  716 billion to defense spending during the fiscal year  Even when other budget consideration remain unresolved  Congress and the President have an easy time agreeing on defense spending Texas Republican Rep  Mac Thornberry  chairman of the House Armed Services Committee suggested that even higher defense budgets are on the horizon  saying of the 2019 allocation   The first job of the federal government is to defend the country  We re doing that on about 15  of the federal budget  but we ve cut too much in the past eight years and we have to make up for some of the ground that s been lost  Northrop Grumman Corporation supplies a wide range of Military systems to the U S and also other countries  The business is broken down into four main categories   Aerospace Systems  Mission Systems  Technology Services and the newly acquired Innovation Systems In the Aerospace division  Northrop produces aircraft  spacecraft  high energy systems and microelectronics  Mission Systems makes military radar  sensors and related products  Technology Services works on the entire lifecycle of civil and defense platforms through a wide range of services  including logistics  security  network operations and integrated air and missile defense serving not only the U S government and other Sovereign nations  but also municipalities like the state of Virginia  Finally  Innovation Systems was borne from the acquisition of Orbital ATK and is a leader in space  defense and flight systems Defense stocks are also generally defensive stocks  providing stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall stock market  With a beta of 0 76  NOC shares tend to move considerably less than the broad markets  especially during times of turmoil  In fact  periods of armed conflict   which cause significant uncertainty for most stocks   are actually the best times for defense companies as nations expand their offensive capabilities and refresh depleted resources Another positive aspect of the defense sector is that these companies generally have an easier time passing along cost increases to their customers than other industrial companies  When rising steel  oil or labor costs increase the price of finished goods  ordinary consumers can much more easily choose to delay the purchase of an automobile or even a tractor  but the government can t necessarily put off defense purchases  Defense companies are also naturally resistant to trade wars and tariffs  because governments are unlikely to enact tariffs on goods and services of which they themselves are the purchasers In their most recent earnings report  NOC handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates of  4 74 share in earnings  with  5 49 share in earnings on sales of  8 48B Analysts expect  20 38 share in earnings in full year 2019 and  23 01 in 2020  Both have been revised upward several times over the past quarter Northrup Grumman is a Zacks Ranks  2  Buy  Northrop also pays a 1 5  dividend  and has over  2 5B in Free Cash Flow to back it up There s one more story that bodes well for the futures at Northrop Grumman  The most recent defense budget bill also provided the framework for the development of an additional branch of the US military   the Space Force The establishment of the Space Force will likely be a windfall for Northrup Grumman  It s a fair bet that a company with Northrop s expertise in the space sector would make it a natural choice for the goods and services the new division would require  Until we know more about the ultimate size and shape of the Space Corps  this is a non quantifiable wildcard  but one with the potential to create a strong tailwind for the company In an investing environment that includes all sorts of apparently hidden risks   trade wars  rising commodity prices  increased labor costs  etc   there are some companies that appear particularly well equipped to weather the storm  With the support of a Presidential administration devoted to increased defense spending  Northrop Grumman belongs in any well diversified portfolio  Analog Devicesis the  44 billion manufacturer of analog  mixed signal and digital signal processing  DSP  integrated circuits  and other semiconductor devices found in cars  planes  factories and home appliances around the globe ADI moved to the cellar of the Zacks Rank after reporting a disappointing Q4 fiscal 2019  ended October  and outlook that caused analysts to take down estimates for their FY20  Adjusted earnings of  1 19 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 21  as the bottom line decreased 19 6  year over year and 12 5  sequentially Revenues of  1 44 billion in the quarter also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 6   And the top line declined 6  year over year and 5 5  from the fiscal third quarter This downside can be attributed to weak performance of the company in all end markets served  Moreover  macroeconomic headwinds negatively impacted the topline Analysts responded to the company outlook by dropping full year 2020 revenue projections to  5 66 billion  representing a 5 46  decline from FY19 And the 2020 EPS consensus fell 10 3  to  4 78 from  5 33  for a projected 7 2  drop on the bottom line Revenues by End MarketsIndustrial generated revenue of  744 1 million  accounting for 52  of total revenues   which was flat year over year Communications revenue came in at  260 1 million  18  of revenues   decreasing 19  year over year Automotive revenue fell to  226 1 million  16  of revenues   down 8  from the year ago quarter Consumer generated revenue of  212 8 million  15  of revenues   reflecting a 7  decline on a year over year basis Guidance LoweredFor the first quarter of fiscal 2020  Analog Devices expects revenues to be  1 30 billion       50 million   representing a 15 6  decline from the year ago quarter  Prior to this disappointing guidance  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q1 was pegged at  1 41 billion Non GAAP earnings are expected to be  1       0 07  per share  reflecting a 24  y o y drop  The consensus mark for the same was  1 16 per share The company anticipates non GAAP operating margins to be approximately 36 7       100 bps  Clearly ADI is not going out of business despite being a leader of analog solutions in a digital world But until the estimates stop going down and start heading back up  it may be best to stand aside  The Zacks Rank will let you know Additional content D R  Horton  DHI  Up Over 50  in 2019  Will the Bull Run Continue D R  Horton  Inc  s shares have jumped 50 2  over a year compared with the Zacks  industry s 45 4  rally  Also  it has outperformed the S P 500 s 30 7  rise in the said period  The price performance was backed by the company s robust earnings surprise history  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the trailing eight quarters  Its revenues surpassed the consensus mark in seven of the trailing eight quarters The bull run is likely to continue  courtesy of impressive earnings growth rate  industry leading market share  solid acquisition strategy  affordable product offerings across multiple brands and solid housing market fundamentals Earnings estimates for fiscal 2020 have moved 6 5  north in the past 60 days  This positive trend signifies bullish analysts  sentiments and justifies the company s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   indicating robust fundamentals and the expectation of outperformance in the near term  You can see  Let us delve deeper into other factors that make this stock a profitable pick What Makes the Stock an Attractive Pick Solid Underlying Housing Market Fundamentals Improved U S  housing market fundamentals on the back of lower mortgage rates  Fed s dovish stance  solid economic growth and favorable demographics are expected to provide a major boost to the demand for homes in the upcoming quarters  Also  a 50 year low unemployment rate and increased wage growth make the picture rosier The recent housing data also reveals encouraging market prospects  The recently released housing starts data for the month of November showed a 13 6  year over year jump  Building permits increased 1 4  to the rate of 1 482 million units in November  the highest level since May 2007  Moreover  a survey showed that homebuilder confidence in December jumped to the highest level since June 1999 This positive momentum is evident from the company s strong fiscal 2019 results  Earnings per share increased 13  from a year ago and revenues grew 9 4  during the year  Notably  with 56 975 homes closed in fiscal 2019  D R  Horton completed its 18th consecutive year as the largest homebuilder in the United States  In fiscal 2019  homes closed increased 10  year over year to 56 975 units and 9  in value to  16 9 billion  Additionally  homebuilding cash flow from operations was  1 4 billion Accretive Acquisitions   Increased Capital Investments in Land  D R  Horton   which shares space with Lennar Corp  and NVR  Inc  in same industry   remains proactive in acquiring homebuilding companies in desirable markets  Over the past five years  through fiscal 2019   the company has invested approximately  1 billion on acquisitions Its strong cash position and low debt capital ratio allowed it to make strategic land purchases even during the downturn  in turn giving it a significant competitive advantage  The company has selectively invested in attractively priced land and lots over the past few years  allowing it to bring new attractive communities in desirable markets  D R  Horton s well stocked supply of land  plots and homes provides it with a strong competitive advantage to meet the demand in the coming quarters  This will in turn lead to growth in sales and home closings The company invested  3 7 billion in lots  land and development in fiscal 2019  almost on par with the year ago level of  3 8 billion  It has plans to boost investments to replenish the land and lot supply in 2020 for supporting revenue growth Superior ROE   Solid Prospects D R  Horton s return on equity  ROE  is indicative of growth potential  The company s ROE of 16 6  compares favorably with the industry average of 12 1   implying that it is efficient in using its shareholders  funds Meanwhile  D R  Horton has solid prospects  as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2020 earnings of  4 89 per share  which indicates 13 9  year over year growth  higher than the industry average of 9 3    Overall  it constitutes a great pick in terms of growth investment  supported by a Growth Score of A  On a further encouraging note  this homebuilder is expected to register 11 8  earnings growth in three five years 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released

Fomento Economico s shares have underperformed the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry over the past year   2 6  vs   16 3    The Zacks analyst believes that the company s growth via acquisition strategy is reaping benefits  Its sound fundamentals and growth efforts position it for growth ahead 
The recent acquisition of minority stake in Jetro Restaurant Depot  AGV and 40  stake in Grupo Socofar  as well as joint venture with Ra zen reveal its commitment to invest in the expansion of core businesses  Furthermore  its third quarter 2019 results reflect significant strength across all businesses 
However  the company witnessed soft operating results across some divisions in the past few quarters  Operating margins at FEMSA Comercio s Health and Proximity Divisions in third quarter 2019 were hurt by operating expense deleverage in these units  Tariff related and higher input costs are headwinds hurting its bottling unit

Shares of Southern Company have gained  26 7  in the past six months against the Zacks Electric Power industry s rise of  14 8   The Zacks analyst believes that leveraging the demographics of its operating territories  as in healthy population and job growth  the firm has gradually increased its customer base 
With good rate base growth and constructive regulation  Southern Company is expected to generate steady earnings and dividend growth in the coming years  However  elevated leverage of the firm  along with continued timing and cost overrun issues over its Vogtle project  are major overhangs 
While the electric utility holding company s debt to capital ratio of 57  restricts financial flexibility  its  25 billion Vogtle nuclear plant has already exceeded budget and is years behind schedule  As such  Southern Company warrants a cautious stance from the investors

99669,321184,ADI,Harmonic  Analog  GOL  JetBlue And AZUL Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   July 10  2019    Harmonic   NASDAQ HLIT   as the Bull of the Day  Analog Devices   NASDAQ ADI   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S A    NYSE GOL    JetBlue Airways Corp   NASDAQ JBLU   and AZUL SA   NYSE AZUL   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Harmonic is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  with a good growth score and a weaker value score   The style scores tell me right away what kind of stock I am looking at and value investors and growth investors are inherently looking for different things   Let s look at why the stock hold the top Zacks Rank in this Bull of the Day article DescriptionHarmonic Inc  enables media companies and service providers to deliver ultra high quality broadcast and OTT video services to consumers globally The company has also revolutionized cable access networking via the industry s first virtualized CCAP solution  enabling cable operators to more flexibly deploy gigabit internet service to consumers  homes and mobile devices  Whether simplifying OTT video delivery via innovative cloud and software as a service  SaaS  technologies  or powering the delivery of gigabit internet cable services  Harmonic is changing the way media companies and service providers monetize live and VOD content on every screen Earnings HistoryI see a good earnings history with the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters   You want to see that because it shows that management knows what to tell Wall Street in order to set the bar low enough EstimatesSo there was a negative move or two in estimates  but it was more than 60 days ago  so the Rank only sees the more recent bumps higher   The current quarter is looking at a loss of 7 cents  down from a gain of a penny about 90 days ago   The next quarter has seen a bump higher in estimates by a penny  moving to 3 cents from 2 cents The full year 2019 Zacks Consensus Estimate has risen from  0 00 to  0 02 over the last 30 days  and the 2020 number has increased 3 cents to  0 20   That implies some really strong earnings growth for next year ValuationThe valuation on this stock is stiff   A 292x forward earnings multiple is crazy high  but that is due to the low EPS number and stock price that is on the move higher in anticipation of higher earnings in the future   The 2 3x price to book is much more reasonable   I also like seeing the 1 3x sales number as it tells me that the market values their sales News Last NightAfter the close HLIT announced that Comcastsaid they elected enterprise license pricing for its CableOS software   As a result HLIT will see around  175M in software license fees over the next four year and about  50M of that coming in 2019  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  is also scouping up a lot of stock in HLIT  7 8M shares from a warrant with a  4 76 exercise price In after hours the stock traded  6 50  Analog Deviceshas seen estimates drop and the Zacks Rank for this stock dropped right along with them  Earnings estimate revisions are the foundation of the Zacks Rank so let s look at why this stock is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  in this Bear of the Day article DescriptionAnalog Devices  Inc  is a world leader in the design  manufacture and marketing of a broad portfolio of high performance analog  mixed signal  and digital signal processing  DSP  integrated circuits  ICs  used in

differentiator in their customers  products  namely the industrial  automotive  communications  and consumer markets Earnings HistoryI see a good earnings hisotyr for ADI  with the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters   That would be a positive influence on the Zacks Rank  so it is not the reason the stock has the lowest Rank Estimate RevisionsThis is clearly the reason why the stock is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell    Estimates for this quarter have come in from  1 38 to  1 22 as have estimates for next quarter as well  Those numbers fell from  1 44 to  1 29 Full year numbers have also slid lower here with 2019 moving from  5 45 to  5 24 and next year coming in at  5 51 after reaching up to nearly  6 just 60 days ago Not ADI s FaultAs I scanned the news looking for a reason for the dip in consensus estimates  I didn t see much I did find an upgrade from Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   as they put the stock at Buy after it was a sell with a  114 price target   That is good news  so why are numbers falling Trade War AVGO reported a while back and they took down forward guidance in a big way   Many analysts applied the same logic to other names in the same sector as well as suppliers to chip stocks   The recent change in the trade war   the cease fire   has yet to show up in earnings estimate revisions   That could make this stock worth a deeper look   ADI reports again in late August so you have plenty of time with this one 3 Airline Stocks to Help a Portfolio Take OffAirlines have benefitted in recent months from relatively

99697,321212,ADI,Stock Exchange  The Future Isn t What It Used To Be ,opinion,"The Stock Exchange is all about trading  Each week  we do the following 
discuss an important issue for traders 
highlight several technical trading methods  including current ideas 
feature advice from top traders and writers  and
provide a few  minority  reactions from fundamental analysts 
We also have some fun  We welcome comments  links  and ideas to help us improve this resource for traders  If you have some ideas  please join in 
Review  Do You Make Up False Market Narratives 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question  Do You Make Up False Market Narratives  More specifically  we asked if you are able to drown out the noise of media driven false narratives when you place your trades  And in the absence of dominant market narratives  are you making up your own and inappropriately placing trades upon them 
This Week  The Future  Ain t  What It Used To Be
There was a time when General Electric s market cap was  600 billion  shopping malls were an unstoppable force behind retail  and  Pong  was a state of the art video game  Well guess what  The future ain t what it used to be 
GE s market cap it now less than  90 billion  online shopping  think Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   is putting a world of hurt on shopping malls  and kids today think Pong stinks 
But are your trading strategies still based on the way things used to be  This week s Stock Exchange reviews a company that owns shopping mall real estate  one that makes analog semiconductor chips  the kind that were around when Pong was hot   and a few others 
But before we get into this week s trades  here are a couple trading strategies that are likely to eventually fail because  well  the future ain t what it used to be 
First  a popular trading strategy in recent years has been to short the market volatility index  aka The VIX   This is a strategy that s gained popularity following the financial crisis as volatility steadily declined from record high levels  Except the problem is that it works until all of a sudden it doesn t  Traders tend to use a significant amount of leverage to make this strategy profitable  but when volatility strikes  even for a relatively short period of time  such as the marketwide pullback we experienced in Q4  these trading profits are easily wiped out  But of course some traders and investors have short memories  or they re just overconfident   For example  the following statement  as highlighted by Jesse Colombo  seems a little overconfident  Does anyone really believe that central banks have virtually eliminated recessions  The markets can be quite humbling 

Also worth revisiting  trading Psychologist  Dr  Brett Steenbarger reminds us that the markets are constantly changing  and that sticking to your same old trading strategy may not be a good idea  According to Steenbarger 

We commonly hear the advice that traders should  stick to their plans  and that planning and remaining true to plans is the epitome of discipline and the key to success  It ain t necessarily so  Let s take an analogy  If I meet with a person for the first time in a counseling session  I don t go into the session with a treatment plan  That would be crazy  Rather  I listen to what the person says  look for patterns in the issues they present  and then come up with an idea of what might be going on 

The future is never exactly the same as the past  and it  ain t  what it used to be  
Model Performance 
Our trading programs have moved back to normal trading and cash levels  after having been holding higher levels of cash in challenging market conditions  And  we are sharing the performance of our proprietary trading models  as our readers have requested 

Controlling Risk 
In addition to increasing and decreasing cash levels depending on market conditions  we find that blending a trend following momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion dip buying model  Holmes  is helpful in controlling risk  it provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
And  since many clients combine the trading models with our long term fundamental methods  they have additional diversity of methods without the need for short term timing

Expert Picks From The Models 
Note  This week s Stock Exchange report is being moderated by Blue Harbinger  a source for independent investment ideas 

Holmes  This week  I bought shares of National Retail Properties  NNN   What do you think about that  Blue Harbinger  It s a shopping mall REIT  and its business will likely face growing pressure and competition from online shopping  Why did you buy NNN  Holmes 

Holmes  First of all  I am a trader  not an investor  so the long term competitive pressures you mention are less relevant to me  My typical holding period is only around 6 weeks  And as you know I am a dip buyer  These shares have dipped in price recently 
BH  Interesting  I do see NNN describes itself as owning high quality retail properties  and its funds from operations and revenues have both been growing in recent years  and so has its dividend  But again  you probably don t care about that information too much because it s more long term focused  Thank you though for sharing that trade  Holmes 
Road Runner  I bought some shares of Analog Devices  NASDAQ ADI   ADI   It s a chip company  semiconductors  and they ve been around since 1965  two years after Yogi Berra retired  

BH  Gee Road Runner  why wouldn t you buy a more cutting edge semiconductor company like Nvidia  Have you seen the amazing video games Nvidia s GPUs enable  They re way more impressive than Pong 
Road Runner  I appreciate your commentary  but my trading strategy is based on momentum  More specifically  I like to buy stocks in the lower end of a rising channel  and then hold on to them for about 4 weeks 

BH  I assume you re talking about price momentum and not necessarily earnings momentum  but Analog Devices has actually beat earning estimates fairly consistently every quarter for over 4 years  Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

RR  That s great information  but not all that info is valuable to me because my timeframe is different  I typically hold my positions for 4 weeks  and then I m out  so that long term fundamental data is not all that valuable to me  but thanks anyway 
Athena  I bought shares of Inogen  INGN  this week  What do you think about that 

BH  They make portable oxygen concentrators to deliver supplemental long term oxygen therapy to patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions  They ve been growing revenues and beating earnings estimates fairly consistently in recent years  Why d you buy 

Athena  I am a technical trader  More specifically  I am an objective momentum trader  and I typically hold my positions for around 17 weeks  I am a  queen of the mountain  strategy where I utilize attractive qualities from across multiple strategies to determine what I hold in my concentrated portfolio  and I usually continue to hold it until something betters comes along and knocks it out of the portfolio 
Felix  I have a ranking to share  This week  I ran the S P 500 Index through my technical trading model  and my top 20 are ranked in the following list 

BH  I see a few more semiconductor companies in your list  e g  QCOM  AMD and MCHP  to go along with Road Runner s ADI pick  Thanks for sharing your list 

Oscar  I have some ETF rankings to share this week  As our resident sector ETF rotation model  I ran our   High Liquidity ETFs with price volume multiple over 100 million per day  universe through my model  and the top 20 are ranked in the following list 
BH  Interesting  Oscar  I see you have the Semiconductor Index  SOXX  ranked highly as well  You models really seem to like chip stocks right now  Thanks for sharing 
Conclusion 
Past performance is certainly no guarantee of future success  Secular market trends and technical trading conditions are always changing  It s important to pay attention to what the market is telling you  look for patterns in the issues presented  and then come up with an idea of what is going on and how to trade it  Because as Yogi Berra eloquently put it   the future ain t what it used to be

99698,321213,ADI,Analysts Estimate Analog Devices  ADI  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Analog Devices  NASDAQ ADI  reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 22  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This semiconductor maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 50 billion  down 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 47  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Analog Devices 
For Analog Devices  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Analog Devices will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Analog Devices would post earnings of  1 28 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 33  delivering a surprise of  3 91  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Analog Devices doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-analog-devices-adi-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200421708,200421708

99725,321240,ADI,Why Analog Devices  ADI  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Analog Devices  NASDAQ ADI   which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor   Analog and Mixed industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This semiconductor maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3 38  
For the last reported quarter  Analog Devices came out with earnings of  1 55 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 52 per share  representing a surprise of 1 97   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 46 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 53 per share  delivering a surprise of 4 79  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Analog Devices  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Analog Devices has an Earnings ESP of  0 14  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 20  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-analog-devices-adi-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200379561,200379561
99726,321241,ADI,The January Barometer Predicting Positive Year For S P 500,opinion,"S P 500The Standard and Poors 500 Index  SPX  has traded higher since December 26th and closed Friday at 2707  up 2 3  for the week  Monday and Tuesday of this week  together with most of last week  consisted of a sideways pause in this rally  but the last three days were very strong  including two gap openings higher  Trading volume in the S P 500 remains below average  as it has since December 26th  the beginning of this bullish run  Volume only exceeded the 50 DMA once this week  This suggests that the large institutions remain uncertain about this market 
Volatility  as measured by the S P 500 volatility index  VIX  declined for the last three days  closing Friday at 16 1   I normally think of 15  as the borderline before I become concerned  By that standard  we should remain cautious 
The Russell 2000 Index  RUT  broke through the resistance set by the February correction low at 1464 last Friday  1 25   and stayed solidly above that resistance level this week  Similar to the S P 500  Russell had strong positive days for the last three trading sessions  closing Friday at 1502  up 3 points 
The NASDAQ Composite index traded higher on Wednesday and Thursday  but was held back Friday by Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Traders were disappointed with Amazon s earnings announcement and weak forward guidance on Thursday evening  AMZN took it on the chin Friday  losing 92 dollars per share or 5 4   That resulted in the NASDAQ Composite trading weaker than the other broad market indices 
The market s recovery since December 26th has been impressive  The S P 500 has gained 15  since the opening on December 26th  But we should keep that gain in perspective  Today s level is equivalent to that of October 23rd  just before we tipped over to the October correction low on October 29th  In spite of our strong recovery in January  we remain about 8  below the highs in early October before the series of fall corrections began 
The January Barometer was developed by Yale Hirsch  creator of the Stock Trader s Almanac  and this indicator has an 88  record of success since 1950  The essence of the January Barometer is that the S P 500 index for the year will follow January s performance  Yesterday s close made it official with a 15  gain  the January Barometer is now in the books  predicting a positive year for the S P 500 in 2019  That would be a welcome prognosis after last year s 7  loss  However  traders remain concerned about continued political turmoil and the outcome of trade negotiations with China  Each day s market is subject to the latest news or even rumors of news  That makes it dangerous for traders 
I am focusing on stocks that have weathered the fall storm of corrections well  and are now trading well above their 50 and 200 day moving averages  For example  take a look at ADI  NASDAQ ADSK  NOW  PANW   and PAYC  I remain in a more conservative stance during this bullish run  When I can close trades with even modest gains  I am taking that opportunity  This is a nervous market  and so am I  Be cautious ",2019-02-02,Dr. Duke,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-january-barometer-200382950,200382950
99727,321242,ADI,Earnings Preview  Analog Devices  ADI  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Analog Devices  NASDAQ ADI  reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 20  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This semiconductor maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 28 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 51 billion  down 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 35  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Analog Devices 
For Analog Devices  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Analog Devices will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Analog Devices would post earnings of  1 52 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 55  delivering a surprise of  1 97  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Analog Devices doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-analog-devices-adi-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200387549,200387549

99759,321274,ADI,Analog Devices  ADI  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Analog Devices  NASDAQ ADI  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 20  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This semiconductor maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 52 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 57 billion  up 1 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Analog Devices 
For Analog Devices  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Analog Devices will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Analog Devices would post earnings of  1 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 53  delivering a surprise of  4 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Analog Devices doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analog-devices-adi-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200358786,200358786

 Adds Hewlett Packard  Analog Devices results 
 By Angela Moon
 NEW YORK  Aug 18  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Tuesday 
rebounding after sharp losses in the previous session  as
better than expected results from big retailers encouraged
investors to get back into the market 
 Results at consumer giants Home Depot Inc  Target Corp and
upscale department store operator Saks Inc were helped by
cost cutting as revenue growth remained slack  That trend has
dominated earnings season  but investors generally approved 
bidding stocks higher 
 The earnings reports offset an unexpected drop in housing
starts and permits in July  sending all three major indexes up
more than 1 percent in earlier trading 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 82 60 points  or
0 90 percent  at 9 217 94  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index was
up 9 94 points  or 1 01 percent  at 989 67  The Nasdaq
Composite Index was up 25 08 points  or 1 30 percent  at
1 955 92 
 On Monday  the S P 500  which is up nearly 50 percent since
its early March low  faced its steepest decline in seven weeks
after poor results from Lowe s  the No  2 U S  home improvement
chain  Analysts were quick to term the decline a start of a
market correction 
  Today was about the recovery from yesterday s sell off 
Lowe s was disappointing  and the market balanced that off with
Home Depot   said Marc Pado  U S  market strategist at Cantor
Fitzgerald   Co in San Francisco 
  It s a healthy cycle  attracting investors  We buy  then
we unwind the overbought condition while the market doesn t
give up ground so easily  
 Financial  retail and technology stocks were the top
advancers Tuesday  but gains were broad based 
 Mohamed El Erian  however  the chief executive of bond fund
manager Pacific Investment Management Co  told Reuters
Television on Tuesday that the rally in U S  stock markets has
topped out  as valuations are running ahead of fundamentals 
 The S P 500 financial sector index which suffered the most
in Monday s sell off  was up 1 92 percent 
 American Express Co gained 4 3 percent to  31 69 and Bank
of America closed up 2 1 percent at  16 90 
 Citigroup Inc rose 3 5 percent to  4 14 
 Home Depot shares rose 3 1 percent to  26 93 while its key
rival  Lowe s  dropped 2 3 percent to  19 99 following a
sell off the previous day on disappointing results 
 Target climbed 7 6 percent to  44 32 and Saks added 6 9
percent to  5 72  The S P retail index gained 1 8 percent 
 The Nasdaq outpaced the other indexes after RBC highlighted
investment opportunities in the smartphone market and raised
its price target on shares of Apple Inc  Research in Motion Ltd
and Palm Inc 
 Apple s shares climbed 2 8 percent to  164 01  RIM added
4 6 percent to  73 99 and Palm climbed 4 9 percent to  13 88 
 Hewlett Packard Co edged up 1 percent to  43 56 from its
closing price after the bellwether reported results after the

99893,321408,ADI,Hewlett Packard  HPE  Q1 Earnings  Disappointment In Store ,opinion,Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company   NYSE HPE   is set to report first quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 22  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this IT solution providing company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  Notably  Hewlett Packard Enterprise has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last two quarters  So  let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderThe acquisition of EMC Corporation  stylized as NYSE EMC  by Dell has been posing new challenges for Hewlett Packard Enterprise  With this acquisition  Dell has become one of the major players in the cloud services and data storage market  EMC offers data storage  information security  virtualization  analytics  cloud computing  and other products and services that enable businesses to store  manage  protect  and analyze data Additionally  VMware   NYSE VMW   was EMC s subsidiary that focuses on cloud and virtualization software and services for its parent company  Therefore  the acquisition of EMC  along with its privately controlled structure  will provide Dell an unmatched scale  strength and flexibility to deepen its relationships with customers of all sizes Apart from this  it also seems that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is losing market share to Dell in the server shipment  Notably  according to IDC  during third quarter 2017  Dell managed to drastically narrow down the server shipment market share difference with Hewlett Packard Enterprise  chiefly benefiting from  the strong synergy between its server team and the storage team incorporated from the EMC acquisition  This happened mainly because Hewlett Packard Enterprise is now focusing on enterprise market and  pivoting away  from the firm s hyperscaler business  which has been denting its short term revenues  We believe this strategy will hurt Hewlett Packard Enterprise s to be reported quarter s revenues Since its split from HP Inc    NYSE HPQ    Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been focusing on restructuring and realigning the company s businesses to drive long term sustainable growth and improvise margins  In doing so  the company has spun off its Software and Enterprise Services business  The spin offs will surely result in an unfavorable year over year comparison  which means disappointing top  as well bottom line results for the fiscal first quarter Moreover  Hewlett Packard Enterprise  in its previous earnings conference calls  had hinted that the company might continue to shrink with spin offs  However  in our opinion  the company s contrarian strategy might be in the right direction but the turnaround is still far behind as we haven t seen any significant improvement in the recently reported financial results  We also consider that the company is still struggling to determine its true business focus Also  we consider that the company s to be reported quarterly results will bear the brunt of the three main challenges it is currently facing   competitive pricing  heightened commodities pricing pressure and some dilution from M A  These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term What the Zacks Model Unveils Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Hewlett Packard Enterprise currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   Notably  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 23 cents  representing a year over year plunge of 48 9   Additionally  analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly  7 03 billion  down a massive 38 4  from the year ago quarter Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise   A Stock With Favorable CombinationHere is a company which  as per our model  has the right combination of elements

99894,321409,ADI,New Products  Buyouts To Drive Palo Alto  PANW  Q2 Earnings,opinion,Palo Alto Networks  Inc    NYSE PANW   is slated to release second quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 26  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this cybersecurity company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  Notably  the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 9 5   So  let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 79 cents  representing year over year growth of 25 4   We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days  Additionally  analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly  524 4 million  up 24 3  from the year ago quarter Let s take a look at the driving factors this quarter  Factors to ConsiderPalo Alto is growing rapidly in the cybersecurity space on the back of its innovative next generation security platforms  The company s security platforms have innovative traffic classification engine which helps it identify network traffic by application  user and content  As a result  organizations have in depth visibility into all traffic and applications  helping the firms control usage  content  risks and cyber threats at the user level Therefore  Palo Alto s security platforms simplify security infrastructure for organizations by eliminating the need for multiple  stand alone security appliances and software products  This reduces the total cost of ownership  in turn  giving a competitive edge to the organization Furthermore  over the last two years  the company has launched several subscription based products  including WildFire  AutoFocus  Aperture  Traps and Virtual  which have been witnessing strong adoption among organizations The company s innovative product portfolio and continued efforts to enhance the same with advanced features helps Palo Alto win new deals  Notably  during first quarter fiscal 2018  the company added more than 2 500 customers  bringing the total to more than 45 000 worldwide  It should be noted that in each of the last 23 quarters  Palo Alto has added at least 1 000 customers The company s to be reported quarterly result is likely to add a sizable number of new customers  which  in turn  will drive Palo Alto s top line Furthermore  acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of Palo Alto to enhance its product portfolio as well as expand the company s global reach  Last year  the company acquired LightCyber for  105 million  which expanded its Next Generation Security Platform  Over the

99896,321411,ADI,Analog Devices And Dine Brands  Growth   Income Buys ,opinion,"In this week s video I discuss two companies that recently reported better than expected earnings results  and that have continued upside going into the next quarter   They are Analog Devices  ADI   and Dine Brands Global  DIN  
Analog Devices   NASDAQ ADI   is a world leader in the design  manufacture and marketing of a broad portfolio of high performance analog  mixed signal  and digital signal processing  DSP  integrated circuits  ICs  used in virtually all types of electronic equipment  Since their inception in 1965  they have focused on solving the engineering challenges associated with signal processing in electronic equipment  Used by over 100 000 customers worldwide  their signal processing products play a fundamental role in converting  conditioning  and processing real world phenomena such as temperature  pressure  sound  light  speed  and motion into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of electronic devices 
ADI announced earnings on February 28th  where they easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the 14th consecutive quarter   On a year over year basis  the company posted  51 1  earnings growth and  54 4  revenue growth   During the quarter the company saw continued strong demand for analog semiconductors which helped all segments post revenues above expectations  Further  the Linear Technology  NASDAQ LLTC  acquisition in March of 2017 has helped reduce overall costs  and aided the bottom line results during the quarter 
Due to the continued success in the semiconductor sector  and the strong outlook for the sector going forward  management gave better than expected guidance for Q2 18  they now expect revenues to come in between  1 43 1 51 billion  above the previous expectation of  1 43 billion  and EPS to be between  1 30 1 44  ahead of the previous expectation of  1 24  
To add to the impressive earnings report  the Board of Directors approved a  7  increase in its quarterly dividend bringing the quarterly payment to  0 48  or  1 92 on an annual basis for an annual dividend yield of  2 1   
These positive announcements caused B  Riley FBR Inc  to raise its target price from  113 to  122 
As you can see in the Price and Earnings Consensus graph below  ADI has been on an upwards trend since the beginning of 2016 Analog Devices  Inc  Price and Consensus   
Due to the earnings report being so recent  there have not been any analysts estimate revisions  but this should change over the next several days  
Dine Brands Global   NYSE DIN    previously known as DineEquity  Inc   was created from a foundation established by IHOP   an American icon to their guests and a franchising company focused on providing strategic  visionary leadership for their franchisees  unparalleled opportunities for our team members  and enhancing value for their shareholders  By bringing Applebee s together with IHOP  they made a bold  new commitment to their brand revitalization abilities and to the power of franchising  DineEquity has successfully made their two businesses more powerful and more successful than either brand could have been apart 
Dine Brands Global also recently reported earnings where they beat both top and bottom line expectations   The big take away from the report was the improved success in the Applebee s segment which was due to its value offerings  and advertising strategies that have progressed faster than expected   This operational execution turnaround saw comparable same restaurant sales improve by  1 3   and caused management to increase FY 18 comp sales expectations  flat to  3 0      The success of Applebee s is also expected to improve royalty collections in 2018  
Further  the long term outlook has significantly improved under new CEO Steve Joyce who has a solid track record of operating multi brand companies  and franchise models   He and his management team introduced a 5 year plan which includes  sustaining positive comparable same restaurant sales  unit growth domestically for the IHOP franchise  expected to open between 85 100 restaurants in 2018   cost management measures  dividend payments with a 35 45  payout ratio of adjusted free cash flows  and new acquisitions  
The earnings report and future goals set by management caused the stock price to jump up by over  16    The graph below shows the huge improvement in the stock price and future earnings estimates DineEquity  Inc Price and Consensus   
To add to the positive news  the company also pays a big  5 1  annual dividend yield   So we have a solid turnaround story  with a very nice dividend

99922,321437,ADI,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Alphabet  SMART Global  Analog Devices And Mellanox Technologies,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 22  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Alphabet Inc  s   NASDAQ GOOGL   SMART Global Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ SGH    Analog Devices  Inc    NASDAQ ADI   and Mellanox Technologies  Ltd    NASDAQ MLNX   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Google Signs Patent Licensing Deal with TencentAlphabet Inc  s division Google recently signed a patent licensing deal with Tencent Holdings Ltd in an attempt to find ways to grow in China  the second largest economy  where many of its products have been discontinued The cross licensing deal with Chinese social media and gaming firm  Tencent will allow the companies to come together and create new technologies  Though Google hasn t disclosed the scope and financial terms of the patent deal but it covers a wide range of products Google has entered into similar agreements before with companies like Samsung Electronics  KS 005930   LG Electronics and Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO    However  this is the first time that it has collaborated with a large Chinese technology firm  According to Google  such agreements reduce the possibility of litigation on patent infringement Google s head of patents  Mike Lee said   By working together on agreements such as this  tech companies can focus on building better products and services for their users  Notably  shares of Alphabet have gained 37 1  in the past 12 months  outperforming the 26 8  rally of the it belongs to Why this Deal Despite a strict Chinese policy that imposes restrictions on foreign firms  including censorship  the search giant has been trying to rebuild its presence in the market Google has undertaken many initiatives like sharing its artificial intelligence software  investing in local projects like AI research lab and introducing a version of its translation app to get back to business with China We believe Tencent will turn out to be a key ally for Google as it operates China s widely used social media and payments app  WeChat and its most famous app store  Tencent is also quite famous for hosting the largest gaming and livestream platforms in the country  With Tencent s push  the tech giant can make its way into China Why is China Important for Google Google has had a bad history with China  Since 2010  Google s search engine has been banned in the Chinese market along with its app store  email and cloud storage services  The company is losing a lot of revenues because of these restrictions When Google exited China back in 2010  the company had 36  share of search advertising and online ad spending was  3 7 billion  During that period  the company used to generate roughly  300 million every year from China  Since its exit  total ad spending in China has skyrocketed  Last year  ad spending in China was  84 4 billion  according to WPP  LON WPP  s GroupM Owing to the ban on Google Play  the company is missing out on potential revenues too  According to App Annie  Chinese consumer spending on applications is ballooning up  People spent nearly  35 billion on apps in 2017 and this aggressive growth is expected to continue in the upcoming years Clearly  Google doesn t want to miss out this opportunity  The Information reported that the company has plans to introduce a censored version of Play Store in China by partnering with a Chinese company  Netease  This shows how keen the search giant is to get back to China Zacks Rank   Stocks to

items  of 82 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2017  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents but remained flat year over year Revenues increased 7 2  year over year and 5 3  sequentially to  237 6 million  primarily driven by strong adoption of the company s 25 gigabit per second and above Ethernet switch business  Also  revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  235 million  Additionally  increased adoption and enhanced performance of Mellanox s products aided the top line Moreover  adoption of 100 Gigabit EDR solutions in machine learning  artificial intelligence  high performance computing  database and storage contributed toward revenue growth  Also  InfiBand s adoption aided Mellanox to continue its leadership position in the high performance interconnects space We note that shares of Mellanox have gained 50 6  in the last year  outperforming the Zacks   rally of 33   Revenue DetailsIn fourth quarter 2017  InfiniBand revenues were  102 million  which increased 1 9  sequentially driven by growth from the company s high performance computing and artificial intelligent customers  InfiniBand based products contributed 43  of total revenues during the quarter  Mellanox was selected by a tier 1 U S   Original Equipment Manufacturer  OEM in order to supply 25 gigabit per second Ethernet adapters  Users are selecting Mellanox due to the robustness and feature advantages of its ConnectX solutions over its peers  products Ethernet revenues grew 73  on a year over year basis and sequentially 11   driven by significant increase in customer demand for the company s 2550 and 100 gigabit per second Ethernet Solutions The transition to 25 gigabit  50 gigabit and 100 gigabit Ethernet will help Mellanox to post multi year growth across various sectors such as cloud  storage  hyperscale and machine learning However  management decided to discontinue its 1550 nanometer silicon photonics development activities as the business did not generate profits  Moreover it believes that this decision will not have an impact on the company s revenues going forward The company started shipping BlueField chips during the quarter  resulting from EZchip acquisition  which has been experiencing increased market traction Operating ResultsNon GAAP gross margin was 68 8   which declined 310 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis  primarily due to lower margin product Non GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at  125 4 million  up 9  year over year  R D expenses increased 9 9  year over year  Sales and marketing expenses increased 9   General and administrative expenses increased 4   Non GAAP operating income was  38 million  which declined 14 3  year over year  Non GAAP operating margins came in at

quarter Inventory was  64 7 million  up from  61 6 million reported in the last quarter GuidanceMellanox expects first quarter 2018 revenues to be in the range of  222 million to  232 million  The company is well positioned to reap the benefits of the release of BlueField system chips as well as introduction of 200 gigabit per second Infiniband and Ethernet products  The Zacks Consensus

gross margin is expected in the range of 68  and 69   Moreover  Non GAAP operating margin is to be in the range of 18  to 19  Our TakeMellanox reported stellar fourth quarter results  and provided an encouraging first quarter and fiscal 2018 revenue guidance  We believe the transition from 40 gigabit to 50 gigabit and 100 gigabit and introduction of 200 gigabit Ethernet solutions augur well for the company given growing demand for such products Also  new design wins for Spectrum products is likely to benefit the company Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderMellanox sports a Zacks Rank  1

99967,321482,ADI,What s In Store For TE Connectivity  TEL  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,TE Connectivity Ltd    NYSE TEL   is scheduled to report first quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 24 TE Connectivity has an excellent earnings surprise history  with an average positive surprise of 9 7  in the trailing four quarters  The company recorded its eight consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter  surpassing estimates by 7 8   In the quarter to be reported  the company is expected to report strong revenues in Transportation Solutions business  which constitutes more than half of its total revenues We expect TE Connectivity to score an earnings beat in the to be reported quarter Why a Likely Positive Surprise  Our proven model shows that TE Connectivity has the right combination of the two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is perfectly the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  TE Connectivity has an Earnings ESP of  0 26   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  TE Connectivity Ltd  Price and EPS Surprise   Zacks Rank  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions Factors Driving the Better than Expected ResultsTE Connectivity is now poised to grow on the back of strong demand in end markets  along with its overarching business model and continued progress on strategic priorities  The company s Commercial transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress  driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market  especially in China  Growth in electronic content and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for its transportation business  Additionally  the sensor business is anticipated to see strong design win momentum  fueled by the growth of automotive space  which is likely to prove conductive to upcoming results Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Transportation Solutions segment in the to be reported quarter currently remains high at  1 867 million compared with fiscal fourth quarter revenues of  1 844 million  However  revenues from Industrial Solutions segment are anticipated to be low sequentially  with an estimate of  869 million compared with reported revenues of  954 million in the prior quarter Moreover  being a market leader in the connectivity and sensor business  the company is armed with a comprehensive portfolio that supplements its strength  About 80  of the company s revenues are driven by harsh environment applications  Over the past five years  its harsh business applications have experienced mid single digit growth  driving top line growth  Going forward  we believe that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion This apart  the company s ardent eye for acquisitions is anticipated to be conducive to core business  going forward  The company s buyout of MicroGroup and agreement to acquire Hirschmann Car Communication enhanced its harsh environment portfolio and are expected to drive first quarter fiscal sales as well However  primarily dependent on end market dynamics the company s business is subject to cyclical risks that the end markets suffer  Though the company has witnessed some stability in direct business with OEMs  poor sales through distribution channels are taking longer than expected recovery time  consequently hurting segmental performance  Additionally  the company s weakness in commercial transportation market due to weak global construction and agriculture markets  along with weakness in the North America heavy truck markets  have been adding to woesFurther  sluggishness in oil and gas markets and its derivative impact on other industrial markets will likely act as strong headwinds for the company  Also  helicopter demand has also been impacted adversely  which can prove to be a drag on the company s aerospace business  This apart  the company believes the supply chain inefficiencies can prove to be a drag on the earnings in the quarter under review Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Analog Devices  Inc    NASDAQ ADI   has an Earnings ESP of  0 96  and a Zacks Rank  1   You can see AMTEK  Inc    NYSE AME   has an Earnings ESP of  0 12  and a Zacks Rank  2 Harris

Our Take
SAP s resilient Cloud and Software business  an enviable business network spread and dominance over critical client demand areas continue to act as staple growth drivers  The company s S 4HANA has proved to be a solid profit yielder  fueled by an increase in cloud subscriptions as well as support revenue rise in recent times 
Also  SAP s new class of solutions that power the next generation of business applications   SAP HANA   has been its biggest top line driver ever since its introduction  The company s latest offering from the SAP HANA family  S 4HANA  has established itself as a mission critical control center for businesses pursuing digital transformation  This apart  the company constantly upgrades the existing products and launches new ones to expand its customer base  thereby offering a competitive edge over peers 
However  dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters along with flat customer spending projections have affected the company s performances  Also  over the past few quarters  many of the company s emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances besides general economic slowdowns  which have adversely impacted the consumers  purchasing power  Currency fluctuations in many of the company s key markets are also hurting its financial performance

The company also anticipates its Adjusted EBITA margin to improve around 100 basis points this year Our TakeIn the past couple of years  Philips has successfully evolved from a lighting company into a

investors  The company also believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will drive future growth Further  the company is highly optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis

100136,321651,ADI,Analog Devices  ADI  Aids Agriculture Development Project,opinion,"Analog Devices  Inc    NASDAQ ADI   is collaborating with The Cornucopia Project and ripe io to aid crop quality  yield and profitability enhancement initiatives 
The Cornucopia Project is a Peterborough  NH based nonprofit organization that conducts agricultural and garden projects for students from elementary to high school 
San Francisco  CA based ripe io focuses on integrating Blockchain consisting of a framework of distributed ledgers  application program interface  API   Internet of Things  IoT  and sensors  and connected food supply chain workflow with the food system 
We observe that Analog Devices shares have rallied 9 2  year to date  underperforming the  s gain of 15 2  

Deal Details
The collaboration aims to train students and farmers on how to monitor crop quality as they move from  Farm to Fork   thus facilitating improved decision making  While financing will be done by all three  Analog Devices and ripe io are in charge of technical training 
Most importantly  Analog Devices will make available a prototype version of its crop monitoring solution for use in the project  It is a sensor to cloud  IoT solution that boosts farmers with improved decision making on the basis of collected knowledge from near real time monitoring 
ripe io  on the other hand  is providing its block chain technology aiming to develop a fresh produce supply chain with farmers  suppliers  distributors  retailers  food service and end consumers 
Kevin Carlin  Vice President  Automation  Energy and Sensors at Analog Devices stated that the project is an expansion of the company s  Internet of Tomatoes  program that aims at improving farmers  decision making on farming cycle and quality of produce 
Analog Devices  Inc  Revenue  TTM 
   Our Take
We believe the move is intended to increase the popularity of Analog Devices  crop monitoring solution offering 
Funding training projects does initially act as a drain on cash balance and weighs on margins but can be fruitful in the long term if used tactfully  Given that Analog Devices has a strong market position across industrial  communications infrastructure and consumer markets  moves like this could help it attract new customers and keep the existing ones hooked on its services 
The company has been strengthening its balance sheet  expanding margins and improving cash generation capacity through continued focus on product innovation  This is required especially when it s increasingly facing tough competition from the likes of Texas Instruments   NASDAQ TXN    Maxim Integrated Products   NASDAQ MXIM   and Broadcom Limited   NASDAQ AVGO

  Free Cash Flow per Share Growth   Analog Devices  FCF has been lower than that of its competitors over the last year  That s not good for investors  In general  if a company is growing its FCF  it will be able to pay down debt  buy back stock  pay out more in dividends and or invest money back into the business to help boost growth  It s one of our most important fundamental factors

	Along with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  to make the strategy foolproof Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20    Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average   Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued  
	These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only four 
	Here are the stocks that made it through the screen

100211,321726,ADI,5 Semiconductor Stocks That Warrant A Closer Look,opinion,"Much has been said about semiconductor stocks lately  with some of the opinion that the secular growth drivers will continue to push them up and others taking the more cautious approach that such appreciation may be risky because they are already fully valued  Neither position can be completely ruled out  But it may be worthwhile to drill down a little deeper to identify the names that still have upside potential 
And what better way than to start with than the Zacks Industry Rank  which is based on the philosophy that about half of a stock s price movement can be attributed to the group  sub industry  that it s in  In fact  Zacks studies have shown that the top 50  of Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
So today  we are going to take a closer look at the   which is in the top 10  of Zacks ranked industries 
The group has slightly outperformed the S P 500  having appreciated 5 5  compared to the 4 8  for the S P 500 
Sector revenues have grown in each of the last four years with the jump in 2016 being particularly high  up 31 4    Gross profit  up 26 3  in 2016  and net income before non recurring items  up 16 4   show similar trends  However  the industry is investing heavily in R D and SG A  up 65 0  in 2016 although moving both ways in preceding years  and unlike in the past  it s tapping into the debt market to do it  interest expenses are up 134 5  in 2016 and up double digits in each of the three preceding years 
A quarterly cross section shows revenues rising steadily from the Sep 2015 quarter  Gross profit dipped in the Mar 2016 quarter but barring that one quarter shows a rising trend from Dec 2014  Net income before non recurring items has risen since Mar 2016  As with the annual trend  the quarterly performance shows rising operating expenses and capex spend  using depreciation as a proxy   as well as rising interest rates 
If you add the above data to secular growth drivers like machine learning  artificial intelligence  self driving cars  IoT  industrial and medical technology  drones  the list is almost never ending   it s clear that this is a growth segment  So while momentum trading opportunities may be there in some cases  they may not be what value buyers are looking for

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
Analog Devices delivered better than expected results for the third quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts  These strong results were driven by a strong consumer market  which offset relatively weak industrial  auto and communication markets 
In 2015  the company successfully incorporated Hittite and expanded the available opportunities  It expects to deliver strong revenue synergies starting 2017 
Analog Devices will acquire Linear Technology  NASDAQ LLTC  in a cash and stock deal worth  14 8 billion  The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017   It will make Analog Devices an industry leader across a huge range of products  customer breadth and scale  The deal will help it to grow significantly in industrial  automotive and communications infrastructure markets 
The transaction is anticipated to be immediately accretive to the company s bottom line results  In addition  the company expects annualized cost synergies of  150 million within the first 18 months following the completion of the transaction 
While its investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and countering increasing competition  the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will ensure investor loyalty 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  management expects revenues in a range of  910 million to  970 million  On a non GAAP basis  the company estimates gross margin of approximately 65 5   operating expenses to be slightly up sequentially  interest and other expense of about  20 million  tax rate of approximately 12  and earnings per share in a range of 84 94 cents 
On a GAAP basis  the company estimates earnings per share in a range of 78 88 cents

100248,321763,ADI,Analog Devices  ADI  Buys Laser Technology To Boost LIDAR,opinion,"Leading semiconductor company Analog Devices  Inc    NASDAQ ADI   has acquired a solid state laser beam steering technology from Vescent Photonics  Inc 
Founded in 2002  privately held Golden  CO based Vescent Photonics develops and manufactures electro optic and laser technologies 
Vescent Photonics  non mechanical beam steering technology can eliminate issues of reliability  high cost and large size associated with mechanical Light Imaging  Detection  And Ranging  LIDAR  systems 
What s Retaining Analog Devices  Interest 
Analog found this innovative technology appealing as it has a number of LIDAR and Radio Detection And Ranging  RADAR  based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems  ADAS  in its product portfolio 
LIDAR  RADAR and cameras are sensor technologies that today s ADAS systems are increasingly using to provide advanced safety features like forward collision warning  pedestrian detection  blind spot detection and autonomous driving mode 
LIDAR adds distance measurement and object recognition features to vehicles  Scanning LIDAR systems can sense objects on or near the roadway  and use RADAR and cameras to fill blind spots 
ANALOG DEVICES Price
   Our Take 
We see this acquisition as part of Analog Devices  ongoing investments in products for the automotive market  mainly because the electronic content in automobiles  particularly in the safety and infotainment areas  is on the rise 
The Automotive electronics market continues to gain on the back of consumer demand for added technology and features in new vehicles and the transition to hybrid and electric vehicles 
Government mandated requirements that all new vehicles be equipped with better safety features and environmental controls is also an important growth driver  Further  the fact that safety devices are moving from high end to mainstream vehicles is a positive for the company   
Management s continuous collaboration with innovative brands  development of new technology along with strengthening in Europe and China should benefit the company  We expect the company to leverage its already strong market position to foray deeper into the automotive market

   Our Take
Analog Devices delivered better than expected results for the third quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and the bottom line  These strong results were driven by a strong consumer market which offset relatively weak industrial  auto and communication markets 
In 2015  the company successfully incorporated Hittite and expanded the available opportunities  It expects to deliver strong revenue synergies starting 2017 
Analog Devices will acquire Linear Technology  NASDAQ LLTC  in a cash and stock deal worth  14 8 billion  The acquisition will make Analog Devices an industry leader across a huge range of products  customer breadth and scale  The deal will help it to grow significantly in industrial  automotive  and communications infrastructure markets 
The transaction is anticipated to be immediately accretive to the company s bottom line results  In addition  the company expects annualized cost synergies of  150 million within the first 18 months post transaction completion 
The company is investing heavily in the health sector and working with several of the world s leading research institutions and system OEMs to improve performance  impact and affordability of medical electronics devices  Primary focus areas within this segment include care imaging applications and clinical grade vital signs monitoring

100344,321859,ADI,Synopsys  SNPS  Q3 Earnings  Can The Stock Surprise ,opinion,"Synopsys Inc    NASDAQ SNPS   is set to report third quarter fiscal 2016 results on Aug 17  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 37 50   Notably  the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 18 84  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation  EDA  software to the semiconductor and electronics industries  We believe that the company s recent product launches  acquisitions and deal wins will boost third quarter results 
Moreover  the unique intellectual properties and global support provided by Synopsys will likely drive the upcoming results  Additionally  the company s acquisitions  such as those of Gold Standard Simulations  Simpleware and Coverity  have expanded its capabilities and customer base  which are expected to aid results in the to be reported quarter 
However  intense competition  a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty on the proper time to realize acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines SYNOPSYS INC Price and EPS Surprise
    
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys will beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 43 cents  Hence  the difference is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  Although Synopsys  Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  its 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum

Twenty eight years ago today  the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed  a one day loss of 508 points  or 22 6   down to 1 738 on what is now referred to as Black Monday  It was by far the largest one day percentage drop in US stock market history 
China s economy grew 6 9  in the third quarter from a year ago  beating forecasts for 6 8  growth  The results add to doubts the country can meet its year end GDP target of about 7   and raises pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus measures following a summer stock market plunge and devaluation of the yuan  Most China analysts also feel the GDP number is fictional  probably more like 3  than 6 9   but it s still the slowest growth since 2009  China has been cutting its holdings of US Treasuries for the first time since 2001  but so far demand remains strong from other foreign investors and American investors 
Last month  Chinese President Xi Jingping visited Washington and an agreement was announced that China and the US would refrain from cyberattacks by each country on the other or on companies domiciled in the respective countries  Yeah  not so much  Security services provider  Crowdstrike  reports it has tracked a number of attacks on American tech and pharmaceutical companies leading up to and after President Xi s visit to the US  including the 3 weeks since Washington and Beijing signed the cybersecurity agreement

Sustained gains in the dollar will come from a more defined increase in hopes for a December Fed rate hike  In other words  while the ECB might jawbone markets for more easing  the Fed might jawbone markets for a rate hike  That could come from a more hawkish Fed at next week s Federal Open Market Committee meeting or a solid uptick in payrolls for October and November 
The National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo housing market index rose 3 points to 64  the highest level since the same month of 2005  The index measuring sales expectations in the next six months rose seven points to 75  and the component gauging current sales conditions increased three points to 70  The index on buyer traffic held steady at 47

Police have raided Volkswagen s main offices in France as part of an investigation into the automaker s cheating on diesel emissions tests  The move suggests VW s legal troubles are spreading across Europe as similar searches have already been carried out at the company s headquarters in Italy and Germany  On Friday  Volkswagen  DE VOWG  reported its group sales fell 1 5  in September  although the larger impact from its scandal will likely be reflected in the sales volume of October

100405,321920,ADI,Buy The Chilli Dip In Analog Devices,opinion,"Many stock price charts show a slow grinding pullback that started in November and picked up steam into December before accelerating into January  From that point they made a bottom into mid February and started higher  This price action resembles a ladle or as I prefer one of those new chips specially made for picking up dip 
I don t know if some classical technician has a name for this pattern but I call it a chilli dip  And it is a buy signal  Below is an example of a chilli dip in Analog Devices  NASDAQ ADI   The chart shows that roll over that accelerated into the bottom and has now rounded up and breaking resistance  The move over 54 Tuesday is the trigger 

The momentum has been supportive of this reversal ever since mid January  That is when first the RSI turned higher and then the MACD followed  Both are now bullish and continue higher  The Bollinger Bands  could still open a bit to make the case more broadly for more upside  The ride may extend for some time or end shortly  I don t know  But the next real area for some resistance looks to be at about 58 then 61  So why not try some chilli dip for a possible 10  gain

100434,321949,ADI,A Company Stuck At The Bottom Of Its Industry,opinion,"The semiconductor industry continues to grow rapidly and there are new uses emerging for these products on an almost daily basis  But not all semiconductor stocks are the same  This week we re focusing on a company that is struggling to survive in this competitive industry  Intersil Corporation  NASDAQ ISIL 
Intersil designs and develops power management and precision analog integrated circuits  The company offers power integrated circuit chips for battery management  processor power management  and display power management  Intersil s products can be divided into industrial and infrastructure products  64  of revenue   consumer products  16  of revenue   and computing products  21  of revenue  
Growth is Long Gone
Intersil  which went public in early 2000  is a tech bubble company still struggling to find its way  It should be noted that the company grew after tax cash flow  NOPAT  from   34 million to  141 million and return on invested capital  ROIC  from  6  to 8  from 2001 to 2006   certainly an impressive feat  Since 2006  however  the company has entered a downward spiral  and the stock  while down 45  since 2006  still has a lot of room to fall 
Since 2006  NOPAT has declined by 30  compounded annually while ROIC has fallen from the aforementioned 8  to just 0  in 2014 
Figure 1 shows Intersil s long term downward trend in profitability 
Figure 1  No Growth  No Profitability

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
We think the main reason for the past decline in Intersil s profitability is its fluctuating strategy  In 2003  the company divested its wireless business and switched its focus to becoming a high performance analog and mixed signal company by acquiring Elantec in 2002  Since then  Intersil has acquired eight other businesses in the segment  each with the aim of strengthening the new core business  This reckless acquisition strategy led to Intersil having over 60 different product lines meeting any number of clients  needs 
This strategy proved to be a losing one  and Intersil again switched focus in 2013 to integrated power management and precision analog integrated circuits  Its goal is to market its entire portfolio of integrated circuit products to industrial and infrastructure markets  mobile markets  and automotive and aerospace markets  However  Intersil s shifting strategies have resulted in five consecutive years of revenue decline  This decline is continuing into 2015  as Intersil reported a revenue decline of 4  year over year in 1Q15 
Intersil s pretax margins over the past five years have fallen from 17  to 6  in 2014   have also been negative every year since IPO  indicating that Intersil has yet to generate any true value for its shareholders 
These Adjustments Reveal Intersil s Recurring Profitability
To reveal how Intersil reported net income growth from  2 million in 2013 to  54 million in 2014  we must look deeper into the company s 10 K 
In 2013  the company understated earnings by taking some unusual charges to set up for a good comp in 2014 
Nearly  29 million in non recurring restructuring charges
 6 million in provisions for a one time compliance settlement
Removing these one time non operating expenses revealed that Intersil s 2013 profit was much higher  a NOPAT of  35 million versus reported net income of just  2 million
Conversely  2014 s NOPAT was much lower than Intersil s reported net income of  54 million 
In 2014  Intersil failed to disclose any inventory reserves in section  Schedule II  on page 66 of its 10 K  In 2013  the company reported inventory reserves at  47 million  The lack of disclosure is odd given that Intersil has reported an inventory reserve on every 10 K dating back to 2001 
We removed this  change  in inventory reserves from net income  revealing a 2014 NOPAT of only  8 million  well below the company s reported  54 million GAAP net income 
Weak Competitor  Less Resources
Intersil competes with other large analog integrated circuit manufacturers such as Linear Technology Corp   NASDAQ LLTC   Analog Devices  NASDAQ ADI   Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  and others  Figure 2 shows how Intersil stacks up with this competition in terms of ROIC and profit margins 
Figure 2  At the Bottom of the industry

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Note that Intersil is at the bottom of the list in terms of ROIC with a paltry 0   The second thing to note is just how poor Intersil s pre tax margins are compared to other industry competitors  How can Intersil compete when it has margins already significantly below those of its competitors 
Valuation Ignores Current State of the Business
Despite the poor health of its business  Intersil s stock price is up over 71  in the past two years  This appreciation has led the stock to become extremely overvalued 
To justify its current valuation of  13 share  Intersil would need to grow NOPAT by over 24  compounded annually for the next 28 years 
Seeing as Intersil s profits have declined by 45  compounded annually since 2010 we think this level of solid  sustained growth is unlikely  Similarly  since 2001  Intersil has not seen sustained NOPAT growth for even two consecutive years  yet the company s valuation implies nearly three decades of sustained growth 
If Intersil can instead grow profits by an overly optimistic 12  compounded annually for the next 15 years  the stock is worth  3 share  a 74  downside from current levels 
Dividend is Costly
Intersil currently offers a small  0 48 annual dividend  which represents a 3 6  yield  and with over 131 million shares outstanding  uses up over  62 million in capital 
 These Catalysts Make ISIL Far Too Dangerous
The first potential threat to ISIL s stock price is further litigation issues  Intersil was ruled to have infringed on certain patents  and to have breached contract and misappropriated trade secrets in early 2015  The jury ruled that the company must pay  59 million  and ISIL is setting aside  80 million in provisions for any future settlements in this case  The semiconductor industry is filled with patent litigation and any rulings like this will only further hurt the company s financial position 
The second catalyst comes from Intersil s competitors  which have significantly more resources than Intersil  This leaves little room for error in relation to Intersil  as opportunities are more valuable and mistakes more costly for the company 
Insiders Not Selling  But Also Not Buying
In the past six months  insiders have bought zero shares and sold 5 417 shares  representing less than 1  of net shares sold 
Short Interest
Short interest stands at 4 8 million shares  or nearly 4  of shares outstanding 
Stupid Money Risk
With a market cap of only  1 8 billion and no long term debt  along with the hot acquisition climate in the semiconductor industry  Intersil could be a takeover target  making a short of this company risky 
Executive Compensation
In addition to their annual salary  Intersil s executives have a short term bonus as well as a long term compensation plan  Short term bonuses are cash distributions paid to executives upon the company meeting desired operating margin  gross margin  or revenue performance goals 
The long term compensation plans on the other hand consist of a performance based market stock unit program  time based stock options  and deferred stock units  The performance based plan is tied directly to ISIL s stock price return relative to the S P Semiconductors Select Industry  If the stock return ranks within the 50th percentile of the peer group  executives receive 100  of the planned equity compensation  Similarly  stock options and deferred stock units are given and grow in value as the ISIL s price increases  further incentivizing executives to ensure the stock price grows by any means necessary
