32370,253885,NS,Exclusive  PDVSA blocked from using NuStar terminal over unpaid bills,news,"By Marianna Parraga HOUSTON  Reuters    Venezuela s state run petroleum firm PDVSA has been barred from using a NuStar Energy  N NS  oil storage terminal in the Caribbean over  26 million in unpaid bills  according to documents reviewed by Reuters  halting delivery of a cargo to an oil trader   The suspension was triggered when PDVSA missed a payment for use of NuStar s Statia facility on the island of St  Eustatius  according to company documents viewed by Reuters    We should not load this cargo   wrote NuStar Vice President James Calvert in response to a loading request  according to one document   NuStar s refusal to retrieve the oil over what amounts to nearly a year s worth of monthly fees shows how recurring legal and trade disputes are disrupting PDVSA s ability to deliver its oil to foreign customers  which generate more than 90 percent of the country s export revenue   Shipping delays and quality concerns also are jeopardizing the OPEC member country s crude sales  the lifeblood of its troubled economy  The suspension comes months after PDVSA had expanded its NuStar storage contract following a payment dispute with Buckeye Partners  N BPL  over a Bahamas storage facility  Both U S  firms operate key transit hubs for companies that move oil through the Caribbean  NuStar declined to comment  PDVSA did not respond to a request to comment  NuStar s refusal and other details of PDVSA s payment problems emerged after trader Trafigura  TRAFG UL  sought to load a cargo of Venezuelan oil held at Statia  Trafigura was the winner of a court ordered auction of the heavy crude intended to help resolve a separate billing dispute between PDVSA and units of Russian state run conglomerate Sovcomflot    Trafigura declined to comment on the auction or whether it expects to receive the cargo  Sovcomflot also declined to comment   NuStar first sought fees for the stored oil from PDVSA  On Oct  10  after receiving no response from the Venezuelan firm  NuStar sent a  287 500 invoice to Sigma Navigation  a unit of Sovcomflot  NuStar offered to allow the oil to be loaded by Oct  20 if payment was made before that date  That request led to a series of exchanges between representatives of the three companies  In one  a law firm representing Sigma alerted PDVSA s lawyers that its client was willing to pay the NuStar bill but reserved the right to seek repayment as part of the broader claim  according to documents   Sigma s lawyers also revealed in emails that  according to its talks with NuStar  the U S  firm was claiming PDVSA owed it another  26 million for accumulated unpaid Statia storage fees   LONG TRIP The tangled story of the oil cargo at the heart of the dispute began a year ago  when PDVSA sent 550 000 barrels of crude oil to St  Eustatius on tanker NS Columbus rented from Sovcomflot  The oil had been sold to Norway s  Statoil   OL STL   which planned to retrieve it at Statia  Before it could get there  Sovcomflot had a St  Maarten court freeze the delivery in hopes of collecting partial payment for shipping fees unpaid by PDVSA  Five months after crossing the Caribbean  the court ordered the tanker to discharge its cargo at Statia   Trafigura s attempts to obtain the oil first were delayed due to force majeure declared by NuStar due to Hurricane Irma  and later over the unpaid bills between PDVSA and NuStar   We are facing a delay in the payment for the use of such facilities and related services contracted there  PDVSA is doing its best to catch up with outstanding debts  but has not made any special arrangements to cover the storage costs of the relevant tank   a PDVSA official wrote in an email in October   The PDVSA official explained that  since June no payment has been made to NuStar   but also said that a payment schedule was proposed to the U S  firm in a meeting in September in Caracas  with a first installment of  2 3 million planned for October  According to the schedule  10 percent of the accumulated debt was to be paid from October through December  with a one time additional payment due in January and the remainder paid off through 10 percent monthly installments  PDVSA has not yet paid the October installment  according to a PDVSA source  prompting NuStar s refusal to load   In a memorandum to PDVSA s finance chief  Simon Zerpa  the oil company s trade and supply department warned further payment delay to NuStar could result in possible tanker embargoes  broken supply contracts with Caribbean customers and a shortage of fuels for Venezuela s domestic market  In the September meeting  PDVSA suggested it could terminate a related contract with NuStar for fuel oil tanks rental and sublease a portion of its Statia storage to an undisclosed firm as a way to reduce further debts   NuStar countered that PDVSA could pay off the debt with oil  or by allowing it to become a partner in the state run company s terminal on the island of Bonaire along with a partial payment to show good faith   
It is unclear if any agreement on topics different than the payment schedule was reached ",2017-10-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive-pdvsa-blocked-from-using-nustar-terminal-over-unpaid-bills-545023,545023

lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  661 million and also decreased 6 8  from the year ago level of  696 83 million  This underperformance can be attributed to weak contributions from the U S  Land

industry leader in wellbore positioning Courtesy of strong demand during the quarter  the segment recognized revenues of  13 8 million  up 26 8  from the year ago figure  However  higher revenues were

32421,253936,NS,NuStar  other energy partnerships simplify business models to spur growth,news,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON  Reuters    Some publicly traded U S  energy pipeline and oil storage partnerships are restructuring into simpler business models to help attract new investors and spur growth 
Rising oil and gas production has spawned billions of dollars of new transport  gathering and storage projects  But the companies most responsible for these projects can allocate up to 50 percent of their income to the general partner  leaving less for other holders or to invest in new projects 
Historically  these firms have passed most of their income along to holders and sold equity or debt to finance new projects or acquisitions  But in the last year  what they have had to offer investors has jumped  MPLX Energy Logistics LP  for instance  paid a 9 7 percent annualized distribution last quarter to its holders  up from 7 9 percent a year earlier  according to figures from investment firm East Daley Capital Advisors 
 The higher cash yield makes the economics of these projects a little tougher   said Kendrick Rhea  an analyst at East Daley Capital  He estimates the cost of equity has risen nearly a third for some companies in the last year 
NuStar Energy  N NS  and ArchRock  N AROC  in recent weeks said they would cut income distributions to the general partners and combine units  shifting away from the general and limited partners structures common among energy pipeline and storage firms  Competitor TallGrass Energy  N TEP  in early February said it was considering a similar change 
 Removing a layer of complexity makes  partnerships  a lot more investible   said James Mick  a portfolio manager for Tortoise  which invests in energy master limited partnerships  MLPs   Private equity firms have been successfully acquiring pipeline operators in the shale patch because of their lower cost of capital  They are proving strong rivals to MLPs for these deals because of their willingness to use more debt financing 
Nustar  Archrock and TallGrass did not respond to requests for comment 
An early move away from partnership models came in 2014 when  Kinder Morgan  Inc  N KMI   then the largest publicly traded pipeline partnership  folded three units into a single company to address investor concerns about its growth and financial structure 
Mick estimates that up to 75 percent of the MLPs Tortoise covers will have eliminated incentive distribution rights within the next two years to free up cash for growth  As of last year  about 51 percent had eliminated their payouts  called Incentive Distribution Rights  IDRs   compared with 4 percent in 2007  he said 
Another factor in the restructurings are institutional investors seeking stronger governance and more independent boards  In some cases  about 80 percent of a limited partner s board will be comprised of individuals appointed by the general partner  investors said 
 In the real world  I don t see how directors can be truly independent and represent the best interests of the limited partners if they can be fired by the general partner   said Kevin McCarthy  chief executive officer at investment firm Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors 
Restructuring the partnerships to resemble corporations could draw renewed interest from investors  helping the firms raise new cash 
 Our view is that governance has to change if the sector is going to move to the next level and attract the attention of long only institutional investors   McCarthy added 
Although mature MLPs are revamping their structures  newer firms that go public are expected to continue using mechanisms such as IDRs to encourage growth   Hess Corp   N HES  and BP Plc  N BP  last year both launched MLPs that included incentive distribution payments to partners 

 It is unlikely they will go away for new issuance and partnership structures moving forward  They are simply too lucrative if executed correctly   said Ethan Bellamy  a senior research analyst with R W  Baird   Co ",2018-02-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nustar-other-energy-partnerships-simplify-business-models-to-spur-growth-1276445,1276445

32457,253972,NS,Here s Why You Should Retain Diamond Offshore  DO  Stock Now,opinion,Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO   is well poised to grow on the back of technologically advanced and versatile drilling fleet  However  conservative spending by explorers and producers is a persistent concern Houston  TX based Diamond Offshore is a contract driller that provides comprehensive offshore drilling services to the global energy industry  The company s rigs operate in the U S  Gulf of Mexico  offshore Brazil in South America  Australia and Southeast Asia  incorporating countries like Malaysia  Indonesia  Myanmar and Vietnam   Diamond Offshore also has operations in the United Kingdom and Norway  East and West Africa  and the Mediterranean Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc  Price and Consensus   Let s delve deeper to find out why this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is worth retaining at the moment What s Favoring the Stock Diamond Offshore s technologically advanced and versatile drilling fleet enables it to stay ahead of its peers in markets that are expected to witness a surge in offshore rig demand through 2025  Moreover  the company experiences robust demand for exclusive services provided with innovative prowess  as is witnessed in Sim StackTM  Helical riser buoyancy  Floating Factory Concept and others   Notably  Diamond Offshore has clinched awards for Ocean Valiant  Ocean Apex  Ocean Onyx and Ocean Monarch  Of these  Ocean Valiant will operate in the U K   while the other three will be working in Australia  The reactivation of Ocean Onyx will help the company to keep the number of active rigs at a satisfactory level  These contracts show upstream companies  high interest in Diamond Offshore s fleet As of Jul 1  2019  the company had a total contracted backlog of  2 billion that reflects more than 20 rig years of work  This not only reflects steady demand from customers but also offers an unmatched level of earnings and cash flow visibility  Further  this enables Diamond Offshore to navigate through any business environment better than many of its peers  Additionally  cost control initiatives of Diamond Offshore are promising  Last year  the company was able to lower total operating cost by more than 12  year over year Its excellent financial health is appreciable  Diamond Offshore has a debt to capital ratio of around 24 8   which is much lower than 41 9  for the broader industry  Also  the company has total cash and cash equivalents  including marketable securities  of  147 5 million to support growth projects DownsidesHowever  there are a few factors that are holding the stock back Diamond Offshore is facing pressure on the top line  The company s revenues have been decreasing over the past eight years  While oil prices have improved over the last year  revenues have failed to register a positive change  In the trailing 12 months  its revenues fell nearly 10 5  Explorers and producers kick started 2019 with a conservative capital budget  as they witnessed massive crude downturn during the fourth quarter of 2018  Moreover  explorers are more bothered about bottom line growth   being forced by investors following years of dull returns  than oil and gas production  Hence  conservative spending by explorers and producers is likely to hurt demand for offshore drilling  in turn hurting the company Diamond Offshore has also expressed concern regarding reduced EBITDA margin  as customers try to seal the deal at the ongoing rates for future works  Under this scenario  the company would miss out on the recovery in dayrates in the markets served To Sum UpDespite significant prospects  top line pressure and conservative upstream spending are concerns for Diamond Offshore  Nevertheless  we believe that systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long term growth Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked players in the energy space are Shell  LON RDSa  Midstream Partners  L P    NYSE SHLX    TC PipeLines  LP

32460,253975,NS,Jump In Oil Prices Is A Boon To These 5 Energy Players,opinion,From recent production cuts to explosion at the Sasref refinery to the prevailing trade tension and optimism over Brexit  all have worked in favor of oil prices  Brent crude oil futures  the global benchmark  rose 25 cents to  58 99 per barrel by 06 21 GMT on Oct 16  up 0 4  from the previous day s close  Meanwhile  the US West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude gained 23 cents or 0 4   to  53 04 a barrel We have thus shortlisted five energy players that investors can make the most amid rising oil prices Factors Behind Rise in Oil PriceThe drop in global demand for oil has been a rising concern for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and allied producers  As the supply for oil keeps growing and demand fading  oil producers are striving hard to reach a break even  To counter soft demand  OPEC  Russia and other producers have cut oil output by 1 2 million barrels per day A recent explosion caused by the gas leak during maintenance work at Saudi Arabia s Sasref refinery also lifted oil price  The Middle East tension has always influenced oil price  Evidently  after the Sep 14 attack on Saudi Arabia s Abqaiq oil processing facility  oil prices climbed higher for days till the company announced that supply was restored Moreover  news from the U S  China trade front also seems to have given oil prices a spike  U S  House passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act overnight on Oct 15  The act would require an annual review if Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous from Beijing  This review will help justify the city s special trading status under the U S  law China has vowed to retaliate if the United States passes this act  This could rattle the phase one agreement that has eased trade tensions considerably  Oil price rose as the market is worried about the outcome of the retaliation  This is because earlier  China had imposed a 5  retaliatory tariff on U S  crude oil  giving American oil exporters a significant blow Further  optimism about a potential Brexit deal also shrugged off losses  As per the UK government s latest statement in caseof a no deal Brexit  fuel imports will not be subject to tariffs  Hence  tariff free fuel import will boost overall demand 5 Oil Stocks to Buy NowIt s quite obvious that from bigwig oil producers to rig operators to pipeline owners to refiners  all are likely to witness a rally in their share prices as oil prices scale upward  Energy shares have been one of the poorest performers so far this year  However  this uptick in oil prices will surely lure investors back  We have thus shortlisted five oil stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Crescent Point Energy Corp    TSX CPG   is a

32474,253989,NS,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  CNX Midstream Partners  NuStar Energy  Global Partners And Noble Midstream Partners,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 24  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  CNX Midstream Partners LP   NYSE CNXM    NuStar Energy  LP   NYSE NS    Global Partners LP   NYSE GLP   and Noble Midstream Partners LP   NYSE NBLX   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  The Best Way to Avoid Oil Price Volatility  Invest in MLPsEnergy market is uncertain and volatile  Nobody has much visibility into the future  So  when you think of something as a clear line of sight one quarter  it can soon be overshadowed by an unforeseen event  The recent spate of conflicting economic reports and events have made assets like oil even riskier For those of you who wish to avoid direct commodity price sensitivity  publicly traded energy master limited partnerships  or MLPs    that derive their revenue based on the volume of resources they carry   might be great bets The surge in oil and natural gas production over the past few years have made pipelines  storage and associated infrastructure MLPs attractive bets in the energy midstream space  This is because these network providers derive a major portion of their revenues from fee based contracts based on volume and are largely insensitive to commodity price fluctuations  MLPs also attract investors through the high distributions dividends that they typically shell out A Revenue Model That s Not Dependent on Energy Prices or EconomyMost MLPs are involved in processing and transportation of energy commodities such as natural gas  crude oil and refined products  under long term contracts  As such they have relatively consistent and predictable cash flows  unlike exploration and production  E P  companies  whose profits are highly correlated with commodity prices  Notwithstanding the state of the economy  pipeline firms enjoy strong demand for their infrastructure and processing services Generally viewed as defensive instruments  a majority of these North American midstream firms enter into long term contracts of around 10 20 years with inflation protection clause  This enables the MLPs to generate stable income practically under all conditions  providing high cash flow visibility and reducing the risk profile     Record Breaking Production to Drive Sector FundamentalsWe believe that the primary driver for the midstream operators is the pace of U S  oil production growth  And with output in America recently surpassing longtime top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia  the environment looks bullish for partnerships engaged in transportation and storage of the commodity Looking ahead  EIA forecasts domestic crude volumes to average 12 3 million barrels per day  bpd  and 13 2 million bpd in 2019 and 2020  respectively   both new all time highs  Lest we forget  oil production in the U S  jumped by around 17  in 2018 to set a new record of 11 million bpd Not to be left behind  American natural gas production reached a record 83 4 billion cubic feet  Bcf  per day in 2018  Its is expected to rise another 10  this year to 91 6 Bcf per day while the 2020 daily average is pegged at 93 5 Bcf  according to the EIA In other words  the robust oil and natural gas production growth in the United States is creating immense opportunities for midstream companies 4 Stocks to Invest InAlthough the benefits of MLP business model cannot be stressed enough  prospective investors need to do adequate research before betting one s hard earned

32519,254034,NS,Chesapeake  CHK  Issues Common Stock To Reduce Debt Burden,opinion,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation   NYSE CHK   recently entered into a privately negotiated agreement to issue a total of 250 721 554 common shares in exchange for senior notes and convertible preferred stock  This move is expected to help the company to strengthen its balance sheet 
Notably  at the end of second quarter 2019  Chesapeake had a cash balance of only  4 million  On the other hand  its net long term debt was  9 701 million  leading to a debt to capitalization ratio of 69 6   The figure was way above the  average of 40 4  
Moreover  the company s debt laden balance sheet restricts its ability to gain capital from the markets while losing credibility among shareholders  Though the recent move of issuance of common stock to retire a portion of its debt dilutes equity  management s focus to tackle leverage is appreciable 

 
The company intends to keep lowering the debt level through several techniques like divesting non core assets  improving capital efficiency  optimizing capital allocation program and others  Among the resources sold  the most notable one is the  1 9 billion divestment of Utica Shale assets in Ohio during late 2018  These initiatives can further improve its financial flexibility 
Markedly  the common stock issuance represents 15 3  of the upstream company s 1 63 billion shares outstanding as of Jul 31  2019  These newly issued stocks will be exchanged for around  40 million in 5 75  convertible preferred stock   155 8 million in 5 5  convertible senior notes due 2026   112 7 million in 4 875  senior notes due 2022   129 3 million in 5 75  senior notes due 2023 and  150 million in 8  senior notes due 2027

32521,254036,NS,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Schlumberger  SLB  Now,opinion,"Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB   is well poised to grow on the back of attractive reservoir and well technologies  However  conservative spending by explorers and producers  and lower domestic rig count are causes of concern 
Houston  TX based Schlumberger is a leading oilfield services company that provides services to oil and gas explorers  and producers across the world  Schlumberger helps upstream energy players to locate oil and gas  as well as drill and evaluate hydrocarbon wells  It also supports the explorers to produce optimum volumes of the commodities from the existing wells  
Estimate Revisions
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s bottom line for 2019 has been revised downward to  1 50 from  1 54 in the past 60 days  Notably  four analysts have revised their estimates higher  while nine analysts have made downward revisions during this time period Schlumberger Limited Price and Consensus
    
Let s delve deeper to find out why this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is worth retaining at the moment 
What s Favoring the Stock 
Schlumberger is the largest oilfield services player  with presence in every energy market across the world  Also  in all the operating business segments  the company is among the top players  Given Schlumberger s huge size and attractive reservoir and well technologies  the company will likely outperform its peers 
Notably  the company s greater reliance on lucrative international market is appreciable  Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfield projects  Schlumberger is better positioned than most of its peers to take up new offshore projects in the shallow water basins outside North America 
The company is expecting to see an improvement in international markets wherein drilling rig count and final investment decision  FID  for clients  projects are on the rise  The tailwinds are supporting Schlumberger s projection of 7 8  increase in spending by upstream energy firms in international markets through 2019  Thus  Schlumberger s oilfield services are likely to record higher demand in international markets served 
The firm has a strong commitment of returning cash to its shareholders through dividend payments and stock repurchases  Over the past five years  Schlumberger s dividend yield has been mostly higher than the collective yield of the stocks belonging to the industry  Markedly  through the June quarter  2 5 million stocks were repurchased by the oilfield services player 
Downsides
There are a few factors that are impeding the growth of the stock lately 
Schlumberger stated that explorers and producers are constrained by the reduction in capacity for borrowings and an increase in the cost of capital  Also  the explorers are facing constant pressure from investors for higher returns instead of production growth  These headwinds are likely to lower investments by explorers and producers in the land market of North America by 10  through 2019 
Moreover  decline in rig count in the domestic market can affect Schlumberger s business  Also  conservative spending by explorers and producers is going to hurt demand for the company s oilfield services in North America  Thus  Schlumberger has set its 2019 capital budget in the range of  1 5  1 7 billion  indicating a decrease from last year s  2 2 billion 
The pipeline bottleneck problem in the Permian Basin has been hurting the company s operations in U S  shale plays  Worryingly enough  Schlumberger expects pipeline transportation capacity constraints to last well into 2019  The oilfield service player s overall business is also getting affected by soft hydraulic fracturing prices in the United States 
To Sum Up
Despite the company s significant prospects  conservative spending by explorers and producers  as well as lower domestic rig count are concerns  Nevertheless  we believe that systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long term growth

32593,254108,NS,Here s Why You Should Hold On To PBF Energy  PBF  Stock Now,opinion,PBF Energy Inc    NYSE PBF   is well poised to grow on the back of sophisticated and complex refining assets  However  rising costs and debt burden are persistent concerns Headquartered in Parsippany  NJ  PBF Energy is a leading refiner of crude  Through five oil refineries and associated infrastructure in the United States  the company provides end products that comprise heating oil  transportation fuels  lubricants and many related products  PBF Energy  with a market cap of more than  2 7 billion  has an expected earnings growth rate of 6 8  for the next five years  It has lost 27 4  in the last six months compared with 21  decline of the  it belongs to Let s delve deeper to find out why this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is worth retaining at the moment What s Favoring the Stock PBF Energy operates through five refineries spread across East Coast  Gulf Coast  West Coast and Mid continent areas  representing a diversified asset base  Notably  the company s daily processing capacity of 884 000 barrels of crude is higher than most of its peers  Through 2019  it anticipates total daily throughput volumes from the East Coast between 330 000 and 350 000 barrels  The same from the Mid Continent and Gulf Coast is projected within 150 000 160 000 and 180 000 190 000 barrels  respectively  This will boost the company s results in the next two quarters PBF Energy has one of the most complex refining systems in the United States  with an overall Nelson Complexity Index reading of 12 8  This reflects that its oil refineries  having the capacity to generate lighter and better grades of refined products  are more sophisticated than most of the other refiners  This positions the company ahead of its peers in terms of IMO 2020 compatibility  which is designed to reduce sulfur content in marine fuels Markedly  the company pays out handsome dividends that have been consistently higher than the broader industry over the past five years  Currently  the dividend yield of the stock stands at 5 3   higher than industry average of 4 4  Through a 48  limited partner interest in PBF Logistics LP  PBF Energy has exposure in diverse midstream assets comprising oil and refined product terminals  pipelines and storage assets  Eventually  the company enjoys stable cash flow on the back of long term commitments of shippers for transporting or storing minimum volume through PBF Logistics  midstream properties DownsidesHowever  there are a few factors that are impeding the growth of the stock lately PBF Energy s debt to capitalization ratio stands at 37   higher than the industry average  This reflects that its balance sheet has more exposure to debt than the broader industry  Notably  at the end of second quarter 2019  the company had cash and cash equivalents of only  204 1 million  while its total debt was as high as  2 billion Second quarter 2019 crude oil and feedstock throughput volumes were 854 1 thousand barrels per day  BPD   down from 866 6 thousand BPD in the year ago period  Moreover  the company s refinery operating expense per barrel of throughput increased to  5 27 from  5 11 in second quarter 2018  As a result  its refining margin per barrel of throughput   following strong turnarounds and maintenance activities   significantly declined  This affected the bottom line in the quarter  Its bottom line will be further hampered  if the metrics fail to improve To Sum UpDespite significant prospects  the company s increasing costs and debt burden are concerns  Nevertheless  we believe that systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long term growth Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the energy sector are given below NuStar

capital budget  as they witnessed massive crude downturn during the fourth quarter of 2018  Moreover  explorers are more bothered about bottom line growth   being forced by investors following years

32643,254158,NS,Enbridge To Restart Line 25 Operation In Kentucky,opinion,"One of Enbridge Inc  s   NYSE ENB   pipelines in the Texas Eastern natural gas system in Kentucky is expected to restart services by the end of August  per Reuters  Notably  its 10  15 and 25 Lines connect Danville and Tompkinsville compressors in Kentucky  In the beginning of the month  rupture of the 30 inch Line 15 resulted in a massive explosion  which killed one person and hospitalized five others  The explosion also destroyed several adjacent structures and railroad tracks 
The midstream giant intends to replace several portions of Lines 10 and 25 near the surrounding areas of the explosion site  and restart operations in Line 25 between Aug 24 and Aug 26  This will likely enable the company to transport 800 million cubic feet of natural gas per day through the area 
However  it requires regulatory approvals from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  PHMSA  for restarting operations in the pipelines  On Aug 8  PHMSA issued a corrective action order  which requires Enbridge to fulfil some duties before transporting gas through the site of the blast    
It expects the work on Line 10 to be concluded by the end of this month or beginning of September  The company intends to assess the full length of Line 15 that runs through Uniontown  PA to Kosciusko  MS 
Notably  in second quarter 2019  the company s Gas Transmission and Midstream segment reported adjusted EBITDA of C 936 million  down from C 1 032 million a year ago  This downside can be attributed to lower contributions from the US Midstream business  owing to divestments  and other reasons 
Moreover  higher planned integrity expenditure in US Gas Transmission affected the segment  The recent affairs in the Texas Eastern natural gas system might further affect the segment s results in the third quarter

prowess and major growth projects  However  the partnership s balance sheet weakness is a persistent concern Phillips 66 Partners   headquartered in Houston  TX   is a master limited partnership  MLP  that is involved in operating and developing midstream energy infrastructures  It was created by Phillips 66   NYSE PSX    a leading refining player in the global market  The partnership  with a market cap of more than  6 5 billion  has an expected earnings growth rate of 4  for the next five years  It has gained 26 3  year to date compared with 5 8  rise of the  it belongs to  Let s delve deeper to find out why this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is worth retaining at the moment What s Favoring the Stock Phillips 66 Partners is least exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices since it generates stable fee based revenues under long term contracts from diverse midstream energy assets across the Gulf Coast  and Central  Western and Atlantic areas of the United States  Thus  the partnership s cash flows are highly stable and predictable as it provides transportation services to third parties and Phillips 66 From fourth quarter 2013 to fourth quarter 2018  Phillips 66 Partners had raised quarterly cash distribution by 30  at a compound annual growth rate  The partnership also raised distribution for the June quarter of 2019  marking the 23rd straight quarter of distribution raise since its initial public offering in 2013  The partnership is likely to continue increasing cash distributions  since it has a solid backlog of organic growth projects  and boosting unitholder value Through 2019  Phillips 66 Partners is planning to complete four major organic projects   Bayou Bridge Pipeline  segments I and II   Lake Charles products pipeline  Lake Charles isomerization unit and Gray Oak Pipeline  In 2020  the partnership plans to bring online three more organic projects  namely Sweeny to Pasadena products expansion  South Texas Gateway Terminal and Clemens Caverns expansion  All these projects are expected to enable the partnership to grow further and boost earning capabilities in the coming days DownsidesHowever  there are a few factors that are impeding the stock s growth lately Compared with only  18 million in long term debt as of 2014 end  the partnership s long term debt load was recorded at  3 3 billion on Jun 30  2019  reflecting a massive increase over the years  Also  compared with  185 million in cash and cash equivalents as of 2017 end  its cash balance plunged to only  130 million in the last reported quarter  Although the partnership is trying to improve its leverage scenario  surging debt loads and declining cash balance reflect weakness in the balance sheet  which can affect financial flexibility  This  in turn  can affect its growth projects Phillips 66 Partners earlier projected 2019 capital spending to be  1 2 billion  However  for financing a portion of the  2 2 billion Gray Oak pipeline project  the partnership has halved its capital budget through 2019 to  601 million  The significant reduction in capital spending may hurt the partnership s pipeline and terminal throughput volume To Sum UpDespite riding on significant growth prospects  balance sheet weakness is a significant concern for the partnership  Nevertheless  we believe that systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long term growth Which Way are Estimates Headed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings per unit is  4 42  which has witnessed one upward movement and four downside estimate revisions in the past 60 days  The

32667,254182,NS,What s In Store For Oasis Midstream s  OMP  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Oasis Midstream Partners LP   NYSE OMP   is scheduled to release second quarter 2019 results after the closing bell on Aug 6  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is earnings per share of 77 cents on revenues of  108 75 million In the last reported quarter  the Texas based midstream player beat the consensus mark by 2 21  on strong transportation and processing volumes  As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the firm has a mixed record  having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four quarters  This is depicted in the graph below Oasis Midstream Partners LP Price and EPS Surprise   While investors are keeping their fingers crossed and anticipating that Oasis Midstream will surpass earnings estimates this time around  our model does not predict the same Let s see which way are top and bottom line estimates trending The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  108 75 million  indicating a significant increase from  61 million recorded in the prior year quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings of 77 cents per share also suggests growth from 45 cents recorded in the corresponding period of the prior year  However  earnings estimates for the to be reported quarter have been revised downward by 4 cents in the past 30 days Let s delve deeper into the factors that are likely to influence Oasis Midstream s second quarter earnings Factors at PlayOasis Midstream s strong execution in the Williston Basin  wherein its parent company Oasis Petroleum   NYSE OAS   is witnessing solid output growth  is likely to fuel the partnership s upcoming results  Strong transportation and processing volumes from the partnership s subsidiaries  namely Bighorn and Bobcat  are likely to boost the firm s results in the to be reported quarter  The partnership expects second quarter 2019 natural gas service volumes from Bighorn in the range of 230 250 million standard cubic feet per day  MMscfpd   implying an increase from 104 2 MMscfpd recorded in the year ago quarter  Growing third party volumes and the ramp up of its new 200 million cubic feet per day processing plant will drive contributions from Bighorn  Bobcat volumes for second quarter 2019 are projected at 270 290 MMscfpd  pointing to y y growth of 97  at the midpoint However  water services volumes from Beartooth are expected within 115 125 Mbowpd  indicating a fall from 139 2 Mbowpd recorded in the year ago period  The partnership is bearing the brunt of increased costs over the last few quarters and the trend is likely to continue  which may dent overall profit margins  Additional spending to form a new entity called Panther DevCo will also add to the capex of the firm  in turn hurting cash flows  While higher y y natural gas service volumes from Bighorn and Bobcat will boost the firm s profits  lower volumes from Beartooth  along with high costs and capex may dent margins What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict that Oasis Midstream will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to be reported quarter  This is because it doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter s earnings per share is  1 74 on revenues of  42 5 billion In the last reported quarter  the integrated oil and gas company beat the

San Ramon  CA based U S  oil major surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four quarters  with average positive surprise of 2 33  Chevron Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and anticipating that Chevron will surpass earnings estimates this time around  Let s see which way the company s top and bottom line estimates are trending The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  42 5 billion  It generated revenues of  42 2 billion in the prior year quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings per share of  1 80 indicates a marginal improvement from  1 78 recorded in the corresponding quarter of the prior year  The earnings estimates for the to be reported quarter have been revised downward by six cents in the past seven days Let s delve deeper into the factors that are likely to influence Chevron s second quarter earnings Factors at PlayThe company s upcoming results are set to benefit from increasing output  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter production volumes is pegged at 3 095 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day  MBOE d   suggesting an improvement from 2 826 MBOE d in the year ago period  Chevron is likely to record higher year over year output from top tier assets in Permian and Gulf of Mexico  as well as the Wheatstone LNG plant in Australia  While higher output may buoy the company s upstream results  we remain concerned of oil and gas prices that declined y y amid rising fuel inventories  slowdown of global economy and trade tensions  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upstream segment s operating income is pegged at  2 863 million  implying a decline from the year ago reported figure of  3 295 million The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter s refinery input is pegged at 1 590 thousand barrels per day  mbpd   pointing to a decline from the year ago level of 1 595 mbpd  Nonetheless  year over year widening of crack spreads in the to be reported quarter is likely to fuel the downstream segment s margins  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for segmental income stands at  890 million  higher than  838 million recorded in the year ago quarter Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Chevron will beat estimates in the to be reported quarter  That is because a

32720,254235,NS,What s In Store For Marathon Petroleum s  MPC  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Marathon Petroleum   NYSE MPC   is expected to release second quarter 2019 results before the opening bell on Aug 1 In the last reported quarter  the independent oil refiner and marketer missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by a huge margin on declining crude discounts  In fact  the company swung to a loss of 9 cents per share  in stark contrast to earnings of 8 cents recorded in the year ago period  As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the Findlay  OH based downstream operator surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four quarters Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the company can top earnings estimates this time around  However  our model indicates that Marathon Petroleum might not beat on earnings in the to be reported quarter Let s see which way estimates are treading The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is a profit of  1 33 on revenues of  31 23 billion  Notably  earnings estimates have moved south by 18  over the past 30 days  The bottom line estimates compare unfavorably with the year ago earnings of  2 27 a share  Nonetheless  the top line estimates for the to be reported quarter indicate y y growth of 39 4 Let s take a look at the factors that are likely to shape Marathon Petroleum s second quarter earnings Factors at PlayMarathon Petroleum s revenues are expected to gain traction in the to be reported quarter on the back of the acquisition of Andeavor in fourth quarter 2018 Its retail division is expected to benefit from higher year over year margins and sales  The upcoming results are expected to be buoyed by Speedway and acquired retail assets of Andeavor  Notably  convenience stores at the end of the quarter are likely to total 3 918  higher than 2 744 in second quarter 2018  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for merchandise sale and margins is pegged at  1 595 million and  455 million compared with the year ago figures of  1 285 million and  366 million  respectively  Consequently  operating income from the retail division is likely to shoot up in the to be reported quarter Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the Midstream segment profitability is expected to reach  915 million from  617 million reported in the second quarter of 2019  benefiting from stronger contribution from MPLX and Andeavor Logistics Its refining segment s earnings indicators are also giving positive signals  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for refined products sales volume and refinery throughput is pegged at 3 721 thousand barrels per day  mbpd  and 3 039 mbpd  higher than the year ago reported figures of 2 392 mbpd and 2 038 mbpd  respectively  The blended crack in the quarter to be reported has risen to  16 41 a barrel from  14 07  which can buoy refining margins  Higher blended crack spreads and favorable sweet sour differentials in the to be reported quarter bode well for the firm s refining segment However  the company is bearing the brunt of increased costs over the last few quarters and the trend is likely to continue in the quarter to be reported  which may limit overall earnings  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict that Marathon Petroleum will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter to be reported  This is because it doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate

 The U S  created 263 000 new jobs in April to help drive the unemployment rate down to a 49 year low of 3 6   the latest cue pointing to a rebound in the economy after a slow start in the new year  The increase in hiring was concentrated at white collar businesses  construction and health care  The only sector to suffer a big drawback was retail  whose employment fell for the third straight month 
The unemployment rate slipped to 3 6  from 3 8  in March  marking the lowest level since December 1969  One caveat  The decline stemmed in large part from nearly a half million workers dropping out of the labor force  Fewer people said they were unemployed  however    MarketWatch

It further allayed concerns about the economy s health  which had been brought to the fore by a temporary inversion of the U S  Treasury yield curve last month  Tame inflation  however  supported the Federal Reserve s recent decision to suspend further interest rate increases this year    Reuters

32809,254324,NS,SemGroup  SEMG  Breaks Even In Q4 Earnings  Revenues Beat,opinion,"SemGroup Corporation   NYSE SEMG   reported breakeven adjusted earnings in fourth quarter 2018 compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents and the year ago quarter adjusted income of 3 cents  The underperformance stemmed from lower Canadian gas processing volumes and certain non cash charges  
Operating income was down 32  to  49 9 million  while adjusted EBITDA fell from  111 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to  105 4 million 
Total revenues recorded in the quarter came in at  611 9 million  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  588 million due to strong White Cliffs pipeline volumes  Further  the top line also edged up around 1  from the prior year sales of  606 8 million 
SemGroup has reorganized its operating activities around three segments   U S  Liquids  U S  Gas  and Canada   to better reflect the company s current business portfolio  
Segmental Information

U S  Gas  Profit generated from this segment  the erstwhile SemGas unit  amounted to  17 6 million  21 1  greater than a year ago on 46  higher average processing volumes 
Canada  This unit contains the results of SemGroup s legacy SemCAMS segment plus the company s newly acquired Meritage assets 
The segment s profit in the quarter under review narrowed to  17 2 million  from  23 7 million incurred in the corresponding quarter of the last year  The deterioration could be attributed to lower average gas processing volumes that fell 5  year over year to 430 million cubic feet per day   
Balance Sheet
As of Dec 31  2018  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  86 7 million and long term debt of around  2 3 billion  The debt to capitalization ratio of the company was 55 3   down from 63 2  six months ago  SemGroup was able to improve the leverage primarily on the back of asset sales

32813,254328,NS,Strong Demand And Supply Cut To Boost Oil Prices  5 Picks ,opinion,After a disappointing fourth quarter  crude oil prices have been stabilizing since the beginning of 2019 following the decision taken by OPEC and Russia led oil exporters to cut production levels  and supply related problems in Iran and Venezuela  Moreover  despite concerns about global economic slowdown  demand for crude oil is likely to remain firm in the near term Additionally  any positive development in the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China will act as a major catalyst to oil prices  Given this upbeat scenario  it would be prudent to invest in oil related stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank Oil Prices Likely to Remain Firm in 2019On Mar 11  the U S  benchmark West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude gained 72 cents or 1 3  to close at  56 79 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  The global benchmark Brent crude rose 84 cents or 1 3  to  66 58 a barrel on ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe  These are the highest finishes for both oil prices so far in March  Year to date  WTI oil price is up 27 7   while Brent crude has gained 29 3  On Mar 11  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  announced that it estimates the average prices of Brent crude and WTI crude to be  70 and  59 per barrel  respectively  in 2019  In January  a Reuters  poll had predicted average price per barrel of Brent crude and WTI crude at  74 50 and  67 45  respectively  in 2019 OPEC Cuts  Venezuela Sanctions Squeeze SuppliesThe OPEC and Russia led oil exporters have decided to cut crude oil supplies by 1 2 million barrels per day  bpd  in 2019  This massive cut aided in the stabilization of oil prices  In December 2018  oil supplies from OPEC nations plunged by 751 000 bpd to nearly

oil producer in the world  is suffering owing to lack of modernization of oil plants  According to the International Energy Agency  IEA   Venezuela s crude output is likely to decline from 1 3 million bpd in 2018 to 750 000 bpd in 2019 owing to U S  sanctions Strong Global Demand for Crude OilOn Mar 11  the IEA projected that global crude oil demand will remain firm at least up to 2024 although the rate of demand growth will decline  By this time  oil demand will rise by 7 1 million bpd Despite a surge in sales of electric car and massive oil exploration in the United States  soaring demand for oil for the petrochemical industry  especially for plastic and growing demand for aviation oil will support crude oil prices Positive Development on Trade War FrontThe 11 month long trade dispute between the United States and China is heading toward a likely resolution  On Feb 24  President Donald Trump tweeted that the United States is planning to delay tariffs on additional Chinese goods given the marked progress made on trade related negotiations CNBC reported that China has committed to import  1 2 trillion of U S  exports  A solution to the U S  China trade spat will be a major

Overall  it was another good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures gained about 0 8  to close at  71 28 per barrel  while natural gas prices rose some 1 5  to  2 847 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  oil benchmark hit a new three and a half year high last week on bullish EIA inventory numbers  a looming drop in Iranian crude exports and alarming drop in Venezuelan crude output 
The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude stockpiles registered a fall of 1 4 million barrels  the second weekly decrease in a row  On a further bullish note  the report revealed that refined product inventories  gasoline and distillate  both dropped from their week earlier levels 
The commodity was also supported by U S  President Donald Trump s recent withdrawal from a nuclear deal with OPEC s third largest producer Iran and a pledge to reimpose sanctions on Tehran  The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from current levels and lead to a supply shortage in an already  tight  oil market 
Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters  With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse  oil output has dwindled by almost 50  since 2005  Venezuela currently churns out less than 2 million barrels per day  much lower that its pledge per the OPEC led supply cuts 
Natural gas prices also moved northward last week  While the weekly inventory release showed a larger than expected increase in natural gas supplies  the report pointed to a tightening market dynamic and boosted the fuel s price  In particular  total consumption of natural gas averaged around 57 5 Bcf per day  4  higher on a weekly basis due to rising usage for power generation 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     TOTAL S A  recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding  MoU  with the Government of Oman to develop natural gas resources in Oman  The agreement covers both the upstream and downstream businesses of the company  TOTAL s involvement in the above project will increase its production from Oman  which was 37 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  Boe d  in 2017 TOTAL  along with Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc   will develop several natural gas discoveries located in the Greater Barik area on onshore Block 6  Shell will be the operator with 75  stake and TOTAL will have 25  interest in these natural gas discoveries  Initial gas production will be 500 million cubic feet per day  with the potential to increase to 1 billion cubic feet TOTAL has plans to utilize its equity gas entitlement from the Oman project as feedstock to develop a regional hub for Liquefied Natural Gas  LNG  bunkering service to supply LNG as a fuel to marine vessels  A small scale liquefaction plant will be built in Sohar port and TOTAL will utilize this plant to convert natural gas to LNG  In addition  TOTAL may benefit from improving natural gas demand in Oman

32986,254501,NS,Schlumberger  SLB  Q4 Earnings Meet Estimates  Decline Y Y,opinion,"Schlumberger Limited s   NYSE SLB   fourth quarter 2018 earnings of 36 cents per share  excluding charges and credits  were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The bottom line  however  declined from 48 cents a year ago 
The oilfield service giant logged total revenues of  8 180 million  flat year over year  The top line  however  beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 062 million 
The improvement in drilling business on higher mobilized rigs for integrated projects  rise in sales of SIS software in international markets and increased activities associated with Testing Services in Oman  United Arab Emirates and Qatar aided the company s fourth quarter results  The positives were partially offset by the fall in OneStim revenues from the North American land market 
Segmental Performance
Reservoir Characterization and Drilling units registered a year over year increase in revenues while the Production segment reported a decline 
Increased sales of SIS software in India  Russia  Vietnam and China aided the Reservoir Characterization segment  Improved activities related to Testing Services in Oman  United Arab Emirates and Qatar also led to the improvement  However  lower Wireline activity in Russia partially offset the unit s results 
Mobilization of higher drilling rigs for several integrated drilling developments in Argentina  China  India and Norway backed the Drilling segment  Lower activities in Northern Hemisphere have offset the results partially  
Decline in OneStim revenues from the land market of North American hurt the Production segment  The waning in revenues related to well services in the Argentina also led to the deterioration   
Revenues at the Reservoir Characterization unit totaled  1 651 million  marginally higher than  1 640 million a year ago  Pre tax operating income increased nominally to  364 million from  359 million in fourth quarter 2017 
Revenues at the Drilling unit summed  2 461 million  up 13  year over year  Pre tax operating income was  318 million  flat year over year 
Revenues at the Production segment declined 5  from the year earlier quarter to  2 936 million  Moreover  pre tax operating income fell 37  year over year to  198 million   
Revenues at the Cameron segment amounted to  1 265 million  down 11  year over year  Pre tax operating income dropped 37  from the prior year quarter s  127 million 
Financials
As of Dec 31  2018  the company had approximately  2 777 million in cash and short term investments plus  14 644 million in long term debt  This represents a debt to capitalization ratio of 30 5   Through the October to December quarter  2 1 million stocks were repurchased by the oilfield services player 
Outlook
Schlumberger believes oil prices will recover gradually through 2019  However  the volatility in the commodity price has convinced explorers and producers to spend conservatively  added the company  In other words  a customer s emphasis on free cash flow rather than capital spending owing to oil price volatility has made the outlook for onshore North American drilling and production businesses uncertain  said Schlumberger 
Zacks Rank   Key Picks
Schlumberger currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   A few better ranked players in the energy space are Shell  LON RDSa  Midstream Partners  L P    NYSE SHLX    NuStar Energy LP   NYSE NS   and Bonanza Creek Energy  Inc    NYSE BCEI    While Bonanza carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Shell Midstream Partners and NuStar Energy sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see     
Bonanza surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  the average positive earnings surprise being 12 9  
Shell Midstream will likely post earnings growth of 27 5  in 2019 
NuStar Energy will likely see earnings growth of 156 9  in 2019

33022,254537,NS,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Genesis Energy  NuStar Energy  DCP Midstream  Crestwood Equity Partners And Transocean,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 8  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Oil   Gas  including Genesis Energy L P    NYSE GEL    NuStar Energy L P    NYSE NS    DCP Midstream L P    NYSE DCP    Crestwood Equity Partners L P    NYSE CEQP   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   Industry  Oil   Gas  Part 3Link  A strong third quarter notwithstanding  energy   which was the best S P sector performer in 2016  with a market thumping 24  return   has not exactly had a great year  The  sector is down 1 4  year to date versus 18  growth for the broader S P 500  Compare this to 17  growth during the same period last year and one wonders whether the stellar run for the sector is over Market participants argue that fundamentals point to a looming oil supply growth despite WTI crude crossing the  55 per barrel mark on more than one occasion  In fact  crude s recent gains could become self defeating if elevated realizations induce producers   especially U S  shale drillers   to ramp up activity  Together with the scheduled conclusion of OPEC non OPEC production cuts in March next year and we are looking at another selloff in oil prices As it is  despite OPEC s claims of  successful  implementation of supply curbs  output from the group was 32 75 million barrels a day in September  a gain of almost 90 000 barrels a day from August  Not surprisingly then  oil has struggled to stay above the psychologically critical  50 threshold for a prolonged period  pointing to the cartel s failure to shrink the global oil glut sufficiently  At the same time  OPEC s moves to trim output and restore the demand supply balance has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more As per Energy Information Administration s   EIA   latest inventory release  U S  production rose to 9 6 million barrels a day   near the highest level in more than two years  Moreover  stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   are close to five month highs Finally  restored output from exempted OPEC producers Libya and Nigeria have added to the surplus and further slowed the rebalancing of the market As long as there is excess oil  the arduous market environment will continue   suggesting that the odds are firmly stacked against a sustained rally  With U S  crude stockpiles remaining high on the back of robust shale production  money managers do not rule out chances of more pain ahead for energy stocks Challenging Distribution Growth Outlook for MLPsMaster limited partnerships  or MLPs  are essentially infrastructure holdings of energy companies that feed off the broader sector  But these midstream operators are not direct oil and gas plays as they derive a major portion of their revenues from fee based contracts depending on volume and are largely insensitive to commodity price fluctuations  Therefore  volatility should be low with this asset class But so far  this year  they are doing worse than the broader market  We note that The Energy Select Sector SPDR  a popular way to track energy companies  has logged a return of  10 5  year to date  while the benchmark Alerian MLP Index is currently down a punishing 15 6  over the same period  The slide has been primarily triggered by a host of negative distribution surprises   cuts and moderations Of late  capital market access has remained tough and credit metrics stretched  making it difficult for the oil and gas transporters to execute on their growth projects  As a result  the distribution outlook became uncertain with a number of MLPs left with no choice but to trim their expected payouts  And with most investors owning MLPs for the benefit of generous  periodical distributions  many have understandably abandoned the sector  A recent case in point is Genesis Energy L P    which lost more than 3  after slashing its distribution to 50 cents per unit from 73 cents We expect the commodity price associated volatility for the MLPs to persist for some time and advise investors to steer clear of this asset class  In addition to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  NuStar Energy L P   other bottom rankers  including DCP Midstream L P   and Crestwood Equity Partners L P    are risky bets that are best avoided at the moment  You can see  Little Hope for Embattled DrillersDespite the uptick in tendering activity and contract fixtures over the past few months  the oil drilling industry is in a bad shape  Waiting for that  elusive  recovery for about three years  the current oilfield environment remains one of the most difficult  With new competitors entering the market and drilling contractors too rattled to make new investment decisions  rig owners have seen a number of their vessels get idled Even Transocean Ltd    the world s largest offshore drilling contractor and leading provider of drilling management services   have been a victim of this sustained period of stubborn low oil price environment  In late September  the company announced that it will   costing Transocean around  1 4 billion  This comes after commodity price rout has already made a number of deepwater drilling projects uneconomical While we agree that the market is far from being dead  it is no secret that there is a major overhang of drilling rigs ordered when crude prices were trading at  100 a barrel prior to the boom years of 2014  compared with around  50 recently Consequently  the drillers are struggling with diving dayrates  lower rig utilization and margin compression  Several quarters of reduced activity and diminishing contract backlog have meant that most of the players are facing continued pressure on revenues  earnings and cash flows With no signs of immediate improvement in market sentiment  2017 is likely to rank as

33024,254539,NS,Energy Investing Guide  3 Stocks To Buy  3 To Avoid,opinion,"Energy  which was the strongest S P sector performer in 2016 with a market thumping 24  return  has not exactly had a great start this year   the  sector is down 9 9  year to date versus 11 5  growth for the broader S P 500 
Compare this to 16  growth during the same period last year and one wonders whether the stellar run for the sector is over 
The sector has been under immense pressure over the last few months thanks to concerns over growing U S  supply and falling refinery demand post Hurricane Harvey 

At the crux of the matter is the rising flood of U S  shale driven production  Now at a financial equilibrium  the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work  Throughout the downturn  producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques 
With these efforts  many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new  50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices  In other words  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent  in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more  As per Energy Information Administration s   EIA   latest inventory release  U S  production rose to 9 5 million barrels a day   the highest level in more than two years  This was prior to the temporary drop in U S  Gulf of Mexico oil volumes on account of disruptions from Harvey 
Meanwhile  as Harvey tore through the Texas Gulf Coast  workers in the U S  oil industry had to evacuate production facilities and shut down refineries  This  in turn  triggered the biggest disruption in nationwide energy supplies in years 
The United States has major refining infrastructures along the Gulf of Mexico   GoM    According to the EIA  more than 45  of domestic oil refining capacity are located in the GoM 
With deluge and floods in the aftermath of Harvey knocking out a major chunk of domestic refining capacity  crude demand was significantly curbed  This again led to lower oil prices 
But it s Not All Bad News for Energy
But the scenario isn t as bad as it may look 
Oil has rebounded from its multi year lows reached in 2016 and while the commodity may not be at a level many thought it would be at this time of the year  even at today s prices certain companies are in a position to earn profits  And while we cannot run down the chances of the market moving sideways and seeing high volatility  many analysts are not too bearish about oil in the remainder of 2017  Here s why 
Sharp Inventory Drawdowns  Investors have pinned hopes of recovery over the recent U S  Energy Department s inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles   pointing to a slowdown in shale output  The nation s oil stockpiles have shrunk in nine of the last 10 weeks and are down more than 70 million barrels since March 
The Shift into  Backwardation   Recently  the front month Brent contract have shifted into  backwardation    a phenomenon when near term oil futures trade at a premium to futures dated further out  Analysts consider this as a bullish signal with the so called backwardated market helping flush out inventories by eliminating the incentive to put oil in storage 
Fall in Rig Count  According to Baker Hughes  the GE owned company s closely watched weekly report  the oil rig count has gone down for a third week in four  This implies that U S  energy firms are cutting down on their capital investment plans in reaction to low crude prices  Importantly  this is an indicator of lower future production 
OPEC Curbs Are Working  According to the oil cartel s latest monthly report  OPEC production fell by 79 000 barrels a day in August  This points to the success of the 14 member group s output curb initiatives and rising compliance levels 
Oil Demand Estimates Upped  Energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year  helping to tighten the market significantly 
3 Energy Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio
One thing the oil market downturn has taught investors  nobody has much visibility into the future  So  when you think of something as a clear line of sight one quarter  it can soon be overshadowed by an unforeseen event  While the major price correction has resulted in attractive valuations  we nevertheless advise investors to exercise caution while selecting stocks 
With a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver attractive returns  While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers  this is where the Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy 
The Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps you to trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and risk tolerance  To learn more about how you can use this proven system for market beating gains  visit  
Based on favorable Zacks Ranks  we have zeroed in on three energy stocks with strong fundamentals and growth potential 
First on our list is Fort Worth  TX based Range Resources Corp    NYSE RRC    Range Resources  a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  is an independent oil and gas company  engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties primarily in the southwestern  Appalachian and Gulf Coast regions of the U S  You can see  
The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this company is 48 cents  representing some 1 494 9  earnings per share growth over 2016  Next year s average forecast is 61 cents  pointing to another 28  growth on the back of expanding margins from cost control and capital efficiencies 
TransCanada Corporation   TO TRP    another  1 Ranked stock  looks well positioned for growth  Based in Calgary  Alberta  the North American energy infrastructure company is the owner of premier pipeline network systems that guarantee  TransCanada s low risk business model and high quality assets offers multiple platforms for visible growth 
As a result  the company s expected EPS growth rate for three to five years currently stands at 10   comparing favorably with the  growth rate of 9 7  
Houston  TX based W T Offshore Inc    NYSE WTI   is our last pick  The Zacks Rank  2  Buy  exploration and production company focuses primarily in the U S  Gulf of Mexico 
W T Offshore has an excellent earnings surprise history  With phenomenal drilling success in its high value deepwater exploration projects  the company has a 100  track of outperforming estimates over the last four quarters at an impressive average rate of 586 7  
3 Names to Steer Clear Of
Choosing stocks to dump from your portfolio is equally risky as there are so many to be avoided  At the same time  identifying vicious stocks and discarding them at the right time is the key to shield oneself from big losses or make profits by short selling them  In particular  it would make sense to avoid companies that carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank 
One of the largest independent liquid petroleum products pipeline and terminal operators in the U S   Buckeye Partners L P    NYSE BPL   is a risky bet that ordinary investors should exit 
Struggling with less favorable business conditions and decline in marine terminal capacity utilization  the Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  partnership reported lower than expected second quarter earnings  Moreover  negative earnings estimates have pushed Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 down from  3 49 to  3 44 per share over the last 30 days 
San Antonio  TX based NuStar Energy L P    NYSE NS    a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock  delivered disappointing second quarter results and is witnessing downward revisions in earnings estimates  NuStar is a master limited partnership that engages in the transportation and storage of crude oil as well as refined products in the U S   the Netherlands Antilles  Canada  Mexico  and the U K 
Crude s historic decline has undoubtedly impacted the demand for transportation and storage services  which justifies the 5 6  downward revision in 2017 earnings estimate over the last 30 days 
Basic Energy Services Inc    NYSE BAS    headquartered in Fort Worth  TX  is a top provider of well servicing rigs and equipments 
Stung by the tepid demand for oil related services  lower utilization and a competitive market  the  4 Ranked company has a dismal track of missing estimates over the last three quarters

33025,254540,NS,5 Sell Ranked Energy Stocks With Declining Estimates To Avoid,opinion,Despite President Trump s pro oil policies and OPEC s efforts to rejuvenate the oil industry  the energy sector s bumpy ride continues  Though oil prices have recovered from their historical lows  prices still remain low  Commodity s woes continue as prices linger around  50 per barrel While OPEC and other major producers  have been taking efforts to help crude prices improve  increase in North American shale output continues to be a laggard  OPEC s efforts to trim output and achieve a balance in demand and supply have stabilized the market to a large extent  However  in the process it has also enabled shale drillers to reap greater produce With production remaining strong and commodity demand lagging supply  the oil industry s prospects are dependent on the conflicts arising from OPEC driven output cuts and increased U S  shale production  Per Energy Information Administration s  EIA  latest inventory release  U S  production rose to 9 5 million barrels a day   the highest in the last two years  This was prior to the drop in U S  Gulf of Mexico oil volumes due to Hurricane Harvey Harvey led to the shutdown of various refineries  This led to the refinery utilization falling to the lowest levels since 2010  It has also reduced the demand for crude which translated into low oil prices  However  with refineries gearing up to resume operations  oil prices are expected to move up gradually Nevertheless  volatility of commodity prices along with the rising shale production are likely to delay the recovery process of the market  Oil Energy ranks 15 among the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification  Year to date  the  sector has declined by almost 10  against the S P 500 market s growth of more than 11  Thus  given the uncertain prospects of the industry  it will be wise for investors to reshuffle their portfolio and get rid of stocks that may dent returns How to Identify Underperforming Stocks Getting rid of underperforming stocks at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selecting stocks to dump could be a bit tricky as there are so many to be avoided  However  with the assistance of our   one can locate stocks with a red flag One could begin by selecting stocks that have lost more than 5  year to date  Further  stocks that witnessed

5 Houston  TX based National Oilwell is a world leader in the designing  manufacturing and selling of comprehensive systems  components  products  and equipment used in oil and gas drilling and production worldwide Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12 5  on the back of strong contribution from its  Wellbore Technologies  and  Completion and Production Solutions  segments National Oilwell has an impressive track record of earnings surprise history  courtesy of its cost reduction initiatives and improved efficiencies  The company delivered average positive earnings surprise of 18 95  in the trailing four quarters National Oilwell Varco  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise     Factors at PlayPrices of oil at the end of the fourth quarter were  60 46 per barrel  up about 12 5  and 19 6  year over year and sequentially  respectively  Improving energy landscape is attributed to tightening supplies  brighter demand outlook and OPEC deal extension talks  The energy equipment supplier is likely to realize the benefit of recovering commodity price environment Rising momentum in the U S  markets and modest improvement in international markets along with increasing demand are likely to improve the revenues of the company  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  1 936 million for the quarter  up 14 4  and 5 5  year over year and sequentially  respectively Robust performance from onshore levered Wellbore Technologies segment is likely to buoy the company s top line this quarter as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Wellbore Technology segment in the quarter under review is  725 million compared with  693 million reported in third quarter 2017 and  531 million recorded in the year ago quarter We believe that the company s cost containment efforts and solid project execution will lead to positive results  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of EBITDA for the Wellbore Technology segment is pegged at  108 million  significantly higher than  20 million recorded in the year ago quarter  The figure is also ahead of the prior quarter s EBITDA of 94 million Further  the Completion and Production Solutions segment is also expected to drive the company s results  The estimates of the backlog for the Completion   Production Solutions segment is  972 million compared with  818 million recorded in the year ago quarter  Consequently  the segment s revenue is pegged at  712 million in the quarter under review  reflecting an increase of 4 4  and 18 3  from the prior quarter and the year ago level  respectively During the quarter  the company reconstituted its offshore focused business segments by combining Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarkets into a single unit named Rig Technologies  The company also expects its Rig Technologies segment to deliver better results than the prior quarter What Does Our Model Unveil Our proven model shows that National Oilwell is likely to beat earnings in the to

33064,254579,NS,Suncor  SU  Warming Up To Q4 Earnings  What s In The Offing ,opinion,Suncor Energy Inc    NYSE SU   will release fourth quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Feb 7 In the preceding period  the Canadian energy giant reported better than expected results on pricing and production gains along with reduced expenses Moreover  the company also displays a good history when it comes to beating earnings estimates  Suncor surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 30 24  Suncor Energy Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Which Way are Estimates Treading Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before the earnings release The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents for the current quarter earnings has been revised upward by 11 cents over the last 30 days  It reflects about 106 9  growth from the year ago quarter Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  6 660 million for the quarter compared with  6 099 million in the prior year quarter Factors at PlaySuncor is expected to realize the benefits of higher volumes from its major project Oil Sands operations  Holding one of the largest positions in the oil sands with the potential of greater long term returns  the company has a competitive edge over its peers  Last month  the company provided fourth quarter update  wherein it stated that its production volumes at Oil Sands  was 447 000 barrels per day  Bbl d  including 6 000 Bbl d from Fort Hills project  reflecting 3 1  rise from the year ago quarter However  the company s production at Syncrude fell to 174 000 Bbl d in the fourth quarter  which reflects a decline of around 7  amid operational challenges  Further  the company s international and offshore exploration and production assets  volumes also reduced to 115 000 barrels of oil equivalent  BOE d  as against 118 100 BOE d a year ago As such  Suncor s total upstream production in the quarter came in at 736 000 BOE d  reflecting a marginal decline from the  738 500 BOE d recorded in the prior year quarter   The production also decreased from third quarter 2017 level of 739 900 BOE d However  the lower volumes are likely to be offset from higher price realizations  driving the company s overall revenues  Prices of oil at the end of the fourth quarter were  60 46 per barrel  up about 12 5  and 19 6  year over year and sequentially  respectively  Improving energy landscape is attributed to tightening supplies  brighter demand outlook and OPEC deal extension talks Further  the company s refinery utilization came at 94  versus 93  in fourth quarter 2016  Also the crude throughput in the quarter was 433 000 Bbl d as against 427 300 Bbl d in the year ago quarter  Refined product demand and distillate sales also grew in the quarter compared to the year ago period We believe that that higher commodity prices and better refining and marketing operations year over year will counter the slightly weaker production volumes in the quarter Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Suncor will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 60 cents Zacks Rank  Suncor carries a Zacks Rank  2   You can see Though a Zacks Rank  2 increases the

33094,254609,NS,Marathon Petroleum  MPC  Q3 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   is set to release its third quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Thursday  Oct 27 
In the preceding three month period  the Findlay  OH based downstream operator delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12 63  owing to improved merchandise margins and contribution from new and existing pipeline 
Coming to earnings surprise history  the company has a mixed record  its missed estimates in 2 of the last four quarters  resulting in an average negative surprise of 9 10  MARATHON PETROL Price and EPS Surprise

   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
U S  refiners have been struggling this year with the existing stocks of refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   remaining at their maximum seasonal levels in at least 20 years despite healthy demand  Consequently  margins have narrowed forcing some of the operators to announce production cuts  postpone capital spending and retrench employees  No doubt  Marathon Petroleum has a terrible industry rank   in the bottom 38  overall 
However  the company s earnings are likely to benefit from lower direct operating costs driven by the drop in purchased energy expenses  Secondly  Marathon Petroleum s  Speedway   convenience stores  unit is primed for another strong quarter as lower gasoline prices continued to drive demand amid cost cutting measures  And finally  the  Pipeline Transportation  segment   with its stable fee based income   will provide much needed support to the first quarter results 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marathon Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  That is not the case here as you will see below     
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 77 cents 
Zacks Rank  Marathon Petroleum has a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Petroleum  here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter

33127,254642,NS,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Conoco  Williams Partners  Asset Sales  NuStar s Permian Push And More,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices tightened their grip over the  50 a barrel level  while natural gas futures fell from a 2 month high 
On the news front  multinational oil company ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   and energy infrastructure operator Williams Partners L P    NYSE WPZ   agreed to sell their respective assets in separate multibillion dollar deals  while another pipeline operator NuStar Energy L P    NYSE NS   became the latest firm to join the Permian rush with a  1 5 billion acquisition

33129,254644,NS,Peek Into Oil Q1 Earnings On Apr 24  HAL  PDS  RRC   NS,opinion,We are entering the heart of the Q1 earnings season  with more than 50  S P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of next week Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q1 results from 57 S P 500 members that combined account for 16 2  of the index s total market capitalization  According to our latest  report  total earnings for these companies are up 18 7  from the same period last year on 6 4  higher revenues  with 75 4  positive earnings surprises and 54 4  beating revenue estimates At this stage  we don t have any results from the  Energy  sector  However  quite a few companies have earnings lined up to release results pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report With a market thumping 24  return   Energy  was the top performing S P sector in 2016  The incredible gains of last year stoked high expectations going into 2017 Let s take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the first three months of this year Q1 Report Card  Prices Move Lower but Recover from Year Ago LowsDespite hope offered by the biggest oil deal in a decade and a new pro fossil fuel administration in the White House  crude prices incurred a loss of almost 6  for the first quarter as traders focused on the rising flood of U S  shale driven production  In other words  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent  in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more  With the recent uptick in U S  shale production putting more pressure on the market  oil ended the first quarter at  50 60 per barrel  5 8  lower than year end 2016 prices Natural gas fared worse  dropping more than 14  in the Jan Mar period  thanks to one of the mildest winters on record  A warmer winter translated into tepid requirement for the heating fuel and upended demand forecasts Despite the sequential fall  both oil and natural gas prices are in a sweet spot compared to the corresponding period of 2016  While crude slumped to a 12 year low  natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years Year over Year Gains Lead to Bullish ExpectationsEnding the dismal trend from the past few quarters  a look back at the Q4 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil Energy sector finally turned the corner  driving the aggregate growth picture for the S P 500 index The Oct Dec 2016 period turned out to be a rather good one with the OPEC deal and extreme weather conditions engineering a hefty rise in oil and gas prices during the fourth quarter A historic OPEC production cut agreement  together with help from non OPEC producers saw oil prices end the year at  53 72 a barrel  representing a gain of 11 4  sequentially and 45  for the year  Meanwhile  natural gas embarked on its own upward journey  with futures jumping around 25  just in the fourth quarter  Ending the year at  3 724 per million Btu  MMBtu    up 59  from 2015   the heating fuel was buoyed by a cold snap that translated into strong demand As a result  following eight back to back quarters of earnings declines  analysts said that the sector was likely to get better in the fourth quarter and clock its first positive earnings growth after two years  With estimate revisions going up following OPEC s Algeria grandstand  the Oil Energy sector s earnings were expected to improve handsomely from the fourth quarter 2015 levels True to the predictions  the sector came out swinging  For the sector components on the S P 500 index  total Q4 earnings were up 17 1  on 2 0  higher revenues The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q1 earnings season as well  This is not surprising  considering that oil and gas both fell to multi year lows in the year ago period  In fact  the  Energy  sector is set to turn around from a modest loss in the year earlier period to improving positive earnings this quarter Importantly  as per our analysis  the aggregate dollar amount of earnings increase for the Energy sector is the highest of all 16 Zacks sectors  with Energy expected to earn a total of  7 7 billion in Q1 against a loss  1 6 billion in the year earlier quarter  The top line is likely to show an impressive growth of 32 4  from the first quarter 2016 levels Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Apr 24Let s see what s in store for four energy companies expected to come up with first quarter numbers on Monday  Apr 24 One of the largest oilfield service providers in the world  Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL   is expected to report before the opening bell  In the fourth quarter of 2016  this Houston  TX headquartered provider of equipment  maintenance  and engineering and construction services beat estimates handily  helped by continued and effective cost management Coming to earnings surprise history  the company has an excellent record  it s been ahead of estimates in each of the last four quarters However  earnings beat looks unlikely for Halliburton this time around  This is because  as per our proven model  a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to beat earnings You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  For the quarter to be reported  Halliburton has an Earnings ESP of  25 00   while it carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult   Read more   Simultaneously  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise    Headquartered in Calgary  Alberta  Precision Drilling Corp    NYSE PDS   is another oilfield services provider set to report first quarter 2017 results ahead of market opening  The company   which supplies its customers in the oil and gas industry with drilling  completion and production services   has an excellent track of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters But our model does not indicate that Precision Drilling is likely to beat on earnings this time around  as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   You can see  Precision Drilling Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    We then have upstream entity Range Resources Corp    NYSE RRC   coming up with quarterly numbers after the closing bell  Based in Fort Worth  TX  Range Resources is an independent energy producer  with primary focus on the southwestern  Appalachian and Gulf Coast regions of the U S While lower commodity prices pushed the company to a fourth quarter loss  the situation is likely to reverse this time around Powered with the right combination of the two key ingredients   an Earnings ESP of  47 06  and a Zacks Rank  3   our proven model shows that an earnings beat is expected for Range Resources in the to be reported quarter Range Resources Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Lastly  there is pipeline operator NuStar Energy L P    NYSE NS   coming up with Jan Mar operational results before the opening bell  Structured as a master limited partnership  NuStar engages in the transportation and storage of crude oil as well as refined products in the U S   the Netherlands Antilles  Canada  Mexico  and the U K As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the partnership is on a bit of a slippery surface  having failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two reports Our model does not indicate that NuStar is likely to beat on earnings this time around too  as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   While a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult Nustar Energy L P  Price and EPS Surprise    Will You

33150,254665,NS,Natural Gas Liquids  Lesser Known Side Of The Shale Revolution ,opinion,"Many people think of fossil fuels as coal  crude oil and natural gas  with the nastiness of their toxic emissions lying in that order  Among the less colorful comments during the second Presidential debate was Hillary Clinton s reference to natural gas as a  bridge  fuel  sitting between today s reliance on hydrocarbons and a future of renewables  solar  wind and so on   Methane  or  to use its Chemical symbols  CH4 since it combines four hydrogen atoms with one Carbon atom   is colloquially known as natural gas  and is the simplest and cleanest burning fuel  It is helping the U S  limit its carbon footprint since as the Shale Revolution has made it plentiful domestically  it s replacing far dirtier coal as the fuel of choice for power plants 
Natural Gas Liquids  NGLs  are a set of hydrocarbons that lie between Methane  also called  Dry  Gas   and the lightest blends of crude oil  such as Naphtha   Methane is often extracted mixed with NGLs and crude oil  It s used for residential gas stoves and heating  electricity generation and  when chilled to  260F turns to Liquid Natural Gas  LNG  in which form it can be transported by ship  The mix of NGLs and oil found in a well with methane affects the value of the play since after being separated from the dry gas the NGLs can be put to other purposes   Wet  gas wells that contain more NGLs often generate more attractive returns as NGLs fetch higher prices 
The energy infrastructure business provides the ability to gather and process the mix of hydrocarbons into Gas  NGLs and Crude Oil  Dry gas then is piped to customers  crude oil heads to storage   refiners  and NGLs are sent to fractionation plants  By exploiting their different boiling points the NGLs are then separated into into their components  Ethane  C2H6   Propane  C3H8   Butane C4H10   Iso Butane  C4H10 with tertiary carbon   and natural gasoline  C5    Although NGLs are gases  their production is usually expressed in barrels a day  like oil  The conversion is based on energy equivalence  so a barrel of an NGL has the same energy output measured in BTUs  British Thermal Units  as a barrel of oil  Nothing gets moved in barrels anymore  but the industry has retained it as a common measure of volume 
Although often ignored  NGLs are significant  The U S currently produces 3 6MMBD  Millions of Barrels a Day  of NGLs  Compare this with U S shale oil production of 4 5MMBD and it s a big business in its own right 
Ethane is most readily found with methane  although it s also a by product of refining crude oil  Some portion of ethane can be left in the gas stream for residential and commercial use if its price doesn t justify separating it out  However  by far its most important use is as a feedstock for petrochemical plants to produce polyethylene  the most commonly created organic compound in the world  It winds up as plastics in various forms with thousands of ultimate uses across consumer products as packaging  containers  plastic bags carpeting and clothing  including swimwear   As the U S  steps up its production of ethane  the low price caused by America s shift towards energy independence is leading to a substantial cost advantage in polyethylene production  Currently the U S produces 1 3MMBD of ethane 
Credit for the first  of polyethylene generally goes to Imperial Chemical Industries  ICI  in the UK in 1933 
Propane exists as a gas at temperatures above  44F  but turns to a liquid under pressure when it occupies 1 270th of the space  allowing it to be stored in propane tanks and bottles  such as the one under your gas grill outside   It has many other uses as a fuel from heating homes  particularly mobile homes which often lack a permanent connection to the local gas supply  to drying crops  The U S produces 1 15MMBD of Propane  Butane is the fuel in pocket lighters  the propellant in aerosols  and is blended with gasoline during the summer to reduce pollution  it s the vapors that come out while you re pumping   Iso butane is primarily used to increase the octane in gasoline while making it cleaner burning  The U S produces 300MMBD each of butane and i butane 
The chart below shows forecast growth in NGLs  referred to as  Natural Gas Plant Liquids   provided by the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  in their 2016 Annual Energy Outlook 

The first point of this brief summary on NGLs is to illustrate that the composition and uses of the hydrocarbons we produce vary enormously  Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  own and operate the pipelines  storage assets and processing facilities that handle this output  which includes providing treatment and separation of methane from the NGLs with which it s found  They process the mixed NGLs into their individual components  providing storage and then transportation of the pure products to their end users 
The second point is that  just as natural gas and crude oil production look set to continue growing in the U S   so does NGL output  Their increasing use is another side to the story of energy independence  Moreover  exports are increasingly driving this growth  as recently as 2014 the U S  was a net importer of ethane  and marine exports were not considered economically viable 

According to the EIA  U S  production of ethane and propane have substantially exceeded demand in recent years  This has led to ethane at times being  rejected   meaning some portion of it is left with the methane in the natural gas supply rather than being separated out  But the growing supply of ethane has also has led to significant investments in petrochemical plants and export capacity 
Ethane exports were non existent before 2014 when two pipelines came online to ship it to petrochemical complexes in Canada  Pembina s  PBA  Vantage pipeline recently added 70KBD  Thousands of Barrels a Day  of capacity from North Dakota  and Sunoco Logistics  SXL  moves 50KBD from their Mariner West line in southwestern Pennsylvania  In March of this year the first waterborne ethane left SXL s Marcus Hook terminal on the Delaware River just south of Philadelphia  headed for Norway  Subsequent for Norway have also left from Texas  Just as the U S  is selling methane to the Middle East  a region not exactly short of it  see Coals to Newcastle   we re able to sell to Norway even though they produce almost equivalent of crude oil  NGLs and natural gas 
In July  refrigerated ships began taking ethane from Enterprise Products Partners   NYSE EPD  200KBD Morgan s Point terminal  now the largest ethane export facility in the world  on the Houston Ship Channel  We are in the middle of the ramp up now as ethane export capacity is expected to increase from 65KBD in 2015 to almost 400KBD by the end of next year  Additionally  Kinder Morgan s  NYSE KMI  50KBD pipeline from eastern Ohio is expected to come online early 2018  Adding in propane and butane docks  the U S will have waterborne Liquid Petroleum Gas  LPG  NGLs when they re condensed to liquid form for transport  capacity of 1 5MMBD by 2017  This includes 1 2MMBD on the gulf coast held by Targa Resources  NYSE TRGP   EPD  Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY   and Sunoco Logistics Partners  NYSE SXL   There s an additional 275KBD in the northeast being developed by Energy Transfer Partners  ETP  and SXL  In other words  there s a lot of energy infrastructure being built that will increase MLP cashflows 
Domestic processing of ethane into ethylene has risen by almost a third in the last three years  Demand from ethylene producers for ethane feedstock is expected to soak up another 600KBD in the next five years  a more than 50  jump from today s level  Propane can be converted into polypropylene  with similarly wide application in plastics to polyethylene although polypropylene is produced as a clear plastic whereas polyethylene is opaque  like a milk jug  Polypropylene production capacity has tripled since 2013 and is expected to consume another 135KBD of propane in the next five years  With all the new demand for NGLs  pipeline capacity is being expanded in multiple regions  Examples include Oneok Partners   NYSE OKS  Bakken NGL network  EPD s Aegis system on the Gulf of Mexico and EPD s ATEX line from the Northeast to the gulf  SXL s Mariner East line 
New pipelines are being built  such as KMI s Utica Marcellus Texas pipeline  and idle ones re purposed  including a JV between EPD and Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  called Centennial  Another example is NuStar s  NYSE NS  Mont Belvieu line to Corpus Christi 
The picture of widespread investment in new midstream energy assets is clear enough  Last year s sellers of MLPs gave no heed to the secular theme that is unfolding 
The chart below shows how the petrochemical industry is gearing up to process increasing volumes of ethan and propane into plastics 


Natural gas and crude oil for power generation tend to dominate the headlines about the Shale Revolution  But the associated production of NGLs and their use in wide scale production of plastics represents a growing and increasingly important part of the economics of domestic hydrocarbon production  Fully utilizing this resource is another driver of demand for new energy infrastructure  another source of growth for MLPs  Unsurprisingly  we are invested in many of the names listed  often through their General Partner  GP  since that s where the returns to growth are best realized 
Disclosure  Of the names mentioned above  we are invested in the following  EPD  Energy Transfer Equity  ETE  GP of ETP and SXL   KMI  NuStar GP Holdings  NSH  the GP of NS   Oneok  OKE  the GP of OKS   PBA  PSX  GP to PSXP  and TRGP ",2016-10-17,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/natural-gas-liquids--the-lesser-known-side-of-the-shale-revolution-200159022,200159022
33152,254667,NS,Are Oil MLPs Still Viable ,opinion,"The collapse of oil prices in 2014 15 has caused many energy master limited partnerships  MLPs  to cut their distributions  and some of them may even become insolvent 
Nevertheless  not all energy MLPs are invested in oil production  and many in other sectors of the energy space still have reliable payouts 
Apart from the risky but enjoyable refinery MLPs  many energy MLPs can provide reliable income   as long as their business models are solid and they re not dependent on energy prices or on sources that may dry up 
Somewhere Down the Line
MLPs have the great advantage of paying no corporate tax  provided at least 90  of net income is distributed to shareholders 
In practice  many MLPs go well beyond this limit  paying distributions out of cash flow or even borrowing to pay distributions when cash flow is inadequate 
That makes them dangerous investments  especially when cash flow can change sharply as a result of  say  declining oil prices  My colleague Alan Gula recently wrote a column about these dangers and the  dividend death watch  
At the same time  the high yields attract income seeking investors  whose investments can then be used to finance more acquisitions and pay even higher distributions 
But eventually it all goes wrong  as happened to Linn Energy  O LINE  in 2015  LINE had to stop paying distributions  and its stock then lost 95  of its value 
It took some time for the drop in oil prices to be reflected in quarterly earnings   and many companies had hedged their sales  thus disguising collapses in operating results through spurious derivatives profits 
But eventually  oil s collapse caught up 
Pipe Down
Today  the main danger isn t from producing companies whose earnings collapse  but from transportation and logistics companies that may run out of product 
Companies set up to service the massive  fracking  boom in domestic oil output that has occurred since 2010 likely did fine in 2015  as fracking investments made in 2013 and 2014 continued to produce at full blast 
However  fracking oil deposits have a very short life   typically 18 to 24 months   so those projects will start to run out in 2016  And with oil at  40 per barrel  they won t be replaced  The price isn t sufficient to justify the capital required 
Thus  pipelines and infrastructure transporting oil from the Marcellus and other oil shales will have difficulty finding products that can be serviced profitably 
MLPs Worth Considering
Nevertheless  there are still a number of MLPs with high yields and cash flow that should cover payouts going forward 
Bear in mind that you should expect a higher yield on these companies than on a bond or a conventional company s distributions  because pipelines and other energy service equipment assets have a finite life  Think of the stock as a 20  to 40 year annuity without assurance of full principal repayment at maturity 
With that in mind  here are three worth considering 
Enterprise Products Partners  N EPD  is a large energy midstream company   50 billion market cap  with operations in natural gas  liquefied petroleum gas  and onshore and offshore pipelines and transportation 
EPD offers a 6 2  yield to conservative investors  However  like most energy MLPs  its  0 385 per quarter distribution exceeds its net income of  1 26 in the last four quarters 
On the other hand  in the first three quarters of 2015  all during the period of lower oil prices  its payouts totaled  2 22 billion  compared with operating cash flow of  2 59 billion  Thus  there s a reasonable margin for hiccups 
Nustar Energy  N NS  is at the extreme end of risk and yield that you should consider  there are  bear in mind  lots of companies whose risk is such that you should not consider them  
NuStar operates in the areas of pipelines  storage  and marketing of petroleum products and anhydrous ammonia in the U S   Canada  Mexico  the Caribbean  and Europe 
It offers a truly juicy yield of 11 7   based on a quarterly distribution of  1 095 
Its distributions in the last four quarters totaled  4 38 per share compared with earnings of  3 23 per share   but in the first three quarters of 2015 its payments totaled  294 million compared with operating cash flow of  375 million 
Finally there s TC PipeLines  N TCP   a Houston based subsidiary of the giant TransCanada pipelines group  TCP is primarily a natural gas pipeline company  owning interests in six pipeline systems in the western and midwestern United States 
It offers a yield of 7 4  based on a current distribution of  0 89  Like EPD but unlike NS  its distribution has been increased regularly by modest amounts 
Again  its payout of  3 56 exceed its last four quarters  earnings of  3 00  but the last three quarters  cost of  178 million was well below operating cash flow of  229 million

33154,254669,NS,The Future Of U S  Shale Gas Hinges On Our Southern Border,opinion,"There s no denying that the United States is currently experiencing a shale gas glut 
Gas fields   such as the Marcellus   are the gifts that keep on giving  Last year  overall U S  production levels hit 74 billion cubic feet per day 
On top of that  the warm U S  winter created a dynamic that s left 2 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas sitting in storage facilities  That s the largest amount ever left over at the end of the heating season  It s even prompted talk about a serious lack of storage capacity by the start of the next heating season 
Between the shale surplus and limited storage  the scenario seems bleak  And the single glimmer of hope for the U S  gas industry is quickly being snuffed out 
The demand for liquefied natural gas  LNG  in Asia has taken a dramatic swan dive off a cliff  With its descent has come an equally shocking decline in value  as well  Prices for LNG in Asia have fallen more than 35  since the start of 2016   even as prices reached  4 40 per million British thermal units  BTUs   which is a record low for this time of year 
And  as I revealed in an earlier article   Gazprom  MCX GAZP  is prepared to launch an all out war on U S  LNG in Europe to defend its territory  And  just like Saudi Arabia before them  the Russians are prepared to jack up supplies and lower prices to ensure continued sales in Europe 
Demand Soars South of the Border
There is  however  one remaining viable option to bail out the U S  natural gas industry   the demand for our natural gas is soaring just south of our borders  in Mexico 
Mexico is transforming itself into a global manufacturing powerhouse  Many electronics  including aerospace parts and flat screen TVs  are produced there 
However  Mexico s auto manufacturing industry is leading the way 
In 2013  Mexico surpassed China as No  1 in foreign direct investment by global automakers 
An estimated five million cars will be built in Mexico within the next five years 
The one item that was holding back Mexican manufacturing was high energy costs  Electricity costs were 47  higher in Mexico than the U S  in 2014 
Last year  that gap closed to 29  thanks to the ongoing move away from fuel oil and other sources  to the use of U S  natural gas 
Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  reports that natural gas now accounts for 60  of Mexico s electric power generation 
In 2015  Mexico imported 2 9 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day  This number will only continue to climb in the years ahead 
According to consultants at IHS Energy  that natural gas import figure will rise to 4 4 billion cubic feet per day by 2020  Other estimates are even more optimistic than the IHS forecast 
The Pipeline Boom
Of course  the gas doesn t make its way to Mexico on its own   it must be transported via pipelines 
The increased need for the transportation of natural gas has led to a boom in the building of pipelines connecting Texas and Mexico  According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch  there are now 14 pipeline projects   costing  7 4 billion and running 2 360 miles   that are either already underway or in the planning stages 
But that s just the start  says Cenagas  the agency that runs the Mexican gas transmission system  A five year plan by the Mexican government calls for the addition of more than 3 000 miles of natural gas pipelines connecting the U S  and Mexico 

A forecast from Platts says pipeline capacity between the two countries will more than double to 14 7 billion cubic feet by 2019  That will leave plenty of spare space for those steadily increasing exports of U S  natural gas making its way to Mexico 
A number of companies are already seeing major benefits from this boom in pipeline building 
Some of the players involved in the Mexican gas pipeline build out are Kinder Morgan Inc  NYSE KMI   Energy Transfer Partners LP  NYSE ETP   Oneok Partn  NYSE OKS   and TransCanada Corp  TO TRPr   Nustar Energy LP  NYSE NS  also has vast storage facilities in Mexico 
Will Economics Trump Politics 
This natural gas boom in Mexico is a win win situation for both Mexico and the U S 
But politics is sure to enter the equation 
One major potential road block would be Donald Trump s vow to build a wall on the Mexican border  If he becomes president  there is a chance he would stop this synergistic energy relationship dead in its tracks 
However  as Mexico is fast becoming an extremely important life preserver for the U S  shale gas industry  it s doubtful that Trump would be able to push forward with his efforts to sever ties with our southern neighbors  Ending our relationship with Mexico may well send the industry over the waterfall without a life preserver

33155,254670,NS,Is Energy Transfer Quietly Fleecing Its Investors  ,opinion,"The Energy Transfer Williams deal has been a rich source of material for this blog  as well as an important driver of MLP performance  Energy Transfer Equity LP  NYSE ETE  was creative in its pursuit of Williams Companies  NYSE WMB   as buyer s remorse quickly set in they were equally creative in pulling all the levers at their disposal to force a renegotiation  As part of this effort to alter the terms of the deal  ETE has taken some steps that transfer wealth directly to ETE CEO Kelcy Warren and other insiders  at the expense of the rest of the ETE unitholders  Whether this was done to drag WMB back to the negotiating table will be clear if the steps are undone once the transaction is deemed to not close  or renegotiated  In other words  ETE management has engaged in blatant preferential self dealing  we re watching to see how it plays out  The SEC filing describing the offending security is  
The original merger agreement consisted of WMB shareholders receiving 1 5274 shares of Energy Transfer Corp  ETC  per WMB share and  8 10 in cash  ETC shares were designed to be worth the same as ETE units  and were created so that WMB investors wouldn t have to deal with the K 1s issued by ETE  On September 28  2015 ETE valued the transaction at  43 50 per WMB share  based on where ETE had been trading just prior to the announcement 
The  8 10 per share in cash promised added up to  6 08BN  and ETE s intention to finance this with debt steadily weighed on the stock price  As ETE fell  the value of the deal to WMB fell  and ETE management quickly concluded that they needed to renegotiate the terms  Whatever overtures were made in this regard evidently did not draw the desired response  so ETE dropped the gloves 
Suppose for a moment you committed to reinvest a portion of your future dividends back into the company you run  this show of confidence would be welcomed  and reinvested dividends typically buy shares at the current price when the dividends are received  The Duncan family has done this with Enterprise Products Partners LP  NYSE EPD   of which they own 34   Or  suppose you felt your company s stock was ludicrously cheap and worth buying  you d get as many shares at today s price as you were willing to pay for  today  NuStar s chairman Bill Greehey continuously does so on the open market with MLP Nustar Energy LP  NYSE NS  and its General Partner NuStar GP Holdings LLC  NYSE NSH  
It seems pretty simple  if you pay today you get today s price  and if you pay in the future you get the future price  But on March 8  Kelcy Warren and a few insiders created for themselves a special that allows them to be both senior in the capital structure to the common unitholders and to buy units of ETE in the future but at a price that s roughly half of where it trades today 
To show how riskless this transaction is for them  the  6 56 price of ETE at which they can buy priced ETE at a yield of 17 37   based on its 4Q15  0 285 quarterly distribution   This is where ETE was trading in early March  Clearly  the market held serious doubts as to whether the distribution was secure  The convertible units ETE has issued require ETE insiders representing 31 5  of the company to invest future distributions in excess of  0 11 per share back into newly issued ETE units  There s a wonderful circularity to this   if the 17 37  yield on ETE from March turns out to be prescient and future distributions to common unitholders are eliminated  the insiders don t have to stump up cash to buy the extra ETE units  But if the 17 37  yield turns out to be a grossly pessimistic forecast  and distributions continue to be paid  the insiders will get to use the distributions paid to buy units at a price whose existence the subsequent payment of distributions has rendered ludicrously low 
Put another way  ETE has raised capital at the exorbitant rate of 17 37   although that capital will only be available to them if they re able to continue paying distributions  which would suggest they didn t need it in the first place  If they are unable to keep paying  the capital won t be there 
It s a form of heads I win  tails you lose  Most investors in a stock that had lost 90  of its value  as was the case with ETE at that stage  would jump at such an opportunity 
But it gets better  The insiders who own this convertible security now have seniority  in that the  0 11 per unit  Preferred Distribution Amount  is paid to them  prior to any distribution on the Partnership s common units   So the new security is really a Convertible Preferred  not simply a Convertible which is what they ve called it in the SEC filing  Kelcy and his friends have moved themselves up in the capital structure 
There s even more though  The insiders get to invest their future distributions back into ETE at the knock down price of  6 56  but even if those distributions are not paid they still get the additional units of ETE  The irony is that ETE only sunk to such a low price because of management s poorly conceived merger proposal  They screwed up so badly they felt entitled to grant themselves additional units at the bargain basement price their actions had caused  To show just how scandalous this new security is  ETE could eliminate their distribution and yet Kelcy and his friends would still receive their  0 11 per unit Preferred Return in cash AND be entitled to 79 million new ETE units without having to pay for them  At today s price this represents a transfer of wealth from the non insiders to Kelcy and friends of over  1 3BN 
This opportunity was only offered to certain accredited investors  Kelcy Warren owns approximately 18  of the partnership  The recipients of this gift from the rest of ETE are essentially the senior management  notably Kelcy himself but also including John McReynolds  President of ETE s General Partner   Matthew Ramsey  President of Energy Transfer Partners   Marshall McCrea III  Group Chief Operating Officer  and Ray Davis  retired  co founder   It d be interesting to hear any of these gentlemen justify their participation  and to reconcile it with their fiduciary obligation to other ETE unitholders 
You d think this kind of egregious self dealing would be illegal  ETE claims that they wanted to offer this opportunity to all the ETE unitholders but because of the merger agreement with WMB they were required to obtain WMB s approval  Under the deal  each WMB share is worth 1 5274 shares of ETC  in effect  ETE   but because the convertible issue took place before closing the deal it had the effect of reducing ETE s purchase price for WMB  The converts will increase the number of ETE units outstanding  thus diluting their value  It alters the terms of the transaction  WMB couldn t possibly agree to this  and so they naturally withheld their approval  ETE went ahead with it anyway  claiming that WMB s failure to approve the converts limited the offering to the select group of insiders noted above  But since WMB couldn t reasonably be expected to approve what was in effect an 11  dilution in the value of the equity portion of the deal  their response wasn t surprising 
We originally thought the converts were issued as part of an aggressive negotiation strategy intended to persuade WMB shareholders to vote against the deal or get WMB s board to agree to altered deal terms  The  6BN cash payment has hung over both stock prices for months  And the SEC filing noted that the proceeds from the foregone distribution payments would be used to pay down debt incurred in conjunction with the WMB transaction  So you might reasonably assume that if the transaction fails to close  the converts won t be needed and Kelcy Warren will remember his fiduciary obligation  He can cancel the issue 
However  ETE s most recent earnings call made clear that these convertible units would remain regardless of the merger closing  The sell side analysts as usual avoided any tough questions  But the biggest question  which wasn t asked  was how Kelcy could justify such abuse of his fellow public ETE unitholders 
Equity investors in ETE are referred to as Limited Partners  But following the issuance of this new security they are no longer partners at all  but rather victims of self dealing by management  owners of an inferior class of securities created by the insiders moving themselves up to a superior position with superior economics for no consideration 
It s not too late for Kelcy to clarify this issue  On the list of CEOs who have performed as honorable stewards of investor capital  you will not find Kelcy Warren  He may be a billionaire  but he is no Warren Buffett  We hope ETE will revisit this abuse of their unitholders and restore their reputation for honest dealing by canceling the issue  Otherwise  why would anybody ever do business with them again 
We are invested in ETE  EPD  NSH and WMB",2016-05-11,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-energy-transfer-quietly-fleecing-its-investors-200129206,200129206
33156,254671,NS,Crude Heading Toward  50  Buy 5 Low Levered Oil Stocks ,opinion,Oil touched multi year lows  raised a panic alarm among investors and led many energy players to bankruptcy  After months of waiting for the commodity to bottom out  it recently started to show a rally  So has oil finally started taking a U turn after its prolonged weakness If we compare the current crude price with the multi year low mark that the commodity touched in February this year  there is definitely a huge improvement  Some analysts are also hopeful of oil touching  50 per barrel in the near term   a level unheard of for a really long time Looking BackThe weakness in oil prices that started in mid 2014 continued in 2015 and spilled over into 2016 and dragged down the markets several times  Data wise  in mid February  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude fell to a 12 year low mark of  26 05 per barrel that also forced the S P 500 index to touch its lowest level since Apr 11  2014 Definitely the continued crude weakness during the beginning of this year hammered energy players during the first quarter  This was reflected in the  report which reveled that the oil energy companies included in the S P 500 index witnessed year over year earnings decline of 107 8  as compared to a fall of 78 6  in fourth quarter 2015  In other words  the magnitude of earnings decline in the first quarter increased significantly from that of fourth quarter 2015 Oil RecoveryNaturally  the  48 08 per barrel mark at which WTI crude closed trading yesterday reflects a remarkable improvement of over 84  from its lowest level in February  This massive recovery primarily came on the back of supply disruption from Nigeria and Canada amid sustained global demand In Nigeria  attacks by a militant group called Delta Avengers on oil installations led to a shut down in production  Nigeria reduced its crude production to 1 4 million barrels per day  bpd   hitting its lowest level in 27 years  The group recently bombed an offshore platform owned by Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX    Among the other attacks  this group targeted a series of refineries and an export terminal In Canada  the Alberta region has been ravaged by a wildfire for two weeks that has threatened the major oil sands  production facilities Those events collectively led The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    NYSE GS   to believe that the oversupplied crude market has taken a turn toward deficit territory  In fact  the firm projects crude to trade around  50 per barrel in the second half of this year  For 2016  the bank predicts average WTI oil at  45 per barrel  much higher than its previous estimate of  38 per barrel Why Low Leverage Players Against this bullish backdrop for oil  investors can pick low leverage companies with good fundamentals to outperform the market  By low leverage firms we mean companies that have a low long term debt to capitalization ratio If we dig a little deeper  we ll see that the prolonged low oil hammered energy players and drowned them in huge debts  Some players even went bankrupt and were delisted from stock exchanges  So  we have opted for low leverage companies Definitely the optimistic run in crude brings good news for upstream energy players as their business is positively correlated to oil price  In fact  exploration and production activities may now be stepped up to tap the long awaited opportunity of selling crude at higher prices Drilling players that assist in exploration and production will also be benefited  Moreover  energy infrastructure players will gain from an expected increase in demand for oil transportation and storage following a likely growth in production Here  we have picked five energy stocks that have a low long term debt to capitalization ratio compared to their industry average  Each player also carries a favorable Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Hercules Offshore Inc    NASDAQ HERO  Houston  TX based Hercules Offshore is an offshore drilling player that provides services to upstream energy players involved in oil and gas exploration and production operations  Long term debt to capitalization ratio for the company is 10 7   which is much lower than industry average of 30 8  Independence Contract Drilling Inc    NYSE ICD  Houston  TX based Independence Contract Drilling is an onshore drilling contractor  The company has a long term debt to capitalization ratio of 20 8   which is lower than industry average ratio of 30 8  Contango Oil   Gas Company   NYSE MCF  Also based in Houston  TX  Contango Oil   Gas has a long term debt to capitalization ratio of 25 2  versus the industry average of 44   This upstream energy player involved in the exploitation and production of oil and gas resources in U S  thus looks well placed World Point Terminals LP   NYSE WPT  St  Louis  MO based World Point Terminals involves in operations like development and acquisition of storage terminals for crude oil  The partnership has a long term debt to capitalization ratio of 0 0  as compared to the industry average of 44 2  NuStar GP Holdings LLC   NYSE NS  San Antonio  TX based NuStar GP Holdings has an ownership interest in NuStar Energy L P    NYSE NS    The partnership involves in the transportation of crude and petroleum products  It has a long term debt to capitalization ratio of 0 0  compared to the industry average of 52 8

33157,254672,NS,Top High Dividend Stocks In 2016,opinion,"Trying to make sense of this market  Join the club   it s been a topsy turvy ride so far in 2016  with the market getting off to its worst start in history  thanks to the December Fed rate hike  and plunging oil prices 
Then  in early February  oil prices bottomed  and the market started coming back  This chart uses the USO  NYSE USO  oil ETF as a proxy for oil  It s a pretty good directional correlation between oil and the S P 500 

Investors have flocked to the Utilities sector in 2016 for its defensive attributes  and also to the Basic Materials sector  in order to profit on extremely beaten down Energy and Basic Materials stocks  Even with their out sized gains in 2016  these 2 sectors still have the highest dividend yields in the market 

So  after all of that support  how do their valuations stack up vs  other sectors  Basic Materials still has the lowest average Price Book and Price Sales  with Utilities near the low end for Price Book and in the middle for Price Sales  It s hard to use P E across the board to compare sectors  though  since so many Energy and Basic Materials stocks use an alternate metric  Price to Distributable Cash Flow to value their earnings 
Healthcare  a former front runner over the past few years  has gotten very little market support  thanks to political and headline pressures  Its P E is also skewed higher by richly valued biotech stocks 

Here are the top 10 performing high dividend stocks so far in 2016  We screened for positive earnings  a 5  plus dividend yield  and positive ROE and ROA  Not surprisingly  there are a few familiar names in this list   Dynagas LNG Partners LP  NYSE DLNG  and KNOT Offshore Partners LP  NYSE KNOP   some shipping stocks which we wrote about last month  and DCP Midstream Partners LP  NYSE DPM   which we covered in a Seeking Alpha article 
Here s the glaring paradox about these stocks   even though they re up by big percentages in 2016  they re mostly still down over the past year   DLNG  for example  is up over 52  in 2016  but it s down over  22  over the past year  It shows you how extremely beaten down these stocks were  that this could be possible 

Valuations  Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP  NYSE BIP  has the cheapest Price Book  but its P E is high  However  on a Price to Funds From Operations basis   P FFO   it looks cheaper  at 11 85x 

Top Performing Basic Materials Dividend Stocks  4 out of 5 are Oil and Gas Pipeline stocks   investors definitely got the news that fee based pipeline businesses weren t going under anytime soon  even with cheap crude oil sloshing through the system 

Valuations  The 4 pipeline stocks have something else in common   take a look at how much lower their forward P E s are   clearly  analysts see better things ahead for them 
Nustar Energy LP  NYSE NS  and Sprague Resources LP  NYSE SRLP  also have options available 

Cone Midstream Partners LP  NYSE CNNX  is the winner in this group for margin  while Sprague Resources LP  NYSE SRLP  has the strongest ROE

33158,254673,NS,MLPs Not Being Helped By Investment Bankers,opinion,"Several MLPs released earnings last week  Results were mixed  November is seasonally a weak month  see    and many investors are weary of the sector after its second ever worst year  So reports below expectations resulted in steep drops  while good earnings caused modest ones 
Plains All America  N PAA   which is in the crosshairs of the drop in U S  crude oil production as the largest crude oil pipeline operator  met 3Q15 expectations but lowered 4Q15 guidance and didn t provide any for 2016  which drew a sharply negative reaction  Their current distribution of  2 80 yields just under 10   There s no plausible risk of it being cut and flat 2016 growth should be followed by a resumption of growth in 2017 
Plains GP Holdings  N PAGP   PAA s GP  yields 7 2   having just increased its distribution 21  year on year  At  12 82  PAGP is down almost 60  from its August 2014 high of  31 55 
What s probably not well understood is that PAGP has only  559MM of debt  The  10 2BN of long term debt they show on their consolidated balance sheet is mostly  9 7BN at the PAA level  With  617MM of distributions coming to PAGP from PAA  and a public float of only  2 8BN  65  is already owned by management and entities with board representation   PAGP could easily take itself private through an LBO  They d simply switch public equity holders for debt  increasing their upside exposure by 50  by using what the company would have paid in dividends to service the debt  This would not be a good outcome for public unitholders since the price is so low  but would represent an opportunistic roundtrip for the insiders who only took PAGP public two years ago at almost twice today s price 
NuStar  N NS  lowered 2016 guidance due to reduced volumes out of the Eagle Ford in Texas  and its price fell sharply as a result  Crude oil pipelines represent a quarter of NS s EBITDA and gasoline and distillate pipelines comprise 30  while Storage of refined products and crude oil represents just under half  they have a small marketing business   The Storage business did well  the silver lining of excess crude production is increased demand for places to put it  They are at capacity and are raising prices on renewals  Neither NS nor its GP  Nustar GP Holdings  N NSH  are growing their distributions at present  although we believe that will eventually happen  Meanwhile  NS and NSH yield 9 6  and 8 9  respectively  Energy Transfer Equity s  N ETE  three MLPs  Sunoco  N SUN   Sunoco Logistics  N SXL  and Energy Transfer Partners LP  N ETP   all had good quarters but nonetheless sold off 
Enlink Midstream Partners  N ENLK  modestly exceeded expectations but its price fell nonetheless  Its GP  EnLink Midstream  N ENLK   yields 5  and reaffirmed its guidance for 15  distribution growth in 2016  ENLC purchased ENLK units recently alleviating all equity capital requirements in the near term 
The biggest shock of the past week though was the announcement by Targa Resources that its GP  N TRGP  will buy in its MLP  N NGLS   While operationally Targa is well run  its strategic mis steps are breathtaking 
In the Summer of 2014  negotiations to sell itself to Energy Transfer Equity  ETE  broke down when TRGP was trading at  150  At that time  management argued the stock was undervalued  Now  having lost fully two thirds of its value  they see fit to issue TRGP shares in order to buy in NGLS  The case in favor for NGLS investors is a lower cost of capital and modestly better distribution coverage  although they ll be receiving a lower distribution from TRGP than they were from NGLS  
As with the Kinder Morgan  N KMI  transaction  the NGLS assets move to TRGP with a stepped up cost basis  eliminating TRGP s tax obligation for many years but at the expense of being a taxable transaction now for NGLS unitholders  The 18  premium that TRGP is paying for NGLS is intended to compensate but in our view is needlessly generous  Most significantly for us  TRGP is foregoing the GP MLP structure  which sacrifices valuable flexibility and is one of their most attractive features 
The GP is also a prized acquisition target  The market reaction was swift  and by day s end investors in both securities were worse off than if the transaction hadn t been announced  We think management may be acting defensively to pre empt a bid for TRGP in the same way that Williams Companies  N WMB  sought to buy its MLP  Williams Partners  N WPZ  before eventually agreeing to sell itself to ETE 
Leon Cooperman  whose Omega fund is a significant investor in TRGP  noted the 8  drop in the stock price and dryly asked on the conference call   did the advisors that worked through this transaction with you expect this type of market reaction   Since investors in both TRGP and NGLS saw a substantial loss in value on the announcement  and since TRGP management has shown themselves to be strategically inept  one would think that shareholder approval of the deal is by no means certain and perhaps even a hostile bid will appear to relieve TRGP of its burdensome stewards  We would be supportive of such  TRGP needs new leadership 
The deal hurt valuations of other GPs as investors considered where else investment bankers might show up  The MLP GP is the most attractive place to be in the MLP structure  and TRGP s apparent rejection of it has led to selling of other GPs and left investors puzzled  In recent weeks they ve persuaded Kinder Morgan  KMI  to issue dilutive  poorly structured securities  see MLP Earnings Offer Scant Support for Bears and Rich Kinder Gets Outplayed  and now destroyed value for TRGP NGLS  We d all be better off if Wall Street bankers refrained from offering any more help  and let the industry just get on with its business

33159,254674,NS,Trading In 2016 Kicks Off With 467 Point Dow Decline,opinion,"DOW   276   17 148SPX   31   2012NAS   104   490310 YR    02   2 25 OIL    11   36 93GOLD   13 50   1075 50
The Dow started the morning with a 467 point decline  An inauspicious start to trading in 2016 kicked off  or more accurately fell down  this morning in China  Traders in Shanghai reacted to growing tensions in the Middle East and a drop in one of China s manufacturing gauges  Fresh manufacturing surveys revived concerns about Beijing s economic slowdown 
China s manufacturing activity contracted for the 10th straight month in December   the official manufacturing PMI stood at 49 7 in December  The yuan  which began new extended trading hours today  also hit its lowest point in more than four years in both onshore and offshore trade 
The China CSI 300 Index dropped 5  and that triggered circuit breakers that resulted in a 30 minute halt in trading of all stocks  When trading resumed  the traders were scared and they rushed to exit their positions  In a matter of about 7 minutes  the Index dropped to a loss of 7   and the next round of circuit breakers triggered a halt to trading for the remainder of the day 
The benchmark Shanghai Composite index closed the shortened session down 6 85  while the broader CSI 300 index  encompassing the largest listed firms by market capitalization in Shanghai and Shenzhen  slid by 6 98   The small cap CSI 500 index fared even worse  finishing the day down 8 27  
From there  the bad vibes in the market spread  the Nikkei in Japan dropped 3 1  even as the yen rallied on a safe haven play  the Hong Kong Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 3 7    The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 2 6   capping its worst start of the year ever as almost 580 of its companies fell  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index lost 3 5   its worst day since August  when China devalued its currency  Benchmark gauges in South Korea  Taiwan  Malaysia  South Africa and Poland lost more than 2  
The first trading day of the year does not seem to have any predictive capacity to tell us the direction of trading for the rest of the year  It s about a 50 50 chance that the market follows the first day of trading in the year  Still  yesterday was a big drop and it makes us look at historic data 
For example  in 1932  the market started the year trading down 6 9   in 2001 the markets lost 2 8  on the first day of trading  We can include first day trading losses of under 2  in the 5 worst first days of trade including 1949  1980  and 1983  Of the 5 worst  2 came at the start of down years  and 3 came at the start of up years for the market 
Still you could be forgiven if you are concerned that today portends a theme in the markets  For global investors  China is a critical piece of the growth puzzle  As the second largest economy  China drives demand around the world in commodities  consumer goods and other sectors 
The government has been trying to increase growth through stimulus measures and it has moved aggressively to prop up the stock market with a series of policy actions  The latest economic data and the big drop in their stock markets cast doubts about whether those measures are working  We don t know and we will only know in time  but if today is any indication we may be in for a boatload of volatility 
Two Fed chiefs came out today to say they re not worried about China  Federal Reserve Bank presidents  Loretta Mester of Cleveland and John Williams of San Francisco  basically said a weakening economy in China had already been built into the outlook for 2016 by Fed officials  Mester said   There s going to be volatility in the markets  that s kind of the nature of financial markets   Williams said the Fed would have to continue with  significant monetary accommodation  to keep growth above 2  
Saudi Arabia cut off diplomatic relations with Iran on Sunday  giving diplomats 48 hours to leave the country  after protesters on Saturday stormed and torched the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Tehran  The move was in response to Saudi Arabia s execution of 47 prisoners  including a prominent Shiite cleric  Bahrain and Sudan joined Saudi Arabia in severing diplomatic relations with Iran  Bahrain is home to the US Navy s 5th Fleet  The United Arab Emirates  meanwhile  recalled its ambassador from Tehran  So this is breaking down along religious lines between Sunni and Shia  but you might also suspect the timing involves Iran s re emergence as a major player in oil production 
Meanwhile  the first oil tanker of freely traded American crude oil launched Thursday from the Port of Corpus Christi  marking the end of a long standing U S  ban put in place in the 1970s  ConocoPhillips  N COP  and Nustar Energy  N NS  loaded the tanker with crude pumped from Eagle Ford 
AAA is projecting that gas prices will stay lower in 2016  estimating an average cost of  2 25  2 45 per gallon  In 2015  the average price per gallon was  2 40  Americans saved  540 on average   AAA also forecast that the national average would stay steady or drop another  0 10 in the coming weeks  and would not go above  3 gallon this year  Oil prices moved higher in early trade but closed slightly lower for the day 
Economic news today shows weakness in the manufacturing sector  The ISM manufacturing index slipped to 48 2  last month from 48 6  in November  Readings under 50  indicate more companies are shrinking instead of expanding  The ISM index has posted sub 50  readings for two straight months for the first time since an economic recovery that began in July 2009  An interview with ISM chair Brad Holcomb has been posted on this site  Meanwhile  Markit s US manufacturing PMI fell to a 3 year low 
The Commerce Department reports construction spending sank 0 4  in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  1 12 trillion  The October increase  originally reported as 1 0   was revised down to 0 3   In November  spending was 10 5  higher compared to a year ago  Private construction was down 0 2  during the month  but 12 1  higher for the year 
As a side note  the Commerce Department is revising how it counts construction spending to include private residential improvement spending  That sounds innocuous  but the improvements category account for about one third of private residential spending  or 13  of the overall total  In November  improvements amounted to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  144 billion  And these revisions go back 10 years  so there could be adjustments to GDP numbers as well 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve cut its forecast for fourth quarter growth for the fourth time in the past three weeks  The Atlanta  Fed s closely watched forecast model now suggests that gross domestic product grew a scant 0 7  from October through December  In mid December  the Atlanta Fed was predicting a 2  increase in GDP  It s since lowered its forecast after disappointing reports on manufacturing  exports  construction spending and consumer spending 
This Friday s jobs report for December  the highlight of the economic data due in the first full week of January  is expected to show nonfarm payrolls expanded by about 205 000  Even with weakness seen during the summer  job gains in 2015 will top 2 5 million  making it the second best calendar year for U S  job growth in this millennium  after last year s 3 1 million  The last time more jobs were created in a two year period was at the height of the dot com boom  in 1998 1999 
After a disappointing 2015 for stocks  it appears the upcoming earnings season will not provide relief  Once again weighed down by the energy and materials sectors  the S P 500 is expected to see a decline in earnings of 4 7  from the year ago period  according to estimates from FactSet 
The only sectors expected to see any gain in fourth quarter earnings are telecom  financials  consumer discretionary and health care  If fourth quarter earnings decline  it will mark the first time the index has seen three consecutive quarters of year  over year declines in earnings since the first 3 quarters of 2009  The ongoing hope is that this will be one of those stock market earnings recessions that are able to avoid US economic recessions

The new quarterly distribution is 55 cents per share  while the previous quarter s distribution was of 70 cents per share The new distribution will be paid on Nov 14  2016  to shareholders of record as of Oct 31  2016 
Plains All American s reduction in its quarterly cash distribution is consistent with its intention to simplify the capital structure and better align its interests with those of its unitholders  This intention was announced in early July 
Investors were not impressed with the decision to trim distribution  Hence  the units of the partnership dropped 2 4  in the last two trading sessions

33237,254752,NS,MLPs Report Encouraging Prospects ,opinion,"It s earnings season  and last week Enterprise Products Partners  NYSE EPD  reported another solid quarter  An appealing feature of EPD is the absence of a General Partner  GP   So unlike many other MLPs  EPD LP unit holders do not suffer a haircut to Distributable Cash Flow  DCF  from GP Incentive Distribution Rights  IDRs  before the cash makes its way to the LPs for their distribution  This allows the growth of DCF from EPD s portfolio of assets to flow right through to EPD unit holders  thereby giving it a lower cost of capital than would be the case if there was a GP  Insiders also own 35  of the units  a significant alignment of interests 
EPD s full year results came in modestly better than expected and their distribution growth from 2013 was  5 8   They also have unusually high DCF coverage of 1 4X which allows them to fund part of their planned growth through this excess of DCF over declared distributions  EPD is positioning itself to support the U S  shift to role of refined products exporter  and its planned growth capex is on the same trajectory as it was last Summer when oil was above  100 bbl 
Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI  held their Analyst Day on Wednesday and provided further detail on the business following their earnings release the prior week  As they pointed out numerous times during the day of presentations  85  of their 2015 cash flows are fee based and a further 9  are hedged  leaving only 6  subject to commodity price swings 
NuStar  NYSE NS  was also interesting  in that their reported earnings showed distribution coverage of 1 1  at last sufficient to cover payouts to unit holders  It s not that long ago that their distribution was at risk  but they have exited the asphalt business  greatly reduced their commodity sensitivity and focused on the storage business  Analysts on the earnings call were even asking about the timing of a distribution increase 
NS has a publicly traded GP called NuStar GP Holdings  NSH   Its current distribution generates a yield of 5 8   very high for a GP  NSH receives up to 23  of the DCF of NS and it is currently at that level  As the business returns to growth  NSH s IDRs  13 1  LP interest and smaller outstanding number of unit compared with NS should translate into roughly twice the distribution growth rate as that experienced by the other LP unit holders in NS  It s why we prefer the GPs

33253,254768,NS,A Hedge Fund  Manager  Trading At A High Yield ,opinion,"Many years ago  in a different investing climate and a different decade  a cut in interest rates was usually regarded as a stimulative move by the Federal Reserve  Lower financing costs were regarded as helping the economy more than hurting it  They certainly help the U S  Federal Government  as the world s biggest borrower  The amount of treasury bills at a 0  interest rate recently reached a cumulative  1 trillion  Although declining interest rates adjust the return on lending in favor of the borrower and at the expense of the lender  a lower cost of capital stimulates more borrowing for more investment and consequently boosts demand  However  the intoxicating nectar of ultra low rates is gradually losing its potency  and while it s overstating the case to say that markets would cheer higher rates  certain sectors would and the confirmation of an economy robust enough to prosper without  extraordinary accommodation  as the Fed puts it would be novel to say the least 
Several major banks released their quarterly earnings over the past week  Balance sheets continue to strengthen  but another less welcome trend was the continued pressure low interest rates are imposing on income statements  Deutsche Bank  N DB   most major banks to report declining Net Interest Margins  NIMs  as older  higher yielding investments mature and are replaced with securities at lower  current rates  JPMorgan  N JPM   to make further operating expense reductions since quarterly earnings were lower than expected 
It s a problem facing millions of investors  The timing of a normalization of interest rates  which is to say an increase  is both closely watched and yet seemingly never closer  If you look hard enough you can always find a reason to delay a hike  and the Yellen Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  looks everywhere  Recent by two FOMC members suggest a December decision to hike may not receive unanimous support  The FOMC s long run rate forecasts continue to drop  as shown in this chart 
Income seeking investors are unlikely to find much solace in the bond market  As I wrote in   when rates are punitively low  discerning investors take their money elsewhere 
Suppose you could buy equity in a hedge fund manager  a fanciful suggestion because they re virtually all privately held  But suppose just for a moment that such a security existed  The question is  how should you value this investment  What multiple of fees to the manager would you be willing to pay or in other words what yield would entice you into this investment 
Hedge fund managers don t need much in assets beyond working capital and office equipment  the assets they care about sit in the hedge fund they control  So let s consider a hedge fund manager s balance sheet  which consists mostly of a small investment in its hedge fund  representing a portion of the hedge fund s total assets  and a bit of cash 
It has virtually no debt  Our hedge fund manager earns income from its hedge fund investment  as well as a payment for managing all of the other assets that sit in the hedge fund  These two revenue streams are roughly equal today and constitute 100  of the hedge fund manager s revenue  The fees charged by the hedge fund manager for overseeing the hedge fund aren t the familiar  2   20   but are instead are currently 13  of the free cash flow generated by those assets and 25  of all incremental cash flows going forward  Moreover  the equity capital in the hedge fund is permanent capital  which is to say that investors can exit by selling their interests to someone else but cannot expect to redeem from the hedge fund  Meanwhile  our hedge fund manager can decide to grow his hedge fund and thereby his fee stream for managing its assets by directing the hedge fund to raise new capital from investors  This represents substantial optionality to grow when it suits the manager by using Other People s Money  OPM   This hedge fund s assets are not other securities but physical assets such as crude oil terminals  storage facilities and pipelines  The hedge fund is returning 9  and is expected to grow its returns by 4   annually over the next few years 
The hedge fund manager in this example is publicly traded NuStar GP Holdings  LLC  N NSH   the General Partner  GP  for NuStar Energy  LP  N NS   NSH  by virtue of being the GP of NS and receiving Incentive Distribution Rights  IDRs  equal to roughly 25  of NS s incremental free cash flow  is compensated like a hedge fund manager  NS  a midstream MLP  is like a hedge fund  albeit the good kind with far more reliable prospects and greater visibility than the more prosaic kind  whose returns have generally remained poor since I predicted as much in  four years ago 
To return to our question  at what yield would you buy this hedge fund manager s  fees   given its option to increase the size of its hedge fund  the hedge fund s respectable and growing return  the permanence of its capital and the perpetual nature of its substantial claim to the hedge fund s free cash flow  NSH currently yields 7 6  which should increase  10  annually over the next several years based on the company s capex guidance at NS

opening bell The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is pegged at earnings of 7 cents per share on expected revenues of  603 16 million  There has been no change in estimates for the bottom line over the past seven days Let s delve into the factors that might have impacted the company s performance in the December quarter Factors to Impact Q1 ResultsDue to minimal activity  this oilfield service provider s U S  Land segment  accounting for about 83  of the top line  is likely to have posted lower year over year revenues for the fiscal first quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from U S  Land  the company s largest segment  is pegged at  500 million  indicating a decline from  624 million reported in the year ago quarter However  Helmerich   Payne s technologically advanced FlexRigs is much in demand and commands strong daily rate margins  This  in turn  bodes well for the segmental profits in the upcoming quarterly results  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average rig margin per day at the U S  Land unit stands at  10 350  suggesting growth from  9 820 reported in the prior year Even though we anticipate that the U S  Land segment s revenues might have declined in the quarter to be reported  Helmerich   Payne s high in demand technologically advanced FlexRigs is likely to have boosted the segment s operating income  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the U S  Land Operating segment is pegged at  87 million  implying an 8 75  increase from  80 million reported in the year earlier quarter While the company is expected to have gained from a solid year over year contribution from the U S Land unit  weaker sales from Offshore and International Land segments might have dented its overall results The Zacks Consensus Estimate for International Land and Offshore segments  revenues in the fiscal first quarter is pegged at  45 19 million and  34 81 million  respectively  indicating a decrease from  66 million and  36 91 million each reported a year ago  Declining rig margins in International Land and Offshore units are a persistent concern and might partly affect the company s overall earnings figures in the impending quarterly release What Does Our Model Say The proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Helmerich   Payne this time around  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the chances of beating estimates  But that s not the case here You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re
