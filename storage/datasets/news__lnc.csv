What s Next for Lincoln National 
While Lincoln National has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Taking a quick step back  LNC stock bounced from a seven month low near  51 in late August  and has since added 20  to trade at  61 12  However  the equity is now within one standard deviation of its 80 week trendline after a lengthy stretch below it  Per data from Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  there have been 13 similar signals over the last 15 years  and the stock was down 5 8   on average  one month out  with the majority of the returns negative 
Short sellers have already started to target Lincoln National  NYSE LNC   Short interest on the stock shot up 14 8  in the most recent reporting period to 4 65 million shares  This represents just 2 3  of the stock s float  meaning the bearish bandwagon is far from full  Continued  could be an even bigger headwind for LNC stock 




MetLife Inc  NYSE MET  is also set to report earnings after today s close  and the stock shed 2 2  in the session subsequent to its July 31 report  That earnings reaction sparked a month long slide for MET shares  which settled August down 10 4  
The shares rebounded in the first half of September  before sliding back to their August lows near  44 by early October  A bounce off here now has the stock trading near its 160 day moving average    last seen down 1 6  at  45 92    which has had historically bearish implications for MetLife  NYSE MET  
According to White s data  there have been four other times in the past three years the equity has come within one standard deviation of this trendline after trading below it 60  of the time in the last two months  Following these previous signals  MET shares averaged a one month loss of 5 4   with not one of the returns positive 
MetLife  NYSE MET  shorts have been reducing their exposure to the stock lately  with short interest down 15 1  in the two most recent reporting periods to 12 09 million shares  This accounts for just 1 5  of the equity s available float  and would take less than two days to cover  at MET s average pace of trading  This leaves little in the way of sideline cash to help fuel any future rally attempts ",2019-10-31,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-insurance-stocks-to-short-before-earnings-200480541,200480541

125620,347135,LNC,Is Lincoln National  LNC  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One company to watch right now is Lincoln National  LNC   LNC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock is trading with P E ratio of 6 12 right now  For comparison  its industry sports an average P E of 8 14  Over the past 52 weeks  LNC s Forward P E has been as high as 7 81 and as low as 5 18  with a median of 6 55 
We also note that LNC holds a PEG ratio of 0 68  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  LNC s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 0 74  Over the last 12 months  LNC s PEG has been as high as 0 79 and as low as 0 58  with a median of 0 73 
Another notable valuation metric for LNC is its P B ratio of 0 66  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  LNC s current P B looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P B of 1 70  LNC s P B has been as high as 1 and as low as 0 56  with a median of 0 81  over the past year 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  LNC has a P S ratio of 0 71  This compares to its industry s average P S of 0 74 
Finally  investors should note that LNC has a P CF ratio of 8 38  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  LNC s current P CF looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P CF of 15 41  Over the past 52 weeks  LNC s P CF has been as high as 9 17 and as low as 5 19  with a median of 7 80 
These are only a few of the key metrics included in Lincoln National s strong Value grade  but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now  When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook  LNC looks like an impressive value stock at the moment ",2019-09-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-lincoln-national-lnc-stock-undervalued-right-now-200466651,200466651

125623,347138,LNC,Lincoln National  LNC  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Lincoln National  LNC  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurance and retirement business is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 6  
Revenues are expected to be  4 54 billion  up 6 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 41  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lincoln National 
For Lincoln National  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 65  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Lincoln National will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lincoln National would post earnings of  2 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 36  delivering a surprise of  1 72  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lincoln National appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lincoln-national-lnc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200476862,200476862

This insurance and retirement business has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 30

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven

125650,347165,LNC,Why Lincoln National  LNC  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Lincoln National in Focus
Based in Radnor  Lincoln National  LNC  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 14 32   The insurance and retirement business is paying out a dividend of  0 37 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 52  compared to the Insurance   Life Insurance industry s yield of 0 7  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 92  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 48 is up 12 1  from last year  In the past five year period  Lincoln National has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 18 55   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Lincoln National s payout ratio is 17   which means it paid out 17  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  LNC expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  9 30 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 9 67  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  LNC is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-lincoln-national-lnc-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200450752,200450752

125662,347177,LNC,Life insurers admit to offering  kickbacks   Senator Warren ,news," Reuters    Senator Elizabeth Warren said 13 major U S  life insurers had admitted to using incentives such as expensive vacations and gifts  which could encourage agents  to put their own interests ahead of their clients   The senator had launched an investigation into 15 major annuity providers in April amid concerns about the  kickbacks  they offered to brokers who peddle products to retirees  Warren voiced her concern about the loopholes in law that allows some advisers to steer customers into complex financial products for higher rewards    Research suggests that this loophole costs Americans an estimated  17 billion every year   she said in a report released by her office on Tuesday  Annuity providers  including American International Group Inc  N AIG   offer anything from luxury cruises  trips to Tahiti  Costa Rica or Rome  creating conflicts of interest  Massachusetts Democrat Warren said    Companies shouldn t be allowed to offer expensive vacations  prizes and other kickbacks to agents in exchange for selling costly  second rate investment products to unsuspecting customers   Senator Warren said in the report   The report was based on responses from 15 companies to letters asking for information on whether they offered non cashincentives  Annuities are popular among retirees because they can offer a steady stream of income  There are a variety of types  including some that provide a guaranteed payout and others whose payout is pegged to the performance of underlying securities  Earlier  the U S  Labor Department proposed new rules to curb conflicts of interest that could lead brokers to steer retirees into less than ideal investments  Companies mentioned in her report include   Prudential   L PRU  Annuities  N PRU   Jackson National Life  Lincoln Financial Group  N LNC   Allianz Life Insurance Co  DE ALVG   TIAA CREF  New York Life  Transamerica  AXA USA  PA AXAF   Nationwide  Pacific Life  Forethought Annuity  RiverSource Life Insurance and Security Benefit Life  Prudential s spokeswoman said the company had received the report and was reviewing it  while TIAA CREF said  as a matter of policy  it  does not engage in product based incentives   Jackson National spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that it does not offer any of the non cash incentives described in Senator Warren s letter or in the report issued by her office

125663,347178,LNC,Senator Warren seeks investigation of insurers over retirement rule,news,"By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON  Reuters    Senator Elizabeth Warren  a Massachusetts Democrat who advocates for strong financial regulation  asked U S  securities regulators on Thursday to investigate comments made by major insurance companies about a forthcoming federal rule on retirement advice  Last month  Warren criticized Lincoln National  NYSE LNC   Jackson National Life Insurance Company  Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  and Transamerica  a unit of Aegon NV   for publicly stating that the rule requiring retirement advisers to put their clients  interests ahead of their own would hurt business while privately telling investors it would not create a major hurdle  On Thursday  she went one step further and requested the Securities and Exchange Commission to formally look into whether the statements were contradictory and ran afoul of securities laws    Both sets of industry claims   that the proposed rule will harm them and their business model  and that the proposed rule will not harm them and their business model   cannot possibly be true  And if one these public statements is materially false  it would appear to violate long standing interpretations of our securities laws   she wrote to SEC Chair Mary Jo White  The White House will soon publicly release the latest version of the rule  drafted by the Labor Department  The 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform law called for holding brokers who give retirement advice to a strong fiduciary standard  meaning they must act in their clients  best interest  as a way to protect retirees from buying unnecessary products that line brokers  pockets  The Labor Department had to withdraw its initial version of the rule in 2011 after complaints from members of both political parties and the financial services industry  Warren says that financial and insurance companies have warned in public that the proposed rule could drive up costs and stop them from offering retirement services such as annuities to middle  and lower income people  But in earnings calls they have reassured investors that they will come up with new products or approaches that will minimize threats to their businesses  
Responding to Warren s critique last month  most of the insurers said their public warnings did not contradict reassurances to investors that they could withstand regulatory changes  They said their companies could navigate potential disruptions but they were still concerned about the consequences for consumers seeking retirement advice ",2016-03-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/senator-warren-seeks-investigation-of-insurers-over-retirement-rule-392921,392921

125667,347182,LNC,Can Lincoln National  LNC  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Lincoln National  LNC   This company  which is in the Zacks Insurance   Life Insurance industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This insurance and retirement business has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1 91  
For the last reported quarter  Lincoln National came out with earnings of  2 14 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 08 per share  representing a surprise of 2 88   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 13 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 15 per share  delivering a surprise of 0 94  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Lincoln National  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Lincoln National has an Earnings ESP of  0 26  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on July 31  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-lincoln-national-lnc-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200445233,200445233

125681,347196,LNC,Is Lincoln National  LNC  A Good Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lincoln National Corporation   NYSE LNC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lincoln National has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 26  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 77  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Lincoln National s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 10 87  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Lincoln National has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 6 76  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lincoln National stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lincoln National has a P S ratio of about 0 77  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 21 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  LNC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lincoln National currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Lincoln National a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 17  which is better than the industry average of 7 53  Clearly  LNC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Lincoln National might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of C  This gives LNC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and only one downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lincoln National Corporation Price and Consensus    Even though Lincoln National has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLincoln National is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 25   should boost investor confidence However over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Lincoln National Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop

125688,347203,LNC,Lincoln National  LNC  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Lincoln National in Focus
Lincoln National  LNC  is headquartered in Radnor  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 26 37  since the start of the year  The insurance and retirement business is paying out a dividend of  0 37 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 28  compared to the Insurance   Life Insurance industry s yield of 0 74  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 88  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 48 is up 12 1  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Lincoln National has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 18 55   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Lincoln National s current payout ratio is 17   This means it paid out 17  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for LNC for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  9 29 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 9 55  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  LNC is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lincoln-national-lnc-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200436788,200436788

125694,347209,LNC,Aflac  AFL  To Report Q2 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Aflac Inc    NYSE AFL   is scheduled to announce second quarter 2019 results on Jul 25  after the closing bell 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at  1 07  same as the year ago reported figure while the same for revenues stands at  5 48 billion  which indicates decline of 1 61  from the year ago reported figure 
Factors to Affect Q2 Results
We expect to see continued strength in the profitability of Aflac U S   led by ongoing investment in the business  delivery of value added services and increased client retention  product partnering to drive improved account values and employee access  and investment in administrative capabilities  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at the U S  unit is  1 65 billion  up 3 1  year over year 
However  sales in its Japan business will remain subdued due to decline in third sector and first sector protection sales  following a strong cancer product launch in 2018  Also  continued reduction in first sector savings products as expected by the company  after re pricing in April 2017  should lead to an overall decline in sales  
Net earned premium is expected to decline as first sector savings policies become paid up  paid up means when all the premium payments are complete and the insurer will not receive any premium on those policies   The company expects third sector and first sector protection combined sales to be down in the high teens in the second quarter 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at the Japan unit is  3 7 billion  almost same year over year 
Investment income performance  both in Japan and the United States  should be strong driven primarily by accelerated growth in the company s floating rate portfolio and variable income from alternative investment portfolio 
The company has increased its investment in core technology platforms and growth initiatives to drive performance and achieve operating effectiveness  This investment will continue to be a strategic focus through 2019  which might increase operating expenses and consequently pressurize margins 
Earnings Surprise History
The company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history  having surpassed estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 7 1   This is depicted in the chart below

Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns

While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurance and retirement business is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 6  
Revenues are expected to be  4 33 billion  up 20  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 23  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lincoln National 
For Lincoln National  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lincoln National will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lincoln National would post earnings of  2 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 15  delivering a surprise of  0 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lincoln National doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lincoln-national-lnc-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200410259,200410259

Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Lincoln National in Focus
Lincoln National  LNC  is headquartered in Radnor  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 27 67  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 37 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 26   In comparison  the Insurance   Life Insurance industry s yield is 0 47   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 89

Looking at this fiscal year  LNC expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  9 23 per share  with earnings expected to increase 8 84  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  LNC is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-lincoln-national-lnc-could-be-a-great-choice-200410870,200410870

125778,347293,LNC,5 Best Performing Life Insurance Stocks To Buy For 2019,opinion,The insurance industry saw the wheels of fortune turning in its favor during 2018 with the economy improving significantly owing to the rising interest rates  a growing gross domestic product and the tax cut  A fairly strong 2018 has set the stage for the insurance industry to usher in 2019 with high hopes  Even though the industry might fight challenges in the form of weather related events and ongoing disputes over tariffs and trade rules  we still expect insurers to maintain a positive trend in the year ahead Here we will talk about the life insurance industry and the factors anticipated to aid its overall results in 2019 The current interest rate environment has given life insurers enough reasons to rejoice as the regulatory body has kept its promise of raising interest rates thrice and with another FOMC meeting around the corner  the air of optimism is at peak among investors surrounding a fourth rate hike  For 2019  the Fed has given an indication of increasing the interest rates thrice with two more lined up for 2020 Life insurers reinvest premiums  which they receive from policy holders so that enough funds are available at the time of paying future claims or upon maturity  In this case  a favorable interest rate environment enables life insurers to reinvest funds at higher rates  thereby garnering better returns  Thus  rising rates have proved to be a boon to life insurers In 2017  life insurers witnessed a decline in premiums due to weak performing annuity business  political and regulatory uncertainties were responsible for this downside   However  progressing interest rates have lent a plausible support to insurers and the annuity business has gradually recovered  We expect this positive trend to remain in the year ahead as well  Per Munich Re s insurance market outlook  the future of annuities looks bright on the back of a bettering interest rate environment and growth in disposable income with the total U S  annuity sales projected to climb 5  in 2019  2018 estimate was in the 5 10  band   Hence  we expect premiums to augment considerably in 2019 It is important to note here that the United States is currently the most important life insurance market with a global market share of around 20   The Life Insurance industry is ranked at  18  representing the top 7  of the  for more than 250 industries  If we shift our attention from the interest rate hikes to a strong labor market  denoted by lower unemployment rate and rising wages  we can safely conclude that it will be able to boost policy sales even at higher premiums  According to an article by the balance  the unemployment rate is expected to drop to 3 5  and the GDP is estimated to rise at 2 5  in 2019  So  a fall in the unemployment rate should perk up demand for life insurance and annuity products  Further  a spurt in aging population will push up demand for retirement benefits  products Adoption and implementation of advanced technology in day to day operations have proven to be beneficial for the life insurers  More and more industry players are now opting to sell policies online that appeal to a greater number of tech savvy consumers  Also  usage of real time data is simplifying premium calculation and reducing risk  Moreover  embracing technologies like artificial intelligence  AI   robotic process automation  RPA   cognitive intelligence  CI  or blockchain should assist life insurers to curtail operational costs Potential Outperformers in 2019Riding on the strength of rising interest rates  brisk annuity business  solid labor market and adherence to advanced technology  the life insurers are capable of reaping profits

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lincoln National 
For Lincoln National  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lincoln National will beat the consensus EPS estimate

Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lincoln National would post earnings of  2 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 34  delivering a surprise of  7 83  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lincoln National doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lincoln-national-lnc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200381222,200381222

with strong earnings numbers and 24  of them are slated to release this week Per the latest   total earnings for the 133 S P 500 members that have reported results already are up 12 3  year over year on 8 8  higher revenues  with 81 2  beating EPS estimates and 78 9  topping revenue estimates  About 65 4  of the companies have surpassed both EPS and revenue estimates Industry TrendsInsurance industry  an integral part of the Finance sector  will witness soft performance in the to be reported quarter which will drag the sector s fourth quarter results  Per the Earnings Preview  earnings of the Finance sector will improve 8 4  with revenues increasing 2 4  year over year A slew of natural calamities inducing cat loss dented the underwriting profitability of insurers this year  The fourth quarter is likely to suffer due to the California wildfires  As a result  insurers have hiked prices that remained flat due to a not so active catastrophe environment  With higher prices  insurers not only will enjoy higher premiums going forward but also be well equipped to settle claims without hurting profitability In addition  since December 2016  four rate hikes have been made and the interest rate now stands at 1 25 1 50   Also  the Fed has reiterated the expectation to raise rates thrice in 2018 and twice in 2019  Owing to a gradually improving rate environment  investment results have improved moderately from the historical lows Moreover  the tax reform policy  enacted in December 2017  that lowers the corporate tax burden to 20  from 35   is likely act as an impetus  aiding margin expansion  However  due to reduction in tax rates  insurers are writing down deferred tax assets that in turn will adversely impact their risk based capitalization levels and also reduce net income for some players in the fourth quarter Stocks to ConsiderFirst  Aflac Inc  s   NYSE AFL   fourth quarter results are expected to benefit from increased revenues from its U S  segment that has been performing strongly as evident from rise in revenues since 2010 Also  we expect sales increase to continue in the fourth quarter given the number of growth initiatives such as the adoption of Everwell for increased penetration  delivery of value added services and increased client retention  product partnering to drive improved account values and employee access  and investment in administrative capabilities  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is  1 6 billion  which translates into year over year growth of 6 7  Aflac s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment  primarily in Japan  The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first sector  life insurance  products in Japan  Premium growth continues to be pressured by first sector savings product  WAYS  and a portion of block reaching paid up status Our proven model does not conclusively show that Aflac is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  Aflac has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  However  the company has an  of  0 49   Despite carrying a favorable Zacks Rank  a negative earnings ESP makes the prediction

NYSE LNC   to see an increase in total annuity sales  driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from operation for the Annuity segment is  264 million  which reflects year over year growth of 9 1  Lincoln National s life insurance business is expected to see top line growth from a broad product portfolio and an industry leading distribution network  The company s Group Protection segment that was challenged in the recent past is now recovering  The fourth quarter is likely to be aided by this segment s performance as well Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lincoln National is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because despite carrying a favorable Zacks Rank  2  an

reflecting a year over year increase of 8  Moreover  the company has likely experienced premium growth at both Unum U S  and Colonial Life segments  driven by improving sales and persistency However  the results of Unum U K  are expected to have remained soft  due to a challenging economic environment Our proven model shows that Unum Group has the right combination of the two key ingredients to

125870,347385,LNC,Is Lincoln National  LNC  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lincoln National Corporation   NYSE LNC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lincoln National has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 2  as you can see below This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 21 5  If we focus on the long term trend of the stock  the current level puts Lincoln National s current PE among its highs over the past five years  This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its own historical levels  Further  the stock s PE compares vastly favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Lincoln National has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 1   which is faintly lower than the current level  So it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lincoln National stock in the near term too PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lincoln National has a P S ratio of about 1 3  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now LNC is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lincoln National currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Lincoln National a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Lincoln National is just 1 2  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 7  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  LNC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though Lincoln National might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of B  This gives LNC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending upwards lately  The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has seen four upward revisions and none downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate has inched up 2 9  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has increased 1 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lincoln National Corporation Price and Consensus   This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineLincoln National is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  among the Top 21  out of more than 250 industries  and strong Zacks Rank  Lincoln National looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2017-12-26,Zacks Investment

125871,347386,LNC,Life Insurers  Multitudes Of Stimuli,opinion,"The rate environment has been favoring life insurers since the Fed started tightening its monetary policy a couple of years back  given the high sensitivity of their business models to interest rates  But neither the pace nor the magnitude of rate hikes has been enough for a measurable benefit so far 
However  the Fed s rate hike last week and three more likely increases in 2018 might change the fate of life insurers by steadily boosting their investment income 
Actually  for any gain  the rate hike driven improvement in investment income will have to more than offset the decline in yield on assets invested in  And the rate hikes so far have not been enough to fetch any significant benefit 
However  the likely change in the frequency of rate hikes should position carriers better in terms of generating investment income and maintaining minimum surplus requirement 
While the rate environment has not been too effective so far  investors have reacted positively to the industry s progress  This is clearly evident from the Zacks Life Insurance Industry s 22 7  gain since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s 20 2  rally 
In addition to a likely escalation in investment income based on an improved rate scenario  there are reasons to be optimistic about the industry s growth 
Key Drivers Beyond Rate Hikes
High hedging costs  which have been marring profitability  are likely to decline with rising interest rates  This will  in turn  alleviate the pressure on investment yields 
Moreover  better control over underwriting expenses and continued increase in premiums should help life insurers enhance their income in the quarters ahead  The individual life insurance premiums  which showed decent growth since the last recession  will likely continue the trend with rising demand driven by a strong job market and the aging population  for retirement savings  
In the low rate era  life insurers managed to stay afloat by going beyond their conservative approach and through capital flexibility  In order to keep their commitments to policyholders  they increasingly resorted to riskier asset classes   such as equities  While increased dependence on this strategy has made them vulnerable to faltering on claim payments as there is no guarantee of steady returns from riskier assets  no major setback is likely in the near term  In fact  this arrangement should make variable annuity portfolios and other fee driven businesses contribute a little more to profits  as the equity market is expected to remain favorable 
What made life insurers resort to racier asset classes is ultra low bond yields due to global growth concerns  However  bond yields have improved since Donald Trump became President on expectations of better economic growth and higher inflation based on an expansive fiscal policy  If this trend continues  life insurers will likely see better days 
Also  as the U S  corporate bond market remains healthy and the real estate market is unlikely to disappoint with strength is job market  life insurers  credit related investment losses should be below average 
Above all  increasing disposable income on the back of continued growth in the economy and declining unemployment should perk up demand for life insurance and annuity products 
Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Upside Potential 
This 14 company group currently carries a  of  56  which places it in the top 22  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our back testing shows that the top 50  of Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
Business Restructuring to Work in Favor
Life insurers did not shy away under difficulties that the low rate environment had created for them  Taking them in stride  they had chosen to capitalize on the rapidly changing sector dynamics  As part of this effort  life insurers had reduced the sensitivity of their product lines to interest rates to some extent and invested in less liquid assets  While this rationalization is curbing the benefits from the rising rate environment  it should make the growth path steady 
The changing economic and demographic conditions are making risk calculation difficult  but life insurers are adopting more predictive techniques with the help of analytics 
Most importantly  life insurers have managed to improve net income in the last few quarters by trimming underwriting expenses and modestly increasing premium rates  In fact  some life insurers are quietly hiking rates on some universal life policies in order to offset losses emanating from a tough industry backdrop  This action is actually narrowing the gap between what they receive as premium and what they promised to pay policyholders 
Life insurers have also been resorting to product modification and re pricing  which should enhance their liability profiles and profitability  While re pricing of traditional products with attractive additional features will help them earn more  product modification will lessen liabilities on insurers  part by shifting risks related to equity and hedging to policyholders  Moreover  a beefed up capital market should strengthen the industry s liquidity profile in the upcoming quarters and help its participants confront any unforeseen challenge

125960,347475,LNC,Is Lincoln National  LNC  A Suitable Choice For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lincoln National Corporation   NYSE LNC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lincoln National has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 93  This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 50 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock  the current level puts Lincoln National s current PE among its highs over the past five years  This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its own historical levels  Further  the stock s PE compares vastly favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance   Life Insurance industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 65  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Lincoln National has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 72   which is faintly lower than the current level  So it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lincoln National stock in the near term too PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lincoln National has a P S ratio of about 1 19  This is lower than the Zacks categorized Insurance   Life Insurance industry average  which comes in at 1 42 right now LNC is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important  it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well  One can easily do that with the PEG ratio  ratio of the P E to the expected future earnings growth rate  The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P E ratio Lincoln National s PEG ratio stands at 1 00  compared with the Zacks Insurance   Life Insurance industry average of 1 59  This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lincoln National currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Lincoln National a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P B ratio  used to compare a stock s market value to its book value  stands at 1 07  lower than the industry average of 1 13  Clearly  LNC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Lincoln National might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives LNC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending upwards lately  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward revisions and one downward revision in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up 0 6  in the past month  while the full year estimate has increased 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lincoln National Corporation Price and Consensus   This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineLincoln National is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  among the Top 18  out of more than 250 industries  and strong Zacks Rank  Lincoln National looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Insurance   Life Insurance industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below Meanwhile  Lincoln National is well positioned for long term growth  given its focus on reducing exposure to businesses with long term guarantee  Its strong capital position is another positive  The company is prudent in managing its capital which has led to an improvement in book value So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana    Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2017-07-18,Zacks Investment

125962,347477,LNC,Beyond Rate Hike  Plenty Of Impetus Left For Life Insurers,opinion,"The rising rate environment has given life insurers a new lease of life given the high sensitivity of their business models to interest rates  But the pace or magnitude of rate hikes needed for a measurable benefit has yet to be initiated by the Fed  In fact  the latest Fed minutes do not point at anything that can alter the fate of life insurers by significantly boosting their investment income they utilize to meet policyholders  future claims 
Actually  for any gain  the rate hike driven improvement in investment income will have to more than offset the decline in yield on assets invested in  And the rate hikes so far are not enough to fetch any significant benefit 
However  the rising rate environment undoubtedly positions carriers better in terms of generating investment income and maintaining minimum surplus requirement 
While the market remains uncertain about the effectiveness of rising rates in the long run  it has reacted positively to the progress so far  This is clearly evident from the Zacks Life Insurance Industry s 12 2  gain since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s 8 5  rally 
However  in addition to a likely escalation in investment income  though not significant   there are reasons to be optimistic about the industry s growth potential 
Factors That Could Drive Life Insurance Stocks Higher 
High hedging costs  which have been marring profitability  are likely to decline with rising interest rates  This will  in turn  alleviate the pressure on investment yields 
Moreover  better control over underwriting expenses and continued increase in premiums should help life insurers enhance their income in the quarters ahead  The individual life insurance premiums  which showed decent growth since the last recession  will likely continue the trend with rising demand driven by an improving job market and the aging population  for retirement savings  
In the low rate era  life insurers managed to stay afloat by going beyond their conservative approach and through capital flexibility  In order to keep their commitments to policyholders  they increasingly resorted to riskier asset classes   such as equities  While increased dependence on this strategy has made them vulnerable to faltering on claim payments as there is no guarantee of steady returns from riskier assets  no major setback is likely in the near term  In fact  this arrangement should make variable annuity portfolios and other fee driven businesses contribute a little more to the profits  as the bull market in U S  stocks recently extended into its eighth year 
What made life insurers resort to racier asset classes is ultra low bond yields due to global growth concerns  However  bond yields have improved since Donald Trump became President on expectations of better economic growth and higher inflation based on an expansive fiscal policy  If this trend continues  life insurers will likely see better days 
Also  as the U S  corporate bond market remains healthy and the real estate market is unlikely to disappoint amid strong job growth  life insurers  credit related investment losses should be below average 
Above all  increasing disposable income on the back of continued growth in the economy and declining unemployment should lead to a step up in demand for life insurance and annuity products 
Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Upside Potential 
This 15 company group currently carries a  of  21  which places it in the top 8  of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries  Our back testing shows that the top 50  of Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
Efficient Business Restructuring to Pay Off
Life insurers did not shy away under difficulties that the low rate environment created for them  Taking them in stride  they chose to capitalize on the rapidly changing sector dynamics  As part of this effort  life insurers reduced the sensitivity of their product lines to interest rates to some extent and invested in less liquid assets  While this rationalization is curbing the benefits from the rising rate environment  it should make the growth path steady    The changing economic and demographic conditions are making risk calculation difficult  but life insurers are adopting more predictive techniques with the help of analytics 
Most importantly  life insurers have managed to improve net income in the last few quarters by trimming underwriting expenses and modestly increasing premium rates  In fact  some life insurers are quietly hiking rates on some universal life policies in order to offset losses emanating from a tough industry backdrop  This action is actually narrowing the gap between what they receive as premium and what they promised to pay policyholders       Life insurers have also been resorting to product modification and re pricing  which should enhance their liability profiles and profitability  While re pricing of traditional products with attractive additional features will help them earn more  product modification will lessen liabilities on the insurers  part by shifting risks related to equity and hedging to policyholders  Moreover  a beefed up capital market should strengthen the industry s liquidity profile in the upcoming quarters and help its participants confront any challenge that might crop up 
How to Play Life Insurance Stocks Life insurers  near term prospects are looking up on a number of positive factors  So  it would be prudent to pick a few stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank 
Here are a few top ranked stocks that you may want to consider 
Manulife Financial Corp   MFC   This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock has gained 8 3  year to date versus the S P 500 s 8 5  rally  Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings has been revised 9 9  upward over the past 30 days  You can see  
Sun Life Financial Inc   SLF   A 6 1  upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year over the past 30 days led to a Zacks Rank  1 for this stock as well  The price of this stock has declined marginally since the beginning of the year

magnitude of rate hikes needed for a measurable benefit has yet to be initiated by the Fed  In fact  the latest Fed minutes do not point at anything that can alter the fate of life insurers by significantly boosting their investment income they utilize to meet policyholders  future claims Actually  for any gain  the rate hike driven improvement in investment income will have to more than offset the decline in yield on assets invested in  And the rate hikes so far are not enough to fetch any significant benefit However  the rising rate environment undoubtedly positions carriers better in terms of generating investment income and maintaining minimum surplus requirement While the market remains uncertain about the effectiveness of rising rates in the long run  it has reacted positively to the progress so far  This is clearly evident from the Zacks Life Insurance Industry s 12 2  gain since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s 8 5  rally However  in addition to a likely escalation in investment income  though not significant   there are reasons to be optimistic about the industry s growth potential Factors That Could Drive Life Insurance Stocks Higher High hedging costs  which have been marring profitability  are likely to decline with rising interest rates  This will  in turn  alleviate the pressure on investment yields Moreover  better control over underwriting expenses and continued increase in premiums should help life insurers enhance their income in the quarters ahead  The individual life insurance premiums  which showed decent growth since the last recession  will likely continue the trend with rising demand driven by an improving job market and the aging population  for retirement savings  In the low rate era  life insurers managed to stay afloat by going beyond their conservative approach and through capital flexibility  In order to keep their commitments to policyholders  they increasingly resorted to riskier asset classes   such as equities  While increased dependence on this strategy has made them vulnerable to faltering on claim payments as there is no guarantee of steady returns from riskier assets  no major setback is likely in the near term  In fact  this arrangement should make variable annuity portfolios and other fee driven businesses contribute a little more to the profits  as the bull market in U S  stocks recently extended into its eighth year What made life insurers resort to racier asset classes is ultra low bond yields due to global growth concerns  However  bond yields have improved since Donald Trump became President on expectations of better economic growth and higher inflation based on an expansive fiscal policy  If this trend continues  life insurers will likely see better days Also  as the U S  corporate bond market remains healthy and the real estate market is unlikely to disappoint amid strong job growth  life insurers  credit related investment losses should be below average Above all  increasing disposable income on the back of continued growth in the economy and declining unemployment should lead to a step up in demand for life insurance and annuity products Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Upside Potential This 15 company group currently carries a  of  21  which places it in the top 8  of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries  Our back testing shows that the top 50  of Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Efficient Business Restructuring to Pay OffLife insurers did not shy away under difficulties that the low rate environment created for them  Taking them in stride  they chose to capitalize on the rapidly changing sector dynamics  As part of this effort  life insurers reduced the sensitivity of their product lines to interest rates to some extent and invested in less liquid assets  While this rationalization is curbing the benefits from the rising rate environment  it should make the growth path steady    The changing economic and demographic conditions are making risk calculation difficult  but life insurers are adopting more predictive techniques with the help of analytics Most importantly  life insurers have managed to improve net income in the last few quarters by trimming underwriting expenses and modestly increasing premium rates  In fact  some life insurers are quietly hiking rates on some universal life policies in order to offset losses emanating from a tough industry backdrop  This action is actually narrowing the gap between what they receive as premium and what they promised to pay policyholders       Life insurers have also been resorting to product modification and re pricing  which should enhance their liability profiles and profitability  While re pricing of traditional products with attractive additional features will help them earn more  product modification will lessen liabilities on the insurers  part by shifting risks related to equity and hedging to policyholders  Moreover  a beefed up capital market should strengthen the industry s liquidity profile in the upcoming quarters and help its participants confront any challenge that might crop up How

125990,347505,LNC,Lincoln National  Should Value Investors Pick This Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lincoln National Corporation   NYSE LNC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lincoln National has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 05  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 35  While Lincoln National s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 8 81 over the past five years  it stands little below the highs for the stock  suggesting that there could still be some good scope for entry Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 95  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Lincoln National has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 17  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lincoln National stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lincoln National has a P S ratio of about 1 23  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 5 93 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lincoln National currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Lincoln National a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Lincoln National is 1 27  a level that is little lower than the industry average of 1 34  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  LNC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Lincoln National might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives LNC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Notably  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no downward revision  while the full year estimate has seen four up and two down in the same time period This has had just a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lincoln National Corporation Price and Consensus    However  this bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock  as we have just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance in the near term  Nonetheless  the definite bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock s prospects in the near term look good Bottom LineLincoln National is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite having a Zacks Rank  3  the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 29   which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks categorized Insurance   Life industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick A Full Blown

126020,347535,LNC,Is Lincoln National  LNC  Poised To Beat On Earnings In Q3 ,opinion,"Lincoln National Corporation   NYSE LNC   is scheduled to report third quarter earnings results after market close on Nov 2 
Last quarter  this insurer reported results in line with the estimates  Lincoln National missed the consensus estimate in three out of the past four reported quarters  with the average miss being 10 8   Will Lincoln National manage to beat estimates this quarter 
Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Lincoln National is likely to beat on earnings as it has the right combination of the two key components  Note that a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  or at least  3  Hold  to have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates Zacks ESP  Lincoln National s Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  1 63 per share  which is a penny above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 62  The Earnings ESP is thus  0 62   Please check our  that enables you find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises 
Zacks Rank   Lincoln National has a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
We expect to see an increase in Group Protection sales  as the company took repricing efforts and enhanced claims management functions to restore profitability in the segment  These efforts had resulted in sales growth of 15  in the previous quarter 
In Retirement Plan Services  small market sales are expected to increase as a result of distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity  This momentum is expected to continue  aided by the recent launch of enhanced small market Director product 
The life insurance segment results are expected to show top line growth from an increase in sales of products without long term guarantees  which will be partly offset by the scale back of the sale of products with long term guarantees 
The bottom line will benefit from the company s expense management efforts  The company is successfully managing general and administrative expenses in a period of slower revenue growth as witnessed by a decline in expense ratio by 50 basis points in the previous quarter  We expect to see a reduction in expenses in the third quarter as well 
Finally  Lincoln National s share repurchase driven by its balance sheet strength and capital generation will further lift its bottom line 
Nevertheless  earnings will likely suffer from low investment income and a decline in income from alternative investments LINCOLN NATL IN Price and EPS Surprise

The segment reported pre tax operating loss of  522 million  wider than the loss of  396 million in the year ago quarter  The downside stemmed from the  622 million loss recognition expense in Institutional Markets based on mortality experience studies that indicated increased longevity Financial PositionAt the end of the quarter  AIG s book value per share  excluding AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth  increased 1  year over year to  62 39 Return on equity  ROE  was 2 1   up 300 bps year over year  led by the active return of capital to shareholders and operating margin improvement  It also benefited from higher returns on alternative investments which exceeded return expectations Share Buyback and Dividend UpdateTotal capital returned to shareholders was  2 6 billion in the reported quarter  including  2 3 billion of share repurchases and  338 million in shareholder dividends On the day of the earnings release  the company s board of directors authorized an additional increase to its previous share repurchase authorization of  3 0 billion  Also  the company declared a cash dividend 32 cents per share  The dividend is payable on Dec 22  2016 to shareholders of record on Dec 8  2016 Our TakeThe year over year improvement in results reflect the efforts taken by the company to make itself slimmer and healthier by shedding non core business  and focusing on high return generating businesses  Its cost reduction initiatives have also borne fruit  as evident from a decline in operating expenses for the first nine months of the year 
Also  the company is delivering on its commitment to return capital to its shareholders  To this effect  it announced an increased in share buyback authorization along with the third quarter earnings release  marking the third increase in share buyback authorization so far this year  Though the company still has a long way to go to improve its profitability  we believe the company is on the right track and is progressing well Currently  AIG carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see AMER INTL GRP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Performance of Other Multi Line InsurersThe bottom line at Lincoln National Corp    NYSE LNC    CNO Financial Group   NYSE CNO   and MetLife  Inc    NYSE MET   all surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter

126043,347558,LNC,Watch Those Small Caps Ahead Of The Fed,opinion,"I confess I  d forgotten what it felt like to bank profits on a daily basis  While it feels great  Janet Yellen has done a fine job yanking away such feelings in times past  So naturally I m nervous about Wednesday  All the same  these small rallies keep failing  which warms my heart 
The small caps are approaching support and of course I hope the trendline breaks  The FOMC will settle that matter  I think  one way or the other

126072,347587,LNC,7 Mid Cap Stocks You Should Consider Buying Now,opinion,"Value stocks are now getting back in favor  It has been almost 7 years of growth and momentum leading value in returns  This year we have seen significant capital move out of growth and into value 
If you are an investor seeking great value investments but you are not fully confident of buying small caps  you should consider mid cap stocks  These tend to show up more undervalued opportunities than large caps and the companies are generally better understood and more stable then smaller companies  Mid cap stocks should also be less volatile 
In this screen  I have stayed under a P E ratio of 9 and a book value greater than the market value 
Interestingly  financials predominate this list  perhaps due to the perceived interest rate risk  Most of these companies also pay great dividends which is always an attractive quality in a value   Mid cap stocks with good dividends that you can buy for cheap right now  what is not to like 
1  Aercap Holdings NV  NYSE AER 
The stock trades at 6 8 times earnings  with a price to book ratio of 0 93  The stock does not pay a dividend 
AerCap is an independent aircraft leasing company based in Dublin  Ireland  Being a capital intensive industry  debt is on the high side and the short term liquidity can be an issue  which is likely why the stock is cheap  Declining oil prices also allow the airlines to lease less and operate their old fuel inefficient planes  When the oil prices go up again  leasing will become more attractive all over again  This may be another industry where we may be seeing a cyclical low as there is a glut of airplanes in the inventory  Very interesting macro economic set up here that we need to keep an eye on 
2  Lincoln National Corporation  NYSE LNC 
The stock trades at 8 83 times earnings  with a price to book ratio of 0 70 and a dividend yield of 2 50  
Lincoln National is a life insurance company providing a full range of insurance products  The stock values the company at  9 6 B  Overall a solid stock with great value now  The stock is down about 30  in the last 52 weeks as longer dated annuities and other similar products are interest rate sensitive 
3  XL Group plc  NYSE XL 
The stock trades at 8 95 times earnings  with a price to book ratio of 0 94 and a dividend yield of 2 17 
Another company based in Ireland  There must be something about the taxes  To be fair  they have proposed moving to Bermuda  If we didn t have a couple of other insurance stocks in the portfolio  I would look very hard at this  Solid operations  92  combined ratio in 2015   and great balance sheet 
4  Unum Group  NYSE UNM 
The stock trades at 8 96 times earnings  with a price to book ratio of 0 86 and a dividend yield of 2 38 
Accident  Health and Life insurer  Unum has a 170 year old pedigree  The stock is cheapish to fairly valued  dividend is consistent and this could be one of the best mid cap t for the long term  You know  just buy it and tuck it away in a corner in your portfolio 
5  Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB 
The stock trades at 8 36 times earnings  with a price to book ratio of 0 90 and a dividend yield of 3 11 
Cincinnati  Ohio based bank is fairly diversified with retail and commercial banking  investments and consumer lending  The stock is well priced and can be a great long term hold 
6  CIT Group Inc   NYSE CIT 
The stock trades at 5 51 times earnings  with a price to book ratio of 0 57 and a dividend yield of 1 87 
CIT provides lending  leasing and advisory services  banking  to small and middle market businesses  They also have a well regarded private banking group  The company delayed filing its most recent annual report due to a material weakness it discovered in One West  a recent acquisition  Profits have been below target as well recently  The valuation reflects these issues  so the question is how long it takes the company to move past this and the stock to recover 
7  Woori Bank Co   Ltd   NYSE WF 
The stock trades at 6 2 times earnings  with a price to book ratio of 0 35 and a dividend yield of 5 15 
This is a South Korean bank that I have looked at on and off for the last 10 15 years  The valuation is great  the stock  ADR  has low liquidity and of course there is a nice dividend
