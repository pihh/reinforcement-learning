Chris Hill  It s Wednesday  January 29  Welcome to MarketFoolery  I m Chris Hill  With me in studio  Mr  Bill Barker  Thanks for being here 
Bill Barker  Thanks for having me 
Hill  Earnings season is in full swing  We ve got McDonald s  we ve got Starbucks  We have a longtime CEO    emphasis on longtime    reportedly leaving the company that he founded  We will get to all of those  but we have to start with Apple  because Apple s first quarter  which is the holiday quarter  was everything you would want it to be if you re an Apple shareholder  Profits and revenue came in higher than expected  iPhone sales   56 billion worth of iPhone sales 
Barker  Yeah  this is the quintessential beat and raise quarter  which Apple probably needed in terms of the stock valuation  It was trading at all time highs  and now is at a new all time high by a little bit more  So  it fulfilled very high expectations  And the question that probably will be bandied around    we ll not spend too much time on this    is  is the valuation justified at this point 
Hill  Yeah  We ll get to the stock in a second  But  the iPhone sales rightfully so getting the headlines  What is the Other Products category    that s the official name that Apple gives it  the Other Products    Apple Watch  AirPods  Beats headphones   10 billion worth of sales  
Barker  Yeah  you can split up the various segments of Apple and get a number of extremely large companies 
Hill  I was going to say  if you just spin off the other products  You d have maybe not a top 100 company in terms of market cap  but certainly top 200 
Barker  Certainly  if you were a Fortune 500 or S P 500 company  how many could you get out of Apple there  That work must have been done a few times  The pile of cash is one of them  at over  200 billion right now  One of the more dominant companies in history is Apple s pile of cash  
Hill   laughs  Trades under the ticker PLCS 
Barker  But in terms of the actual business  yeah  they ve got the various moving parts  Wearables  I guess  and home  and that being the fastest growing part today  Expectations for that are the highest of the various things  I think that the iPad and Mac sales were a little below expectations  There would have been a time where that would have been a big problem  But today is not that time  iPhone is still the dominant part of the business  and really got the job done  especially in China  
Hill  So  what about the stock  Actually  before we wrap up on the stock  worth mentioning  and this is something we ll return to a couple of times today  Tim Cook did talk about China  I think it most notably showed up in the guidance that they gave for Q2  The range of guidance was wider than they normally give  That was Tim Cook and his team s nod toward the uncertainty in China  and rightfully so  
Barker  Yeah  a bit of uncertainty both as to what the purchasing patterns will be there  especially over a quarter  Really  if you re looking at Apple over a one quarter timeframe  you re probably missing a lot of story there  But  possibly benefiting a little bit from the move to do some of the manufacturing outside of China  Yeah  this  like many other companies  has to talk about what the China effect is going to be  and is largely entering with a   Over the short term  we really don t know  Over the long term  probably not much of a problem  
Hill  Apple s stock has more than doubled over the past year  As you said  it s at an all time high  As strong as this company is  this really doesn t seem like the day to buy shares if you don t own shares  
Barker  Going into today  it moved up over the last six months from about 17X earnings over the next 12 months to 24X earnings over the next 12 months  The next 12 months earnings are always a little harder to weigh than the actual trailing 12 months  So  they re looking at good earnings in the next 12 months  and things like China might be more of a headwind than we know today  And  giving them a much higher multiple on that positive future than was being done six months ago  So  yeah  the risk here is that the stock trades a little bit more like the stock usually trades  and at some point in the future  it probably will  
Hill  Shares of McDonald s up a little bit this morning after a good fourth quarter report  McDonald s profits were a little higher than expected  Global same store sales were up nearly 6   Another company dealing with uncertainty in China in the future  In the present  McDonald s closed a few hundred locations  But that s a tiny fraction of the number of locations McDonald s has around the world  
Barker  Yeah  There s certainly been a time when McDonald s was looked at negatively for not having done as much expansion into China as  say  Yum  Brands  which got bigger there faster  earlier than McDonald s  But today  that doesn t look like as much of a problem  They have to give the same answer today that others are giving   We don t really know  We re taking care of our employees  We don t know   I think that for McDonald s  it s a more permanent hit to actual cash in the bank in that if you don t eat a McDonald s  you re not going to eat more there later  hopefully  Whereas  if you don t go out and buy your iPhone today  and you want to  you re going to buy in a month or two or something like that  So  I think the phones will eventually be built and manufactured and sold  McDonald s  when they re closed for business  they don t make that up later  
That said  it was another good quarter  I think they have highlighted that U S  sales and traffic is what they re most focused on  I think that is going well  Getting U S  guest count to positive is our number one priority  new CEO said in the call  They re getting people in  
Hill  They are  although I get why it s a priority  Even though we see the positive comps  and they re able to boost that ticket for 2019  they did see a slight decline in traffic  You mentioned the new CEO  I think that s also worth highlighting for McDonald s  
Barker  We re referring to him as the new CEO because his name is harder to pronounce than Smith  I m going to let you take a crack at it  You ll probably get it right  but I m not 100  sure that I ll pronounce it perfectly  because it is not Smith  which is  I think  the only name I can confidently get right all the time 
Hill  Chris Kempinski is the new CEO  
Barker  I think you re right  
Hill  Yeah  I wrote it down phonetically  But  worth pointing out that  they put up these numbers  this is a huge company  and they put up these numbers when  in the middle of the quarter  Steve Easterbrook  who had been  from a business standpoint  a successful CEO  and certainly from a stock standpoint  and he left suddenly and immediately  And credit to Kempinski and his lieutenants for having no time to ramp up as CEO and pulling off this type of quarter  We ll see if he can handle it just as smoothly for the next couple of quarters  
Barker  And there is a tendency to give  probably  in my estimation  too much credit to a CEO  both positively and negatively at times  We ll see whether McDonald s as an operation owes as much to Easterbrook as would have been thought the case at this time last year  He certainly did a great job and then they re in a good position  Right now  what they re looking at is more competition from places on breakfast  which McDonald s got to early  while giving more competition to the chicken sandwich phenomenon that Popeyes got to earlier than McDonald s  So  they re rolling out a couple of new chicken sandwiches  and they are  I think  expecting more competition from Wendy s in the breakfast category  So  a little bit of getting into some competitions  on both sides  good and bad  
Hill  From a headline standpoint  Starbucks  first quarter report kind of similar to McDonald s  in the sense that profits came in higher than expected  they put up global same store sales growth of 5   That was  I think  about 0 5  higher than was expected  And yet shares of Starbucks down a couple percentage points  Maybe they re being more aggressive with their guidance with respect to China  but if they are  it s probably because they need to be  
Barker  Yeah  we re three for three now on China being a big part of today s stories  It is their fastest growing and second largest market  and it s a major  major  major contributor to the top and bottom line  Again  when they re shutting down stores  which they re doing  closing  they are losing that money  that cash flow  and they re not going to make it back  despite our recommendation that if you have missed some coffee  go ahead and drink more the next day to make sure that you re getting all the health benefits that you can  I mean  not to make light of the situation  But  one thing  listening to the conference call  I felt like  a little bit    I thought the CEO did a very good job of going on again and again about the partners    what other places call employees  Starbucks calls partners    and that Starbucks  success was all attributable to the partners and special relationships and all that  And I m going through  as you have  and will again  the college experience  And my feeling going to every single college and hearing their spiel is  what makes that place special is the people  
And got a little bit of that vibe  listening to the conference call  which you don t typically get  There are many CEOs that talk about their great employees  but Starbucks is definitely a leader in that category  
Hill  I agree with that  But  I referenced this the other day  that I think that how companies doing business in China provide guidance in their earnings report this quarter is something that bears watching more closely than usual  And as a Starbucks shareholder  I was happy with the guidance that they gave  the clarity  You mentioned Kevin Johnson  the CEO  Also Patrick Grismer  the CFO  Just  being very clear with analysts about China  about closings  basically saying    to the point that Kempinski made with McDonald s   Look  we re going to update our guidance for the current quarter and the fiscal year as soon as we possibly can   And they re also dealing in an environment where the state government of China may not necessarily be giving them all the information they want  That is a very real possibility  I think that s to be respected  
Barker  Yeah  That would be consistent with every bit of information that probably comes from the Chinese government  But I think on the whole  they had a great quarter  and in terms of their guidance  they didn t change their previous guidance  On the conference call  pointed out   We would have been raising the guidance if not for China   There was a question   How much   He was like   I m not going to answer that  but I ll just say that we re able to maintain our guidance because of the good start to the first quarter and how well things are going outside of China  And we still think we ll hit that guidance  And it would have been possible to raise it  but it s not possible to raise it today   I think that is putting a cap on what the ceiling for this year is likely to be  but it s a pretty strong floor  
Hill  It is  And I think if Starbucks is a stock you don t own and it s on your watch list  you re probably hoping that this coronavirus thing goes on for another few weeks  
Barker  You re a bad person then  aren t you  What kind of awful people are you describing here  
Hill  I m not saying I want the death count to rise  I m not saying that people   
Barker  It sounded like that to me  You re saying other people think that way 
Hill  I m saying you want the uncertainty out there a little bit longer  You want a cure sooner rather than later  But  just the uncertainty  because as the old adage goes  the market hates uncertainty  If you like Starbucks at this price  you ll like it even more if it s  4 cheaper a share  And Kevin Johnson  the CEO  he was on CNBC this morning  And one of the things he said  and I hope he s right about this was  he pointed out   Look  12 months from now  this is the comp we get to work against  This is the same store sales report that we re going to be competing against a year from now   And he s right about that 
Barker  Yeah  Long term  obviously  it doesn t change much  And it s in a glorious business of serving something that is legal and addictive and beyond that    we joke about this  but there is a lot of science  It has been studied  As something which is consumed as much as it is  I believe the second most consumed beverage behind water in the world  it is important that it be assessed as to whether it s healthy or not  And there are a lot of studies which we talk about  because we like to see that  given our respective amounts of coffee consumption  And the large weight is to their benefit  And that is a nice thing to have  
Hill  L Brands is the parent company of Victoria s Secret and Bath   Body Works  and shares are up 13  this morning and reports that Leslie Wexner  the founder and CEO  is in talks to step down  Mr  Wexner has been the CEO of L Brands for the past 57 years  He is 82 years old  And I think this speaks to the belief  certainly among some investors out there  and maybe private equity is part of this  that they look at Victoria s Secret and Bath   Body Works as brands that have some staying power  and if someone other than Mr  Wexner is running the company  then that s the value to be unlocked  
Barker  I have discussed that if I were to be accorded one superpower  it would be the ability to leave at the right time  I think you could do a lot with that  And that is not a superpower which he has  because this is a stock which was trading at  100 in 2015  It s going for  23 after going up 12  today  His superpower is longevity  Not strictly  Other people have lived longer than he has  although he s off to a good start  57 years as CEO  that s rare company 
Hill  Incredibly rare company  Also  he s a billionaire  so let s not bemoaned any losses he must have taken   
Barker  He probably thought about it   laughs   probably  a little bit  But  no  he s lived and worked a whole life  Let s not look at the last couple chapters from a stock perspective  which I was setting up  
Hill  You know what  He s in the Tres Commas club  he s fine 
Barker  Yeah  So  up 12  on the news  This is something that isn t entirely unexpected  I say that because I was reading a Deutsche Bank report today from about three weeks ago  which was speculating that now    this was three weeks ago    was the time to buy following as disastrous a quarter as L Brands had just reported  because this was highly likely to lead to increased movement in terms of his departure or some sort of breakup  Right now  Victoria s Secret is expected to lose money this year  which is remarkable  It s Bath   Body Works which is producing what little profits there are now  Victoria s Secret has just not gotten the trends right at all for a while now  That has led to 80  of the stock price being taken away  
Hill  Again  there s brand equity there  They re still a leader in their category  I was talking a bit with Abi Malin this morning  she follows the retail industry pretty closely  When I asked her  what do you think of this pop  She said   Yeah  this makes perfect sense   Someone in there more dynamic  with more creative ideas  particularly with respect to Victoria s Secret  Yeah  that s absolutely why this is happening  
Barker  Yes  They are behind on a number of issues  If we get into talking about the specifics  I m sure we ll trip over the wrong thing  But I was interested that  for instance  in the last quarter  there were declines in casual sleepwear  but there was growth in sexy sleep  And I didn t really know that was an industry category  
Hill  Look  Apple has their Other Products category  Victoria s Secret  makes sense that they would break out into different categories as well 
Barker  You ve got your Sexy Sleep and your Casual Sleep  So  it s definitely not doing very well there  Bath   Body Works  they had a good Christmas season  perhaps in part because of the Unicorn Sprinkles candles  
Hill  You sent this to me right before we started recording  The profit margins  as we ve discussed in the past  the profit margins on those  25 three wick candles have got to be pretty amazing  And at this point  I think anything s fair game  As you said  Bath   Body Works is getting it done for the parent company  So  if you re in the candle division  yeah  you can pretty much throw whatever you want out there  Sweater Weather  Sure  absolutely 
Barker  We ve mocked the candle names in the past  and I think we re about to again  but I went to the page  and the first page of candles    and they ve got hundreds of different scents    all made sense  Like  I could say   Oh  that s a smell I recognize   rather than Sweater Weather and Expensive Romantic Dinner or whatever  But  Unicorn Sprinkles  I don t know where to begin on what that might smell like  
Hill  I m assuming like Sex Panther cologne  it has bits of real unicorn in it 
Barker  The fragrance    I ve looked it up     fluffy cotton candy   as opposed to your more hard cotton candy  I guess   Rainbow candy drops and sugared lemon with essential oils   So  it smells like sugar  Which is what unicorns smell like  
Hill  Apparently  
Barker  So  they nailed it  
Hill   laughs  Well done  Bath   Body Works  Well done  Bill Barker  thanks for being here 
Barker  Thanks for having me

93445,314960,SBUX,Earnings volatility set to kick in as coronavirus worries mount,news,"By April Joyner NEW YORK  Reuters    Concerns over the outbreak of coronavirus from China have largely overshadowed corporate results  but the back half of the earnings season could hold greater sway over the performance of individual stocks  Earnings related stock moves have been smaller this season in comparison with the average over the past 12 quarters  according to data from options research company ORATS   The muted moves reflect a broader trend of subdued volatility that had limited price fluctuations in a range of assets over the last several months  Some of that calm was disrupted this week  as mounting concerns over the spread of the coronavirus on Friday dealt the benchmark S P 500  SPX  stock index its biggest daily percentage loss since October  The dampened earnings related moves have benefited options sellers  who profit when the change in share price is smaller than expected  Yet betting that earnings related moves will remain subdued could soon become more costly   Options traders have priced in more volatility for broader exchange traded funds  Implied volatility on the SPDR S P 500 ETF Trust  P SPY   which shows expectations for future stock swings  has climbed since mid January  according to data from Trade Alert  That rise coincides with mounting concerns over the potential economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak   The options market is reflecting this new risk  this coronavirus risk   said Ophir Gottlieb  chief executive of Capital Market Laboratories in Los Angeles  Moreover  risks from the virus outbreak are beginning to spill over into earnings commentary  Companies such as  Starbucks Corp   O SBUX   Levi Strauss   Co  N LEVI  and Oreos maker  Mondelez International Inc   O MDLZ  have warned of a financial hit from the outbreak  As such remarks pile up  they could also bump up volatility among shares of certain companies  Gottlieb said   Some CEOs are openly saying   Hey  things are going to be a little harder    Gottlieb said  At the same time  the fourth and fifth weeks of the six week earnings season have usually reaped the greatest rewards for traders buying options in anticipation of outsized stock moves  according to ORATS data  Earnings related moves tend to be greater in those weeks in part because smaller companies  whose stocks are often more volatile  tend to report later in the season  said Matt Amberson  founder of ORATS  in Portsmouth  New Hampshire  Options for several S P 500  SPX  companies reporting next week   including  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc   N CMG    Twitter Inc   N TWTR  and  Coty Inc   N COTY    show a gap of several percentage points between investors  expectations for share moves and past share performance after quarterly reports

93446,314961,SBUX,The Coronavirus Is Infecting the Global Economy  Here s How ,news," Bloomberg     An interconnected global economy is feeling the strain of China s viral outbreak    and the potential  160 billion hit in lost growth that may be on the way 
In New Zealand  a bath furnishings seller told a customer that the German designed shower head he ordered is unavailable    because the factory in Shanghai is closed  Out in California executives of REC Group organized a supply chain war room to plan around an anticipated trucking shortage and port logjam in China  In the Middle East  Saudi Arabia is rallying support for an emergency OPEC meeting on concern oil demand will falter 
Since China s last health crisis  the SARS outbreak of 2003  its share of global economic output has quadrupled to about 17   It s now the biggest market for new cars and semiconductors  the largest spender on international tourism  the leading exporter of clothing and textiles  and the land where many PCs and virtually all iPhones are made  The global hit from this new outbreak could be three to four times larger than the  40 billion blow from SARS  estimates Warwick McKibbin  a professor of economics at Australian National University 
Thus far  China has absorbed most of the economic shock from the coronavirus known as 2019 nCoV  which has killed more than 210 within its borders and infected over 9 950 globally  Wuhan  the city with 11 million residents where the virus came to light  remains closed off from the world  Under a government mandated extension of the Lunar New Year holiday  provinces generating at least two thirds of economic output will be shuttered through next week  including Shanghai and key eastern manufacturing hubs 
All the while  the virus s toll continues to rise    and with it the worry  China s essential role in the global supply chain means business owners and executives around the world are being forced to contemplate what will happen in a prolonged crisis 
 Everyone is waiting to see how this evolves   said Miguel Patricio  the chief executive officer of Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  Co  The food giant has a couple thousand employees in China  including a small sales team in Wuhan   The danger  of course  is that if this continues and people have to stay home  you start having problems in terms of distribution  production  
Closed Doors
Four months ago  Levi Strauss  NYSE LEVI    Co  opened the doors to a flashy new flagship store in Wuhan  a booming manufacturing powerhouse that alternately gets called the Chicago or Detroit of China  The location features three levels of premium collections and a massive tailor shop  At just over 7 500 square feet  697 square meters   the location is twice as big as any other Levi franchises in China  The mega store was heralded by top executives as a symbol of a new era of growth for the brand in the country 
Today  like almost everything else in town  the store is shut  A major component of Levi s growth strategy in the region is temporarily stalled  joining thousands of international corporations  Chinese conglomerates and small businesses in the first wave of economic impact from the virus 
 Our priority is employees  and if the situation doesn t correct itself quickly  we will probably remain closed for a while   Levi Chief Financial Officer Harmit J Singh said in a phone interview 
International companies have poured into China  opening up Est e Lauder counters  Canada Goose stores and Rolls Royce  LON RR  showrooms in Beijing and Shanghai  In more recent years  they moved into the second  and third tier cities whose populations have ballooned during the nation s mass urbanization 
Companies with big exposure to China  from  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   to Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  Inc   refrained from predicting this week how the virus would affect demand  saying simply that they d update their forecasts when they know more  Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   and  Microsoft Corp   NASDAQ MSFT   gave wider than usual forecast ranges for the quarter amid uncertainty about the virus impact 
The hope  of course  is that health officials are able to contain the spread of the virus enough to let people get back to the normal rhythms of life in a matter of weeks  A vaccine could be months or even years away  but some viruses can burn themselves out within the season  Others take longer  SARS was declared a global health emergency in March 2003 and was considered contained by that July 
The fear is that because 2019 nCoV has a stealthy quality    symptoms can appear as late as two weeks after infection    it will have staying power  Worst case  it could frustrate the best efforts of the world s public health authorities and wreak havoc along trade routes and in boardrooms for months to come 
The first wave of economic impact from the virus comes at a delicate moment  Western companies have helped convert late January s Lunar New Year festivities into a shopping bonanza  to the point where it s become a key period for economic growth in China  This year  it s been so subdued that consumption growth in the first quarter will slow by more than half in China from the 5 5  growth rate recorded in the final months of 2019  according to Bloomberg Economics 
It s easy to see how  Starbucks has closed more than 2 000 outlets across China    half of its total    and can t get some menu items for those that remain open  McDonald s Corp  has shut hundreds of restaurants  Some Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc  stores are running out of products  Walt  Disney   NYSE DIS  Co  s theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have gone dark  Even before the U S  and Japan advised their citizens to avoid traveling to China  airlines had curtailed flights to the country    not because of fear of contagion  but due to lack of passengers 
Many of those coffee purchases  vacation getaways and impulse buys are lost forever  in terms of GDP    it s not as if consumers will buy two lattes in March to make up for the one they meant to purchase in January  Manufacturing is different  Although factories that were supposed to be reopening now will remain closed  many have some wiggle room to make up for lost time  pay employees some overtime and finish off their orders 
But with every passing day  there s less room to maneuver  Construction activity that was paused over the winter  especially in the colder northern parts of China  should be starting up by now  Capital spending is likely to be reined in as companies delay decisions until they know more about the virus s impact 
The many companies that rely on Chinese manufacturing need to place orders soon to have products ready for peak shopping times 
Take Anne Harper  founder of OMG Accessories  a New York based company that sells bags and backpacks to Macy s Inc    Nordstrom Inc   NYSE JWN    Dillard s Inc   TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores Inc  Even before the Lunar New Year  she works to lock in orders with her supplier near Guangzhou to ensure she gets priority after the holiday  Customers want the product by May or June for back to school season  when some customers will sell 80 000 backpacks in a single week  That means OMG tries to fill its warehouse by April 
 Making those deliveries is just so important for the life cycle of our product   Harper said   If you miss delivery  everyone has already bought their school bags  
The outbreak will also have a wide ranging impact on the technology industry  with China accounting for about 21  of global IT hardware spending  Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote Jan  29  Some of the biggest PC makers and parts suppliers are based in China  and if there s a slowdown in sales  that would constrain demand for Microsoft s Windows operating system software 
Apple  Tech
More than 50  of the more than  470 billion of chips that are sold each year are either used in devices sold in China or go there to be put into gear sold around the world 
Apple has roughly 10 000 direct employees in China  and its supply chain has a few million workers manufacturing products like the iPad  iPhone and Apple Watch  The Cupertino  California based company prepares for extreme scenarios like the coronavirus by mandating that major components be dual sourced    both in terms of vendors and geography    and a major immediate impact to its production plans is unlikely for now  a person familiar with its operations said this week  Even so  most of its assembly work is done in China  and so a shortage of workers for assembly lines will have a direct impact on shipment numbers 
On the other side of the equation are small manufacturers in China whose livelihood depends on the confidence of their customers  Any hesitance from clients can cause disarray for people like Cash Liu  a sales director at hot tub maker Shenzhen Kingston Sanitary Ware 
 Some of our clients choose to wait and see and hold off from placing orders  due to concerns over the coronavirus   Liu said via a messaging app   Thus we are likely to miss the peak season of sales to Europe in March  
Add up the effects of lower consumption  investment and a pause in manufacturing  and the impact from the virus could knock China s first quarter gross domestic product growth down to 4 5     the lowest since the quarterly data begins in 1992    from 6  in the final three months of 2019  estimated Chang Shu  chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics  The biggest knock on effects would be felt by Hong Kong  followed by South Korea and Japan  she wrote  Germany and Japan might take a 0 2  hit to GDP  while the U S  and U K  would absorb a 0 1  blow 
It s survivable  and fiscal stimulus from Beijing could even lessen the blow  On the other hand  the estimate assumes the outbreak is contained to China  And  the longer factory output is affected  the bigger the risk China s dominant position in global supply chains disrupts activity elsewhere   the economist wrote 
Shell  LON RDSa  Shock
Within and outside China s borders  the virus is bringing up flashbacks to the height of last year s trade war with the U S   when global companies raced to find alternatives to their Chinese suppliers and avoid tariffs 
The outbreak could spur more businesses to move manufacturing to the U S  and Mexico  U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business this week  What s clear is that the virus is adding another layer of complexity for businesses that were just beginning to breathe a sigh of relief over trade tensions 
 This virus outbreak may be even a bigger hit to us than the U S  China trade war   said Melissa Shu  export manager at E D  Opto Electrical Lighting Co  s auto parts factory in Zhenjiang City 
Decades of globalization have made leaders at large corporations comfortable with the logistical challenge of moving resources from place to place and responding nimbly to geopolitical shifts  But 2019 was a lot for anyone to handle  and the thought of contending with a potentially lethal virus in 2020 is giving even the most hardened executives pause 
 Between the virus and the tariffs and the protests in Hong Kong    I m waiting for the locusts   said Emanuel Chirico  CEO of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH Corp  NYSE PVH   He said it s too early to determine the impact the virus will have on the apparel industry

If markets are assuming the coronavirus will have an economic hit on China  then the USD CNH should be trading higher  which it is   On January 20    USD CNH put in a hammer candlestick formation  which is a one candle formation when price trades to new lows early in the day and bounce later in the day to close near unchanged  forming a hammer   Since then  USD CNH has been moving higher and has traded out of falling wedge   The target for a breakout of a falling wedge is a 100  retracement of the wedge  which is near 7 0865   However on the move higher  the pair has stalled near the psychological level of 7 0000  which is also near the 200 day moving average

On a 240 minute timeframe  USD CNH has actually been in a channel downtrend since September 3  2019   After a false breakdown on January 20 to the hammer lows  on the daily   price moved higher and gapped higher on this past Sunday s reopen from 6 9265 to 6 9452   The gap has yet to be filled  In addition to the psychological resistance and the 200 day moving average  the stall in price is also near the 38 2  Fibonacci retracement level from the previously mentioned timeframe and the top  downward sloping trendline from the channel

7 0000 is first resistance level   If price breaks above  7 02 is the 50  retracement level of the same timeframe and horizontal resistance   The 61 8  retracement level is near 7 06  however there are small resistance levels to stop the pair from moving back up toward 7 19   First support is the gap fill from last weekend at 6 9308   Below that is some minor horizontal support near 6 87  but the large support of recent lows and bottom trendline of the channel near 6 8448 
As the coronavirus continues to spread  watch for 2 things in particular that may give an indication that the virus may be slowing  1  the rate at which it is spreading and 2  the number of companies that are closing operations for a period until the virus is contained   These will give us a better idea of how well the virus is being contained   And if the coronavirus is contained  we may see the 7 0000 level hold in USD CNH ",2020-01-29,Joe Perry,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-coronavirus-impact-on-usdcnh-200502834,200502834

93450,314965,SBUX,Coronavirus  Potential Signs Of Containment  Key Markets To Watch,opinion,"This week  traders have been weighing generally optimistic signs from massive U S  technology companies against the continued spread of coronavirus  So far  virus fears are winning out as seen by the week to date drop in major global indices and rally in traditional safe havens like gold and bonds  That said  the situation is far from resolved  so we wanted to take a look at the raw numbers and highlight different market opportunities for traders to examine 
While the total number of infections and deaths continue to grow  it s worth noting that the percentage growth rate of those figures has shifted lower in recent days  Reviving and expanding our rough   na ve growth  coronavirus model from earlier this week  we can see that the growth rate of infections and deaths on mainland China has shifted down to  only  around 25 30  over the last two days 







Source  Chinese Health Commission  GAIN Capital 
Reiterating that I m not an epidemiologist and this is far from an exhaustive model  there are tentative signs that Chinese authorities may be slowing the growth rate of the infection  a critical step toward ultimately containing it  Early data from other countries is even more optimistic  with no deaths reported in other countries  We ll continue to monitor these developments in the coming days  as any new outbreaks in other countries or reacceleration in growth would be very worrisome 







Market ImplicationsBased on the general recovery in risk assets since Monday s swoon  traders are taking a similar cautiously optimistic view toward the virus s spread  At this point  it s premature to speculate on the ultimate economic impact  but this quarter s growth is likely to slow sharply with many heavily populated regions of mainland China on lockdown during the critical New Year holiday  The SARS epidemic of 2003 reportedly shaved 1 2  off China s GDP growth and coronavirus has likely already eclipsed the total number of infections from SARS  though early indications of the death rate are lower  Rather than wait for the official economic figures  traders have aggressively sold Chinese assets  with USD CNH retesting the key 7 00 level and the FTSE China A50 index shedding about 12  over the last two weeks Source  TradingView  GAIN Capital As we noted earlier this week  individual equities and markets could provide additional trading opportunities in the days and weeks to come Assets Likely To Be Correlated With Spread Of Coronavirus

93452,314967,SBUX,A Combination Topping Pattern Is Setting Up,opinion,"Our research team has highlighted a number of technical and other factors that point to a very real potential of a major market top setting up across the global markets   We ve highlighted a number of research articles over the past 30 to 45 days that clearly illustrate our interpretation of the U S  and global markets 
Our team believes the Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan china will cripple economic expansion and consumer economic activity in China and much of SE Asia over the next few weeks and months   If the virus spreads into India  it could quickly target large portions of India s economic capabilities   We are very early into this potential pandemic event   The growth rates reported by China suggest only a 2 3  death rate  yet an almost exponential growth rate for the number of invested   It started off below 100 about 10  days ago and is now almost ready to break 10k 
Skilled traders must understand that the world is far more inter connected economically and via transportation than it was even 50 years ago   More people travel to various parts of the world more often than ever before   More goods and services travel back and forth across oceans and continents than ever before   This inter connected world is actually quite small when you consider a student or vacationer can travel more than halfway around the planet in less than 35 hours  access two or three major transportation hubs  airports  and have direct contact to dozens of people and indirect contract to thousands of people within that span of time 
January 23  2020  JANUARY 2018 STOCK MARKET REPEAT   YIKES 
December 20  2019  WHO SAID TRADERS AND INVESTOR ARE EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOW 
December 16  2019  CURRENT EQUITIES RALLY SIMILARITIES TO 1999
Our concern is  quite literally  that the growth of the number of infected people related to this Coronavirus is only just starting to explode 
One analyst we were watching on TV suggested waiting for a  5  price correction in high value U S  equities before attempting to buy back into this weakness   Knowing that any type of global pandemic even could continue to expand for many months  years of decades  we believe a large number of these analysts are failing to understand the total scope of this potential event 
Our research team believes the next 6 to 12 months will become very telling regarding the real economic contraction resulting from the Coronavirus spread   We believe the initial measures governments and world organizations are taking will shrink economic opportunity by at least 10 to 20  for certain nations   If the virus explodes into Africa  or the Middle East  or North America  then we have another set of problems to deal with   At that point  the economic ramifications could result in a 30 to 50  contraction in certain segments of the US and Global economy 
Let us try to explain our thinking 
No  people will not stop buying toilet paper  toothpaste  food  and other essential supplies  but they will likely slow their purchases at Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   movie theaters  social events  traveling to unknown areas and shopping in large exposed areas  big box stores    Anything that is perceived as a risk will be viewed as potentially dangerous and unwanted 
Consumers and Businesses are like flocks of birds or schools of fish  they all seem to turn to follow the others and move as a single group or  beast    If consumers start to pull back as this issue extends  we expect the  beast  will follow this trend until the risk is minimized 
Even though the U S  economic numbers from Q4 are still landing with very strong numbers   remember this data does not include any real data from the current quarter   Everything looks really good if you ignore the threat of the Coronavirus going forward  which is rather foolish    Q1 and Q2 2020 could become a completely different set of numbers 
January 29  2020  ARE WE SETTING UP FOR A WATERFALL SELLOFF 
We believe the waterfall even that we highlighted earlier this week is still a very valid interpretation of the global market future reaction throughout most of Q1 and Q2 of this year   We don t see any real alternative other than price contraction as long as the Coronavirus continues to wreak havoc across the planet   If the virus is suddenly contained and diminishing  or cured  then we believe the global perception will change back to positive very quickly 
We believe the first waterfall event is already taking place   We believe the second waterfall event will produce a downside price move targeting recent support near  307 on the SPY  NYSE SPY    We believe any further breakdown of the price below this support level will prompt a downside price move targeting the  260 level   These rotations will come in waves or waterfall events and could target various sectors of the U S  and global markets 







Pay attention to what the Transportation Index  TRAN  is doing as this outbreak continues   Slowing consumer activity means essential items will still be in high demand  but big ticket items  cars  luxury  and vacations may see a dramatic slowing in sales and activity   Even homes and apartments may slow in sales   People tend to become very protective and secure in these economic modes 
The Transportation Index may initially fall to levels near 10 200 before finding any real support   Then a further downside move may target longer term support near 8 500   Below that level let s just say that below that level and we could be well into a very serious Bearish contraction phase of the global markets 







Take this time to reposition your assets and protect your value   You can always redeploy your capital when you feel the time is right to jump back into the markets   We believe the next 60 to 90 days will become very informative relating to the spread and capabilities of this virus and our ability to fight it   Don t let this volatility be something like 2009 when you look back and say  I should have known better  ",2020-01-31,Chris Vermeulen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-combination-topping-pattern-is-setting-up-200503601,200503601

citizens out of the epicentre of China s coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday  as the number of deaths jumped to 133 and the World Health Organization voiced  grave concern  about person to person spread in three other countries  The WHO said its Emergency Committee would reconvene behind closed doors on Thursday to decide whether the rapid spread of the new virus from China now constitutes a global

93472,314987,SBUX,Coronavirus outbreak poses risk to U S  Fed s economic outlook,news,"By Ann Saphir and Lindsay Dunsmuir
SAN FRANCISCO WASHINGTON  Reuters    The outbreak of a new virus that originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan is likely to slow China s economic growth at least in the near term and could hurt its trading partners around the world 
The potential effects of the spread of the coronavirus  which has sickened more than 6 000  mostly in China  and killed 133 since its detection early last month  took center stage in U S  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell s news conference on Wednesday following the central bank s widely expected decision to keep interest rates unchanged 
The Fed is  very carefully monitoring the situation   Powell told reporters 
While Powell noted that it is  too early to say  what the extent of the impact on the United States will be  he said it is  a significant thing which will have some effects on the Chinese economy  at least in the short term  
A Chinese government economist earlier on Wednesday projected the outbreak would cut China s first quarter growth by one percentage point to 5  or lower 
Powell also acknowledged the risks  including to the U S  economy  from any slowdown in the world s second biggest economy 
 China s economy is very important in the global economy now  and when China s economy slows down we do feel that   not as much though as countries that are near China  or that trade more actively with China  like some of the Western European countries   Powell said 
China has imposed travel restrictions and shut businesses and schools in an attempt to contain the outbreak  but it has not quelled rising concern among companies and governments across the world  some of whom are taking swift action 
Airlines including British Airways  L ICAG   United Airlines  O UAL  and Lufthansa  DE LHAG  are cutting or suspending flights  tourists are canceling trips  and businesses including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Starbucks are warning of the potential impact on their supply chains and sales 
Starbucks  O SBUX  has closed more than half its cafes in China and Walt  Disney   N DIS  shut its resorts and theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong during what is usually its busiest time of year  Alphabet Inc s  O GOOGL  Google has said it is temporarily shutting down its offices in China  Hong Kong and Taiwan 
 The coronavirus will likely have the largest negative impact on goods and services sectors within and outside of China that rely on Chinese consumers and intermediary products   Moody s analysts said in a report on Wednesday 
The assessments suggest the impact could be larger than that of the 2002 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  SARS  epidemic  the last novel virus to cause global alarm 
That outbreak resulted in about 800 deaths and slowed Asia s economic growth  But the overall effect on the U S  economy was ultimately limited and short lived 
But as the Moody s analysts and others point out  China accounts for a bigger share of global economic growth now than it did then  and the world is more closely connected 
Over the past week  amid news of coronavirus cases in the United States and more than a dozen other countries  trading in U S  Treasuries reflected rising concern about a spillover effect 
Futures tied to the Fed s target policy rate also moved in the past week  and are now pricing in bets the Fed will cut interest rates again in July 
CAREFUL COMMENTS
In his news conference on Wednesday  Powell gave no hint the central bank plans to lower borrowing costs anytime soon  Indeed  he suggested the global risks from uncertain trade policy and slowing global growth  which prompted the Fed s three rate cuts in 2019  looked to be receding  prompting  cautious optimism  on the U S  economic outlook this year

93473,314988,SBUX,China virus toll rises to 170 as countries isolate citizens to stop global spread,news,"SHANGHAI SEOUL  Reuters    Several countries began isolating hundreds of citizens evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan in an effort to stop the global spread of an epidemic which has killed 170  with South Korea calling for calm in the face of protests at a quarantine center 
Asian stocks and currencies fell on Thursday as fatalities rose and more cases were reported around the world 
China s National Health Commission said the total number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus in the country climbed to 170 as of late Wednesday and the number of infected patients rose to 7 711 
Almost all the deaths so far have been in the central province of Hubei  home to about 60 million people and now under virtual lockdown  The virus emerged last month in a live wild animal market in the provincial capital Wuhan 
Infections have been reported in at least 15 other nations  with 104 confirmed cases 
The World Health Organization  WHO  said its Emergency Committee would reconvene behind closed doors on Thursday to decide whether the rapid spread of the new virus from China now constitutes a global emergency 
 In the last few days the progress of the virus especially in some countries  especially human to human transmission  worries us   WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva  naming Germany  Vietnam and Japan 
 Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small  they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak  
ISOLATION PLANS
Plans to isolate hundreds of evacuated foreigners varied between countries 
Australia  South Korea  Singapore and New Zealand will quarantine all evacuees regardless of whether they showed symptoms for at least two weeks  while the United States and Japan were planning voluntary isolation for shorter periods 
Two returnees from Japan tested positive for the virus in Tokyo on Thursday although they showed no symptoms  explaining why some countries are planning extreme quarantine measures for the entire incubation period of up to 14 days 
South Korean protesters used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centers in the cities of Asan and Jincheon  about 80 km  50 miles  south of Seoul  on Wednesday 
South Korean President Moon Jae in on Thursday urged residents not to give in to fear as the country prepared to evacuate the first of around 700 citizens from Wuhan 
 The weapons that will protect us from the new coronavirus are not fear and aversion but trust and cooperation   Moon said in a speech on Thursday  decrying  fake news  as creating excessive anxiety 
The first of up to four planned flights to Wuhan had been due to depart South Korea on Thursday morning  but were delayed for unspecified reasons  Yonhap news agency reported  The flights were still expected to depart by later in the day 
Singapore s foreign ministry said it was returning 92 Singaporeans from Wuhan on Thursday  All returning passengers  and foreign ministry staff accompanying them  will either be taken to hospital or quarantined for 14 days 
Nearly 200 Americans  mostly U S  diplomats and their families  airlifted from Wuhan on Wednesday will remain isolated at a U S  military base in California for at least 72 hours of medical evaluation  public health officials said 
A second flight with Japanese evacuees from Wuhan landed in Japan on Thursday with nine people showing symptoms of fever or coughing  broadcaster NHK reported  The first flight landed on Wednesday and at least one more is expected in coming days 
Three Japanese who returned on the first flight on Wednesday were confirmed to be infected with the virus  said the health ministry  two of the three had not shown any symptoms 
Japan will declare the virus as a  designated infectious disease  from starting Feb  7 which will allow compulsory hospitalization  but will not apply to those without symptoms 
Chinese National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei on Sunday said the virus was infectious during incubation  which was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  SARS   another coronavirus that emerged from China and killed about 800 people in 2002 2003 
VIRUS HITTING CHINA ECONOMY
The effects of the virus are already weighing heavily on China s economy  the world s second biggest  with companies cutting corporate travel and tourists cancelling trips during the traditional Lunar New Year holiday period 
A government economist said the crisis could cut China s first quarter growth by one point to 5  or lower as the crisis hits sectors from mining to luxury goods 
Various airlines are cutting flights to the country  from British Airways and Lufthansa to Air Canada and American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  
Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc s Google said it would temporarily shut all its offices in China and Sweden s IKEA said it had temporarily closed all its stores in the country because of the outbreak of the new coronavirus

93475,314990,SBUX,China Seen Boosting Stimulus as Virus Hammers the Economy,news," Bloomberg     China is expected to unveil efforts to cushion the economic blow from coronavirus  with the central bank set to keep liquidity ample and the government likely to step up spending 
Authorities will need to break their fiscal rule of a 3  deficit relative to GDP to  slow the downward spiral of economic activities   according to Li Gang Liu at  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   Measures such as cutting interest rates and the proportion of deposits banks must set aside as reserves are possible  said Larry Hu  head of China economics at Macquarie Securities Ltd  in Hong Kong 
As the death toll rises and authorities lock down cities  the blow to spending and production is becoming clearer  with policy moves unlikely to avoid at least a short term wallop  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and Uniqlo are among the retail outlets closing down across the country  and manufacturers including Toyota Motor Corp  have halted production at least for a time 
 Beijing is unlikely to sit on its hands   said Hu   But liquidity easing measures could only do so much to boost growth  
U S  and European equity futures slumped and Asian stocks tumbled to a seven week low amid mounting concerns over the virus  Sovereign bonds rallied 
Growth Hit
The economic hit to China could exceed that seen during the SARS outbreak of 2003  according to Nomura Holdings Inc  Gross domestic product growth could  materially drop  this quarter from the 6  pace at the end of 2019  maybe even more than the 2 percentage point deceleration seen in the second quarter of 2003  Nomura economists led by Lu Ting wrote in a report to clients 
Policy makers will provide liquidity and credit support  especially to business owners severely affected  they said 
 RRR cuts  rate cuts  various lending facilities and open market operations all are possible options   the Nomura economists wrote   However  it seems unlikely that these measures would turn the economy around  as the virus outbreak may further weaken domestic demand and thus render the upcoming policy easing less effective  
The outbreak and its aftermath will drag first quarter GDP growth 0 9 percentage point lower to 5  as industrial production and exports decline  according to Raymond Yeung  chief China economist at Australia   New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  in Hong Kong  The loss of an extra 3 5 working days in the quarter will dent industrial production and exports while the plunge in tourism will trim the services sector s growth  he noted 
 BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  economists Ryutaro Kono and Azusa Kato see the first quarter growth rate falling below 5  
JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co  economists led by Zhu Haibin revised their growth forecast for 2020 to factor in the  large negative shock  in the first quarter  mainly to retail sales  They lowered the year on year prediction for the first quarter to 5 6  from a previous estimate of 6  and the 2020 forecast to 5 8  from 5 93  earlier 
Like most economists  the JPMorgan team noted that much depends on China s ability to contain the spread of the disease 
 A more benign scenario is that the virus outbreak will successfully be contained in the next few weeks after the  Big Bang  control measures   Zhu wrote   A more bearish scenario is that the virus outbreak will continue into 2Q  and suspension on activity will be extended and the demand shock will interact with a supply shock  adding further downward pressure  
Serena Zhou  an economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd in Hong Kong  also sees two scenarios  In the optimistic case  a  catch up  effect in the second and third quarters allows full year GDP growth of 5 9   in the conservative case  full year GDP may be at least 0 3 percentage point lower than that 
Global Spillover
The global economy is likely to feel the effects  too  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the outbreak will likely hit the Chinese economy and could spread wider  but it was too early to judge what impact it would have on the U S 
 We are very carefully monitoring the situation   Powell said at a press conference Wednesday in Washington after the U S  central bank held its benchmark interest rate steady 
Virus Poses New Threat to Economy s Fragile Stabilization
Macquarie s Hu said Beijing s priority is on containment  and the earliest time for any major policy change is at April s meeting of the Communist Party s Politburo  by when damage to the economy can been assessed 
Liu at Citigroup said  micro level fiscal policy implementation will be more important to provide free medical care to affected patients  tax and interest rate payment subsidies to firms   especially small and medium sized ones 
Liu also expects targeted cuts in the reserve requirement ratio for banks headquartered in Hubei and other heavily affected regions  and a one off policy rate cut in the first quarter of at least 15 basis points 
Some of China s largest banks have already said they will reduce interest rates for firms affected by the novel coronavirus  The People s Bank of China said Tuesday it will conduct operations  to provide abundant liquidity in a timely manner to maintain reasonable and sufficient liquidity in the banking system

93476,314991,SBUX,Why Starbucks Investors Shouldn t Worry About Coronavirus,news,"Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  nailed its first quarter earnings report Tuesday  But in spite of strong results across the board  investors were spooked by the outbreak of coronavirus in China  Shares were trading down 2 7  in afternoon trading Wednesday as a result 
Starbucks said that currently more than half of its stores in China were closed as it responded to the outbreak  The java giant also said it would have raised its full year guidance in operating margin and earnings per share  but it was exercising caution  as it said the impact from the store closures would be material to its second quarter and full year results 
Though that news is clearly a setback for the coffee chain  investors seemed to be overreacting to it  We ll discuss why  but first let s review a few key facts about the coronavirus 
Some coronavirus facts
According to authorities  the new coronavirus came from a seafood market in China s Wuhan province and was first detected on Dec  12  and identified on Jan  7  The first death from pneumonia like symptoms occurred on Jan  9  and by Jan  13  the disease had spread to other countries 
Over the last week  cases have skyrocketed and fears about the disease s spread have multiplied  Wuhan has been placed on lockdown  By Jan  28  the death toll reached 100 globally  and there are more than 4 500 confirmed cases  At this point  relatively little is known about the disease s potential impact  or even its mortality rate  But restaurants can easily spread diseases  those in China are being cautious  and many have temporarily closed their doors or cut back hours 
Why Starbucks investors need not worry
Though the coffee chain will take a hit from the outbreak  Starbucks  vulnerability isn t as great as some investors might think  The java giant has spent years talking up the market  but today only 10  of its revenue and a slightly higher percentage of its operating income come from China 
In a worst case scenario  if Starbucks were forced to close all of its stores in China  the company would still be fine  Its revenue and profits would just be 10  lower  However  if the outbreak worsens  the company could actually be better off than a number of American companies and local rivals 
It s hard to understate the importance of China in the global economy  Nearly one fifth of the world s population lives in China  and the country contributes nearly 20  of the world s gross domestic product  GDP   making it the second biggest economy after the U S  Hundreds of multinational enterprises count on the Chinese market the way Starbucks does  looking to it for growth    and because it s a huge market 
China is also the world s biggest manufacturer  and a major supplier of everything from tech gadgets and electronics to apparel and toys to raw materials like steel and concrete  Therefore  a sustained and deadly outbreak in China would likely devastate the global supply chain and economy  Since 90  of Starbucks  revenue comes from outside of China and it isn t dependent on China as a supplier  the company would be relatively protected from any shock waves that could affect manufacturing and supply chains 
Many investors have felt that Starbucks  biggest threat in China is Luckin Coffee  NASDAQ LK   a homegrown chain specializing in pickup and delivery that now has more locations in China than Starbucks  barely two years after it opened its first store  There s no question that Luckin is seeing incredible growth  but the company is still losing gobs of money and only has stores in China  If the coronavirus situation gets much worse  it will be a significantly bigger problem for Luckin than for Starbucks  That gives Starbucks the advantage in such a scenario over the long term  as it can better absorb any costs that result from store closings  Luckin has yet to make a public statement on coronavirus  but Reuters said that Luckin plans to keep stores in Wuhan closed through the week long Lunar New Year holiday 
Why Starbucks is being punished
Starbucks may be just as threatened by coronavirus as hundreds of other companies  but as a restaurant chain it can t recoup sales lost from having stores closed  If a customer doesn t come in for a cup of coffee today  they won t come in and get two cups tomorrow  A business like Apple or Nike  on the other hand  could reasonably count on customers upgrading their phones or buying new pairs of sneakers next week  even if its store is closed this week 
Starbucks won t get back these lost sales  but the company is doing the right thing by protecting its brand  employees  and customers from a new and potentially dangerous outbreak  Its financial results may take a hit this year  but over the long term this will be little more than a blip for the coffee giant ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pozgg,2071809
93477,314992,SBUX,Starbucks  Strong Q1 Earnings and Coronavirus Concerns Boost Volatility,news,"Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  just reported blockbuster growth during its fiscal 2020 first quarter  a strong follow up to the accelerating results during 2019  Higher numbers were supported by a growing store base and higher comparable store sales  or comps  a combination of foot traffic and average guest ticket size  in China  as well as a big comps increase in the U S  that bucked the negative trend in the industry during the last quarter of calendar year 2019 
In spite of the positive report card  I m holding off on making any more purchases of Starbucks    for now  The stock already rallied over 15  from its lows registered over the autumn months  and complications from the Wuhan coronavirus in China caused management to remove its sales guidance for the time being  Until there is some clarity  shares could get volatile  which usually means buying opportunity 
Higher sales but with an asterisk
The good news is that global comps growth  led by comps increases in the two most important markets    the U S   up 5   and China  up 3      as well as positive traction in Starbucks  retail division distributed by Nestle  led to across the board advances 

Data source  Starbucks   
Also adding to the strong numbers was a 16  increase in store count in China  bringing the total to 4 292 at quarter end  or over 13  of the total 31 795 stores in operation   Some 600 more locations are in the works for the year ahead  Growth in China is great news  but the coronavirus outbreak in China has garnered a lot of headlines  and though it s highly unlikely to derail economic growth for any time period longer than the extreme short term  thousands of reported cases at this point barely even registers on the global scale   travel bans and other government measures to limit the spread of the illness could cause some minor business hiccups   
So far  Starbucks has closed more than 2 000 locations as it works with Chinese officials to help limit the spread of coronavirus  Granted  it s normal for stores in China to close down or reduce operating hours during this time of year because of the Chinese New Year celebration  Plus  management said it is looking at how to reroute traffic to those stores left open to account for the closures  However  it remains to be seen if more locations will be shuttered due to the virus  and for how long  
Management said it was going to raise its fiscal 2020 outlook  previously for global comps growth of 3  to 4  and revenue growth of 6  to 8    however  in light of the uncertainty surrounding coronavirus and how it will affect operations in China  any outlook on results is being removed for now  And if there s anything the stock market dislikes  it s uncertainty  In the days since the fourth quarter report  the stock has given up about 7  of its value in spite of the exceptionally good start to 2020  and more volatility could be in the cards if the disruption in China continues  

Artificially intelligent coffee to the rescue
Beyond what may  or may not  be a disruptive force for the next couple of weeks or months  there is plenty still going right for the coffee giant  Comps increases aren t just happening by accident  Starbucks is driving more traffic and higher sales at its stores via its digital strategy  specifically pertaining to its app and loyalty rewards program  In the U S   there were 18 9 million active members at quarter s end  a 16  increase over a year ago  and 10 2 million in China  a 40  increase   Seasonal drink specials and AI driven suggestions and notifications via the app are encouraging patrons to return more frequently   
AI is quickly becoming an even larger part of Starbucks in store as well  The AI enabled Mastrena 2 espresso maker made its way into 900 stores last year  and another 4 000 will be deployed in 2020  Besides churning out more coffees at more consistent quality  equipment with intelligent software built in will help Starbucks predict what customers want and when  Early work in this regard through the app and tailoring the revolving menu and happy hour deals has been a big reason for Starbucks  resurgence in comps  and the hope is more of the same can be generated by bringing that software into the stores themselves   
Thus  there s still plenty to like about Starbucks  and it remains one of the best consumer discretionary companies around in my book  With uncertainty making the immediate future hazy  I m holding off for the moment before scooping up any more shares  But if a pullback ensues  it will be time to buy again as the chain continues to lead the coffee and restaurant industries forward with best in class technology and consumer centric strategy ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp33b,2072163

increase in average ticket and 2  improvement in comparable transactions Starbucks opened 539 net new stores worldwide in the fiscal first quarter  bringing the total store count to 31 795  Global store growth came in at 6   based on a year over year comparison Overall Margin Improves in Q1On a non GAAP basis  operating margin expanded 80 basis points year over year to 18 2   The uptrend was primarily due to sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies  The increase was partially overshadowed by rise in wages and benefits  It was also negated to a lesser degree by rent inflation and investments in store labor hours  Per management  despite investing in partners  stores and digital capabilities  it has managed to deliver margin expansion Starbucks Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Segmental PerformanceNotably  in fourth quarter fiscal 2019  the company realigned its operating segments  Specifically  the China Asia Pacific segment and Europe  Middle East and

Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi operations   were previously included within Corporate and Other  It will now report within Americas and International segments based on the geographical location of operations Americas  Net revenues at this flagship segment increased 9  year over year to  5 010 9 million  driven by 550 store openings in a year s time and comps growth of 6  in the quarter under review Markedly  segmental growth was driven by robust performance of beverage   the company s highest margin category  Growth was also favored by an improved in store experience and digital initiatives  Starbucks  cold beverage platform grew across all dayparts led by cold coffee  refreshment and tea  The Nitro Cold Brew platform  which reached full penetration of its company operated stores by the end of the fiscal fourth quarter  continued to be well received  Beverage and food contributed five points and one point to comps growth  respectively  during the quarter under review

year over year to  1 571 1 million at this segment  After adjusting for the unfavorable impact of streamline related activities of 6   revenues grew 10  year over year in the quarter  The upside was mainly driven by 11  store growth and comps growth of 1  in the quarter under review Moreover  operating margin in the segment expanded 230 bps to 17 6  on the back of sales leverage  cost saving

engagement  primarily owing to growth of delivery  the Starbucks Rewards loyalty program and MOP Channel Development  Net revenues at this segment decreased 2  from the prior year quarter to  494 6

This colorful Malay saying captures the spirit of the animal spirits  Narrowly escaping an escalation of a trade war between the world s two largest economies  the outbreak of a deadly virus has spurred moves  especially the sell off in stocks and rally in bonds  for which many investors seemed ill prepared  Even though the virus contagion has not peaked  the recovery in US equities yesterday points to a break the fear and anxiety  Most Asia Pacific equity markets pared recent losses  though Hong Kong re opening for the first time  played some catch up  and the Hang Seng fell 2 8   European bourses are also stabilizing  and the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is up about 0 3  in late morning turnover  led by healthcare and materials 
US stocks are firm in Europe after the S P 500 held the support we identified near 3235  the  38 2   retracement of the leg up from the December 3 low  Bonds remain bid  The benchmark 10 year yields are mostly 2 4 bp lower today  which leaves the US yields hovering above 1 6   Of note  Italy s generic 10 year yield reached over 1 25  a couple weeks ago amid political worries  is now near 86 bp  the lowest since before Christmas  Meanwhile  the dollar remains firm against most major and emerging market currencies  The yen continues to outperform  suggesting that the risk off fears continue to linger despite the equity market stabilization 
The price of oil snapped a five day drop yesterday and is extending the recovery today  helped perhaps by the unexpectedly large drop API s estimate of US inventories   4 27 mln barrels  and talk of OPEC  extending curbs  Gold ended a four day advance yesterday  shedding almost 1   but has returned bid today 
Asia Pacific
The confirmed cases of the new coronavirus have surpassed China s official estimate of the SARS virus  Travel restrictions and output cuts continue to broaden  At first  it seems services were more vulnerable than production  but now it seems clearer than manufacturing will also be depressed  and supply chains remain vulnerable  It appears the disruption will last through at least next week and possibly the first week in February and extends to international companies operating in China  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   for example  has announced extended closures of more than half of its branches on the mainland  Japan s Toyota also shuttered local production  China is to report the January PMI tomorrow before markets reopen 
Australia reported slightly firmer than expected Q4 19 CPI  The net impact was to reinforce that the Reserve Bank of Australia will not cut rates when it meets on February 3  The derivative markets showed a nearly 85  chance of no change in policy at the end of last week  and the odds have moved close to 90   The year over year rate edged up to 1 8  from 1 7   Economists expected no change  It is the highest since Q4 18 when it also stood at 1 8   It rose 0 7  on the quarter  instead of the 0 5  expected  The underlying measures increased by 0 4  in Q4 19  The drought and fires pushed up food prices  Fruit prices  for example  for 6 8   Tradeable goods prices rose by 0 2   while non tradable goods rose 1  
The dollar reached a three day high a little above JPY109 25 before selling pressure re emerged  The dollar s recent low was on Monday near JPY108 75  There are two option expires of note today  There is one for about  610 at JPY109 00 and one for  465 at JPY109 25  Although the daily technical readings favor additional dollar losses   the intraday technical readings warn that higher levels may be seen first  The Australian dollar bounced from a three month low near  0 6735 yesterday to a little more than  0 6775 today before running out of steam  The reversal lower  though  is stretching the intraday technical readings  Recall that the dollar closed near CNY6 9425 last Thursday as the mainland markets shut  The offshore yuan has edged higher for the past two sessions  leaving the dollar near CNH6 9610  vs  CNH6 9320 last Thursday  
Europe
EMU s money supply growth and lending figures for December disappointed  M3 year over year growth slowed for the second consecutive month  and the 5  pace was the slowest since June  Loans to non financial businesses slowed to 3 2  from 3 4   The month y extension of new loans slowed to a trickle of 0 7 bln  as trade and the manufacturing slump took a toll  On the other hand  lending to households accelerated to 3 7   from 3 5   is the strongest in 11 years  There is little doubt that the ECB is on hold  However  the money supply and lending figures suggest that the transmission of monetary policy may be stalling 
Attention turns to tomorrow s Bank of England meeting  It remains a close call  The economic consequences of the new coronavirus may encourage a cut  but on balance  the sentiment leans against a move  The derivatives market suggest about a 55  chance that the BOE stands pat  This means that a significant number of participants will be surprised no matter the outcome tomorrow  It is also Carney s last meeting as Governor  The next MPC meeting is not until March 26 
The euro has already traded on both sides of yesterday s range  It traded up to almost  1 1030 and down to  1 0995  The intraday technicals are stretched  but the market may want to test last November s lows in the  1 0980  1 0990 area  There is a 1 2 bln euro option at  1 0985 that expires tomorrow  On an outside day  the close is particularly important from a technical perspective  Sterling is hovering just above  1 30  having been down to  1 2975 yesterday  There is an option for roughly GBP310 at  1 2965 that will be cut today and another option for GBP220 at  1 30 that expires too  The intraday technicals warn that sterling s low may not be in place yet today 
America
The US reports December goods trade  retail inventories  and pending home sales  But the key event is the FOMC meeting followed by Chairman Powell s  press conference  We do not expect significant changes in the central bank s economic assessment  It is no hurry to change its stance  which 14 of 17 Fed officials last month thought could persist for the entire year  The press is likely interested in how the Fed thinks about the risks the virus poses  but the focus may be on the Fed s balance sheet and its plans to reduce T bill buying in Q2  There may be some technical adjustment to the interest paid on reserves  yes  required reserves and excess reserves   With the effective Fed funds rate near the lower end of the band  a small increase in the interest paid on reserves is thought to help ensure that the funds  rates remain in the target range  The December 2020 fed funds futures contract implies a yield of 1 25   The current effective average is about 1 55   This implies 30 bp of easing is anticipated  i e   one cut and about a 20  chance of a second one 
Canada and Mexico s economic calendars are light today  Canada reports November s monthly GDP figures tomorrow  A flat performance is expected after a 0 1  contraction in October  Disappointment will likely weigh on the Canadian dollar  Mexico will report Q4 GDP figures tomorrow  After contracting for three consecutive quarters  growth was flat in Q3  However  it is expected to have contracted by 0 2  in Q4 19  It would be the third successive quarter that the year over year pace has been negative  Mexico s central bank meets on February 13 and is expected to ease policy again 
The US dollar reversed lower after poking above CAD1 32 for the first time since mid December  It found support near CAD1 3155 and has not seen follow through selling today  While the greenback is poised to test yesterday s highs  the intraday technicals suggest the upside will be limited  The US dollar neared MXN19 00 on Monday and fell back to MXN18 71 yesterday  The appetite for risk has not returned  and the dollar is firm against the peso  trading near MXN18 75 in Europe  There is scope to test the MXN18 80 MXN18 85 area ",2020-01-29,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/recovery-in-equities-points-to-break-in-anxiety-200502513,200502513

93505,315020,SBUX,3 Ways Starbucks Just Crushed Its Latest Earnings Report,news,"Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  traded down modestly in pre market trading on Wednesday morning  despite a strong earnings report Tuesday afternoon 
Investors weren t disappointed with the quarter s results but were rather acting on fears about the coronavirus in China  The recent outbreak has forced the coffee chain to temporarily close more than half of its stores in its fastest growing market  causing what the company said would be a material impact to its results for the current quarter on the full year  
While news about the coronavirus may grab headlines this time around  Starbucks  results nonetheless deserve a closer look as the quarter overall was one of the best the company has posted in recent years  

1  Customer traffic is back
One of the market s biggest concerns about Starbucks recently has been a lack of growth in customer traffic  Though the company has lifted comparable sales by raising prices  growing customer traffic is a much better way to drive sustainable growth  and Starbucks delivered on that metric 
Globally  comparable sales jumped 5  on a 2  increase in customer transactions  a proxy for traffic  and in the U S   where traffic growth has lagged  comparable transactions rose 3   driving comp sales up 6   its fastest growth in that market in several quarters  In China  Starbucks  other key market  comparable sales rose 3  on a 1  increase in comparable transactions 
Expanded delivery seems to be helping lift comparable sales  as Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said 75  of Starbucks locations in the U S  now offer delivery  and that in China  delivery had risen to 9  of sales  In addition  data from Edison Trends shows that spending on Starbucks delivery in the U S  tripled in the quarter  a promising sign  as delivery orders tend to have higher average transaction values than in store orders 
2  Margin is expanding
Overall revenue rose 7  to  7 1 billion  which was affected modestly by the sale of assets in its channel development segment  But the bottom line performance was the star of the quarter  as adjusted earnings per share increased 16   factoring a tax benefit in the quarter a year ago  to  0 79  beating estimates at  0 76  
That profit growth was driven by an increase in adjusted operating margin from 17 4  to 18 2  because of sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies  Operating margin rose in all three of its operating segments    Americas  international  and channel development    and in its stores  improving margin was a direct effect of rising comparable sales and bringing in more customers  That growth can be attributed to delivery and digital orders as well as seasonal menu items such as Irish Cream Cold Brew and Pumpkin Cream ColdBbrew 
Starbucks management has found a number of levers to pull and is adjusting its menu to changing customer tastes by adding items such as more alternative milks  and it has plans to introduce a breakfast sandwich with a plant based patty later this year 
3  Guidance would have been raised  if not for coronavirus
The impact of coronoavirus remains to be seen  as it s been only weeks since the disease was first reported  However  investors should be encouraged that Starbucks would have lifted its guidance in operating margin and earnings per share had it not been for the outbreak  While the severity of the coronavirus  impact isn t known  the company is making progress that will hit the bottom line eventually once its Chinese stores are fully open and operating and the virus scare passes  so the recent improvements will pay off for long term investors 
Outside China  Starbucks is seeing strong momentum in the U S  with digital  delivery  and new menu items  and its new partnership with Nestle  the Global Coffee Alliance  is also paying off    that partnership is now operating in 40 markets  with five new ones added in the first quarter 
While the coronavirus is a temporary challenge for Starbucks and the restaurant stocks with exposure to China  it s worth remembering that only 10  of its revenue comes from China and that the company is much better positioned than local rivals such as Luckin Coffee  which aren t profitable and have 100  exposure to China  if the outbreak turns out to last longer and be deadlier than expected  
Though Starbucks isn t getting credit from the market right now because of fears about coronavirus  investors should still feel confident in the stock  since the company just turned in all around excellent quarter ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pocq1,2070348

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 95   A quarter ago  it was expected that this coffee chain would post earnings of  0 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 70  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Starbucks shares have added about 0 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 4  
What s Next for Starbucks 
While Starbucks has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Starbucks was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Comps  or sales at company operated stores open 13 months or longer  rose 5  year over year on a global basis  in line with growth seen in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  Global comps growth was driven by a 6  increase in the U S  and 3  growth in China  Going into the year  management had guided for global comps to rise from 3  to 4  during fiscal 2020

Furthermore  the company said that while it expects the negative impact from the virus to be temporary  it is forecasting for both its international segment and consolidated results to be materially affected in fiscal Q2 and the full fiscal year

I will now turn the call over to Kevin  Kevin Kevin Johnson    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon and welcome  Q1 was an exceptional quarter for Starbucks  The positive business momentum we ve created over the past fiscal year continues with a strong start to fiscal 2020  These results were fueled by a healthy balance of comparable sales growth and new store development  as well as continued expansion of our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle  I m especially pleased that we delivered meaningful margin expansion in the quarter  even as we continued to invest in the key areas to support sustainable growth  first and foremost in our partners as well as in beverage innovation and digital customer relationships  Given the strength of our Q1 results  we had intended to raise certain aspects of our full year financial outlook for fiscal 2020  However  due to the dynamic situation unfolding with the corona virus  we are not providing guidance at this time  And as we get more clarity on the situation  we will transparently communicate with investors Our immediate focus is on two key priorities in China  First  hearing for the health and well being of our partners and customers in our stores  Second  playing a constructive role in supporting local health officials and government leaders as they work to contain the corona virus  That said  we remain optimistic and committed to the long term growth potential in China  a market we have been in for more than 20 years Before I hand over to Pat who will provide more detail on our Q1 financial performance  let me share some highlights for the quarter  which provide powerful evidence of the unique strength of our brand  I will also outline additional steps we are taking that continue to elevate Starbucks in ways that will inspire our partners and deepen our relationship with customers In the first quarter Starbucks delivered global revenue growth of 9   excluding the 2  impact of streamline activities  This was led by strong comp sales growth of 5  and net new store growth of 6  over the last 12 months  At the forefront of these results were our two lead growth markets  the US and China along with Channel Development The US grew revenues by an impressive 9  in Q1 led by comp sales growth of 6   including comp transaction growth of 3  for a third consecutive quarter  With the two year sales comp of 10  for the past two consecutive quarters  it is clear that our focus on the customer experience  beverage innovation and digital customer relationships is working  At the center of this are our Starbucks partners and the investments we continue to make in them  It is no coincidence that following last September s Leadership Experience where we hosted 12 000 Starbucks field leaders and outlined a series of partner focused initiatives and investments  our partners delivered one of the most successful US holiday seasons in the history of the Company Our partners in China also delivered a solid quarter with revenues increasing by 15  in Q1  excluding a 2  impact of foreign exchange  fueled by a 16  increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and a 3  increase in comp  And for the fourth consecutive quarter  we grew total transactions at a double digit percentage pace in this strategically important market  On every market visit I make to China I experience firsthand the passion  innovation and commitment our partners demonstrate each and every day and I m proud of them  Given the purposeful and highly differentiated partner investments  it is no surprise Starbucks was recently named China s best employer by Aon Hewitt for the fifth consecutive year Finally  on the strength of our channel partnerships with Nestle and Pepsi  our Channel Development revenue grew 5  in Q1 when normalized for the 7  impact of the Tazo and Global Coffee Alliance transitions  boosting our share of the coffee market outside of specialty retail  This is another example of the strength of the Starbucks brand that continues to expand globally  reaching more customers through more channels  Collectively  these results demonstrate that we are on the right track with our Growth at Scale agenda  I m especially grateful to all Starbucks partners around the world who celebrate coffee and human connection and whose passion and commitment to the Starbucks mission and our Company values are creating long term sustainable value for all stakeholders As we approach the 50th anniversary of Starbucks in 2021  I am optimistic about the future  Why  Well  when I step back and look at the quarter  I see multiple proof points of the unique strength of our brand  strength that is derived from targeted investments that bolster our competitive position in a high growth category  enabling us to unlock the full potential of one of the world s most admired and trusted brands  In the US  customer connection scores reached another all time high in Q1 as our dedicated store partners continued to elevate the Starbucks experience and deliver the very best moments with our customers each and every day  We realize this is a key differentiator for Starbucks and we continue to make investments in partner hours  benefits and training  There is no doubt that our partners and the investments we make in them are at the core of creating the unique Starbucks experience that fueled our Q1 performance Additionally  our brand equity research in the first quarter confirmed that Starbucks continues to lead consumer perceptions of specialty coffee retail concepts in the US  well ahead of other brands including so called third wave  independent and local coffee concepts  This is aided in part by our proprietary beverage innovation and our unique ability to personalize handcrafted beverages at scale  We strengthened this competitive advantage in Q1 by extending our Cold Brew platform and cold foam options with two new seasonal beverages  Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew and Irish Cream Cold Brew  which together contributed to our traffic growth for the quarter  Notably for five consecutive quarters  our comp growth has outperformed the external indexes and benchmarks we track in the restaurant and QSR space Our brand strength was also evident on the digital front in Q1  In the US  we added a record 1 4 million customers to our 90 day active Starbucks Rewards member base  ending the quarter with 18 9 million active members  a 16  increase over prior year  This is important because we know from experience that when customers join our rewards program  their total spend with Starbucks increases meaningfully  We also know that Starbucks is increasingly valued for convenience as the mix of Mobile Order   Pay transactions in the US grew to 17  in Q1 and our industry leading digital platform will further differentiate us from the competition over time Our digital progress in China was equally compelling and is resonating with the digitally savvy Chinese consumer  Proprietary research in Q1 showed that Starbucks remains the country s most beloved coffee brand and customers  first choice for away from home coffee  In the first quarter sales from China s mobile orders jumped to 15  of total revenue  up from 10  in the past quarter with 9  coming from delivery and 6  from mobile order and pickup  Underpinning these results was the continued growth of China s 90 day active Starbucks Rewards members  reaching 10 2 million customers in Q1  That s 40  growth over the prior year when the program was relaunched  Our first quarter digital strength in China was further evidenced by record sales on Alibaba s Singles Day shopping festival  the number one card position on Tmall and the leading brand on WeChat social gifting platform Over our 20 years in China  we have established unparalleled brand stature by delivering a unique premium experience to our customers  Outside of specialty coffee retail  the power of our brand was demonstrated by the continued expansion of our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle now in more than 40 markets  including the additional five new markets we entered in Q1 with product sales significantly ahead of expectations Every customer interaction in our stores establishes customer affinity and brand loyalty with the Global Coffee Alliance then acting as a brand amplifier  bringing Starbucks Coffee to new channels and new markets Our Starbucks Reserve Roasteries are also important brand amplifiers  In November  we opened our Roastery in Chicago  our sixth Roastery globally  to a phenomenal customer reception  Since the opening the store continues to gain international attention  attracting an average of 10 000 visitors a day with a peak of more than 21 000 visitors in a single day  I want to thank our Starbucks partners who work in the Chicago Roastery as well as the City of Chicago for the warm welcome and spectacular response to the opening of the world s largest Starbucks These proof points provide clear evidence that the Starbucks brand is not only strong but it s getting stronger through the focus and discipline of our Growth at Scale agenda  In fact just last week Starbucks was named one of Fortune s Most Admired Companies for the 18th consecutive year In summary  I could not be more pleased with our Q1 results and how they reinforce the unique strength of Starbucks  But make no mistake  we do not take this for granted  We will continue to take clear and decisive steps to build our brand for the future  focusing on our competitive advantages  investing in our partners as they create those unique Starbucks experiences for our customers  driving beverage innovation and enhancing digital relationships  And while we do this  we are further amplifying our brand through the Global Coffee Alliance and committing to an even higher level of social responsibility with bolder aspirations for environmental sustainability As many of you have seen  last week we disclosed an ambitious  multi decade aspiration for Starbucks to become a resource positive company  which means we as a company want to give more than we take from the planet  We thought long and hard about this aspiration and are being deliberate in our approach  Over the past year  we conducted a rigorous environmental sustainability study in partnership with third party advocacy groups  We embraced science based targets and utilized industry experts to audit every aspect related to Starbucks  impact on climate  water and waste  We have shared the sustainability baseline report and our aspirations transparently on our website  knowing that this will not be easy  The journey will not be linear  It will require innovation  many industry partnerships  alignment with other like minded companies  public policy support and engagement of Starbucks  partners and customers  This will challenge us in new and different ways and will require transformational change and measured risk taking We start this journey understanding our footprint  building upon our decade of experience and sustainability and committing to lead on something that is important to all of humanity  taking care of our planet and we invite others to join us  As announced last week  we will be transparent in reporting short and long term progress against our goals and we will start with preliminary targets for 2030 that will be the focus of our research and operational plans going forward  Then on Starbucks  50th anniversary in 2021 we will formalize our 2030 environmental goals and our strategies based on what we have learned between now and then  As we embark on this journey  we will prioritize  sequence and balance our investments as we do across every aspect of our business  We remain committed to our ongoing double digit EPS growth model  We have momentum  our brand is strong and we will continue to responsibly grow our business by staying true to our mission and values  doing the right things to care for and inspire our partners  creating great Starbucks experiences for our customers and pursuing a bold aspiration for the planet In closing  I would again like to thank my fellow Starbucks partners around the world  I have the privilege of sharing all your good work on these calls and it is an honor to serve you and all of our stakeholders  I would also like to reiterate our support for the ongoing work as we respond to the corona virus in a thoughtful and responsible way to protect our partners and support health officials and the government as they work to contain this public health risk  Starbucks has made a donation to the Red Cross to help support these efforts  We are making decisions real time to ensure the health and well being of our partners  and I am proud of how Starbucks China is navigating a very dynamic situation Now  I ll turn it over to Pat for a deeper dive into our Q1 financial results and an update on our fiscal year  20 outlook  Pat Patrick Grismer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Kevin and good afternoon everyone  I am pleased to report non GAAP EPS of  0 79 for our first quarter of fiscal  20  exceeding our expectations and reflecting meaningful margin expansion in each of our operating segments  This represents a 16  increase year over year when excluding an 8  headwind related to a lower income tax rate in fiscal  19  These results underscore the strength of our brand globally and the outstanding underlying momentum across our business as we continue to execute our Growth at Scale agenda I will first take you through our Q1 fiscal  20 operating performance by segment  followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance  I will then share some perspective on our outlook for the full fiscal year Our Americas segment delivered revenue growth of 9  in Q1  primarily driven by 6  comp sales growth and net new store growth of 3  over the past 12 months  Our US business delivered an impressive 6  comp sales growth in Q1  driven equally by transactions and ticket  These results were driven by an improved partner led in store experience  a strong beverage lineup and increased digital customer engagement Beverage led our comp growth for a sixth consecutive quarter  driving approximately 5 points of comp sales growth with strength across all beverage categories with food contributing the remaining point  Our cold platform continues to resonate with customers during all seasons and was our primary growth engine for the quarter led by cold coffee  Importantly  the growth in cold beverages in Q1 occurred in all dayparts and all regions  reflecting broad appeal across our customer base Following the success of our fall seasonal offerings at the start of the quarter and building on the success of last year s season  our holiday platforms delivered strong performance that exceeded our expectations  Returning favorites such as Peppermint Mocha and new innovations like Irish Cream Cold Brew created momentum throughout the holiday period  And as Kevin mentioned  our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program continued to gain momentum building on the launch of multitier redemption last April Our reimagined Happy Hour resonated well with customers  driving additional member growth and gift card activations delivered their strongest year over year dollar growth in four years  Ticket growth of 3  for the quarter was led by pricing  beverage attach and food  We saw transaction growth in both the morning and afternoon dayparts for a third consecutive quarter and our highest quarterly peak transaction growth in three years  These improvements would not have been possible without the dedication of our green apron partners who continue to accommodate higher volumes while elevating the customer experience  And finally Americas non GAAP operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 22  in Q1  driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies  partially offset by growth in wages and benefits and to a lesser degree investments in labor hours and inflation in occupancy costs Moving on to international  The segment delivered revenue growth of 10  in Q1  excluding a 6  unfavorable impact of streamline related activities  This was led by a 11  net new store growth over the past 12 months  International s comp sales growth of 1  in Q1 was adversely impacted by 2 points due to a soft quarter in Japan which was lapping 6  comp sales growth from last year  China  our lead international growth market delivered solid comp sales growth of 3  in Q1  including 1  comp transaction growth  Continued expansion and strong performance of mobile ordering as well as the up level Starbucks Rewards program were primary drivers of these results At the end of the first quarter  Mobile order and pickup had been rolled out to more than 100 cities encompassing more than 90  of our store base just seven months following the launch of the program  And we expanded delivery to 130 cities covering more than 80  of our portfolio  International s non GAAP operating margin increased by 170 basis points to 21 4   When excluding the 70 basis point impact of Streamline related activities  non GAAP operating margin expanded by 100 basis points  driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies  partially offset by unfavorability in product mix and strategic investments  notably in store and digital initiatives On to Channel Development  Revenue declined 2  in Q1 as we lapped two items that benefited fiscal  19  the sale of Tazo branded products to Unilever and transition activities related to the Global Coffee Alliance  When excluding the 7  adverse impact of these items as well as Global Coffee Alliance transition activities in fiscal  20  revenue increased by 5  in Q1  led by strong underlying growth in the Global Coffee Alliance  The segment s non GAAP operating margin improved by 70 basis points over the prior year  Normalizing for the 20 basis point impact of the transition activities I just mentioned  Channel Development s operating margin expanded 90 basis points in Q1  driven by favorable distribution efficiencies and business mix Finally  at the consolidated level non GAAP operating margin of 18 2  in Q1 increased by 80 basis points year over year primarily driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies  The favorability from these items was partially offset by growth in wages and benefits and to a lesser degree by rent inflation and investments in store labor hours  I am particularly pleased that we delivered meaningful margin expansion  while also continuing to invest in our partners  our stores and our digital capabilities to keep the Starbucks brand strong and relevant  To a great extent this reflects our ability to drive improvements in margin from sales leverage  as well as supply chain and G A efficiencies and to reinvest a meaningful portion of that upside in our key brand differentiators which strengthen our competitive position and fuel long term sustainable growth Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2020  Given the strength of our first quarter results  we had intended to raise certain aspects of our guidance for the full fiscal year  However  as Kevin mentioned  given the extraordinary circumstances that are rapidly developing in China  we are simply reaffirming our original guidance and will provide an update when we have better visibility to the impact of corona virus  The magnitude of the impact will depend on the duration of store closures as we work with local authorities to manage the situation and protect our partners and customers  At present  we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact to the business  Notwithstanding the fact that our China business represented only 10  of our global revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2020  we expect these events to have a material impact on our International segment and consolidated results for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2020  In any event  based on what we currently know  we expect the impact to our business will be temporary  Our brand is very strong in China and our confidence in the profitability and growth potential of this business is undiminished To summarize  we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and view these results as further validation of our strategy to grow Starbucks at Scale with greater focus and discipline  We appreciate the hard work of our Starbucks partners who deliver these results in a manner that remains true to our Company s mission and values  which is the core of our business And with that  Kevin and I are happy to take your questions  joined by Roz Brewer and John Culver as Durga outlined at the top of our call  Thank you  Operator Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley  Please proceed with your question John Glass    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks very much  Could you maybe just help us understand or dimensionalize the impact of China a little bit more  First  just when the stores were closed those stores that aren t closed  maybe magnitude of what you think the sales declines are currently  And do you continue to pay employees  I assume you do  but just clarify that And then finally is delivery an offset  Is there a delivery business that can offset some of the closures or has that also been curtailed by this outbreak Kevin Johnson    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  John  We will have John Culver kind of give you a little bit of color on the day to day in China and then Pat will follow up on the second part of your question related to the implications  John John Culver    Group President  International  Channel Development and Global Coffee   TeaYeah  John  obviously Kevin reiterated the fact that we re focused on making sure we re taking care of our partners  their health and well being  as well as the customers  In terms of the closures  what we ve seen is that over the last few weeks  I would say  that as the situation has accelerated we ve taken action to close stores  both working with the local government and the direction that they ve given us but then also proactively closing stores in the country As we shared we currently have over half our stores closed in the market  We are assessing this each and every day  We do have delivery available to customers from stores that are remaining open  but again this is something that we continue to assess every day  And let me just reiterate  this is a very complex situation and I m working very closely with Belinda and the team in China to navigate this changing environment  And you know as a company we ve navigated complex situations before  And in China  we feel there is no other company that s better positioned to navigate this given our relationship that we    and trust we ve been able to build with our partners and the relationship and trust that they ve been able to build with their customers We will remain transparent as the events continue to unfold  but we do have complete confidence in the decisions that we re making and we will continue to provide complete support for our partners and for the people of China as they navigate this situation  We ve been in the market for 20 years and we have built a admired and trusted brand and we will continue to play the long game in China as we navigate in the coming weeks and months Patrick Grismer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd John  this is Pat  Just to build on what John has said  it really is difficult to say at this juncture what the impact to our business will be and how it will show up in our financials given the fluidity of the situation  The business impact is largely a function of two things  the number of stores closed and the duration of closure  And with respect to the duration of closure  it s not entirely in our control  I would say to a lesser extent  the financial impact is a function of how we manage wage costs during the period of closure So we re simply not able to provide a reasonable estimate at this point in time  We will need to move beyond the extended Chinese New Year holiday season to assess how the situation may be stabilizing and what the implications are for store closures  We re probably looking at early March at the earliest to reasonably assess the implications for revenue  operating income and EPS for our second quarter and for the full year  At the very latest  we will provide an update in conjunction with our Q2 earnings release on April 28th Our commitment is to maintain transparency with investors and as and when we have a reasonable basis for estimating the financial impacts for the quarter and year  we will communicate that information  But importantly  we do expect the impacts to be temporary  Our long term double digit growth model is fully intact and of course we will gain the benefit of lapping these temporary impacts next year OperatorYour next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird  Please proceed with your question David Tarantino    Robert W  Baird    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  And Pat  maybe just following up on some of the questions around the guidance  Would you be willing to share where your guidance would be without this China issue so that we can understand where the baseline of the underlying business is  especially if you want to assume that it s temporary Patrick Grismer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I m not going to provide details as to the magnitude of the guidance raise that we had planned or the specific line items  but I m happy to share that we would have raised guidance for operating margin and for EPS on the strength of our Q1 results and visibility to some balance of year benefits  But given the uncertainty of the corona virus situation in China and its impact to our near term results  which we expect to be temporary  we felt it was best to defer any change to our guidance until we had better visibility to full year results  including the impact of corona virus And as I said before  we re committed to being responsibly transparent with our investors and we ll provide an update when we have reasonable confidence behind our numbers because it would not be helpful to speculate at this time  But we could not be more pleased with our Q1 results across the board  the overall underlying momentum in our business and the confidence that that gives us behind our ability to deliver better than expected results setting aside this new issue that has emerged in China OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair  Please proceed with your question Sharon Zackfia    William Blair    AnalystHi  good afternoon  I m not going to ask a China question  I actually wanted to talk about the Americas and the decline in G A dollars  Year over year  I know it was modest  But if you could kind of talk about that whether that was just timing  And then on Channel Development  I think you had expected revenue to go down somewhere between 7  and 9  this year  It was obviously a lot less in the first quarter in terms of the degree of decline  Is there something that s changed there  Is it a timing dynamic more weighted to the back half of the declines  any commentary would be helpful Patrick Grismer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSharon  this is Pat  I m happy to take both questions  First of all  with respect to the G A  we are very pleased with the progress that we are making across the Company in delivering our G A efficiency commitment  As a reminder  we had committed to reduce by 100 basis points G A as a percentage of system sales  That is not something that we routinely report because we don t report system sales  but a good proxy for that is non GAAP G A as a percentage of revenue and we do report that  We ve added that to our supplementary schedules in our earnings release  And we have seen meaningful efficiencies emerge in the first quarter and we expect that to continue balance of the year  That s on the back of very significant work over the last 12 to 18 months to realize productivity in our G A  not just in the Americas  but really across all of our segments and certainly at corporate And then with respect to the Global Coffee Alliance  we did see better than expected results in the first quarter  We did anticipate a decline for the first quarter and for the full year  but our better than expected results in the first quarter resulted from outperformance  specifically in the Global Coffee Alliance  So we could not be more pleased with how our products are performing as we continue to partner with Nestle and we anticipate that was going to be one of the aspects of our improved guidance for the year is better than expected revenue growth from our Channel Development segment Kevin Johnson    President and Chief Executive OfficerJohn  you might want to comment on the new markets and   John Culver    Group President  International  Channel Development and Global Coffee   TeaYeah  And so  Sharon  we couldn t be more pleased with the performance of the Channel Development business and in particular the Global Coffee Alliance  Through the quarter  we saw acceleration into 40 markets around the world where we have our products available through grocery  as well as Foodservice  We also are on path by the end of this quarter that we re in to be in over 50 markets Our product sales continue to be significantly ahead of expectations  both in terms of package coffee  Nespresso capsules  as well as Dolce Gusto  When you look at our core business here in the US  the Starbucks brand outgrew the total category for coffee  Roast and Ground share grew 80 basis points  K Cup share grew 40 basis points and we ve got some exciting new items that are coming up  Later this spring  we previously announced that we re launching premium soluble coffee which will    we re excited about and the big opportunity internationally with that And then the launch that we had with our creamers of four flavors  we re now expanding to an additional two new flavors  given the recent success  So the Global Coffee Alliance itself is performing very well around the world and it s helping us continue to grow the Starbucks brand  and amplify the brand as Kevin highlighted in his comments earlier OperatorYour next question comes from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan  Please proceed with your question John Ivankoe    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  thank you  I was hoping to get an update on Deep Brew  especially as we come into April  and I think lap some changes around the change in the AI machine that delivered some customized loyalty to customers as well as the change in the My Starbucks Rewards program  Maybe as a slightly related question  how much  I guess  confidence do you have as we do get to some of the strength that we saw in fiscal  19 that we can lap some of those significant changes in the consumer offerings Kevin Johnson    President and Chief Executive OfficerJohn  I ll let    I ll have Roz give you a little perspective on Deep Brew and how it s influencing our performance Rosalind  Roz  Brewer    Chief Operating Officer and Group PresidentThanks  John for the question  So first of all  I wanted to ground everybody on what s happening in some of our equipment innovation  And one of the strongest pieces of innovation that we re seeing is combining our Mastrena 2 machine  which is our espresso machine  which we installed about 900 units last year  We ve got 4 000 of those coming this year and those machines are AI enabled  And so that is where we ll see the most significant deliverable around how we will integrate AI into understanding how to deliver the best coffee experience and also reducing the amount of time it takes to deliver and then giving us a chance to provide a variety of coffee to our customers  So you ll see that come through There is also other innovation happening around Deep Brew  It will show up in various aspects of the business  but the equipment position is our strongest position right now  In addition to that  when we talk about the things that have happened in our loyalty program  we did see some significant improvement in this quarter  Right now we finished this quarter at about  18 9 million growth and that s a 16  improvement versus last year in our active Starbucks Rewards members  It s the strongest growth rate we ve seen in three years  So the work that we ve done in our multi tier redemption is also allowing us to grow our member base  We ve got an increase of annual member growth of 2 7 million members And we re also seeing all time records in that area as well  It s enabling us to do really creative work with how we reimagine our Happy Hour performance  making sure that we are understanding what the customer needs  There is a lot of customer insights that come out of the work that we do as we grow our member base  We re also seeing that our loyalty programs and the new membership behavior that we re seeing  which contributed 2 points of the 6  comp for the quarter  So we are learning from what s happening as we align AI to our equipment and then the work that comes out of our loyalty program and getting us closer to customers  expectations and it s making a difference OperatorYour next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays  Please proceed with your question Jeffrey Bernstein    Barclays Capital    AnalystGreat  Thanks very much  Just a broader question on China learnings  putting aside the corona virus  Clearly there is lots of competition in the market  I think  oftentimes coming in on the lower end in terms of experience and perhaps customer affluence  So I m just wondering what learnings would you say you ve taken from this competition to better your positioning  It seems like you had a slowdown a year ago  and now it seems like trends are moving in the upward direction again  I m just wondering if you could provide some clarity in terms of which two or three initiatives  would you say maybe you took some learnings from some of that competition to better yourself in the market  Thank you Kevin Johnson    President and Chief Executive OfficerJohn  why don t you take that John Culver    Group President  International  Channel Development and Global Coffee   TeaWell  Jeffrey  I think that a couple of things around what we re doing in China  First and foremost  focusing on the premium quality of the coffee and our ability to handcraft the beverages for customers to the way they want it  We feel that there is no other competitor in China that is able to do it and replicate it at the level that we are as signified by more than 7 million customers we serve a week across the 4 300 stores In addition  you then have the opportunity of developing these relationships between our partners and our customers  And our partners are truly the differentiating factor in terms of bringing the Starbucks Experience to life for our customers  And when you go to China and you experience our people and their passion for coffee in their passion for service to customers  That is a true differentiator that we have in the market You then put all that together in the third place  and the beauty of our stores  the inviting environment  the way in which we show up in the third place  we have an environment that customers come to and want to be with their family and friends Now what we ve done is we ve also enhanced that with the digital experience  And we had a great quarter as it relates to digital  We now have 90 day actives grew 40  year over year to 10 2 million  That s nearly double from where it was a year ago  We ve also gone through and built out Mobile Order   Pay capabilities as well as delivery  so mobile orders in total reached more than 15  of sales mix in the quarter compared to 10  in Q4  So 9  being delivery  6  being mobile order and pay  and we re continuing to build out these digital relationships with customers  Then you couple all that with the Global Coffee Alliance in our RTD business in China  there is no other company brand in China that has the distribution points that we have  We have over 100 000 points of distribution of the Starbucks brand in China and our partners are bringing it to life every day and it s their passion and their commitment that is making us successful and will continue to make us successful Kevin Johnson    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  let me just add to John s comments and share perspective  Jeffrey  I think look over throughout history we ve had many  many competitors enter the market  Look coffee is a large and growing addressable market  And we stay focused on the premium experience and the unique differentiators that we believe create Starbucks  And if you look throughout history there is a consistent pattern  In most all cases our competitors shift to focusing more on the value play and you see that time and time again  And I think we continue to see that trend  So the lesson for us is continue to amplify those unique differentiators that make us Starbucks and that s why  as you think about the growth at Scale  we really  as John said  amplify the customer experience we create in the store  we amplify the quality of our coffee and the beverage innovation that we provide  the fact those beverages are handcrafted and personalized for each and every customer  And now we extended that in store experience to a digital customer relationship  And those mix of ingredients are what differentiates us and we feel confident that we understand them  we don t compromise those and we stay focused on playing our game  It s worked in the past  it s working today and it will work in the future OperatorYour next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities  Please proceed with your question Matthew DiFrisco    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystThank you  I just had a couple of follow ups  With respect to China  thank you for sharing that about the 10  of global revenue  Is it correct and I guess also to assume in your past analyst days you have obviously shown how strong of a market and the opportunity on the returns there  That also would then by default have a higher contribution to the income I suspect  And then if you could comment also  is this    the travel restrictions  are they having any sort of impact also on the ability to meet those growth targets  I know you have 600 stores planned for that country  Is that something also that s sort of been halted during this time frame as well Patrick Grismer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Matthew  this is Pat  With respect to the first question  China s operating income as a percentage of business unit operating income globally is slightly higher than the 10  that it represents of revenue  And over to John for the second piece John Culver    Group President  International  Channel Development and Global Coffee   TeaYeah  Matthew  on the store side of it  I think it s too early to tell  We re committed to the numbers that we previously communicated around store growth in China  and we ll continue to build beautiful stores and accelerate the growth of the brand  Suffice it to say  new stores contribute 80  of our revenue growth in the market and it s an important component and one that we will continue to focus on with the team there OperatorYour next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS  Please proceed with your question Dennis Geiger    UBS Securities    AnalystThank you  I just wanted to ask a bit more about the continued strength of US traffic  Maybe Roz  could you talk a bit more about where that s coming from  How much of it is higher frequency from existing customers versus maybe some new customers  And any other observations or insights that you can share  And then I think you ve touched on the drivers  but if there s anything you can get into more on how much of it is experience versus digital versus the beverage innovation that you feel is driving that traffic piece  if you can dive into that anymore  Thank you Rosalind  Roz  Brewer    Chief Operating Officer and Group PresidentSure  Thank you  Dennis  So a couple of things  So you heard Kevin    in Kevin s remarks that we achieved a 6  comp in this quarter  5 points of those 6 points came from beverage growth  So beverage innovation is a large part of the work that we re doing that also is impacted by the work we re doing and in store innovation also and the efficiency that we re building there and then the digital relationships If I could go a little bit further into the efficiencies that we re seeing in the store  we are actually doing a large amount of work around creating and improving productivity in the stores  And in many cases  this is not productivity driving activity by taking hours out and really reducing our cost position in the stores  it s actually to allow our partners to spend more time with our customers  So we re seeing record scores at this time of customer connection scores in our stores  These are record numbers  We believe it s a multitude of things  dealing with reducing the amount of task  the menial task that our store managers and our  Indecipherable  have to do in our stores  In addition to the equipment improvements that we re seeing  we have Nitro Cold Brew across all of our stores right now  When we put in a Mastrena 2 machine we re seeing operational efficiencies  It s a lower profile machine  it allows our partners to see over the bar and interact with the customers  We re actually seeing a significant amount of work coming out of the work we have learned through our digital relationships  So we know more about who is coming in the morning Kevin s remarks also revealed that we are growing in every daypart  We re also seeing a significant growth pattern in our cold coffee  And so  that includes all cold beverages  meaning tea as well  and we re seeing cold beverages grow in the morning and the afternoon occasion  We re seeing also to the work  if you recall  when we began to grow and change our program in loyalty around multitier redemption  we are seeing growth with the occasional customer  And there is some connection between cold coffee  afternoon occasion and the occasional customer  We are seeing growth after 11 o clock in the afternoon with the occasional customer and with cold coffee So we think that is that combination that s really happening for us  Dennis  in terms of the beverage innovation  So right beverage for our customer base  improving the work that our partners have to do in our stores so that they can interact with the customers and improve customer engagement and then learning from our digital relationships and understanding how to market to our customer base and bring them in the store and a great example of that is our reimagined Happy Hour  And so we re doing    we re combining these three initiatives together and we are convinced that this work and the discipline around it is really driving our comp performance and we can see this in future quarters ahead of us OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein  Please proceed with your question Sara Senatore    Bernstein    AnalystHi  thank you  I have a question  And then a quick follow up  Just on the margins  you have said that that was some    a place where you would have probably raise guidance  I think in general  Pat  you wanted to be conservative on guidance  But could you just talk a little bit about whether the beat versus expectations was in fact just how you position the guidance or were there some surprises in there  supply chain  obviously the comps were a bit better than you would have I think expected or the long term algorithm would suggest So you could just talk about where the margin upside with maybe some specific initiatives or sources would be  And then just my follow up is you have said that the wide scale closures in China and the store closures to be the primary driver of the impact on the business  So does that suggest that for the stores that are remaining open you re not really seeing a change in trend in the China stores  I would have thought there d be more of an impact on consumer confidence broadly Kevin Johnson    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Sara  I ll take both questions and then pivot to John for additional color on China  First of all  with respect to margin performance in the quarter  we were really delighted with our overall margin outcome in Q1  And what was better than expected was  to your point  higher than expected comp growth and with that strong sales leverage contributing positively to margin We also had stronger than expected benefits from our supply chain  Part of that was a function of the fact that in the US we had such strong sell through for our food  beverages and merchandise in holiday that we did not incur the level of inventory reserves that we ve seen in the past  So a number of initiatives came together to deliver really strong margin performance in Q1 and that was the overriding contributor to what we had planned by way of a margin guidance raise for the full year With respect to China and the drivers of the business impact  I highlighted that the number of stores and duration of closure are the two primary drivers of the business impact  That s not to say that there aren t other drivers or other considerations here  And certainly the reduced retail footfall that we re seeing across the country in the wake of the efforts taken to contain the virus and how customers generally are a bit reticent to perhaps visit commercial centers versus previously is another factor  So it is a contributing factor  But the big factor really is the duration of closure and I ll really pivot to John for additional color on that John Culver    Group President  International  Channel Development and Global Coffee   TeaYeah  So  Sara  obviously we re tracking customers and transactions in our stores that we have open  And we look at that each and every day  I would say that versus historical levels  it definitely has slowed down from    and Pat gave a little bit of color on that  We look at this each and every day  We ve taken action in our open stores to adjust operating hours  We ve also gone in and adjusted some of the product offerings based on supply chain availability  And then we ve also taken a look at specific trade areas where we can consolidate the stores into one store that s meaningful and reaches customers  So a lot of different actions are being taken  But as Pat shared the majority of the impact will come from the closed stores  But this is something we assess every day As you re aware  Chinese New Year has been extended and we re continuing to watch this very closely with the team in China OperatorYour next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI  Please proceed with your question David Palmer    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks  Just a follow up on the US and the beverage contribution of 5 points  which is much    certainly much higher than it was a couple of years ago  If we look back that far  it feels like the Frappuccino platform has stabilized and we ve seen the benefit of some of the newer cold beverage platform like Cold Brew and Nitro and perhaps with the help of foam more recently Could you talk about the biggest contributors to the improvement if we kind of look at this from a multi year perspective  And if we re looking forward in a similar way  could you talk about the biggest contributors to beverage growth going forward and how you feel about the pipeline of beverage news kind of keeping this energy going in the beverage side  Thanks Rosalind  Roz  Brewer    Chief Operating Officer and Group PresidentYes  David  thanks for the question  So a few things  If you recall last year this time we were probably issuing a lot of LTOs  limited time offers  Some of that was Frappuccino based  We were not penetrated with Nitro equipment technology in the stores and Nitro we knew was a growing category  So what you re seeing right now is our execution of putting Nitro in every one of our buildings in the US  And so that s a big transition that we ve made In addition to that playing into cold coffee and that process of creating and leaning into cold  And what you can see in the future from that is that we do have equipment improvements coming in our Cold Brew technology  Part of that is making sure that we are in stock at all times with this process  And so we actually have equipment changes coming in the future for that  I also mentioned too that you ve seen us add all types of milks our beverage line  which gives us the chance to customize  We know that there is a portion of our customer base that wants more of a healthy for you concept  And so you have seen some of the works that we have done to add old  Phonetic  milk regionally across the country  And as that becomes more available in the industry  we will acquire more of that capacity In addition to that  our whole    our hot business is holding very nicely for us  Also from a holiday perspective we introduced beverages that had high demand  If you think about the Irish Cream Cold Brew and then what we were able to do with the Pumpkin Spice category  What also gives us confidence as we go forward is the work that we re doing to make sure that we can deliver on what the customers are asking us for  So you ll see more coming in the alternative milk category for us and then playing into the cold category Also in terms of what helps us sell beverages is our food attach  We will be introducing a breakfast sandwich this year with a plant based patty both in US and Canada and the combination of those pairings is significant for us in terms of how we think about what the customers asking for us to develop I ll also mention that we are seeing still growth in our morning daypart and with MOP  But it s significant to also mention that in this quarter  we opened our first convenience store  So we re seeing increased traffic when we create new formats  Our first introduction to this was in    is in Penn Plaza  New York  I had the chance to visit there in the last 10 days  Customer response is very favorable  It is showing just one more way that our brand is significant to our customer  Once you exit Penn Plaza station you come right up to the store  Customers are responding that it feels like a walk through  It has our latest technology in there from the digital boards that really announce when you drink is ready  It s those kinds of things combined with beverage innovation  they give us the confidence that we re listening to our customers and providing them access to our stores  access to our brand the way they want to acquire their coffee and also listening to them in terms of how we should grow our beverage innovation So we are committed to this category of cold coffee and also making sure that we re staying close to what the customer like    would like to see in what s next in their beverage preference OperatorYour next question comes from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc  Please proceed with your question Eric Gonzalez    KeyBanc    AnalystHey  thanks for taking the question  Just have one question on China and then maybe a follow up  So it seems like you re pushing more aggressively into lower tier cities where coffee consumption is a little bit lower than it might be in the higher tier cities  So if you can maybe talk about how the returns equation works in those lower tier cities and maybe how the product mix differs in those types of locations And then as a follow up to that with the delivery driving 9  sales mix this quarter  does that imply that the on premise business is running negative if it was early days about this time last year in the delivery rollout  So can you maybe talk about why that might be the case  Is the competition  potentially sales transfer or is delivery itself cannibalizing your in store business  Thanks John Culver    Group President  International  Channel Development and Global Coffee   TeaYeah  Eric  this is John  Just to answer your question  In the quarter  we opened 167 stores  46  of those were either in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities  We do see very strong performance in lower tier cities and we continue to make investments in those cities playing the long game  Clearly when we open our first new stores there is a lot of demand for Starbucks coming into those cities  As we continue to build out the footprint  what we ve seen historically is that the total transactions  obviously  continue to grow and volumes    volumes show up as very similar to some of our outer Tier 1 cities  So we feel good about our growth in these Tier 4  Tier 5 cities overall In terms of the delivery aspect of it at 9   clearly we see a lot of benefit  It creates a whole new occasion for our existing customers and it s helping to drive transaction growth in our stores  We have over 3 500 stores in 130 cities  which is 80  of the store base having delivery available to them  We see it as an incremental for these existing customers as well as attracting new customers  In total  dollar profits continue to increase because of it  It s slightly margin dilutive  but it does provide a higher ticket as well as a higher food attach  And we also see stronger demand in the mornings and during the lunch daypart OperatorYour next question comes from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed with your question Katherine Fogertey    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  thank you  I have a couple of questions here  So first of all on international  stripping out the strength that you saw in China  it looks like the rest of International was pretty weak on the traffic side  So I was wondering if you could walk through dynamics you re seeing in select markets there And then on the point that was made earlier about the supply chain and having some problem stocking stores in the region in China for the ones that are open  are you guys seeing difficulty transporting goods and services across the country at this point  And if that is the case  would there be any kind of ripple through effect to maybe push out of new store openings and unit growth  Thank you Kevin Johnson    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Katherine  just real quick on the international side  As Pat highlighted  we had 2 points of impact given the Japan market and what we saw in Japan  And when you look at Japan overall  we had two major factors that influenced the comp performance in Japan  First was early on in the quarter  we had a devastating typhoon that went through the country which impacted twofold  Phonetic  days of sales in the market The second piece was the increase in consumption tax that took place in early October  The good news that we saw through the quarter is that comps accelerated through the quarter back to more normal levels  So we do feel good about the trends that we re currently seeing in Japan When you look more broadly across the International segment and you look at in specifics  EMEA and Asia Pacific  we saw strong growth in both of those regions through our license partnerships  UK in particular did very well  We had Middle East in EMEA that also performed well  And then when you go over to Asia Pacific  Korea had another strong quarter  which was great to see  And then we had some smaller markets  Philippines  Indonesia  Australia and New Zealand doing well as well Switching to your question on China on goods and services  we re monitoring each and every day the supply chain challenges  Clearly in Hubei province that area is impacted the most in terms of supply chain  given the limited travel that s taking place in that city  We haven t seen that meaningful impact take hold in other cities  although as I shared we continue to adjust the menus in our stores and the offerings to accommodate any supply chain challenges we have OperatorYour next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citi  Please proceed with your question Fred Wightman    Citi    AnalystHey guys  It s actually Fred Wightman on for Greg  Just one quick follow up  In your response to an earlier question as far as the changes to the full year outlook  you had alluded to some additional visibility  I think it was on operating margins or earnings for the balance of the year  What exactly were you referring to there Patrick Grismer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So this is Pat  We see further upside in our Channel Development business specifically  So we have a stronger outlook for full year revenue and flow through associated with that in Channel Development  There were a couple of other line items where we were anticipating making some adjustments as well  But far and away the key driver of what we had planned by way of a guidance raise was the extraordinary strength of our Q1 results OperatorYour next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company  Please proceed with your question Andrew Charles    Cowen and Company    AnalystThanks  Roz one of the more impressive drivers of US same store sales has been growth in loyalty program with the 1 4 million members added during 1Q  seasonally the highest it s been on record since you guys have been disclosing this  And I was wondering with this growing base of users  can you tell what the changes in the tactics you re using to market more effectively to these customers to help increase the spend as well as the visitation Rosalind  Roz  Brewer    Chief Operating Officer and Group PresidentSo yes  Andrew  just a few things there  One is we have a very effective media spend  And so if you go back a year or so ago we were either had very small investments in our media spend or not very direct  And so now we are better at understanding almost a one to one relationship with that consumer  And so if we have an email address  we can look at their past purchases and then suggest to them what they could enjoy in our stores and then also to alert them to Happy Hour and other events that are happening in the store and we didn t have that in the past And in addition to that is when we introduce new items  And so what we re seeing from a Cold Brew perspective is also just speaking to them about the new cold beverages  So it s having that one to one relationship and access to them and can personalize the offerings that we have to our customer base In addition to that  some of the other works that we re doing is to help our partners in the stores understand who is shopping in the stores  And so they know their customers just by the relationships that they ve built over the years  But now they know a little bit more about who is shopping in their stores and who s visiting our cafes  And so we share that information with our partners in the stores and it makes them very effective at the work that they do  And so it s    a lot of the insights that we re gathering  we re using it to make our decisions and also to fueling  Phonetic  how we think about what s    what innovation that we want to build and develop  And so  we re using our insight effectively learning from our new members that are growing and then watching the work that we need to do as we look at the multi tier redemption program  which is still just approaching a year in terms of its full national rollout OperatorYour next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America  Please proceed with your question Gregory Francfort    Bank of America    AnalystHey  thank you very much for the question  Just looking back to the US business on  I guess  18 to 24 months of a slowdown in store growth  with that perspective have you seen maybe less cannibalization from new stores or is that something that you guys have seen maybe flow back into comps and that s part of the reason why they picked up a few points  any perspective on that And then as we look forward  I think we re at the bottom of your 3  to 4  unit growth  Is this kind of how we should think about the longer term framework for Fortune vision  Phonetic  store growth being in the US  Thanks Rosalind  Roz  Brewer    Chief Operating Officer and Group PresidentSo a few things there in terms of our store growth in the US  And so we re seeing pretty much the same amount of cannibalization in our business  There is no change there  For us the best investment we could make is our new store growth  We appreciate the return on invested capital that we re seeing with our new store investments  So you ll see that continue What we ve been doing is really looking at our formats and making sure that as we add delivery  add new stores  we are looking at coverage and how we cover our customer in the United States  One of the things I ll mention is the combination of delivery to our new store growth  We just added a total of 3 500 stores now across 49 markets in delivery  And so we have a broad amount of coverage in the US combining with that  And we still have the estimated number of new stores coming in the US in really advancing our format development  anything from our new format in terms of the convenience stores all the way to our Roastery plan  So we are still encouraged by our investments in new real estate and we re not seeing any shift in cannibalization in our business right now Patrick Grismer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd Greg  this is Pat  To build on what Roz just said  we would reaffirm our net store growth guidance for the US of 3  to 4  OperatorYour last question comes from RJ Hottovy with Morningstar  You may ask your question RJ Hottovy    Morningstar    AnalystThanks  and thanks for let me get the question in here  Just one follow up question for Roz  You kind of painted  Phonetic  on this in the last answer  but one of the things we haven t heard a lot about is that delivery program and obviously you ve been working with some new restaurant formats and developing that  But just wanted to see if you could provide us an update in terms of where that initiative stands and what takeaways you ve had  Obviously you shared some takeaways from the China in terms of attach rates and new customer growth  But just any takeaways you ve seen at the delivery program so far in the US Rosalind  Roz  Brewer    Chief Operating Officer and Group PresidentSure  So  yes  we are continuing to expand  Because we re now at 75  US coverage of all Starbucks stores  we are now into a national marketing program  which if you remember  this time last year we were roughly about 115 stores with no marketing against it  And so we are encouraged to continue to see what happens when we alert the customer that delivery is available at their favorite location  Our stores are equipped from a technology standpoint  The partners are well trained in terms of how to handle the trade off between the transition of the beverage to the pickup delivery person  So operationally it s working extremely well  We ll continue to watch it One thing I ll say about the US business is  if you compare it to China in terms of delivery  the adoption rate is still pretty modest in the US and so we re just moving right along with the customer and making it available to as much coffee coverage as we can in the US  But it s modestly being adopted in the US if you compare it to China OperatorLadies and gentlemen  that was our last question today  I will now turn the call over to Kevin Johnson for closing remarks Kevin Johnson    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  thank you all for joining us on today s call  I want to close by recognizing my Starbucks partners around the world for such a strong Q1 performance and the underlying business momentum that we are building as a company  I also want to recognize my Starbucks partners who are navigating the dynamic situation related to the corona virus in China  As we deal with these extraordinary circumstances  we will remain focused on caring for the health and well being of our partners  supporting health officials as they work to contain the corona virus and during all of this  staying true to the mission and values that built this great company To our investors  I appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through the temporary business impacts in China  We are as confident as ever in the strength and resilience of our double digit earnings growth model for the long term and we are committed to maintaining transparency as we gain a better understanding of the magnitude and duration of the near term business impacts  I serve all stakeholders of this great company and I am so optimistic about our future

93544,315059,SBUX,Bear Of The Day  Canada Goose  GOOS ,opinion,"If you live in a cold winter climate   especially in Urban areas  you ve no doubt noticed the proliferation of bulky down parkas with fur lined hoods and collars and a distinctive embroidered patch signifying that they are from the collection of high end outdoor garment maker Canada Goose  
Around the downtown Chicago offices of Zacks  the Canada Goose parka is the winter wear de rigueur for the millennial crowd  It would be understandable if you thought it was actually a required uniform if you re going to be standing in line at Starbuck s  or the hip place next door that sells take out salads for 11 bucks 
You may also be aware that those garments are very expensive  with the price of the flagship parka starting at about  800 and going up to  1 400 and beyond  Other garments are priced at similar levels with lighter weight jackets  outerwear pants and premium knit items all selling for over  500 So how does a company with popular  premium priced products end up as the Bear of the Day 
Lowered earnings estimates  stagnating long term forecasts and the wildcard of selling products made from animal feathers and fur that have been the subject of negative press and an FTC investigation into the company s claims of  ethical sourcing  
There s also the issue that while those expensive parkas have become ubiquitous in the big city coffee lines  they were noticeably absent from the slopes of ski resorts in places like Jackson Hole  WY and Vail CO during the holiday season  In fact  an informal survey of outdoor winter sports enthusiasts finds that that group still prefers high performance  technical outerwear from the likes of the North Face  Patagonia and Columbia Sportswear and considers Canada Goose a fashion  poser  brand 
Having a hot fashion brand can be a double edged sword  While consumer demand for the newest items can drive sales and help a company hold gross margins  those tastes are notoriously fickle and require a marketing spend that quickly becomes unsustainable if sales dip 
In the case of Canada Goose  the company relies on large  stylish  flagship  stores in prime luxury shopping districts across the US and Canada as well as in London  Paris  Beijing  Shanghai  Hong Kong and Tokyo 
Those stores utilize extremely expensive retail commercial real estate  Floor space is arranged to showcase new inventory and the stores function more as advertisements that draw attention to the brand rather than as a channel for significant retail sales 
Early reports are that Canada Goose outerwear   which was rarely discounted in previous seasons   has been the subject of steep markdowns during the 2019 holiday season  The average discount to MSRP this year was calculated at 13  by one industry analysis firm  Pushback from animal rights groups is affecting consumer demand for the garments at full price   Activists have been critical of the conditions in which geese for the down stuffing are raised as well as the use of leg traps   necessary to procure coyote fur from wild animals 
Recent downward revisions for Q4 2019 earnings from  0 96 share to  0 87 share earn Canada Goose a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Though the company turned in an earnings beat last quarter  management declined to adjust future guidance and the shares have been declining   trading recently at less than   the all time high of  70 05 share reached at the end of 2018

93545,315060,SBUX,My 3 Step Plan For 20  Upside  9  Dividends  In 2020,opinion,"We re just three weeks into 2020 and it s already a dividend wasteland 
Happy New Year  Enjoy Your 1 7  Dividend






Drop  500K into the typical  miserly  S P 500 stock today and you get a pathetic  713 a month in dividend payouts  That s no retirement  it might cover the cost of your commute and coffee on the way to your job as a Walmart  NYSE WMT  greeter so long as you avoid going to Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  
Treasuries  Forget it  At a 1 8  yield  we re not retiring on them  either 
No wonder I hear from so many investors wary of putting their cash in a market yielding less than inflation  Meantime  with stocks trading at a bubbly 25 5 times earnings  you re putting yourself in the tracks of a price correction that would quickly devour your tiny income stream 

The S P 500 Ate Its Dividend Nearly 10 Times in Late 2018






This problem is why I launched my Contrarian Income Report high yield investing service in August 2015  Buy CIR s average portfolio pick now and you ll get a hefty 7 2  dividend stream  That s right around the market s long term annualized return  and you re getting it in dividends alone 
Add in the price appreciation we ve seen since launch  and CIR subscribers are pulling in a steady 11 9  annualized total return 
A 20   Return Every Year   From Dividend Stocks  
Here s the real news I want to share with you today  I ve just launched a new dividend service called Dividend Swing Trader  It gives you a chance to bag even bigger returns I m talking 20   a year  including dividends  in total 
It s the perfect complement to Contrarian Income Report because  like CIR  our Dividend Swing Trader picks pay huge dividends our initial 4 buys  which I ll give you instant access to below  yield an outsized 8 9  now  which already gives us a nice head start on our planned sprint to 20   yearly total returns 
But unlike Contrarian Income Report  where we plan to hold our positions for years  we re using a different strategy for Dividend Swing Trader  we ll buy in so that we catch the bulk of a major move up  and collect our dividend payouts  of course   then make our exit  taking our gains  and dividends  with us 
The last step  roll our gains into yet another high yielder set to gap higher  Rinse and repeat 
Our Dividend Swing Trader holding periods are usually measured in weeks or months  though you might find yourself holding a few of these cash machines for a year or more 
Call It Contrarian Income Report 
Before you ask  no  this isn t speculation  Heck  it isn t even anything we aren t doing already  All we re really doing here is slightly accelerating our successful Contrarian Income Report approach  But it s a slight acceleration that can really ignite your total return 

In fact  Contrarian Income Report gives us a great example of how my dividend swing trade system works and how potent it can be in mortgage lender  Arbor Realty Trust   NYSE ABR   
We ve held this real estate investment trust  REIT  for a relatively short period of 18 months  and bagged a 54  total return  doubling up the S P 500 s gain 
Arbor Realty  Our Slow Motion Swing Trade






Here s how we did it 
First  the dividend  Arbor s payout was already huge when we bought an outsized 9 6  yield  We climbed aboard at  10 85 a share and have collected  1 81 so far  In other words  we got 17  of our initial capital back in the following 18 months 
That was just the start 
Dividend Growth Powers Our Price Gains
Not only was Arbor s dividend high  but it was well covered by adjusted funds from operations  a better measure of REIT profitability than earnings per share   Arbor was also growing its payout fast 56  in the two years before we bought   Or  put another way  six increases in the previous eight quarters  
A  Unicorn  9 6  Dividend That Soared






That s more than most companies hike their payouts in eight years  Yet Arbor  payer of an already stratospheric 9 6  dividend  pulled it off in eight quarters 
  That Pulls the Stock Higher
I ve  about how a growing dividend is the No  1 driver of share prices  That makes dividend growth the safest  surest way for us to get the price upside we need to push us to a 20   yearly total return  This was just starting for Arbor 
Arbor s Soaring Dividend Awakens Its Stock






Finally  let s move on to something that s not easy for us contrarians to do  
Forget the Bargain Bin Buy Stocks Showing Strength
Here s somewhere else our Dividend Swing Trader strategy stands out  for these shorter term trades  we re zeroing in on stocks that at least match and ideally do better than the market 
The term for this is  relative strength   which simply means that strong stocks tend to stay strong  giving them a solid base to jump off from as their dividends soar 
This is what happened with Arbor in February 2018  After pacing the market for a long stretch  the stock gapped higher  powered by its relentlessly rising dividend 
Arbor s Breakout






Finally  with all these winning elements in place  a high current yield  a dividend that s growing  and pulling the stock price higher  and a base of relative strength  all we need to do is sit back and let our winners run  which is exactly what we did with Arbor  pacing us to that nice 54  gain 
How to Get in on the Next 54   Gainer Now
I m excited that  after months of lobbying  my publisher is finally letting me take my Dividend Swing Trader system public  You can get your no risk 60 day trial to the service  along with 4 free special reports that show you exactly how it works   
But before I go further  there are two things I have to tell you about Dividend Swing Trader 
First  as I m sure you ve figured out  this is an active trading service instead of buying and holding for years  we re flipping in and out of these dividend payers for maximum profits  often just a few months at a time  and almost always with shorter holding periods than we saw with Arbor 
Second  I m keeping my Dividend Swing Trader subscriber rolls small way smaller than the 15 000  subscribers to Contrarian Income Report   In fact  we have only 50 or so seats left as I type  
This is no marketing gimmick 
I have no choice but to keep membership limited because we re dealing with small companies much smaller than Arbor s  1 6 billion market cap  If I recommend them to thousands of readers  we ll move the market with our buying volume 
An 8 1  Dividend  Waiting for You Now
Here s another reason why you should give Dividend Swing Trader a try in a little over a month since launch  we ve built our portfolio up to include 4 stocks that already yield an outsized 8 1   on average 
There have been some nice gains  too  with one of our first picks having already returned 7 5   Plus  our first dividend payout is already in hand from this 8  yielding cash machine 






Our latest dividend swing trade just went out last Thursday  and I can t wait to send it to you it s a utility stock throwing off a 6  dividend that s risen for 10 straight quarters  As with Arbor  its share price is just starting to kick up with its payout 
With the herd just starting to catch on  this new pick is nicely positioned for double digit upside  starting from our strong base of a surging 6  dividend

93561,315076,SBUX,Starbucks Earnings Today  3 Metrics to Watch,news,"Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  is one of many companies reporting earnings this week as earnings season continues to ramp up  The coffee giant is scheduled to announce its fiscal first quarter results after market close today 
Following a strong fiscal 2019 in which comparable store sales growth accelerated from 2  in fiscal 2018 to 5   investors will look to the company s fiscal first quarter results to see if the consumer goods company can kick off fiscal 2020 with similar momentum 
Here are some key areas for investors to check on when Starbucks reports earnings after the bell today 

1  Global comps growth
Just as is the case for most retailers  one of the primary metrics for investors to watch is Starbucks  comps growth  Starbucks defines this metric as sales at company operated stores open 13 months or longer  
In fiscal Q4  global comps increased 5  year over year  This gain was driven by a 3  boost in average ticket amounts and a 2  increase in transactions  Comps growth in the Americas and the U S  was particularly strong  increasing 6  year over year  Growth in China  Starbucks  most important growth market  was also robust at 5  
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020  investors should look for this metric to highlight more growth  Specifically  investors should watch for it to be somewhere in management s full year guidance range for the metric  In the company s most recent quarterly update  management said it expects fiscal 2020 comparable store sales to increase between 3  and 4  
2  Revenue growth
Another key item to watch will be Starbucks  revenue growth  which is driven by both comps growth and new store openings  In fiscal Q4  revenue increased 7  year over year  or 10  year over year on an adjusted basis 
While management s guidance for slower comps growth in fiscal 2020 implies some deceleration in total revenue growth  any deceleration should be moderate in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 
3  Starbucks Rewards members in China
Finally  investors should look for continued momentum in Starbucks  China based digital rewards program  which was revamped during the first quarter of fiscal 2019  Starbucks Rewards members in China hit 10 million by the end of fiscal 2019  up 45  year over year 
Rapid growth in Starbucks  digital loyalty program and in delivery from online orders has helped mobile orders grow to account for 10  of total sales in China during fiscal Q4  Look for continued success in these programs to remain an important revenue driver for the market during the first quarter of fiscal 2020

My call has been absolutely wrong  And it could be again  But I ll stand by my reasoning and back it up this time    by putting my own skin in the game  more on that below  

What s so bad about Starbucks 
You might think I hate the company  that s simply not true  I m thoroughly impressed with the culture of coffee  and community  that Starbucks has helped foster in America  I m equally impressed with how the company takes care of its employees  And while it s not my first choice  I don t mind visiting my local store 
My reticence is about the stock    not the company  It can be broken down into three broad categories 

Moat  The company s sustainable competitive advantages are shrinking 
China  It won t be the panacea that the bulls are hoping for 
Price  The stock is simply way too expensive given the above two points 

Let s break them down one at a time 
Got a moat 
In my investing world  moats come in four varieties  

Network effects  Each additional customer makes the overall experience better for all customers  and thus makes the product more valuable 
Low cost production  When one company can make something for less than anyone else could 
High switching costs  Current customers would find it painful  expensive  or otherwise challenging to change to a different provider 
Intangible assets  These can include patents  government protection  and brand value 

Restaurants are notorious for their thin moats  Anyone can open up a store  While you might be able to keep your single location special enough that people frequent it  doing the same at scale is an entirely different thing 
That said  Starbucks has actually done a great job here  Forbes ranks it as the second most valuable restaurant brand in the world  behind only McDonalds 
Starbucks  app and rewards program have proven quite popular  Customers clearly appreciate being able to order digitally  walk into the coffee shop  grab their beverages  and be on their way quickly  Those interactions with the app    and the rewards points that build up from using it    make patronizing Starbucks more  sticky  and add a mild degree of switching costs  
It could also be easily argued that because of its scale  Starbucks benefits from low cost production 
And yet   
As I highlighted in my earlier article  millennials are becoming the most dominant demographic among consumers  And they  we  are looking for three things 

Products produced locally 
Products from small companies 
Products that are organic 

While Starbucks can certainly offer organic beans  it is not local  unless you re in Seattle   nor is it small  There s evidence that this new demographic is willing to pay a little more for products that have those attributes  That could  of course  change    but it substantially saps the value of Starbucks  powerful brand and lower cost production 
How much luck will it have in China 
Much of the excitement around Starbucks has to do with the company s ambitions in China  It s hard not to get excited  There are over 800 million people living in its urban centers  American brands are popular there  and coffee is becoming more popular 
But there s a new kid on the block that could spoil everything  Luckin Coffee  NASDAQ LK   There were no Luckin shops in existence three years ago  This is what has happened in China since 

Over the past year  Luckin has increased its footprint by 210    Sure   you might say   anyone can grow fast by spending a lot of money  That doesn t mean Luckin will succeed   
But consider the following 

Average monthly customers grew 389  over the same period  faster than store openings  meaning existing locations are getting more customers 
Average items sold rose 467  during this period  faster than the growth in customer count  meaning the average customer is buying more 
Revenue is growing faster  520   than items sold  meaning people are paying more for each item 
Gross profit is growing faster than revenue  surging 822   meaning Luckin has some financial leverage 

I m not saying there won t be room for both Luckin and Starbucks in China  What I am saying is that Starbucks  long term dominance in the Middle Kingdom is far from a foregone conclusion 
An expensive stock
So here s where I m at  Starbucks is a quality company  But because of demographic shifts  I think its moat is narrowing  And because of the ascendance of a major competitor in China  I don t think it will be nearly as dominant there as it might have previously expected to be 
Those points alone don t make this a stock to avoid  The fact that Starbucks stock is trading for 36 times trailing free cash flow  P FCF  and 32 times trailing earnings  P E   is what really gives me pause  To put it in perspective  the average S P 500 company trades today for 25 times earnings    and even that is a historically high level  I just don t think such a large and mature company that isn t notably increasing traffic  much of its recent comp sales growth has come from price increases  deserves such a high valuation 
Putting my own skin in the game
I think having skin in the game is important  It forces us to hold ourselves accountable  I ve already given Starbucks an underperform rating in my CAPS profile  a losing bet right now   I even briefly considered shorting the stock  But then my fellow Fool Daniel Sparks reminded me of something that s worth repeating here for all to see 

My take  One of the best privileges of investing is that you can have a negative view and remain on the sidelines  Shorting is more than being negative about a stock s long term prospects  It s a bet it will go down 
  Daniel Sparks   danielsparks  January 23  2020



He s right  And this is an important behavior to model right here  
In its place  I offer this  I will take any money I get from writing this article and if    three years from now    Starbucks has outperformed the market  I will donate every cent to my local Boys   Girls Club 
You obviously don t have to follow suit  Staying on the sidelines is more than enough  There are better places for your money ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmtoz,2067784

93609,315124,SBUX,Starbucks Wants to Get Rid of Single Use Packaging,news,"Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  produces a lot of waste  Customers still use plastic straws  throw away their cups  and go through tens of millions of bags and napkins each month  The company has made efforts to use recyclable items  and to offer cups that make drinking without a straw easy  but its efforts still have it sending products to landfills 
Now the company wants to do better  CEO Kevin Johnson has  unveiled a multi decade aspiration to be a resource positive company  giving more than it takes from the planet   The new initiative includes  science based preliminary target reductions of carbon  water and waste by 2030   and offers  five strategies the company has identified to move toward them  

A greener Starbucks 
The coffee chain has set five specific goals that it plans to meet by 2030  It did not lay out exactly how it plans to reach these targets  which makes sense given that the deadline is a decade away 

Offer more plant based menu items 
Stop using single use packaging that ends up in landfills 
Invest in  innovative and regenerative agricultural practices  reforestation  forest conservation  and water replenishment  in its supply chain 
Do a better job managing food waste 
Create more eco friendly stores  operations  manufacturing  and delivery 

 Our aspiration is to become resource positive    storing more carbon than we emit  eliminating waste  and providing more clean freshwater than we use   Johnson wrote 
Starbucks does not entirely know how it s going to meet these goals  Johnson  however  pledged short term and long term transparency so consumers can see what his chain is doing 
 Our eyes are wide open knowing that we do not have all the answers or fully understand all the complexities and potential consequences   Johnson wrote   Now  it s time to create an even broader aspiration    and it s work that will require visionary thinking  new ways of working  investment of resource and urgent action  
The company did lay out some specific benchmarks it hopes to achieve by 2030 

reduce its carbon emissions by 50 
cut waste sent to landfills by 50 
conserve or replenish half of the water it uses

Starbucks will also make its progress public  To do that  it s using a new gauge created in a partnership with Quantis and the World Wildlife Fund  The index will track the company s  comprehensive environmental footprint of carbon emissions  water use  and waste in Starbucks    global operations and supply chain  
Why is Starbucks doing this 
Call it a mix of altruism and staying ahead of bad press  but Starbucks is taking real action here  It s also doing so in a way that neither puts immediate pressure on the company nor requires it to make an immediate major investment 
Basically  the coffee chain has agreed to do the right thing  but has given itself a lot of runway to get it done  That s a smart move to protect its stock price  The company can take its time to meet these goals  while making incremental changes and taking advantage of innovations by others between now and 2030 
This is Starbucks protecting its brand while getting ahead of what could have become a public relations problem  It s addressing the issue before it faces a backlash   in a way that should also do some real good by 2030 ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plgc3,2065182
93610,315125,SBUX,How Nike and Starbucks  Global Strategies Keep Them Ahead of Competitors,news,"I m writing this as I sit in a Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  cafe at Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris  and while the language is different  the experience is very much the same   Many of the high end luxury shops are understandably quiet  but Starbucks is hopping  It seems like everyone knows that here  you ll get a quality cup of coffee in a relaxed environment and a table for your laptop 
This idea of getting a consistently quality product  no matter where one is in the world  seems to translate across countries and cultures   Many large U S  companies  such as Nike  NYSE NKE  are catching on  By focusing on a wider global audience  these companies stand to benefit from new opportunities and strengthened revenue streams in the decade ahead 

Starbucks has a vision
The main driver of Starbucks revenue is domestic sales  which accounted for 69  of the total revenue in the 2019 fourth quarter  However  notwithstanding positive comps and cash flow from domestic operations  growth is coming from international locations  and Starbucks is cultivating these markets that are slowly catching up  

Data source  Starbucks annual reports 
Starbucks is now in over 80 global markets  and the fourth quarter of 2019 saw a 3  increase in international comps  up from a 1  increase in 2018  Overall  revenue was up 6  year over year 
The company has done a thorough analysis of the issues involved in international operations  including higher development costs and risks related to varying cultural norms  But it helps that most of us drink coffee  which makes for a more seamless international transition  
Why has Starbucks been so successful worldwide  The same reasons it s seen so much success in the U S   a commitment to the customer experience  which matters everywhere  and strong technological innovation  which gives it the power to manage international growth 
Nike s supreme advantage
In many ways  Nike is hard to beat  too  Its image as a technological front runner and high status symbol gives it an edge in sales  and no other athletic shoe company can quite match it in terms of revenue and innovation  The second quarter of 2020 saw  10 3 billion in revenue and 10  growth  crushing numbers for its closest rival  Adidas  OTC ADDY Y   which saw  7 1 billion and 6  growth in its most recent quarterly report 
The greater share of the gain came from international markets  specifically in China  as these areas have been fueling the company s growth over the past year 

Data source  Nike quarterly reports 
Not only are these numbers fantastic  they re also remarkably consistent  which is important for investors to consider when evaluating a company s longer term sustainability 
The company released the Nike app in China this past quarter  and it was downloaded 1 million times on the day of the launch  making it the top shopping app in all of China  Nike monitors that region thoroughly to find opportunities for community engagement  and the result has been explosive growth  
Nike plans to achieve greater worldwide dominance through its premium and exclusive products that appeal to a mass audience of fans internationally  Former CEO Phil Knight said in his book Shoe Dog   Business is war without bullets   and Nike knows that to keep its top spot  it can t let up on the offensive 
Taking the initiative
With the rise of digital sales  having an international presence and strategy has become all the more important  Starbucks and Nike are ahead of the pack  which goes a long way toward ensuring long term growth 
Going global is not a simple task for any company  It requires stability and a core business back at home before any company can grow beyond its borders  and enough brand recognition that it can have the confidence that it will take hold outside of its home country  
Both of these companies have seen rising share price  with Starbucks up 46  and Nike up 32  over one year  and there s good reason to believe that they will continue in that direction ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pma7a,2066841
93611,315126,SBUX,Starbucks Aims to Take Positive Momentum Into a New Fiscal Year,news,"Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  is back in growth mode  The coffee titan in late October posted impressive results for its fiscal 2019 year that marked a sharp turnaround following two consecutive years of underperformance 
That success has raised expectations for the new fiscal year and Starbucks will report on its first quarter on Tuesday  Jan  28  Below  I ll take a look at a few trends to keep an eye on when that report is released 

How things have been going
It was just over a year ago that Starbucks  business began to turn the corner  and that positive momentum carried through for the entire 2019 year  Comparable store sales trends improved in both of its core growth markets  the U S  and China  culminating in a 5  global uptick in the fourth quarter 
That translated into market share growth and shows that CEO Kevin Johnson s rebound plan is working  Investors next  week will be looking for confirmation that the selling environment is still favorable  Those clues will show up in the growth pace in the U S  and China  which might slow slightly from the prior quarter s 6  and 5  gains  respectively 
Beyond the headline result  keep an eye on customer traffic trends  Starbucks  recent results have featured balance between rising traffic and increased average spending  in contrast with peers like McDonald s  and furthering that streak should support the stock 
Starbucks  stronger results have allowed it to scale up its cash returns to shareholders  with spending on stock repurchases and dividends jumping to  12 billion last year compared with  9 billion in 2018 and  3 5 billion in 2017  However  profitability still hasn t rebounded    and that s a key missing ingredient in the bullish investing thesis  In fact  operating margin last year slipped to 15 4  of sales from 15 7   It was nearly 19  in fiscal 2017 
That 2019 decline was mostly driven by temporary issues  Investors will be looking for the restaurant chain to begin marching back toward a percentage operating margin in the high teens  perhaps starting with next week s quarterly report 
A look ahead
Investors started taking Starbucks  rebound seriously around a year ago  and that enthusiasm was supported by the fact that management issued a rare upgrade to its outlook  Executives said at the time that global comps might land at almost 4  for the year  and they went on to expand by 5  
Starbucks will have another opportunity to update its full year outlook on Tuesday  Currently  that prediction stands at the same range as it did a year ago  calling for comps of between 3  and 4    An additional 1 900 new stores  meanwhile  should help lift overall revenue higher by about 7   Starbucks is also calling for a  modest  uptick in operating margin so that operating income rises by nearly 10  
Affirming those financial targets on Tuesday would confirm that Starbucks is still expanding quickly  and that it continues to find ways to make its beverages  and its dining experience  stand out from rivals in brutally competitive markets like the U S  and China ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmfoj,2067208

93614,315129,SBUX,3 Mutual Funds To Tap October s Striking Job Additions,opinion,New job creations across the United States  private sector were quite astounding in October  as neither analysts nor investors anticipated such an impressive increase in positions across key sectors The remarkable new job additions revealed a good domestic economy  which remained strong despite the country s slow expansion in the third quarter and a six week long strike at General Motors Company  NYSE GM  October s job report clearly reveals the strength in the U S  job market  Mutual fund investors could thus consider investing in some key sectors that added the highest number of jobs Private Sector Job Additions Top Expectations According to the   total nonfarm payroll employment in October rose by 128 000  New job additions were broad based and took analysts by surprise  given that the General Motors  strike impacted the U S  auto industry  After all  employees on strike are considered as unemployed in U S  statistics   In fact  the unemployment rate nudged up to 3 6  in October  although it remained the lowest in about 50 years Sectors That Added Most New JobsTaking a closer look at October s jobs report  one can note that employment in food services and drinking places  professional and business services  healthcare  social assistance and financial services drove the month s share of new job roles Food services and drinking places added maximum jobs in October   48 000   followed by professional and business services  which added 22 000 new roles  Employment in social assistance increased by 20 000  with most of the new jobs added in individual and family services The financial services and healthcare sectors added a decent number of jobs last month of 16 000 and 15 000  respectively The manufacturing sector lost 36 000 jobs in October  In fact  employment in the auto sector declined by 42 000 owing to the General Motors strike  New job additions across sectors such as wholesale trade  retail trade  construction  mining  transportation and warehousing and information changed little in October Our ChoicesWe have  therefore  selected three mutual funds that invest in sectors that gained the highest number of jobs in October  All these funds carry a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Moreover  these funds have encouraging year to date returns  Additionally  the minimum initial investment is within  5 000 We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future  Remember  the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide

the fund The question here is why should investors consider mutual funds  Reduced transaction costs and diversification of portfolio without several commission charges that are associated with stock

93636,315151,SBUX,Starbucks eyes plant based food  reusable packaging in latest sustainability push,news,"By Richa Naidu and Hilary Russ
CHICAGO  Reuters     Starbucks Corp   O SBUX  aims to add more plant based food and drinks to its menu  make its packaging reusable and invest in better waste management  CEO Kevin Johnson said on Tuesday  as part of the company s latest plan to become more environmentally friendly 
Starbucks   which sells sausage breakfast sandwiches  chicken wraps and smoked salmon bagels with cream cheese   did not say by when it would start offering the plant based items or shift from single use cups and plastic  A spokeswoman told Reuters that the company is exploring meat alternatives for its breakfast menu  but declined comment on potential suppliers 
Over the past year  with the rise of companies like Beyond Meat  O BYND  and Impossible Foods   plant based  has become a food industry buzzword and several major brands and restaurants have raced to offer such products  The plant based meat category is expected to be worth  140 billion in the next decade  according to  Barclays   LON BARC  
For now  the world s largest coffee chain has laid out targets for 2030 including halving landfill waste from stores  and carbon emissions from its direct operations and supply chain  These targets were informed by research from the World Wildlife Fund and sustainability consultant Quantis 
Starbucks  which uses about 6 billion cups a year at its more than 30 000 outlets  has failed in the past to meet some of its own environmental goals including making 25  of its cups reusable by 2015  The target was revised to serving 5  of its beverages in personal tumblers by 2015  which Starbucks also missed  The Seattle based company s abundant use of containers  lids and straws has been criticized by consumers as well as activist groups for decades  To be sure  some of its goals have been met  such as a 2008 plan to buy enough renewable energy certificates to power all of its company operated stores by 2015 ",2020-01-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/starbucks-eyes-plantbased-food-reusable-packaging-in-latest-sustainability-push-2063863,2063863

93642,315157,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  Q4 Earnings Match Estimates,opinion,"Starbucks  SBUX  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 70 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 62 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this coffee chain would post earnings of  0 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 78  delivering a surprise of 8 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Starbucks  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry  posted revenues of  6 75 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 14   This compares to year ago revenues of  6 30 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Starbucks shares have added about 30 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 1  
What s Next for Starbucks 
While Starbucks has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Starbucks was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 76 on  7 08 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 07 on  28 44 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

93667,315182,SBUX,Starbucks Wants to Balance Technology and Personal Connections,news,"Visit the same Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  more than a few times and chances are you will build connections with store personnel  That may mean being greeted by name  getting a welcoming smile  or having a barista know the special quirks of your order 
Technology  however  can prevent those bonds from being created  Consumers can use the coffee chain s app to place an order and pay for it  bypassing any human interaction  That s a problem that Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson has wrestled with 
 I ve seen firsthand the incredible power of technology and the positive impacts it has had on our world  whether it s empowering people with information  enabling them to stay connected or creating business models   Johnson said in a press release   But it s not until being here at Starbucks that I started to realize there s another dimension to this  

What is Starbucks doing 
Johnson spent some time over the holiday season working the front lines at one of his chain s cafes  He served customers  watched staff  and saw that some consumers were  falling deeper and deeper into their mobile devices  
That s something the CEO wants to work to avoid  He believes strongly in technology    having worked in that space for over three decades before coming to Starbucks    but he also sees its downside 
 Technology has done so much positive for the world  but it has contributed to some unhealthy outcomes as well  When it comes to enhancing human connection and enabling people to be present and feel a part of a community   he said   I believe technology  if used in responsible and thoughtful ways  can also be the enabler of freeing up people to be more human and better serve humanity  
The CEO does not want his customers and employees to lose their connection  To make sure that doesn t happen  he began talking to employees to see what daily tasks keep them from engaging with customers or leave them stuck working in back rooms  away from where they can engage with guests  He plans to explore ways to use technology in ways that build  rather than replace  customer interaction 
 Investments in the Starbucks partner experience is what creates that special customer experience  and that  in turn  drives our business success   Johnson said   I want to ensure we stay true to that approach  So we will pursue world class technology  not just for the sake of technology  but in service of humanity and in support of our mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit one person  one cup  and one neighborhood at a time  
Using tech to free people up
The CEO does not entirely know what that will look like  but he has tasked thousands of employees to try out new ideas  That has happened at the company s Tryer Center  a mock store that serves as a lab for testing ideas 
 There were lots of different hacks and wonderful ideas   said Tryer Center Director Janice Waszak   Many of the ideas revolved around cleaning  We spend a lot of time in Tryer thinking about value added work  and non value added work and how we can invent ways to free them from the latter  Cleaning is a great example of a non value added thing we ask partners to do  and a great place where some automation or technology could help solve some things  
In theory  if workers spend less time performing tasks that don t involve engaging with customers  they will have more time to interact  That may seem like a small thing  but it s a very important way to build a connection between the brand and its patrons 
 If you can t create a customer experience in your brick and mortar store  an experience that goes beyond convenience  you re just another node in the supply chain   Johnson said   And that in store experience must then be extended to a digital mobile relationship  
That s not a simple problem to solve  Technology can be isolating  and it helps people avoid human interaction  Johnson and Starbucks  however  deserve credit for realizing that part of its brand appeal comes from its connection with customers  Finding ways to continue  or even enhance  that in a world with ever increasing technology will help the restaurant chain remain relevant and important to its customers for decades to come ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phg1u,2058177
93668,315183,SBUX,Seattle passes campaign finance curbs on  foreign influenced  firms,news,"By Greg Scruggs
SEATTLE  Reuters    The Seattle City Council voted unanimously on Monday to approve campaign finance legislation banning political donations in local elections from companies with at least 5  foreign ownership 
The Clean Campaigns Act makes Seattle the largest city with such a ban following St  Petersburg  Florida  which passed a similar ordinance in 2017 
Seattle s move is widely viewed as an effort to curb online retailer Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   the city s largest employer  which has flexed its political muscle the past two years 
At least 9  of Amazon s stock is owned by foreign investors  according to financial data provider Refinitiv 
Amazon poured a record  1 5 million into a political action committee  PAC  run by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce to back a slate of candidates viewed as pro business in the November council elections  Only two of seven candidates endorsed by the PAC won 
A spokesman for Amazon  which has been butting heads with the city for two years over attempts to levy more taxes on large employers  including Amazon  has declined to comment 
According to a memo prepared by a council analyst  in addition to Amazon  at least six other companies that were among the top 20 corporate contributors to PACs during the 2019 election cycle are at least 5  foreign owned  AT T Inc  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Cable Communications   Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE  Ltd   Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   Weyerhaeuser Co and WSP USA 
 It s disconcerting to see the Seattle City Council pick and choose who gets a voice in local elections  and when   the Seattle Chamber of Commerce s chief of staff  Markham McIntyre  said in a statement 
Seattle s law comes a decade after the U S  Supreme Court struck down limits on political contributions by corporations or unions in the landmark Citizens United case 
 It does make it look like it s an end run around Citizens United   said Ethan Blevins  an attorney with the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation   Corporate decision making process and who owns shares are two totally different things   he said 
Ron Fein  legal director for government watchdog Free Speech for People  which consulted on the bill  denied it was written as a test case to overturn Citizens United 
 Just like foreign investors have long been prohibited from spending their own money in elections  they shouldn t be allowed to influence a corporation to spend company money to do what they can t do directly   said Fein  saying that the bill  sets a new model for protecting democratic self government  ",2020-01-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/seattle-passes-campaign-finance-curbs-on-foreigninfluenced-firms-2058618,2058618
93669,315184,SBUX,If You Had Invested  1 000 in Starbucks  IPO  Here s How Much You d Have Today,news,"No restaurant business has been more successful than Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  over the last generation 
Under the guidance of former CEO Howard Schultz  Starbucks went from a handful of sleepy stores in Seattle to a global coffee empire with more than 30 000 locations  as well as products that fill the aisles of supermarkets and convenience stores and a robust licensing business 
Starbucks  massive returns alone make it a compelling investing story  but there are two other reasons why investors may want to study its history  First  it happened in front of all of us  Starbucks has long been mocked for being ubiquitous  but almost any American could see that the company was growing like a  caffeinated  weed throughout the 1990s and 2000s  As famed investor Peter Lynch often advised  Starbucks is the classic  buy what you know  stock 
Second  Schultz took a simple idea and turned it into a  100 billion company  On a trip to Italy  he was inspired by Italian cafes and sought to bring the experience and  theater  of espresso cafes back to the U S   creating a  third place  away from home and work where customers could relax and feel welcome  
Let s take a look at Starbucks  history and see how much you d have today if you d bought into the IPO 

A brief history of Starbucks stock
The coffee chain debuted on the market at  17 a share  or  0 34 split adjusted  on June 26  1992  At the time  the company had just 165 locations   but the stock would gain quickly through the 1990s as the company first expanded overseas in Japan in 1996  Schultz stepped down from the CEO role in 2000  and several years later the brand began to deteriorate and performance worsened  Starbucks individual stores began to feel too generic  the brand had become watered down  and the stock fell sharply from 2006 to 2009 
Schultz returned in 2008  closing hundreds of stores  and worked to bring Starbucks  old atmosphere back  The strategy worked  and the company and its stock continued to grow through the 2010s  expanding into China as its next big frontier  and tapping into digital ordering and its rewards program to drive growth in the U S  In 2017 Kevin Johnson  former CEO of Juniper Networks  took over as CEO  bringing a tech background to the leadership post 
Starbucks  stock splits
If you had invested  1 000 in the company s IPO  you would have been able to purchase 59 shares  Starbucks today is trading around  90 a share  so much of the share appreciation has come from stock splits  The chart below shows each stock split and how many shares you would have after it 

Source  Starbucks 
Just seven splits over the course of Starbucks  history would be enough to multiply your share total by a count of 64  With 3 766 shares worth  90 99 each as of Tuesday s closing you would be sitting on  342 668 worth of Starbucks stock today 
However  there s more to the equation  as we must factor in Starbucks  dividends  As investors know  Starbucks has been a committed dividend payer since 2010  raising its quarterly payout ever year by at least 14  
Starbucks  dividend history
Since paying its first dividend 10 years ago  Starbucks has quickly ramped up its payouts  The chart below shows how the company has raised its split adjusted dividend over the last decade 

 Source  Starbucks
Starbucks has been one of the best dividend growth stocks over the last decade  Its payout has risen by more than eight times during that period  putting the company on track to become a Dividend Aristocrat if this pattern continues  Today  Starbucks offers a dividend yield of 1 8   about equal to that of the S P 500  Since Starbucks started paying a dividend  the IPO investor who plunked down  1 000 would have earned another  27 134  and that doesn t include reinvested dividends 
Starbucks  success is a reminder that successful investments don t have to be complicated  The cafe brand has delivered huge returns by taking an age old concept and turning it into a modern restaurant chain 
The good news is Starbucks  growth isn t over  The company continues to expand  especially in China  and is leveraging delivery and digital ordering and adding new menu items to bring in new customers  That s one reason why Starbucks looks poised to continue to outperform the market over the next decade ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pitic,2060977

The company will report results for the holiday season on Jan  28  Starbucks is investing in new technologies in order to perk up its operating efficiency in the long run  Here s a look at three of the company s most interesting tech ideas  and how they might affect the upcoming first quarter 2020 report 

Better coffee machines everywhere
The high performance Mastrena machine isn t exactly new to Starbucks  The highly automated coffeemaker  which can grind your beans and pull three espresso shots at once  all while also steaming some milk   was introduced in 2008 and is now standard equipment for company owned Starbucks stores in the U S 
But Starbucks is still rolling out Mastrena machines to its international locations  and not all franchise stores are on board yet  The company intends to complete those upgrades by the end of 2020 
That s a big deal because the Mastrena can do so much more than Starbucks  older coffeemakers ever could  The ability to produce espresso shots 50  faster limits the time customers spend waiting for their drinks  The machines also come with built in Internet of Things  IoT  sensors  connected to Starbucks  support center 
 We can see every shot of espresso that s being pulled and we can see centrally   CEO Kevin Johnson said in the fourth quarter earnings call   If there is a machine     that needs tuning or maintenance  that allows us to improve the quality of the shots that we re pulling  
Artificial intelligence
The IoT sensors tie into an artificial intelligence  AI  system Starbucks has dubbed Deep Brew  Based on real time data from every Mastrena equipped Starbucks store  Deep Brew analyzes the information from many different angles  The system then spits out recommendations on everything from inventory orders and local advertising plans to personalized drink recommendations and equipment maintenance warnings 
 Deep Brew is a key differentiator for the future  and as we continue our quest to build world class AI capabilities to better support partners   Johnson said   With the Deep Brew and our predictive analytics  we re going to be able to determine if the machine needs preventative maintenance on it before it breaks  and so that simplifies things for our partners  
So a store with the Mastrena has access to Deep Brew features that just aren t available to stores that are stuck with older machines  Together  Mastrena and Deep Brew should boost each store s efficiency in myriad small ways  adding up to significant improvements over time  This is not a short term strategy but a proactive way to drive a stronger and more sustainable business in the long run  Expect to hear more about Mastrena and Deep Brew installations in the first quarter report  especially as they relate to international expansion 
Online orders in China
On that note  Starbucks opened more than 600 locations in China last year  and the store network in that country now stands at over 4 000 coffee shops  The way to modern Chinese customers  hearts appears to go through their mobile devices  and Starbucks is exploring digital strategies to expand its business in the country as quickly as possible 
Johnson said   As we expand our store footprint  we have also been investing in innovative retail formats  including our Starbucks Now store in Beijing that opened in July  a unique express retail experience that seamlessly integrates physical and digital touchpoints to enhance the mobile order and pay and the Starbucks Delivers customer experience  We recently celebrated the one year anniversary of our China digital partnership with Alibaba  NYSE BABA   and I m pleased to share that we surpassed our goal of expanding Starbucks Delivers to 3 000 stores in 100 cities by the end of the fiscal year  
Mobile orders accounted for 10  of Starbucks  second largest and fastest growing market in the fourth quarter  That includes a 3  contribution from the mobile order and pay system that was introduced in China just one quarter earlier  Look for more details on mobile order growth in China as that strategy plays a large part in Starbucks  expansion plans there ",2020-01-18,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjq4-,2062622

93674,315189,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Starbucks  SBUX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This coffee chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 9  
Revenues are expected to be  6 63 billion  up 5 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 94  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Starbucks 
For Starbucks  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Starbucks will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Starbucks would post earnings of  0 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 78  delivering a surprise of  8 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Starbucks doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-sbux-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200476892,200476892
93675,315190,SBUX,FTSE  The Long And Short Of It,opinion,"The FTSE 100 continues to chop its way around between key levels  yet with resistance nearby  upside could now be limited 
The recovery frim 7000 has so far come in 3 waves  As momentum from the lows pales in comparison to the decline from 7441 to 7000 the rebound still looks corrective  Furthermore  yesterday s high is now trading just below the 200 day eMA  and between the 50 200 eMA zone  and stopped just shy of the 61 8  Fibonacci retracement level  Therefor upside could be limited unless we see a global rebound across equities  For now  bears could look to fade into areas of weakness and seek signs of a top  After which the 7132 and 7000 lows come into focus for the bear camp 




Avast PLC  LON AVST   Trading just off its record high after breaking out of a symmetrical triangle  we re waiting for price to consolidate or pull back for a better entry  Up 43 5  YTD  the software and security company has outperformed the FTSE 350 this year  it looks like momentum is just ramping up  However  given the bearish hammer and extended distance from the eMA s  we d prefer to see a higher low form before assuming new highs and trend continuation 




BAE Systems PLC  LON BAES   A potential head and shoulders top is forming  although it s neckline is just above the 200 day eMA and 530 support  Whilst this means support around 530 could be a tougher nut to crack  it becomes more significant if it does break  or could still provide a bullish setup over the near term if it bounces instead  Bears could wait for a break below 530 to assume the H S has been confirmed and target 500  whereas bulls could target the upper gap around 550 




 Greggs  PLC  LON GRG   In some ways  Greggs is similar to the setup on Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  we highlighted earlier this week  It s recently broken beneath the 200 day eMA and bounced back towards this level  Indeed  bearish swing traders could look for a move towards the 1718 low whilst prices hold beneath the 1900 area  Also note that the 20 and 50 day eMA s could cap as dynamic resistance and that the recent  rebound  has been seen in lower volume  meaning it s more likely corrective   A break below 1718 assumes a run towards 1500 
Bulls may point towards a potential inverted H S  although we d want to see prices back above 1954 before assuming the corrective low from the 2496 high is in 
 Cranswick PLC   LON CWK   Since breakout out from its 12 month basing pattern  the breakout climbed to a 12 month high  Yet momentum has clearly turned so this on now on the backburner  although we ll monitor to see if it can build a new level of support above 3116  breakout level  before reconsidering longs  to target the 3500 high 
 ConvaTec Group PLC   LON CTEC   The break above 188 failed to hold up and by the close produced a key reversal day  back below resistance  This is on the back burner for now but  given its create support around 180  potential higher low  then we d reconsider if it were to break back above 191 15
Imperial Brands PLC  LON IMB   It remains on the watchlist as it s consolidating after a fall to a new cycle low  Traders could look for a break of 1800 to assume bearish trend continuation  The 1736 2 low is the initial target  although given the strength of the bear trend overall  an eventual break low remains the bias  Alternatively  traders could fade into moves below the 1929 2 gap high   above here bulls would likely look to close the gap up to the 2000 area 
 JD Sports Fashion  PLC  LON JD   Trading just off its record highs in a tight flag pattern and found support at its 10 day eMA  It s one of the stronger performers this year in the FTSE  and daily trend remains bullish above 717 
 Segro  PLC  LON SGRO   It hit an 11 year high on Tuesday but  if you re not in  may be time to wait for a retracement given the shooting star on the daily chart  A bullish engulfing candle marks a higher low at 804 6  so we d like to see a new level of support build above the 800 804 region before reconsidering longs 
AVEVA Group PLC  LON AVV   After finally breaking out of its corrective  bearish  channel  prices charged for 4 000 on Tuesday  However  a bearish hammer with a wide body warns of the need for a retracement  so now look for either 3800 to hold as support  or somewhere around a new bullish trendline projected from the September low  Given the longer term bull trend  it remains firmly on our bullish watchlist ",2019-10-24,Matt Simpson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ftse-the-long-and-short-of-it-200477207,200477207

93699,315214,SBUX,Starbucks launches oat milk drink as vegan movement grows,news,"By Nivedita Balu
 Reuters     Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX  on Tuesday added an oat milk beverage to its menu  as the coffee chain taps into the growing demand for vegan alternatives to dairy 
The new beverage is available at 1 300 locations in the U S  Midwest  the Seattle based company said 
It also launched new beverages made with coconut and almond milk in the United States and Canada  It has previously sold menu items made with those milks 
Plant based milks  popularity comes as more consumers shun cow s milk  citing health and environmental reasons  Dairy sales have fallen for the past four years  and some of the largest U S  dairy producers have filed for bankruptcy 
The alternative milk category stands at  1 8 billion  with sales of oat milk jumping over sevenfold to  53 million over the past year  Cow s milk sales came in at  12 billion for 52 weeks ending Oct  26  according to Nielsen s data  down from  15 billion in 2015 
Market research firm Mintel projects sales of nondairy milks to reach  3 1 billion by 2023 
Sweden based Oatly  which supplies oat milk to Starbucks in the Midwest  started production in the United States about three years ago and has partnered with several cafes in the country  including New York based bubble tea caf  Boba Guys and Chicago based Intelligentsia 
The trend mirrors the popularity of plant based meat substitutes  with Beyond Meat  NASDAQ BYND  and Impossible Foods adding their vegan patties and sausages to menus at fast food and fine dining restaurants

93701,315216,SBUX,Why Starbucks Is a Winner in Any Market,news,"When the last recession hit the U S  economy in 2007  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  faced a challenge  The company had become hugely popular and had grown to accommodate demand  However  it had also become overly confident and wasn t prepared for the approaching headwinds 
When the company began to see slowing sales and unprofitable stores  former CEO Howard Schultz took back the helm and proved the company could withstand a recession  With a robust economy  the company will keep growing  but in the event of another recession  Starbucks has a strategy in place as part of its culture 
Facing declines for the first time
Starbucks saw declines start in 2008  but they exploded into sharp drops in 2009  Here are the numbers for the three previous years as well 

Data source  Company annual reports  2008 and 2009  
And then take a look at the numbers for 2010 

Data source  Company annual report  2010  
The huge two year decrease was followed by a dramatic turnaround  Was it just that the economy improved the following year  Or did Starbucks create something that helped it gain ground 

Meeting the challenge
Many experts say that a company like Starbucks  which serves expensive coffee  is one of the first to suffer in a recession  Customers can easily cut back on cups of coffee  which they can purchase elsewhere for a fraction of the price or brew at home 
When the recession hit in 2007  Starbucks was not at all prepared  and saw a decrease in growth for the first time  In fact  it had been too confident and expanded too quickly  giving in on its core values to spur faster growth  When the downturn came  the company was in a compromised position 
Fortunately  Howard Schultz returned at that point to realign the company s values  and make its stores places where customers would want to come in and spend their money  to give themselves that small luxury  And things have been looking up since 
Keys to sustainable growth
Starbucks is now in a similar situation  having grown its store count to more than 31 000 stores worldwide with  26 5 billion in sales  The difference is that it now has a strategy in place for charging through a downturn in the economy 
The company s winning formula has four parts 

The  Starbucks Experience   Current CEO Kevin Johnson said that  The investments we are making for the long term    in our partners  our stores  beverage innovation and digital    are collectively delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience  as evidenced by all time high customer connection scores in the fourth quarter  
A strong focus on digital  Starbucks was forging ahead with advanced digital capabilities  It has continued its relentless technological progress with its Mobile Order   Pay feature  and a heavy investment in data analytics  When Schultz made his second exit from the company  he was replaced by Johnson  who has a tech background  rather than an executive with a background in food or consumer goods 
Client engagement  Whether it s through the  Starbucks Experience   the Starbucks Rewards program  or better employee training  Starbucks wants to show customers they are valued  it knows that people who feel valued will keep up their end of the relationship  Schultz said   In the face of these challenges  we made what many believed to be a controversial decision to invest in our people  
Operational efficiency  When sales began to slip  the company realized that its rapid growth meant that it had lost touch with rigorous standards  and needed to implement cost effective measures  This meant closing some stores  and establishing more stringent decision making about product offerings 

At the time    before the company knew that these were the right decisions    Schultz said 

Our blueprint for change was the transformation agenda  improving the state of our business through better training  tools and products  renewing our attention to store level economics and operating efficiency  reigniting our emotional attachment with customers  and realigning Starbucks organization for the long term 

This is the fuel for the company s growth now  and will continue to power this restaurant stock through potentially troubling times ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pf-av,2056173
93702,315217,SBUX,Alibaba Roundup  5 Year Targets  Cloud  Partnerships  Ant Stake  Investments ,opinion,"Alibaba   NYSE BABA   announced its 5 year targets  its first ML chip  some partnerships  an investment in Taiwanese AR startup and a NetEase  NASDAQ NTES  unit while the government announced that it would be sending reps 
Long term Targets
At Alibaba s annual Investor Day in Hangzhou  Daniel Zhang the CEO replacing Jack Ma  talked about the company s 5 year target  He said that Alibaba remains as focused on improving the ease of doing business today as laid out in its mission statement 20 years ago 
The annual active consumers have swelled to 860 million  including 730 million in China  as of Jun 30  Alipay annual active users in China number 900 million  There s naturally a lot of overlap  so total consumers from the two platforms are 960 mmillion 
The company  which operates e commerce platforms such as Taobao  Tmall  Freshippo and Tmall Super  is targeting a billion annual active consumers by the end of fiscal year 2024 and annual gross merchandise volume  GMV  of 10 trillion yuan   1 4 trillion  
Increased Government Representation
Hangzhou  a manufacturing hub in the eastern province of Zhejiang  is assigning government affairs representatives to 100 local companies  including private giants Alibaba  beverage giant Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co and automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co 
The move is ostensibly to facilitate communication and expedite projects  as the city government said on its website  This could include oversight of policies and projects so they continue as desired by the government in view of the slowing economy or the prolonged trade war with the U S 
Government involvement at any time and any level is not uncommon in the country  as Paul Gillis  a professor at Peking University s Guanghua School of Management  says  They might be checking whether the Communist party units are working effectively within the companies    While China legitimized capitalism  the level of government influence was never intended to disappear  Occasionally private entrepreneurs forget about this and are reminded of it  
Officials don t usually get involved in operations however  as Alibaba said in a statement   We understand this initiative   aims to foster a better business environment in support of Hangzhou based enterprises  The government representative will function as a bridge to the private sector  and will not interfere with the company s operations  
In the Cloud
Alibaba technology is being used by the United Nations World Food Programme  WFP  to track the magnitude and severity of hunger across 90 countries  as well as food security  nutrition  conflict  weather and a variety of macro economic data  applying machine learning and analytics to the data and creating a hunger map 
Its significance is in the availability of real time data on a global  country and subnational level through advanced data visualization tools  The data is available for anyone free  WFP s goal is to free the world of hunger by 2030 
Separately  Alibaba has announced Hanguang 800  its self developed chip facilitating machine learning tasks to enhance services provided by its cloud computing unit  The chip is used in its product search and automatic translation services  as well as for personalized recommendations on its ecommerce websites  There are no current plans to commercially sell the chip developed by DAMO Academy  an Alibaba research institute  
SAP Partnership
SAP s world leading enterprise cloud solutions  SAP S 4HANA  Cloud and SAP  Cloud Platform are now available on Alibaba Cloud  the data intelligence backbone of Alibaba Group in China  The deal integrates the two companies  SaaS  PaaS and IaaS solutions and provides for the collaborative development of custom solutions to help Chinese companies accelerate their digital transformation 
Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  Partnership
Starbucks  year old  new retail  partnership with Alibaba  that integrates platforms and services of the two companies  was enhanced earlier this month  Now  Starbucks customers in China will be able to order by voice  using Alibaba s smart speaker  Tmall Genie  The Starbucks virtual store is selling a Starbucks themed version of the speaker promising 30 minute delivery 
Equity Interest in Ant Financial
In pursuance of the conditions set forth in a 2014 agreement  Alibaba received a newly issued 33  stake in Ant Financial  which owns Alipay  As a result  it gave up the 37 5  pre tax profit it had been receiving from Ant  Alibaba and Alipay have from the start been operating as two closely intertwined companies that were a part of the same ecosystem  Alipay had been sending customers to Alibaba s ecommerce business  just as the ecommerce business helped create Alipay customers 
This collaboration is likely to get even tighter going forward  Ant Financial also owns Yu e Bao  the world s largest money market fund  and operates Sesame Credit  a third party credit rating system 
Funding Taiwanese AR Startup
Alibaba is leading a new funding round in Taiwanese augmented reality  AR  startup Perfect Corp  and bringing its AR technology to Tmall and Taobao  The startup made the announcement although Alibaba and venture capital firm CCV  which also participated  didn t comment  Financial terms were also undisclosed 
In particular  Alibaba will be using Perfect s YouCam virtual try on technology that will allow users to see how a certain shade of lipstick  eyeliner or makeup will actually look on them before buying 
For Perfect Corp  it s a good deal  because Alibaba is a huge platform  reaching millions of Chinese customers and supporting most major global beauty brands  So the deal increases its scope tremendously 
 This is a classic win win strategic partnership   said Jeremy Choy  head of Asia technology mergers and acquisitions at HSBC Holdings Plc  LON HSBA   who helped work on the tie up   Perfect strengthens its business and network in the important Chinese market and customers gain a better shopping experience  
Jack Ma Passes the Baton
Jack Ma  the man who took Alibaba from inception to the giant it is today  passed over the position to Daniel Zhang  He currently owns a 5 3  stake in Alibaba worth  24 6 billion  This is 10X the value of his 7 4  stake in 2012 valued at  2 6 billion at the time  During his tenure  Alibaba s revenue has surged about 1 100  to 378 8 billion yuan   56 2 billion  in the year ended March 2019 
Buys NetEase Online Mall
Alibaba is taking over Netease s online luxury retail platform  Kaola for  2 billion in cash  Alibaba and founder Jack Ma s Yunfeng will infuse an additional  700 million into NetEase Cloud Music s latest funding round for a minority stake in the company 
Under Alibaba  Kaola will operate independently  but its CEO Zhang Lei will be replaced by Tmall Import and Export general manager Alvin Liu  The deal has been rumored for months but was apparently delayed because of a disagreement of terms  Read more

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks  including AbbVie  ABBV   Starbucks  SBUX  and Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   PSX   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
AbbVie s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry in the past three months  2  vs   3 7    The Zacks analyst believes that AbbVie s key drug  Humira  is performing well on strong demand despite competition 
Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential  AbbVie has been successful in expanding approvals for its cancer drugs  Imbruvica and Venclexta  Moreover  the company has an impressive late stage pipeline comprising products with multibillion dollar potential  expected to be launched in the near term  Meanwhile  the acquisition of Allergan  NYSE AGN   if successful  should diversify AbbVie s revenue base and accelerate its non Humira business 
However  AbbVie s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year  Sales erosion due to direct biosimilar competition to Humira in international markets is a big headwind in 2019  Also  costs to support expected new product line extension launches should hurt profits this year 
 You can  
Shares of Starbucks have gained 37 3  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Food   Restaurants industry s rise of 26 1   The Zacks analyst believes that this momentum will continue as the company reported solid third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings and also raised its full year view 
Notably  earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing five quarters  Robust Americas and CAP comps bode well  The company now anticipates global comps growth of nearly 4   Non GAAP EPS is expected to be  2 80  2 82  up from  2 75  2 79 guided previously  Meanwhile  Starbucks  business is rapidly growing in China  courtesy of innovative store designs and the success of the MSR program 
Also  operating fundamentals such as solid global footprint  successful innovation  best in class loyalty program and digital offerings are encouraging  However  operating margin contraction over the past few quarters has been a concern 
 You can   
Phillips 66 s shares have gained 8 3  in the past six months  outperforming the Zacks Oil Refining and Marketing industry s rise of 1 9   The Zacks analyst believes that Phillips 66 is well positioned to gain from rising demand for midstream assets in the United States  where takeaway capacity constraint is a potent problem 
Precisely  with its oil and gas pipeline network spreading across 21 000 miles  the company is an industry leader in the midstream business  Moreover  Phillips 66 is committed toward returning cash to stockholders through dividend payments and share repurchases  Notably  since inception  the firm has returned more than  24 billion to shareholders 
However  a declining crude utilization rate has hurt refining operations  Also  uncertainties in the global market  owing to more than a year long trade dispute between the United States and China  are likely to hurt demand for petrochemicals and refined petroleum products  affecting the firm s chemical and refining businesses

reports here    AbbVie s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry in the past three months  2  vs   3 7    The Zacks analyst believes that AbbVie s key drug  Humira  is performing well on strong demand despite competition Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential  AbbVie has been successful in expanding approvals for its cancer drugs  Imbruvica and Venclexta  Moreover  the company has an impressive late stage pipeline comprising products with multibillion dollar potential  expected to be launched in the near term  Meanwhile  the acquisition of Allergan  NYSE AGN   if successful  should diversify AbbVie s revenue base and accelerate its non Humira business However  AbbVie s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year  Sales erosion due to direct biosimilar competition to Humira in international markets is a big headwind in 2019  Also  costs to support expected new product line extension launches should hurt profits this year Shares of Starbucks have gained 37 3  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Food   Restaurants industry s rise of 26 1   The Zacks analyst believes that this momentum will continue as the company reported solid third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings and also raised its full year view Notably  earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing five quarters  Robust Americas and CAP comps bode well  The company

Refining and Marketing industry s rise of 1 9   The Zacks analyst believes that Phillips 66 is well positioned to gain from rising demand for midstream assets in the United States  where takeaway capacity constraint is a potent problem Precisely  with its oil and gas pipeline network spreading across 21 000 miles  the company is an industry leader in the midstream business  Moreover  Phillips 66 is committed toward returning cash to stockholders through dividend payments and share repurchases  Notably  since inception  the firm has returned more than  24 billion to shareholders However  a declining crude utilization rate has hurt refining operations  Also  uncertainties in the global market  owing to more than a year long trade dispute between the United States and China  are likely to hurt demand for petrochemicals and refined petroleum products  affecting the firm s chemical and refining businesses     Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Anheuser Busch InBev

93725,315240,SBUX,Starbucks settles New York probe into illegal sick leave policy,news,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters     Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX  agreed on Thursday to pay restitution and accept greater oversight to settle a multi year probe finding that it had illegally required New York City employees to find substitutes when they needed to use sick leave  The settlement with Starbucks  which has changed its sick leave policy  was announced by New York Attorney General Letitia James  New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio and the city s consumer affairs commissioner  Lorelei Salas  It requires the Seattle based coffee chain to pay  176 000 in restitution to employees  a sum that could grow if exhausted  and prominently post educational posters about the city s sick leave law in all city stores  Starbucks must also clearly explain its sick leave policy in to its more than 8 000 New York City employees  and detail its compliance within six months to regulators  The settlement runs three years and could be extended if Starbucks violates it  Starbucks did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Officials said Starbucks violated New York City s Earned Safe and Sick Time Act from April 2014 to February 2016 by requiring employees to find replacements before using sick leave  or else face possible discipline including termination  In January 2018  Starbucks adopted a nationwide policy granting employees one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked  That equates to roughly seven or eight days a year for a full time employee

93729,315244,SBUX,White House hopeful Bernie Sanders raises  34 5 million in fourth quarter,news,"By Simon Lewis
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Bernie Sanders raised more than  34 5 million in the last quarter of 2019  his presidential campaign said on Thursday  the largest three month haul of any Democrat so far in the contest to take on Republican President Donald Trump in a November election 
The announcement  which brings his total fundraising last year to  96 million  appears to confirm Sanders  position as the leading fundraiser in the nominating contest  in which states begin caucusing and voting next month  Some candidates have not yet disclosed their fourth quarter fundraising numbers 
U S  Senator Sanders of Vermont  a Democrat who wants to reduce the sway of corporate America  has built his campaign on small donations  largely through online fundraising from an ethnically diverse and mostly young coalition of supporters 
Campaign manager Faiz Shakir said Sanders   grassroots movement  showed he was he best placed candidate to defeat Trump 
 He is proving each and every day that working class Americans are ready and willing to fully fund a campaign that stands up for them and takes on the biggest corporations and the wealthy   Shakir said in a statement 
Sanders  78  bounced back from a heart attack in early October to win growing support for his platform of expanding government run healthcare  free college and investment in renewable energy paid for with higher taxes on the wealthy 
Sanders said this week that about 1 3 million Americans had donated to his campaign 
His campaign said the most common occupation among Sanders  fourth quarter donors was teacher  and the most common employers were Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   Walmart  NYSE WMT   the U S  Postal Service and  Target   NYSE TGT  
Sanders is polling second in most national opinion polls behind former Vice President Joe Biden 
Pete Buttigieg  the former mayor of South Bend  Indiana   who is polling behind Biden  Sanders and U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts   raised  24 7 million in the fourth quarter  an increase on previous periods 
Republican President Donald Trump  who can raise funds together with the Republican National Committee for his 2020 reelection bid and is therefore able gather larger donations  has raised more than all the Democratic contenders in past periods  pulling in  125 million in the third quarter of 2019 ",2020-01-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/white-house-hopeful-bernie-sanders-raises-345-million-in-fourth-quarter-2051019,2051019
93730,315245,SBUX,Will the Starbucks Rebound Continue in 2020 ,news,"Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  operates the largest chain of coffee shops in the world with 31 000 locations  most of which are company owned  The restaurant stock produced a stellar twelve months for shareholders in 2018  rising from  49 in July 2018 to  99 in July 2019  This momentum was unsustainable  and the stock dropped nearly 20  from its all time high  but some strength in December has driven shares up to  87    poised to close the year up 35   
Starbucks delivered 7  revenue growth in fiscal 2019  driven primarily by 5  comparable sales growth from existing locations  This performance was impressive because the company was able to approach prior levels of growth despite pulling back on new store openings  Starbucks experienced a 63 basis point reduction in operating margin from the prior year  primarily attributable to non recurring expenses related to corporate restructuring and streamlining efforts  Analysts are expecting 8  revenue growth in 2020  with more than 10  earnings growth  which suggests that the market is anticipating sustained high repurchase activity or margin improvement  The chain is forecasting 3  to 4  comparable sales growth and 2 000 new store openings in 2020  and investors are bullish about the opportunity to expand in the Chinese market  

Starbucks carries a rich valuation
The stock trades at a 28 7 forward price to earnings ratio  which is nearly double the restaurant industry average and substantially higher than rival Dunkin Brands   NASDAQ DNKN  23 2  Starbucks has a similar premium based on price to free cash flow and EV EBITDA  though it is slightly cheaper than Dunkin by the latter metric  Starbucks bulls point to the company s superior growth outlook compared to peers such as Dunkin and McDonald s to justify the premium  but the 10 5  forward growth rate is not exceptionally high among restaurants and eateries in general  The stock s 2 7 PEG ratio is high  indicating that growth alone is not sufficient to explain the price premium  
Starbucks pays a 1 9  forward dividend yield for shareholders  which is a nice opportunity to deliver returns independent of market conditions but is ultimately pedestrian compared to other restaurants and eateries  The company s 9 5  buyback yield in 2019 helped drive price appreciation for investors  though this marked an increase from prior years that is unlikely to be sustained  Nonetheless  Starbucks has averaged 4 3  buyback yield over the past five years  so investors should expect to receive some meaningful price support from repurchasing  
Starbucks is operationally sound and financially healthy
The company s dip in operating margin might cause concerns that pricing power is declining or that sales mix is trending unfavorably  These are definitely metrics to monitor because even the adjusted margin for 2019 was multiple percentage points lower than the 18 1  figure delivered in 2016  While this trend might not be the most enticing element of the story  the company s margins are still more than triple the restaurant industry average  This is even more impressive  considering that peers like Dunkin that operate primarily through a franchise model are generally able to achieve higher margins due to the nature of their business  Starbucks  37 4  return on invested capital is excellent  indicating efficient use of financial resources to generate returns for shareholders  Therefore  it would seem that management s operational stewardship is notably strong 
Investors also have little reason to feel concerned about financial health  Starbucks carries just over  11 billion in total debt and negative shareholder equity  which could be a concern if there is a long term decline in operating performance  But the company is currently in a strong position to meet any obligations with a 0 92 current ratio  1 79 debt to EBITDA ratio  and 11 8 interest coverage ratio  Things really have to deteriorate for financial health to become a problem for Starbucks  and the lower floor associated with negative net equity would only be on the table after a precipitous fall caused by declining fundamentals 
Starbucks runs a nice business with a strong global brand  and it seems likely that the company will continue to enjoy above average growth  However  the flaw in the bull narrative is connected to valuations that might not be sustainable or may not leave enough room to the upside  The valuation metrics are not wildly high by any means  but they are on the higher end of reasonable compared to peers  That means that further outperformance is likely to require fundamental support  and any failure to meet growth or profitability expectations could catalyze a decline  Continuation of the margin compression trend could be a problem   pricing power erosion amid difficult global economic conditions could be an issue for a brand that commands premium pricing compared to substitutes  Also  the annualization of 2018 s public relations nightmares will make it harder to sustain its growth rate next year  There might be a better time to get into this story at a cheaper point ",2020-01-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pcfct,2051285

93733,315248,SBUX,3 Ideal REIT Dividends With Growth Up To 170 ,opinion,"Where are you going to find meaningful income to get you through retirement  Not from popular stocks  with the S P 500 paying less than 2   And bonds won t help either  as their yields are in the tank  too 
Instead let s consider real estate investment trusts  REITs   which are tailor made for investors who are at or nearing retirement  Specifically  I d look to dividend growing REITs  like the three I m about to show you  This trio of landlords are on pace to double their dividends in just four years 
How Dividend Growth Can Quickly Double Your Money

Respected healthcare REIT Ventas  NYSE VTR  is the perfect example of how this strategy can do more than provide income  Heck  it can make you as rich as you always wanted to be 
Ventas which invests in all sorts of properties  from senior care to medical offices to even research facilities is the second largest such REIT on the market  It s also one of the most underappreciated growth stories on Wall Street  In its 2001 annual report  Ventas boasted 268 properties across its portfolio  today  it s a healthcare juggernaut with more than 1 200 
The stock has behaved exactly like you would imagine  Since the start of 2002  the S P 500 has put together a 267  total return  Ventas  Almost 10 times that  at 2 310  returns when you include both price gains and dividends 
Ventas Has Run Circles Around the Market




But it wasn t just about the growth  Booming profits fueled a virtuous cycle  Yes  some investors bought in for upside potential  But others were drawn to a rapidly growing dividend that at one point doubled in a five year span 
That s changing  however 
As Dividend Growth Slows  So Too Does Ventas




Funds from operations  FFO  growth has slowed in recent years  and even declined in 2018  The once spry dividend has grown just 9  in total over the past five years  including a mere 0 3  hike this year 
In other words  we want to find ourselves a 2001 Ventas   not the 2019 version 
Flagging Dividends Are a Red Flag

Public Storage  NYSE PSA  also shows both stages of the dividend growth coin  From 2009 through 2016  Public Storage the premier name in self storage real estate could do no wrong  The entire self storage industry was blossoming  Management couldn t hurl cash at shareholders fast enough  The payout more than tripled during this period  and unsurprisingly  that s exactly what the stock did 
PSA s Dividend and Shares Tell the Same Story




But  like with Ventas  shareholders have greeted a slowdown in the payout with diminished enthusiasm  Indeed  Public Storage  NYSE PSA  hasn t touched the dividend since raising it in the final quarter of 2016  and PSA has barely stumbled ahead with subpar three year returns 
Investors Have Cooled on PSA




Beat the  Aristocrat REITs 
Like the S P 500  REITs boast a small group of Aristocrat esque payers that have upped the ante on their dividends every year for at least a quarter century  They re good companies with respectable stocks  but they re not the first place we should look to for dividend growth  because that dividend growth has slowed to a crawl 
Again  we want stocks that look like the VTRs and PSAs of yesteryear  with relatively young but aggressive payout histories and I have three that fit the bill  Just look at this trio s dividend growth  which is absolutely boat racing the  REIT Aristocrats  





These young guns  payouts are expanding at more than three times the rate of REIT royalty like  Realty Income  C NYSE O  and  Federal Realty Investment Trust   NYSE FRT  
And if they can keep this momentum going  they ll double their dividends in four to five years  And when payouts increase by 100  or more  so do the stock prices attached to them 
Extra Space Storage  EXR 
Dividend Yield  3 0 
5 Year Dividend Growth  Avg    13 9 

 Extra Space Storage   NYSE EXR  is picking up where Public Storage left off  There s plenty to love about the self storage space  even now that it s starting to mature  But perhaps its best quality is that it s economically indifferent 
Is the economy booming  Great  Americans are going to buy  buy  buy  until there s no more room left in their homes  necessitating self storage units  Is the economy tanking  That s fine by the likes of Extra Space Storage  Because when Americans downsize  they re not going to want to part with all their things   so they ll pay a few bucks a month to keep it stored until conditions improve 
As for EXR itself  It s the second largest self storage operator in the U S   and it s gained its size by simply hoovering smaller competitors  The company has spent almost  1 billion a year over the past half decade making acquisitions to grow its empire 
Yet somehow  there are profits left over for dividend hikes  Plenty  in fact  EXR has juiced its payout by more than 90  since 2014  Shares have actually managed to outstrip that dividend growth 
Extra Space Storage Bulks Up on Income




Extra Space s current FFO payout ratio is just 73   leaving a ton of cushion for more rate hikes by typical REIT standards  I will point out  however  that dividend growth has begun to slow over the past couple years  dragging down its average  But even if EXR  normalizes  to rate hikes like its 10  bump in 2018  that ll send a strong buy signal to shareholders 
Terreno Realty  TRNO 
Dividend Yield  2 1 
5 Year Dividend Growth  Avg    14 0 

Terreno Realty  NYSE TRNO  is an option for retirement investors who want to get in near the ground floor  This industrial real estate player focuses on coastal markets such as L A   Miami and Washington  D C  It s a relatively young REIT that got its start as a 2010  blank check  IPO a weak offering that was cut twice before finally hitting the markets 
No wonder  given this cloud of mystery surrounding the company  via Reuters  
 It said in a regulatory filing with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission that it has no operating history and has not yet identified any acquisitions  or committed any portion of the proceeds to such acquisitions   It also said it may change its business  investment  leverage and strategies without stockholder approval  Terreno is the definition of a  show me  stock  Well  here s what the REIT has shown so far 
Terreno Shows Us 170  Dividend Growth




Terreno is doing all the things you want to see in a young REIT  It s highly acquisitive  making about  220 million worth of deals in 2018  the company itself is worth just  3 billion   Cash rents on new and renewed leases shot up 19 2  year over year in 2018  FFO surged 19  
My only concern is that 2019 growth has cooled a little bit  FFO from the first six months of 2019 has come in flat compared to last year s midway point 
Still  Terreno seems to have faith in its prospects  The REIT ramped up its payout by 12 5  at the end of July  and it s still only paying out 74  of its FFO via the distribution ample firepower for more 
Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI 
Dividend Yield  3 1 
5 Year Dividend Growth  Avg    26 3 

I ve previously highlighted  of telecom infrastructure REIT Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI   which has more than tripled its payout over the past half decade  But there s another aspect of the story that s important to CCI s dividend growth future 
That payout is young 
You see  Crown Castle  NYSE CCI  went public in 1998  but it didn t start paying dividends until 2014   the year it converted to a REIT structure  And unlike many untested things  young dividends tend to be awfully safe  because the company is only really starting to dip its toe into profits to pay it out 
You can see it all over Wall Street  Consider the first five years of relatively recent dividend payers Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   They doubled  and in Cisco s case  tripled their quarterly dividends within five years and had oodles of room to spare 
New Dividend Payers Don t Waste Any Time




Meanwhile  Crown Castle  NYSE CCI  is paying out just 77  of FFO as dividends  which again is extremely low by REIT standards  And FFO growth seems a lock too  given the importance of telecom to everyday life  not to mention the continued rollout of new technologies such as 5G 
Those two factors combined should help Crown easily reach its stated target of 7  8  annual dividend growth  if not exceed it 
This  Perfect  Portfolio Will Quadruple Your Retirement Income
I see potential in each of three dividend payers above  But there s one vital factor that retirement planners especially those close to or already in retirement desperately need that they don t have 
High headline yield 
Even at their breathtaking dividend growth rates  it could take each of these stocks anywhere between four and 10 years to hit the kind of payouts you need to sustain your lifestyle with dividend income and without decimating your nest egg 
You need stocks that already fit the bill  like the dividend dynamos in my 
The old retirement model is broken  The vast majority of so called income experts frequently point to 2   to 3  yielding blue chip stocks that will never pay the amount of money you need  In fact  unless you re sitting on a massive pile of cash  or you re willing to wait 30  40  or 50  years  it s mathematically impossible for you to retire rich  wealthy and financially free by following their outdated advice 
Times have changed  You need far more income  for far longer  than people needed 20 or 30 years ago 
My  can deliver exactly that  In fact  if your current holdings look like the industry standard  this portfolio can literally double  triple or in some cases quadruple your annual income 
No tricks  No crazy options techniques that will blow up in your face overnight 
Just under the radar  against the radar income plays that can quickly build your wealth without piling on extra risk 
Too good to be true  Look at this strategy s past 10 years of returns  and you ll see why this portfolio deserves the  perfect  name 
What really makes this group of stocks stand out is that it s so much more than high headline yield  This portfolio checks off a bundle of vital retirement boxes 
It gives you a safe  secure  and steady income of  10s of thousand per year in cash not just  paper gains  It pays out more than enough to live on from dividends without drawing down your savings or assets You avoid overly complex  high risk investments that can wipe out decades of hard earned money in a matter of weeks or months You re not involved in any risky options  spread bets  or day trading It s simple to set up and simple to manage  That way you re not glued to your screen all day  Go out  Enjoy life  Your check ll be in the mail Don t lie awake anymore worrying about your yo yo ing net worth  Instead  let me teach you more about this incredible strategy  including its dominant track record  In fact  I ll even let you hear it from the mouths of other investors that have reaped market smashing gains from my research service

 Reuters    Wall Street edged lower on Wednesday as President Donald Trump s threat to  substantially  raise tariffs if China did not make a trade deal with the United States as well as escalating tensions in Hong Kong kept investors away from riskier assets 
Trump on Tuesday dangled the prospect of completing an initial deal with China  soon   but offered no new details on negotiations and largely repeated well worn rhetoric about China s  cheating  on trade 
Technology stocks had lifted the benchmark S P 500  SPX  and Nasdaq  IXIC  to all time highs in the run up to Trump s speech on Tuesday  but the indexes pulled back slightly after his address at the Economic Club of New York

The trade sensitive industrial sector  SPLRCI  was also among the biggest drags  while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0 87  
Heightened tensions in Hong Kong also dulled sentiment after police warned violence related to anti government protests had reached a deadly level and that the Asian financial hub had been pushed to the  brink of a total breakdown

93761,315276,SBUX,Factbox  Nestle CEO Mark Schneider s top deals over the past three years,news," Reuters    Mark Schneider  Nestle s  S NESN  first outside chief executive officer in almost a century  has made big strides in positioning the world s largest food company for the future with aggressive deal making since taking over in January 2017 
He has set a vision on selling premium products in fast growing categories such as pet food and coffee  while disposing businesses in the slower growth areas of lunch meat and chocolate 
The 54 year old German American has promised to replace as much as 10  of Nestle s existing portfolio with products of the moment by the end of 2020  under pressure from activist investor Dan Loeb  who through his investment firm Third Point took an about  3 billion stake in Nestle in 2017

93762,315277,SBUX,The Reason Stocks Will Soar In The Next 20 Months,opinion,"A reader asked me last week if it s time to head for the exits 
There s a lot of fear in the markets right now  Folks are nervous  Maybe you re nervous 

The past two weeks have been rough for the stock market  The S P 500 recently suffered its worst day of the year  And stocks have now dipped 4  since hitting record highs in late July 
If you watch any financial TV  you ve surely heard this blamed on a troubling economic signal triggered last week called the  inverted yield curve  
I ll tell you in a moment why it s actually a good sign for stocks  But before that  let s clarify what the inverted yield curve is  and why it matters to you 
What the Heck Is an Inverted Yield Curve 
If you ve applied for a mortgage  you know the two most popular options are a 15 year mortgage or a 30 year mortgage 
The interest rate you ll pay on a 15 year mortgage is lower than what you d pay on a 30 year one 
Which makes sense  right 
With the 30 year mortgage  you re borrowing the bank s money for twice as long  So you must pay a higher rate 

It s the same with the interest rates that the U S  government pays on its bonds 

99 9  of the time  the longer out a bond goes  the higher rate it pays  A 10 year bond almost always pays higher interest than a  2 year bond 

But on Aug  14  the interest rate on the 10 year U S  bond sunk below the interest rate on a two year bond 
This  upside down  situation is what investors call an inverted yield curve 

A Reliable Sign That Something Is  Off  with the U S  Economy
It s rare for the yield curve to invert  It s only happened nine times in the last 50 years 

It last happened in January 2006  Roughly two years later  we entered the 2008 financial crisis  U S  stocks cratered 57  in  08  09 
More bad news  Every time the yield curve has inverted in the last 50 years  a recession has eventually followed 

Recessions are bad for stocks  Since the 1920s  U S  stocks have sunk into a  bear market  10 times  Eight of the 10 have come inside a recession 
Also a Reliable Sign Stocks Will Go Up
It s important to know the yield curve inversion typically warns of a recession  years in advance  From the time the yield curve first inverts  a recession hits 20 months later  on average 
Twenty months is a long time  And in those 20 months after the yield curve inverts  stocks usually perform well 
The last time the yield curve inverted in 2006  the S P crept up 22  before the onset of the financial crisis 

The time before that  in 1998  stocks soared 55  before peaking  And the Nasdaq jumped a crazy 210  to form the infamous dot com bubble 
Not only is there a long lag between this signal flashing red and stocks topping out  You could say a yield curve inversion is a  buy  signal for stocks  at least in the short term 
If the Economy Is in Bad Shape  Explain This to Me 
Although the yield curve inversion is a reliable signal  it s at odds with the  real  economy 
Look at these stock charts of five  everyday  American companies 
If the economy is on shaky ground  these companies should be struggling 

After 20 straight quarters of rising sales  America s largest retailer  Walmart Inc  NYSE WMT   recently hit all time highs 





Fast food giant McDonalds  SA MCDC34  is looking better than ever 





If we re in an economic danger zone  why are tens of millions of folks paying  6 for luxury coffee at Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  




Credit card giant Visa  V  keeps zooming higher 





And new highs in  Home Depot  Inc  NYSE HD   suggest more Americans are renovating their homes than ever before 




If the economy is about to hit the rocks  why are these stocks hitting all time highs 
If a meltdown is coming  somebody forgot to tell the hundreds of millions of Americans who shop at these places 
Here s What I m Doing with My Money Right Now
Many investors assume they only have two choices now that the yield curve has inverted 
1       Sell all their stocks and park the cash in their bank accounts 
2       Or hang on and hope the next recession doesn t wipe them out 
This  all or nothing  mentality is a rookie mistake 
There is a better way 
Don t panic  PREPARE 
Prepare by committing to disciplined risk management with each stock you own  Any investor can do this by using  stops  
As you may know  a  stop  is a predetermined price at which you ll sell a stock  Say you buy a stock at  100  and put a 20  stop on it  If the stock falls to  80  you sell immediately  No questions asked  and no second guessing the decision 
Used correctly  stops keep any losses small while allowing your winners to ride 
That way  if US markets continue to perform well  your nest egg will keep growing 
And if markets turn down tomorrow  your stops act like a  circuit breaker  for your portfolio 
They ll get you out before a stock loses too much ground 
Let Me Be Clear
The yield curve inversion is a  red flag  to take seriously 
It s one of the most reliable indicators of a recession there is  It s definitely not a good thing 
It would be irresponsible to ignore it 
But as I said  20 months is a long time  The average person has about 35 working years  or 420 months  to build wealth through investing 
Twenty months represent around 5  of your investing life     
 
Are you willing to squander 5  of your investing life 
To park your money on the sidelines until a potential recession comes and goes 
With scary headlines swirling  that might  feel  like the safe  prudent thing to do 
But the data are clear  For the next twenty months or so  we re in an environment where it has historically been good or great to own stocks  especially disruptor stocks

93797,315312,SBUX,In the Future  We Will All Work in Food Service,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Of the 128 000 new nonfarm payroll jobs created in October  according to today s employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  47 500 were at food services and drinking places  While that 37  share was anomalously high  the sector has been a major driver of job gains for this entire expansion  Of the 20 million new jobs created since employment bottomed out in February 2010  3 million  or almost 14   have been at food services and drinking places  much higher than their 8  share of employment  The restaurant employment boom  seemed to be fizzling in late 2017  and definitely proceeded at a slower place for most of 2018 and earlier this year  But now it seems to be gaining strength again 
The continued rise of food services employment says something encouraging about the current business cycle  Regardless of some weakness this year in manufacturing and oil and gas  and worries that the longest ever expansion might finally be fading  Americans in general are still going out for meals and drinks   and restaurant and bar owners are still hiring workers to serve them 
Over the longer haul  the rise of the restaurant tells several different stories  not all of them so encouraging  For example  employment at food services and drinking places hasn t passed employment in manufacturing yet  but seems destined to overtake it before long 
Food services jobs don t pay as well as factory jobs or offer as regular hours  average weekly earnings in October were  389 in the former   1 198 in the latter  Minimum wage laws and other policy efforts may be able to raise that pay somewhat  but there are limits because productivity growth in the sector is so slow  Since 1990  real output per hour worked has risen 10  at food services and drinking places  and 116  in manufacturing  A shift away from making stuff to providing services and experiences is perhaps inevitable in a wealthy  maturing economy  but it does pose challenges for maintaining economic growth and broadly shared prosperity 
The rise of restaurants also signals a change in how we get our food  Overall spending on food has declined a lot as a share of disposable income since the 1920s  according to the U S  Department of Agriculture  But restaurants have actually been taking a growing share of our paychecks over time  and thanks to them the overall food share has barely budged over the past decade 
This is isn t just about restaurants  of course  Full service restaurants remain the biggest employer in the food services sector  with limited service ones  e g   fast food and fast casual  a close second  and together they accounted for more than 81  of the food services and drinking places jobs gains since February 2010  But the fastest growth has come at what the North American Industry Classification System refers to as snack and nonalcoholic beverage bars  a category that likely  the BLS never says  includes national chains such as Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and Smoothie King as well as the locally owned coffee shops and juice bars one now finds in  virtually every American downtown  1 
Microbreweries that serve drinks and even food generally aren t included here  because they re counted as manufacturers  but they re clearly part of this phenomenon as well  Employment at breweries  wineries and distilleries was up 103 300  or 144   from February 2010 through September  and small establishments where customers often show up in person have driven most of those gains 
Feeding and serving drinks to people outside of their home has been a business for an awfully long time  but it also appears to be a major 21st century growth industry

93799,315314,SBUX,310  Upside  A 12 9  Dividend And A Yield Curve Strategy You Won t Believe,opinion,"Here s the funny thing about the inverted yield curve talk we re getting hit with lately  most people are looking at the wrong numbers 
I m going to show you how we savvy dividend investors can jump on this mistake to bag total returns of 69  and up fast  First  here s what I mean when I say investors are looking at the wrong numbers 

These days  all we hear about is the yield curve inversion we ve seen a couple times over the last few weeks  where the yield on the 10 year Treasury note fell below that of the 2 year 

It s certainly worth paying attention to  because the inversion of the 10  and 2 year Treasury yields does predict recessions though the timeline tends to be around 18 months and maybe even longer than that 
That s far too long for you to sit on a mattress loaded with cash and miss out on gains  and dividends   
These  Inverted  Yields Delivered a 310  Return

This is where the  other  inversion I want to show you today comes in  I m talking about the  inversion  between the yield on the 10 year Treasury note and the yield on the average S P 500 stock 
And that ignored indicator is telling us one thing  buy  Especially if you re after stocks with fast growing dividends  Check out this chart 
Cash in on the  Other  Yield Inversion




We re looking at the yield on the 10 year  blue line  and the yield on the average S P 500 stock  orange line  since the financial crisis  And you can see that  from time to time  the blue line wanders below the orange line 
If you d bought in any of those periods  during the 2008 financial crisis  in 2012  2013 and 2016   you d be sitting on big gains today 

Say you bought the benchmark SPDR S P 500 ETF  SPY  NYSE SPY   stocks at our first  inversion   in November 2008  You d now be up 310   including dividends   Heck  even if you held off till the start of our last  inversion   in January 2016  you d have bagged a nice 67  total return in about three and a half years 
As you can see at the end of that chart  the  inversion  has swung our way again  with the 10 year s yield at a three year low positioning stocks for another leg up 
How We ll Play This Unusual Indicator for Big Gains  and Dividends 
The logic behind this indicator is simple  as the yield on the 10 year falls  investors go hunting for higher income  which leads them to dividend stocks  Then  as they buy  they drive stock prices up and dividend yields down 
And remember  this happens even with the pathetic 2   or less  dividend the typical big cap name dribbles out  You ll do better if you grab a stock whose payout is growing at an accelerating pace 
That s because these payout hikes are a shiny lure to investors looking for income  As they dive in  they drive these stocks  prices up  tick for tick  with the dividend 
How Our  Inverted  Yields Ignited a Fast 69  Gain 

To give you a sense of the gains available  consider the last time our yields  flipped   back in mid January 2016  I pounced  recommending CoreSite Realty Corporation  NYSE COR   a real estate investment trust  REIT  that owns data centers  in the March issue of my Hidden Yields service  which I d launched a few months earlier 
It was the perfect bait  even though CoreSite only yielded 2 6  when I recommended it  its dividend had exploded 308  in the a little over five years since the REIT s IPO 
In other words  due to that payout growth  folks who bought COR when it started trading in September 2010 were already yielding 12 9  on their money 
A Runaway Dividend




Our  inverted  yield buy paid off  when we exited our position just under three years later  CoreSite s dividend had soared another 108   and we d bagged 68 9  in gains and dividends  crushing the market in the process 
Income Seekers Snap Up COR




And we weren t done yet 
This  Inverted Yield Curve  Buy Tripled the Market s Return
By July 2016  the gap between the yield on the 10 year fell further below the typical S P 500 yield than it had in years  That summer  the average S P 500 stock looked like a dividend investor s dream compared to the 10 year  with a 2 1  yield  compared to the long bond s 1 4  
 Even though 2 1  only gets you  21K in dividends a year on a million bucks less than your local Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  barista makes   but I digress  
The takeaway  income seekers were getting desperate 

That was the perfect setup for Packaging Corporation of America  NYSE PKG   the lowest cost producer of containerboard  which is used for packaging everything from food to your latest Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  order  making it a perfect  pick and shovel  play on e commerce  
PKG yielded more than CoreSite when I rolled it out as my Hidden Yields pick in July 2016  at 3 1   Better still  management had boosted free cash flow by 171  in the preceding five years a gain they dutifully handed over in dividends  with the payout surging 175  in that time 
Our play on the ultra wide spread between the 10 year yield and the average stock dividend paid off  when we sold PKG just 14 months later  we d bagged a 65  total return tripling the market s gain 
PKG Laps the Market Twice 




That brings us to today 
With the yield on the 10 year plunging below the S P 500  the best move you can make is buy dividend growth  Because if there s one thing we can count on  it s this  as long as so called  safe  investments pay less than inflation  fast growing payouts will be in high demand 
Zero in on those stocks with accelerating payouts backed by soaring cash flows and you ll be well on your way to doubling your nest egg  and your income stream  fast 
7  Yield Curve  Buys to Double Your Nest Egg and Triple Your Income
You know me  I ve got 7 perfect buys for our new  inverted yield curve   7  hidden  stocks I ve handpicked to pay you a reliable 15  a year in gains and dividends 
That s enough to DOUBLE your money every 5 years 
Imagine turning a retirement  pot  of  250 000 into  500 000  or  500 000 into  1 million  And on it goes 
Plus  these 7 dividend wonders are growing payouts at an accelerating pace  That sets you up to earn 10   13   even 15  yields on your initial buy in just a few years just like the lucky folks who bought the CoreSite IPO did 
And even if the market does take a tumble  these stocks  soaring dividends give you downside insulation as more yield seekers spot their surging income streams and buy in  eager to hedge their own downside with dividend cash

93821,315336,SBUX,Republicans see impeachment backfiring  Democrats fear they may be right,news,"By Gabriella Borter  Brendan O Brien  Andrew Hay and Zachary Fagenson  Reuters    Having his morning coffee and cigarette outside a Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  in one of the most politically contested counties in the United States  Richard Sibilla recoils at the memory of President Donald Trump s election  But impeach him now  Sibilla can see little upside    After this he has a much better chance of winning another election  as scary as that sounds   said Sibilla  39  a resident of Pinellas County  Florida  who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016   It s not even worth following because it s all going to help him    Alarmed by a whistleblower s revelations that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the 2020 Democratic presidential front runner  former Vice President Joe Biden  Democratic leaders of the U S  House of Representatives this week launched a formal impeachment inquiry into the Republican president  Among the public  interviews with more than 60 voters across four of the most important counties in the 2020 election showed Republicans largely confident the impeachment process will backfire and Trump will win re election  Democrats  on the other hand  are worried they may be right  Marc Devlin  a 48 year old consultant from Northampton County  Pennsylvania  said he expects the inquiry to  incense  supporters of the president   This is my fear  that it will actually add some flame to his fire with his base   he said   I just fear  party over country    Throughout the 2020 election cycle  Reuters is monitoring voters in four areas that could determine the outcome of the Nov  3 presidential contest  Pinellas County  Florida  Maricopa County  Arizona  Northampton County  Pennsylvania  and Racine County  Wisconsin  Given the sharply divided electorate and the rules in America s state by state races that determine the winner in the Electoral College  those four states will be among the most targeted by presidential candidates next year  Public opinion has time to shift before voters cast their ballots next November  But for now  the prospect of impeachment has done little to sway opinions  largely formed along party lines  according to the interviews and polling   A Reuters Ipsos poll taken on Monday and Tuesday showed 37  of respondents favored impeaching the president versus 45  who were opposed  That 37  figure was down from 41  three weeks earlier and down from 44  in May  after the release of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller s report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election   I don t think he did anything wrong   said Joe D Ambrosio  78  who runs a barber shop in Bethlehem  Pennsylvania  and cheers Trump s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration  Lee Snover  chair of the Northampton County Republican Committee  said she felt the impeachment inquiry was the latest instance of the Democrats using unfair tactics to try to take Trump down  It showed  she said  how disconnected Washington s politicians are from the country   I have not had one Republican crack or say they re turning or going the other way  They re laughing it off  I think it s going to help him   said Snover  50  That sentiment was shared at a meeting of College Republicans United at Arizona State University on Wednesday   They have this idea that everyone is siding with them  that Trump is an impeachable president  when really it s only a minority   Rose Mulet  19  said of the Democratic leadership in Congress   It s not a reflection of the general public    Moreover  odds of impeachment succeeding are long  None of America s 45 presidents have even been removed that way  Though the Democrats control the House of Representatives  where they need a simple majority of votes  the Senate  controlled by Republicans  would have to vote with a two thirds majority to remove the president from office  That reality has only frustrated Democrats angered by what they see as a string of offenses by Trump  from bragging about grabbing women by the genitals to Mueller s conclusion that Trump interfered with his probe   I am enraged   said Barbara Lebak  a 66 year old librarian who was working her way through a crossword puzzle from a bench in Racine County  Wisconsin  Like Lebak  fellow Racine County resident David Ferrell  56  said he saw multiple reasons to impeach Trump  including what he called the president s hardline policies on immigration and inflammation of race relations   What has taken so long  It should have been done long ago   said Ferrell   I m voting for a Democrat  no matter who it is   While polls and interviews suggest most voters are solidly entrenched  some  like Chris Harman  have been swayed  Harman  52  who works in sales and marketing in Maricopa County  said he voted for Trump in 2016 but will not in 2020  He said the president had already committed impeachable offenses even before the Ukraine scandal erupted    It should have been done a long time ago   Harman said as he left a baseball game in Phoenix   I m not voting for Trump  I tried it  it was a grand experiment  but I m not going to try it again

93826,315341,SBUX,Starbucks Pays Farmers  20 Million More as Coffee Crisis Deepens,news," Bloomberg       Starbucks Corp     NASDAQ SBUX  is giving farmers a cushion against the blow of tumbling coffee prices  a move that could also protect supplies of the high quality beans the company needs 
The world s largest coffee chain operator paid over 8 000 farmers in Mexico  El Salvador  Nicaragua and Guatemala a premium totaling  20 million  according to Michelle Burns  senior vice president of global coffee and tea at Starbucks  That s on top of the regular amounts it pays over futures prices for specialty arabica beans  she said 
With prices falling below production costs in many countries  shielding those who produce the beans the company purchases is especially important for Starbucks  Growers from Colombia to Mexico are struggling to compete with ever rising output from top producer Brazil  where a weaker currency has meant many farmers there are still making money 
 When we looked at what the cost of production was across the range of countries  it was clear that the Latin American countries had a serious situation in hand   Burns said in an interview   When a premium specialty arabica coffee of the highest quality    the arena that we play in    has been impacted  with historically low coffee prices at around  1  there are many countries where that s not sustainable living  
As Brazilian output kept expanding  futures fell this year to their lowest in more than a decade on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures U S  exchange and are hovering around  1 a pound  The cost of production in Central America is at least 30  higher than in Brazil  according to Carlos Mera  an analyst at Rabobank International Ltd   a lender to the agriculture industry 
The global coffee crisis has already brought producers together  with countries calling on roasters to pay a fair prices  Colombia even considered dissociating its coffee sales from futures traded in New York  Prices are unlikely to significantly recover without intervention given the potential for increased low cost production in Brazil  Jeffrey Sachs  professor of economics at Columbia University  said in a report this month 
With a global oversupply hanging over the market  Starbucks said it remains committed to taking further action for the 2019 20 season that started Oct  1  The company also helps farmers through its nine support centers and a plan to give out 100 million trees by 2025 so growers can replace their aging and diseased plants  So far  almost 32 million trees have been distributed 
Market Correction
 The desire would be that the market has some correction  That would be the ideal state   Burns said   If the coffee crisis on pricing continues  we will look at both what we do on the financial side as well as our continued work with what we do with trees  
Even when the company doesn t buy directly from farmers  it asks traders to disclose how much the grower was paid  That helps it determine whether additional payments are needed  Starbucks wants to ensure that farmers cover their costs and make at least a small profit  according to Burns  The firm s purchases account for 3  of global coffee production and 40  of high quality specialty arabica beans 
The coffee industry has seen significant consolidation with closely held investment firm JAB Holding Co  spending more than  30 billion buying companies including Peet s Coffee  Keurig Green Mountain and Caribou Coffee  Nestle SA  SIX NESN  and Italy s Lavazza have also jumped on the bandwagon  With increased competition  industry executives say there s been a focus on cutting costs and buying cheaper beans 
Flavor Profiles

93830,315345,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Starbucks  SBUX   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 18 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  99 72 in the previous session  Starbucks has gained 53 9  since the start of the year compared to the 22 4  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 31 7  return for the Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 25  2019  Starbucks reported EPS of  0 78 versus consensus estimate of  0 72 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 07  
For the current fiscal year  Starbucks is expected to post earnings of  2 81 per share on  26 35 billion in revenues  This represents a 16 12  change in EPS on a 6 62  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 13 per share on  28 33 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 55  and 7 48   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Starbucks may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Starbucks has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 35 3X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 28 6X versus its peer group s average of 12 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 75  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Starbucks currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Starbucks fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Starbucks shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Starbucks Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Starbucks have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including J  Alexander s Holdings  JAX   Noodles    NDLS   and The Habit Restaurants  HABT   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 38  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Starbucks  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-sbux-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200446353,200446353

93848,315363,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  Q3 Earnings And Revenues Top Estimates,opinion,"Starbucks  SBUX  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 78 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 72 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 62 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8 33   A quarter ago  it was expected that this coffee chain would post earnings of  0 56 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 60  delivering a surprise of 7 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Starbucks  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry  posted revenues of  6 82 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 07   This compares to year ago revenues of  6 31 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Starbucks shares have added about 40 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Starbucks 
While Starbucks has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Starbucks was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 70 on  6 63 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 78 on  26 25 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

93875,315390,SBUX,Philippine fast food specialist Jollibee hungry to expand in U S   China,news,"By Neil Jerome Morales and Martin Petty MANILA  Reuters     Jollibee Foods  Corp  PS JFC   the Philippine fast food specialist known for fried  Chickenjoy  and chopped hotdogs in sweet spaghetti sauce  is doubling down on expansion plans in the United States and China that are likely to include more M A  Helped by the purchase of California based Coffee Bean   Tea Leaf in July and having taken full control of Denver based Smashburger in 2018  it wants to earn 30  of its revenue in the United States in a decade s time  executives told Reuters  It is also aiming to lift revenue in China to 30  of overall sales  while the Philippines would fall to 30   That would represent a major rejig of revenue streams for Jollibee  which ranks No  4 among Asia s listed quick service restaurant firms  and would build upon plans to cut its reliance on its domestic market to 50  of sales in the  medium term   Prior to its acquisition of Coffee Bean  the Philippines accounted for 73  of sales while the United States represented 15  and China 12    We want to spread our portfolio and risk   Jollibee CEO Ernesto Tanmantiong said in an interview   There s huge opportunity out there    Jollibee  which is valued at  4 8 billion and has 16 brands or franchises to its name  aims to have six brands each in the United States and China  just as it does in the Philippines  In the U S  market  it currently has five including its namesake Jollibee restaurant chain and a minority investment in Tortas Frontera  run by Michelin starred chef Rick Bayless and which offers Mexican inspired sandwiches at just three outlets in Chicago s O Hare airport  It has three brands in China   the Dunkin Donuts franchise  as well as the Yonghe King noodle and Hong Zhuang Yuan congee restaurant chains   GRAPHIC  Jollibee  The little bee that could     TRUSTING ONE S GUT Jollibee likes to acquire quite small  loss making firms at low prices and turn them around  It receives business proposals frequently but acquisitions are more often stumbled upon during one of Chairman s Tony Tan Caktiong long food tasting trips than sought out through bankers   Most of the acquisitions resulted from Tan Caktiong eating in a restaurant  liking the food and asking  who runs the place     said Erwin Elechicon  former chief of Jollibee s international operations  That was the case with Tortas Frontera  Tan  also founder of the company and brother of CEO Tanmantiong  had eaten one of its sandwiches at the airport  While noting they tend to buy small  Jollibee executives say they are open to any type of acquisition if the food is good   But they acknowledge their immediate focus is on turning around Smashburger and Coffee Bean   both loss making and bigger than Jollibee s usual acquisitions with  210 million spent on Smashburger and Coffee Bean costing  350 million including debt  Investor concerns that Jollibee is overextended were exacerbated by first half profit sliding by a third to 2 66 billion pesos   51 million  due to losses at Smashburger and deliveries problems with its Red Ribbon Bakeshop  Its stock has lost 18  since late July when it announced its purchase of Coffee Bean   It would be better for them not to do another acquisition at least of this scale until Smashburger and CBTL become profitable   said Renzo Louie Candano  analyst at DBP Daiwa Capital Markets in Manila  Jollibee believes  however  that it has not overreached  Nor is it concerned that any of its targeted markets are saturated or that it might not be able to compete with the likes of Starbucks  O SBUX    Every restaurant in the Philippines has fried chicken  in Vietnam there are maybe 10 coffee shops on every block  In the midst of all of this competition  there s always a standout one or two   said Chief Financial Officer Ysmael Baysa   How are you going to do it  Our formula is very simple  Offer the best tasting food at the right price and you re going to make it   He noted that Coffee Bean had a strong presence in Southeast Asia and the Middle East  regions where coffee culture still has a lot of room to grow and that its Highlands Coffee stores in Vietnam logged revenue growth of around 32  last year  It has also taken on big chains before  Not long after Jollibee  originally an ice cream parlor  started selling burgers in 1978  friends advised Tan Caktiong and his brothers to quit  warning the imminent arrival of U S  giant McDonald s  N MCD  in Philippines would decimate Jollibee s six branches  Undeterred  the firm took on McDonald s by surrounding each big branch with smaller Jollibee outlets  and measuring the U S firm s sales by counting trash

93900,315415,SBUX,U S  Growth Slows to 2 1  as Trade Tensions Weigh on Businesses,news," Bloomberg       U S  economic growth slowed in the second quarter by less than forecast as consumer spending topped estimates  though weaker business investment and exports underscored the risks spurring the Federal Reserve toward an interest rate cut next week 
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2 1  percent annualized rate  according to Commerce Department data Friday that topped forecasts for 1 8   That follows an unrevised 3 1  advance in first quarter and updated data showing growth last year was slower than previously reported 
Consumer spending  the biggest part of the economy  increased 4 3   while government spending climbed 5  and offered the biggest boost in a decade  Nonresidential investment fell 0 6  for the first drop since 2015 and residential decreased for a sixth straight period 
The mixed report highlights how President Donald Trump    who s repeatedly called for lower interest rates    is enjoying signs of a solid economy while his trade war with China weighs on the expansion and fuels uncertainty for global businesses  Revised data released Friday showed the economy missed Trump s 3  growth goal in 2018  after previous data had showed it matching 
Friday s report showed fresh evidence that trade is weighing on the expansion as exports dropped 5 2  while imports rose just 0 1   Overall growth on a year over year basis slowed to 2 3   the weakest pace in two years 
Economic Risks
The report on the broadest measure of all goods and services comes as Fed is expected to cut interest rates next week by a quarter point  The GDP report isn t likely to sway that outcome  though officials are likely to consider the weakness in trade and corporate investment as risks to the economic outlook 
Excluding the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP  final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a 3 5  pace  the best in a year  Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand  Inventories were a drag on growth  subtracting 0 86 point from growth after a 0 53 point contribution in the prior period 
The Fed s preferred underlying inflation measure  the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy  firmed to a 1 8  annual pace in the quarter  closer to policy makers  2  objective 
The expansion  which this month became the longest on record  is cooling as the effects of the 2018 fiscal stimulus fade and global growth slows  with the International Monetary Fund again cutting its estimate earlier this week  A stronger dollar and new tariffs are also making it less desirable to do business with the U S 
Other data have highlighted the cooler pace of growth  with manufacturing figures showing tepid conditions and bellwether  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   reporting a lackluster second quarter  A U S  measure of production has declined in consecutive quarters  the common definition of recession  while a gauge of global factory activity contracted in May and June 
Orders Gaining
A more upbeat report Thursday showed business equipment orders jumped in June by the most since early 2018  signaling company investment may be regaining momentum that would help support the economy in coming months 
Consumer sentiment is near historical highs and robust spending is backstopping growth  Retail sales have advanced for four straight months  the longest streak since early 2018  indicating Americans are benefiting from a tight labor market and elevated wages  Coffee chain  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   on Thursday said U S  comparable store sales soared 7  from a year earlier 
Trump targets growth of about 3   though economists see the pace of growth remaining under 2  through at least the end of next year  Revised GDP figures released Friday show 2 5  growth on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis last year  That compares with a previous estimate of 3  and an upwardly revised 2 8  in 2017  the first year of Trump s presidency 
Government spending got a boost from a 15 9  surge in federal nondefense expenditures  which contributed the most in two decades to growth  That was boosted by delayed compensation for some federal employees after the government shutdown that ended in January

93902,315417,SBUX,Walmart faces pressure to stop gun sales after latest U S  mass shootings,news,"By Nandita Bose and Melissa Fares  Reuters    Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc said on Monday there has been no change in its policy on gun sales after two mass shootings over the weekend  including one at a Walmart store  left 31 people dead in Texas and Ohio  Years of public pressure led Walmart  the largest U S arms retailer  to end assault rifle sales in 2015 and in 2018 to raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21  Some gun control activists and Walmart customers now want the retailer to drop sales of guns and ammunition altogether  The weekend shooting in Texas unfolded at a popular Walmart store in the border city of El Paso  killing 22 people  In the other weekend mass shooting  in Dayton  Ohio  a gunman killed nine people  Many people took to social media to post about the deadly shooting using the hashtags  walmartshooting     boycottwalmart   and   guncontrolnow   Guns Down America  an advocacy group that runs campaigns for gun control  began a petition to urge more change at Walmart late on Monday  The petition calls on Walmart to stop selling firearms  pledge it will no longer make contributions to lawmakers who take money from gun rights lobby the National Rifle Association  and fund gun buybacks  It also pushes Walmart to use its political influence to advocate for legislative changes to raise the standards for gun ownership in America    Federal legislative change will take time  but more and more Americans are dying every day   Igor Volsky  founder and executive director of Guns Down America  told Reuters   The El Paso shooting happened in their store  they have a responsibility to go further   It is not the first time that gun control advocates have signed a petition calling on Walmart to take action  In early 2013  just one month after a gunman in Newtown  Connecticut  shot dead 20 first graders and six adults at an elementary school  nearly 300 000 people signed a petition urging Walmart to stop selling assault weapons  It was another two years before Walmart ended such sales   A REASON TO BOYCOTT WALMART  Other gun control activists such as Texas Gun Sense President Ed Scruggs said Walmart  whose stores act as de facto community centers in rural America  could do more to educate children and teenagers on gun safety  A group called Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America said it has been asking Walmart to stop letting shoppers walk into its stores with guns   even where doing so is permitted by law   Target   NYSE TGT  and Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  have policies asking shoppers not to carry firearms in their stores   On Twitter  one Florida based user said Walmart needs more security  Another user  from Irvine  California  said Walmart s statement outlining that it would not change its gun policies in the wake of the two shootings over the weekend was  shocking    If this isn t a reason to boycott Walmart  I don t know what is   the user tweeted  Some celebrities also demanded more action from the retailer   Hey  Walmart  This would be a great opportunity for you to take a true leadership position and stop selling guns   actress Alyssa Milano said in response to a Walmart company tweet saying it was  in shock  over the tragic events in Texas   For now  Walmart s policies remain unchanged  A Walmart spokesman on Monday told Reuters the retailer has not made any change in its firearms sales policy after the mass shootings and that it has not issued a directive to any stores around the country to change policy   Our focus has always been on being a responsible seller of firearms   spokesman Randy Hargrove said   We go beyond federal law  requiring all customers to pass a background check before purchasing any firearm    The retailer s chief executive  Doug McMillon  offered his support to the community of El Paso and reached out to employees via Instagram on Sunday   I can t believe I m sending a note like this twice in one week   he said  referring to an earlier message he sent after two employees were shot by a co worker in a store in Mississippi  Walmart s gun safety policies are more restrictive than many retailers  even as it trails some of its rivals  Walmart rivals like Kroger owned Fred Meyer stopped selling guns and ammunition in 2018 and the same year  Dick s Sporting Goods ended the sale of assault weapons and raised the minimum age to 21 for gun purchases   In March 2019  Dick s also said it would pull guns and ammunition off the shelves of 125 of its 720 store  a decision the company said it took because its gun sales were down due to competition from dedicated gun and hunting stores  That same month  in a call to discuss earnings  the company s chief executive  Ed Stack  said lower sales during the quarter were partly driven by lower demand for  anything associated with hunting   including guns  ammunition  firearm accessories and hunting apparel  Despite such measures from the larger chains  the sale of guns and assault style weapons continues unabated  Outdoor goods chains including Bass Pro Shops  Gander Outdoors and Academy Sports continue to sell assault style rifles  A proliferation of online retailers like AIM Surplus  Armslist and Brownells also sell firearms that can be easily procured   
Armslist called the shootings  horrific  and said in a statement it is a service that does not directly sell guns  but carries ads and listing for private sales  The other companies did not respond to a request for comment ",2019-08-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/walmart-faces-pressure-to-stop-gun-sales-after-latest-us-mass-shootings-1946009,1946009

rate cut this month  The rally continues despite lingering trade conflict While Fed s willingness to cut rate    popularly known as Fed put    is likely to boost investor sentiment  Wall Street is also facing an immediate concern of a negative earnings session for the second quarter of 2019  Can Fed put be strong enough to overcome a possible decline in second quarter earnings  thereby maintaining Wall Street s momentum seen so far in 2019 Bleak Expectations From Second Quarter EarningsAt present  the market is anticipating a negative earnings session for the second quarter of 2019  As of Jul 10  total Q2 earnings for the S P 500 Index are expected to be down 3 3  from the year earlier period on 4 0  higher revenues  This would follow the 0 2  earnings decline on 4 5  higher revenues in Q1 If the current consensus estimate for the second quarter proves itself true  then it will be two consecutive quarters of earnings decline for the S P 500  Technology  Aerospace  Basic Materials  Construction and Conglomerates sectors are likely to witness double digit decline in second quarter earnings    Read More  Previewing the Q2 Earnings Season Wall Street Hit Record High on Fed s Rate Cut SignalOn Jul 10  in a testimony to the House Financial Services Committee  Fed chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank s commitment to act as appropriate to sustain U S  economic expansion  giving a clear message of a rate cut possibility in the upcoming FOMC meeting scheduled on Jul 30 31 At present  100  respondents of CME FedWatch are expecting a 25 basis point reduction in interest rate in July  Consequently  the Dow crossed the 27 000 level for the first time on Jul 11  The S P 500 touched the 3 000 mark for the first time and Nasdaq Composite also recorded a fresh all time high Although Powell said in his congressional testimony that U S  business investment  housing investment and manufacturing output have weakened considerably  it was primarily due to crosscurrents of trade tensions and weak global growth  The Fed chair noted that the U S  jobs market remained robust and consumer spending may have rebounded in the second quarter of 2019 Can Fed Put Boost Investors  Confidence According to Sam Stovall  chief investment strategist at CFRA   the S P 500  since World War II  has risen 10 3  on average in the six months after the Fed starts cutting rates  and then 14  by the end of the first year  However  the U S  China trade conflict is very much alive and in second quarter earnings reports  the market will see the magnitude of decline in corporate profits due to tariff war and slower global growth On the other hand  Fed s rate cut will not only make cheaper funds available to businesses and stock market investors  but also

93905,315420,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Starbucks  SBUX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This coffee chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 7  
Revenues are expected to be  6 68 billion  up 5 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 13  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Starbucks 
For Starbucks  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 32  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Starbucks will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Starbucks would post earnings of  0 56 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 60  delivering a surprise of  7 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Starbucks appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-sbux-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200441373,200441373

93929,315444,SBUX,P G  Starbucks  Great Retirement Stocks  But Is Now A Good Time To Buy ,opinion,"Dividend stocks  in general  have had a great rally in the first half of this year  Investors have flocked to high quality income names as they sought shelter amid widespread warnings of imminent recession or economic slowdown 
Though that danger is still lurking large  the gains of the first half have made many popular dividend stocks expensive to buy if you re starting to build your retirement portfolio  These are the two top names to consider buying when the next dip comes 
1  Procter   Gamble
Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  is one of those dividend stocks that retirees love  The world s biggest consumer product company is also one of the largest dividend payers in the sector 
The maker of Dawn dish soap and Pampers has hiked its dividend for 62 consecutive years  Over the past 128 years it has never stopped paying dividends  making money even during recessions  wars and droughts 
But if you want to add this stock to your portfolio now  the timing may not be right  After surging more than 22  on a total returns basis since January  P G s valuations don t look quite so compelling  The consumer staple giant s 2 7  dividend yield is much lower than its four year average of 3 4   while its price to earnings multiple of 26 52 is getting close to the highest in five years 

That being said  some analysts still see a lot of value in PG stock  Goldman Sachs  last week  upgraded the giant  saying the stock still offers a  potential double digit return  opportunity 
 We believe there is a role in investors  portfolios for a large liquid global staples company such as this and note that PG remains the most underweight U S  listed mega cap global consumer packaged goods company among mutual funds   Goldman said in a note to clients 
The investment bank boosted its rating to  buy  from  neutral   and also raised its 12 month target price to  125 a share  P G closed around  111 49 yesterday after rising 0 9 
2  Starbucks
Investor enthusiasm about Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX  doesn t look like it ll die down anytime soon  The maker of popular Frappuccinos and pumpkin spiced lattes hit another record high yesterday after jumping more than 70  in the past one year  gaining around 1 1  through the session to close at  85 51 
This powerful momentum is being fueled by the company s upbeat forecast for 2019 coupled with visible signs that its turnaround efforts are being effective  For the quarter that ended in March  the world s largest coffee chain reported numbers that came in much stronger than the market expectations 

This performance is extraordinary for a mature restaurant operator in an environment where costs are escalating  competition is intensifying  and consumers are seeking healthier options than sugary Frappuccinos 
Starbucks  powerful comeback this year shows that the chain is winning back coffee drinkers   not only in its home markets  but also in China  a country that s taken center stage in the company s growth strategy  Indeed  its further expansion is very much dependent on international success as well as restructuring at home  which is crucial to meet customers  changing needs 
If you don t own Starbucks already  this may not be the right time to start building a position  But If this stock goes through a pullback for whatever reason  you shouldn t hesitate to start buying it  Starbucks is an attractive buy and hold candidate for retirees  especially with its hefty dividend growth  that s currently yielding just 1 72   and a share buyback plan 
Bottom Line
Both P G and Starbucks are dependable consumer staple companies which fit perfectly in any retirement portfolio aimed at generating passive income during the golden years  Retirees can rely on them in both good and bad times  Both companies have a wide moat  recurring cash flows and a history of rewarding their investors 
If you ve bought these stocks  there s no reason to panic and sell  If you re a new investor  it would be better to wait on the sidelines after their massive jump this year  They should be on your shopping list when the next opportunity comes along ",2019-07-03,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pg-and-starbucks-are-2-great--retirement-stocks-but-is-it-a-good-time-to-buy-200436641,200436641

93932,315447,SBUX,Is Starbucks  SBUX  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Starbucks  SBUX  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this coffee chain a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Starbucks is 16 1   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 15  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 4 4  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Starbucks is 14 6   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Starbucks  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Starbucks a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Starbucks is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-07-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-starbucks-sbux-a-solid-growth-stock-3-reasons-to-think--yes--200439299,200439299

93952,315467,SBUX,China s Centurium Capital raises over  2 billion from GIC  Temasek  others,news,"By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG  Reuters    China s Centurium Capital  a big backer of domestic startup Luckin Coffee  said it has raised more than  2 billion in its debut fund  giving the private equity firm more firepower to cut deals involving the world s second largest economy 
The firm  co founded by the former head of Warburg Pincus Asia Pacific  David Li  said in a statement on Wednesday that Centurium Capital Partners 2018 L P  raised the sum in U S  dollars 
The fund secured strong interest from global investors  known as limited partners  LPs   such as pension funds  sovereign wealth funds and funds of funds  it said 
Investors in the fund include Singapore s GIC Pte Ltd  GIC UL  and Temasek Holdings  TEM UL   Canada s Ontario Teachers  Pension Plan  China Investment Corp  CIC  and U S  pension fund Washington State Investment Board  said two people with direct knowledge of the matter 
Centurium and Temasek declined to comment  All the other investors didn t respond to requests for comment 
The U S  dollar fund will help Centurium invest in Chinese firms that use overseas structures such as variable interest entities 
Centurium joins several China focused private equity and venture capital managers who raised  17 3 billion in dollar denominated funds in the first half of the year  versus  13 billion over the same period last year  according to data provider Preqin 
Launched in March 2018  Centurium s maiden fund reached the first close of nearly  1 billion three months later and has beaten the  1 5 billion and  1 98 billion fundraising targets since then 
BESPOKE SOLUTIONS
Beijing based Centurium was set up in early 2017 by Li and two other partners  Li had worked with Warburg Pincus for 14 years and led several investments for the U S  buyout firm in China  including in top car rental service provider CAR Inc 
 After helping several entrepreneurs fulfill their entrepreneurial dream for so many years  I also have my dream of launching our own  investment  firm   Li told Reuters 
Centurium primarily seeks control and significant minority investment opportunities across China s consumer  services and healthcare sectors where it looks to boost operational efficiency and tackle structural deficiencies 
 The Chinese business environment nowadays needs a new generation of investors that combine the global PE best practice and local experience   Li said 
 Instead of being a pure capital provider  firms like Centurium can better integrate with local markets and be more efficient and responsive to provide bespoke local solutions to new challenges and opportunities faced by Chinese entrepreneurs  
Centurium began to gain recognition last year when it made a big bet on Luckin Coffee  the Chinese challenger to  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   It invested about  180 million in Luckin in the startup s first two fundraising rounds 
Li said that Centurium has invested about 40  of the capital raised in the debut fund in five firms in China and aims to fully deploy the fund by the end of next year

93953,315468,SBUX,Colombia proposes coffee nations group to provide bigger influence on market,news,"CAMPINAS  Brazil  Reuters    Colombia proposed on Wednesday that coffee producing nations form an association to have a stronger influence in the coffee market  as producers from around the world meet in Brazil to discuss the economic sustainability of coffee production 
 We need action  because the problem is clear  there are 25 million coffee producers that can barely cover their production costs   said Eugenio Velez  a director at Colombia s coffee federation in the opening ceremony of the 2nd Global Coffee Producers Forum 
Velez suggested that countries at the forum  which include representatives from Central and South America  Asia and Africa  join forces to try to impose some sort of supply limitations as a way to boost prices that farmers consider inadequate 
Coffee prices reached the lowest levels in 12 years in May  They recovered somewhat  but are at levels considered historically low and below production costs 
Farmers in the forum criticized roasters  saying they continue to sell processed coffee at high prices  paying less to producers each year 
Economist Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University in the United States presented a study on the situation of coffee farmers globally  suggesting the creation of a global fund to finance improvements both in production and social conditions 
Sachs suggested that governments in producing nations  international donors and large coffee processors in developed countries such as Nestle  JDE  Lavazza and Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  help finance the fund 
 Coffee is clearly a very profitable business for roasters  but it is not working to produce sustainable development  so there is a puzzle   Sachs said 
He said the fund could improve agricultural yields  as a way to reduce production costs  and at the same time improve living standards in producing countries 
Organizers of the forum said they will take the proposal to presidents of producing countries to start up a movement toward creating the fund 
The Colombian proposal on the association of producing countries  however  is less likely to advance 
Brazil  for example  which is the world s largest producer  is not a supporter 
 We had that in the past  and it didn t work   said Jos  Marcos Magalhaes  one of the forum organizers  referring to the International Coffee Agreement that fell apart in the 1980 s 
Magalhaes believes producers need to have better knowledge of how the market works  to be able to make better deals when prices spike ",2019-07-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/colombia-proposes-coffee-nations-group-to-provide-bigger-influence-on-market-1920226,1920226

 I do think we have bigger problems than plastic straws   he told reporters on the White House South Lawn prior to leaving for a weekend in New Jersey 
On a 96 degree day  Trump warmed to the subject 
 You know  it s interesting about plastic straws  So  you have a little straw  but what about the plates  the wrappers  and everything else that are much bigger and they re made of the same material   he pondered 
 Everybody focuses on the straws   There s a lot of other things to focus on   he added 
Trump s comments coincided with the launch of Trump branded plastic straws on his online store at  15 for a pack of 10   Much like most liberal ideas  paper straws don t work and they fall apart instantly   his campaign said 
Plastic straw bans and restrictions have been proposed or enacted in U S  cities including Seattle  Los Angeles  Miami and New York City as part of a growing movement to reduce single use plastics such as cutlery  cups and bags

93972,315487,SBUX,Sparkly unicorn ice cream  Kroger s bid to win grocery wars,news,"By Emma Thomasson and Richa Naidu BERLIN CHICAGO  Reuters    Kroger  NYSE KR  Co has room to improve on sales and is looking to its Deluxe Unicorn Swirl ice cream and other store brand products to boost growth  Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said on Thursday  Multicolored  sparkly ice cream is an unlikely battleground in U S  grocery stores  But  Kroger Co  believes trendy house brand items like Unicorn Swirl will help it win market share from Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc  Aldi and Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN    We know we can do better when it comes to identical sales results   McMullen told analysts after Kroger posted quarterly same store sales below Wall Street estimates  sending its shares down 2 5    The grocer s store brand business was one of its most powerful tools  McMullen said   Kroger s own brand sales for the quarter rose 3 3   Unicorn ice cream  pork belly bites and artesian jerky were among 219 new store brand items that boosted sales by  225 million  By churning out new house brand items  Kroger hopes to tap into broad sales growth for private labels  The push comes as grocers compete fiercely on price and race to expand online ordering and delivery  an area where the biggest U S  grocery chain has lagged  Kroger added 1 022  own brand  items in 2018  and each supermarket on average stocks more than 15 000 private label products such as pet food  clothes  furniture  meal kits and office supplies  Kroger s 16 house brands account for more than 30  of unit sales  the company said in March   We don t see this slowing down at all   McMullen had told Reuters in a separate interview in May  Cincinnati based Kroger has long made store brands that compete with name brands from Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  Co  Nestle and others  But it started focusing more on its own brands in 2012 and flagged them as key to reviving sales growth when introducing its  Restock Kroger  plan two years ago  Graphic on store brand growth   Kroger s Simple Truth line hit  2 3 billion in annual sales to become the biggest U S  natural and organic brand  the grocer said in March  Sales of its Kroger range and premium Private Selection food line are also growing  with the total own brand portfolio expanding 45  since 2011    Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX  kicked off the unicorn food craze in 2017  sparking a social media frenzy with its pink and blue Unicorn Frappuccino  Breakfast cereal and cake followed  and  Target  Corp  NYSE TGT  launched a cherry flavored Unicorn Magic ice cream last year   Kroger debuted its cake batter flavored Unicorn Swirl in March  and saw more than 2 5 million likes and shares on social media for the product on National Unicorn Day on April 9    Kroger has been very clever about expanding into rapidly growing categories   said Neil Saunders  who heads retail consultancy GlobalData  highlighting brands like Simple Truth and Home Chef meal kits  Simple Truth has likewise benefited from a social media boost  Kayla Schneider  28  a vegan receptionist and beauty advisor from Fenton  Michigan  has 11 000 Twitter followers and earlier this year tweeted when Simple Truth vegan ice cream went on sale   I have a lot of followers who also share my type of diet and I like sharing new finds yummy products so they can try them out as well   Schneider said in a Twitter direct message  Almost half of Kroger s private label grocery lines  including bakery and dairy items  are produced in its 37 plants  giving it an advantage when it comes to creating and testing out items  Kroger makes more in house than other U S  retailers  with Walmart outsourcing all store brand production until very recently  when it opened a dairy in Indiana  retail consultant Roger Davidson said   They  Kroger  are very serious about private label and in my opinion better than any consumer goods company in the U S    said Davidson  who used to oversee food procurement at Walmart   Big CPG companies are really struggling   he said  referring to consumer packaged goods makers   Kroger has been looking for ways to claw back market share from Walmart  the world s biggest retailer  and German discount chain Aldi  It also has to grapple with Amazon s fast growing private label sales  both online and in Whole Foods   MARGIN PRESSURES Soaring

93973,315488,SBUX,Illycaffe chairman says open to partnership to expand cafe network,news,"By Francesca Landini
MILAN  Reuters    Italian premium coffee maker illycaffe is open to a strategic partnership to help accelerate the growth of its retail network and could consider selling a minority stake for the first time in its 86 year history  Chairman Andrea Illy told Reuters 
The group wants to expand its network of branded cafes at home and abroad  especially in the United States where bigger rivals like Starbucks  O SBUX  and JAB are jumping on a trend away from regular coffee bars toward high end cafes 
Illycaffe   which serves up 7 million cups of its brew in restaurants and cafes each day   has 219 illy branded outlets outside Italy  including 23 in North America 
In comparison  Seattle based Starbucks has around 14 000 U S  outlets and recently unveiled a new up market  roastery  in New York  JAB owns several chains  including hipster favorite Intelligentsia Coffee  with well over 10 000 U S  stores 
In a phone interview  Illy said the premium roaster had so far used a cautious approach to expanding retail outlets globally  with 20 openings every year  net of closures 
 If we find a traveling companion who knows the retail industry very well we could speed up growth   Illy said  adding a partner with a U S  expertise could be valuable 
 We are bombarded with proposals from investors and banks     if the right partner shows up we could even open up our capital to let them get a return on their investment   he said  adding the group could sell a  small slice  of its equity 
The remarks by Illy  grandson of founder Francesco Illy  hint to a potential shift in the future for the company  which is 100  owned by the family s holding company  In October  Andrea Illy poured cold water on the idea of selling a minority stake 
BOARD OVERHAUL
Matthew Barry  senior beverages analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International  said illycaffe needed to look beyond its home turf which was small and slow growing 
The premium brand of illycaffe  which produces a blend made by nine varieties of Arabica beans  gives it an edge over rivals  the analyst said 
 Though pretty crowded  I think it is easier for Illy to distinguish itself  in the U S   coffee shop business since its offerings are very different than a Starbucks  a Dunkin  or an independent third wave shop   Barry said 
Illy made clear the roaster was not in need of financial support and would not open its capital to private equity firms or competitors  such as JAB  with which the group signed a licensing deal on pods last year 
No concrete talks with a partner were under way  he said  adding that  with or without an ally  the company would open up more to attract talent from outside the founding family 
To meet this goal  illycaffe recently overhauled its governance  appointing seven directors who are not family members to its 10 member board  Six of them are independent 
Illy also set up a board committee on sustainability issues and the group plans to become carbon free by 2033 
 Sustainability is an endless effort embracing all our activities  from the lamp bulbs to the cars we use   Illy said 
The group posted sales of 483 million euros   545 million   up 5  at constant exchange rates in 2018  Adjusted core profit rose 10 7  to 75 3 million euros ",2019-07-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/illycaffe-chairman-says-open-to-partnership-to-expand-cafe-network-1915350,1915350

The officers had visited the store on July 4 and had paid for the drinks  before one company employee approached them about a customer not feeling safe because of the police presence  the Tempe Officers Association said on Twitter 
 This treatment of public safety workers could not be more disheartening  While the barista was polite  making such a request at all was offensive   the association added 
Following the incident  users took to Twitter to support the police  tweeting comments along with the  boycottstarbucks hashtag 
In an apology  addressed to the Tempe Police Department and posted on its website  Starbucks said the treatment of the officers was  completely unacceptable  
 On behalf of Starbucks  I want to sincerely apologize to you all for the experience that six of your officers had in our store on July 4   Rossann Williams  NYSE WMB   the coffee chain s executive vice president  wrote 
 What occurred in our store on July 4 is never the experience your officers or any customer should have  and at Starbucks  we are already taking the necessary steps to ensure this doesn t happen again in the future

94031,315546,SBUX,Starbucks s Chinese Rival Markets IPO at Discount to Peers,news," Bloomberg     Luckin Coffee Inc  quickly grew to become China s second biggest coffee chain with generous promotions that made its brews much cheaper than  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   Now it s also selling stock at a discount to rivals 
The price range for Luckin s initial public offering values the company at 9 times to 10 2 times the company s estimated 2021 earnings  assuming a so called greenshoe option is exercised  That s less than half the valuation of Starbucks  which trades at 22 5 times that year s forecast profit 
Luckin also looks cheaper than Dunkin  Brands Group Inc   whose closing price Tuesday translates into 21 3 times on that basis  Gourmet Master Co   which owns the 85 C bakery and cafe chain  is trading at 13 7 times in Taipei  data compiled by Bloomberg show 
The lower valuation could be due to Luckin s short track record    it only started operations in October 2017  While it had 2 370 stores at the end of March  it s continuing to spend on growth and hasn t yet turned profitable  Luckin made a net loss of 572 8 million yuan   85 million  for the three months ended March  more than quadruple the same period a year earlier  according to a regulatory filing  Net revenues surged 37 fold to 478 5 million yuan 
Luckin s IPO price range implies an enterprise value of 1 36 times to 1 56 times its estimated 2020 sales  including the greenshoe option  the deal terms show  It s seeking to raise as much as  510 million from the base offering 
The company operates a cashier less business  where customers place orders from a mobile app and pay with electronic wallets  Luckin calls it a  technology driven new retail model   as it gathers customer behavior from the app and relies more on smaller pick up stores instead of the streetfront locations with expansive seating offered by Starbucks

94035,315550,SBUX,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Mastercard  PayPal  Thermo Fisher  Starbucks And Simon Property,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   May 7  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Mastercard   NYSE MA    PayPal   NASDAQ PYPL    Thermo Fisher   NYSE TMO    Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   and Simon Property Group   NYSE SPG   
Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  
Top Research Reports for Mastercard  PayPal and Thermo Fisher
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Mastercard  PayPal and Thermo Fisher  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see all of today s research reports here    
Buy ranked Mastercard s shares have increased  31 1  in the past year  significantly outperforming the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry s rally of  18 6   Mastercard s first quarter earnings beat expectations and increased year over year 
Solid results were led by higher switched transactions  increase in cross border volume and gross dollar volume  and gains from acquisitions  partly offset by an increase in rebates and incentives  The Zacks analyst thinks the company is poised for growth  given its solid market position  ongoing expansion and digital initiatives  and opportunities from the shift toward electronic payments  Its numerous acquisitions have aided revenue growth 
However  escalating costs will put pressure on margins  Also  in order to gain customers and new business  Mastercard has been incurring quite high levels of costs under rebates and incentives  which remains a concern  Nevertheless  its strong balance sheet enables business investment  thereby driving growth 
Shares of Buy ranked PayPal have outperformed the Zacks Internet Software industry in the past year   50  vs   26    PayPal reported mixed first quarter results with earnings surpassing expectations and falling short  However  both top line as well as bottom line reflected year over year growth on the back of benefits from investment in MercadoLibre and increasing customer engagements on PayPal s platform 
Further  robust Venmo and One Touch contributed well  Additionally  rapidly rising net new active accounts boosted growth in the company s total active accounts  Growing momentum of the company s core peer to peer also acted as a tailwind in accelerating its total payment volume 
The Zacks analyst thinks the weak eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  performance remains a headwind for the company s total payment volume  Further  negative impacts of sale of the U S  consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony are risks to the company s top line growth 
Thermo Fisher s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Instruments industry in the past three months   14 7  vs   2 6   Thermo Fisher ended first quarter 2019 with adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing expectations  The Zacks analyst thinks the company is demonstrating strength in all end markets categorized by customer type or geography 
In the quarter  the company registered solid international performance with strong growth in Asia Pacific including China  Also  a series of product launches aided its performance  The company s recent purchase of Brammer Bio  operating in the field of Gene and Cell Therapy  provides cause for optimism 
This apart  the purchase of Gatan should boost electron microscopy suite  Even after considering the impact of impending divestiture of its Anatomical Pathology business  the company s 2019 guidance looks encouraging 
On the flip side  Thermo Fisher s operating segments are getting impacted by unfavorable business mix  Competitive headwinds and escalating costs pose a threat

94036,315551,SBUX,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Starbucks  SBUX ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Starbucks  SBUX   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Starbucks currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if SBUX is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this coffee chain holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For SBUX  shares are up 0 77  over the past week while the Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 4  compares favorably with the industry s 0 46  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Starbucks have risen 10 69   and are up 36 83  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 6 81  and 9 91   respectively 
Investors should also take note of SBUX s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  SBUX is averaging 6 931 059 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with SBUX 
Over the past two months  14 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost SBUX s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 72 to  2 78 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  11 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that SBUX is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Starbucks on your short list ",2019-05-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-starbucks-sbux-200419659,200419659
94037,315552,SBUX,Starbucks Nears Max Move Level,opinion,Shares of Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  continue to make new all time highs  hitting a high of  78 57  However  this is nearing a maximum move if you look at the monthly chart and draw a trend line starting in 2005 and connecting to the 2015 high  The trend line extends out and finds the current price just a shade below that  This tells us that Starbucks is near its maximum before the next strong pull back  Upside potential should be  80  then look for a strong sell back to  70  Pro traders are looking to short this in the coming days ,2019-05-09,Gareth Soloway,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-sbux-nearing-max-move-level-200419248,200419248
94038,315553,SBUX,Is Bitcoin s Next Stop  9 000 ,opinion,"Over the last 5 days  the price of Bitcoin has soared by 31  or  2 000  At the time of writing  the benchmark cryptocurrency trying to catch on above  8 200  On the intraday charts  it is clearly seen how exceeding the threshold levels of  7 000 and  8 000 caused a wave of profit taking  but pretty quickly it was ended up by the new wave of purchases  The return of public interest was so intense that previous levels of consolidation were simply swept away  Given this dynamic  the next stop could be level at  9 000 and local peaks of May 2018 at  9 500 

FOMO  fear of missed opportunities  has returned to the market  as retail investors became the real driving force behind this dynamic  Nevertheless  it must be remembered that in addition to optimism and patterns similar to the 2017 rally  many new participants appeared on the market  who firstly benefited from pushing the market to the bottom  and then it would be profitable for them to sell at highs 
It is equally important that growth not only increases but also widens  actively engage altcoins in the rally  Since May 10  the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has grown by  47 billion  Over the past 24 hours  the XRP token shows the most significant growth by 21  to  0 38  Probably  the coin attracts demand due to the low price  while market participants remember it at a price of around  4  Ethereum  ETH  and Bitcoin Cash  BCH  add 10  and 12   respectively  At the moment it is difficult to find a cryptocurrency in the red zone  The Bitcoin domination index has grown in recent days  reaching 60   however  it gave back some gains to 59 2  

The cherry on the top was the news that Amazon s Whole Foods now accepts Bitcoin  BTC   Ethereum  ETH   Bitcoin Cash  BCH  and Gemini Dollar  GUSD   This made possible by the partnership of the Winklevoss twin project Gemini with payment start up Flexa  In addition to Whole Foods  people can spend their digital currencies at Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   Baskin Robbins  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   and others  It should be noted that so far there were no  leaks  about the project  and the launch took place exactly at the right moment  heating the growth impulse  Whether it is a coincidence or not  the twins won t tell  but they are pushing the entire crypto sector to integrate with the real world ",2019-05-14,Alexander Kuptsikevich,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoin-is-the-next-stop-at-9000-200421073,200421073

94056,315571,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Starbucks  SBUX   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  78 4 in the previous session  Starbucks has gained 21 2  since the start of the year compared to the 20 5  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 18  return for the Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 25  2019  Starbucks reported EPS of  0 6 versus consensus estimate of  0 56 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 04  
For the current fiscal year  Starbucks is expected to post earnings of  2 78 per share on  26 24 billion in revenues  This represents a 14 88  change in EPS on a 6 16  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 09 per share on  28 2 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 37  and 7 48   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Starbucks may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Starbucks has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 28 1X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 22 5X versus its peer group s average of 11 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 19  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Starbucks currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Starbucks fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Starbucks shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Starbucks Stack Up to the Competition

94086,315601,SBUX,China s Starbucks Challenger Files for U S  IPO,news," Bloomberg     Luckin Coffee Inc   the ambitious startup that is challenging  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   in the race to dominate China s growing coffee culture  filed for a U S  initial public offering 
The Beijing based company applied to list American depositary shares on Nasdaq under the ticker LK  The coffee unicorn is said to plan to raise around  300 million in the IPO  Bloomberg News reported in February  Last week  Luckin raised  150 million from BlackRock  NYSE BLK  and other investors at a valuation of  2 9 billion 
Luckin is spending millions of dollars a year opening outlets to unseat Starbucks as China s top coffee company  Since its inception in June 2017  Luckin has quickly expanded into 2 370 stores in 28 cities  with backing from investors including Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte and China International Capital Corp  By the end of this year  Luckin aims to become the largest coffee network in China in terms of number of stores 
Starbucks  which entered China 20 years ago  has dominated the market with more than a 50 percent share in 2017  The company has more than 3 700 outlets in the country and is also expanding at break neck speed  opening a new store roughly every 15 hours  It s aiming to have 6 000 sites in China by 2023 
China may become an increasingly important market for coffee retailers due to the country s low per capita consumption of the beverage and rising middle class affluence  Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote in January  Coffee consumption is estimated to grow by roughly 3 percent a year through 2023  according to Euromonitor 
Luckin  with a focus on convenience and affordability  is seeking to lure urban office workers who don t need the big plush spaces offered by Starbucks  Many customers are initially attracted to the coffee chain by its free vouchers  and the company plans to keep investing heavily in discounts and deals 
Fast Delivery
Luckin s outlets are cashless and designed for fast pick up as well as delivery  with an app that rushes out deliveries in about 18 minutes  The company has a partnership with internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd  Starbucks only launched delivery in August  under a partnership with  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd 
Chasing the entrenched rival has been costly  Xiamen based Luckin said it s burning through  130 million a year and may continue to see losses in the future  The company reported a net loss of  241 3 million for 2018  on total revenue of  125 3 million 
 Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN    Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   CICC  and Haitong International are the underwriters for the IPO  Luckin plans to use proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may including store expansions

94098,315613,SBUX,Big Coffee Has a Problem as Craft Roasters Cut Out a Middleman,news," Bloomberg     Jeff Bezos isn t coming to Long Island City anymore  but the future of small batch coffee roasting may already be taking root there 
About a mile north of the site that Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   abandoned for its proposed New York City campus  a tiny coffee roasting co op is welcoming anyone from cafe owners to hip consumers wanting to prepare their own green beans  Regalia s model  which lets customers rent time at its roasting machines  is attracting a wave of trendy Americans looking to ditch the traditional brands that have long dominated the coffee scene in favor of specialty beans and a more artisan cup of joe 
 The visions and the goals of the coffee roasters and the visions and goals of a cafe or bakery owner didn t always align   said Paolo Maliksi  one of the owners of Regalia   We are here to make sure that anyone can come in and roast for whatever reason  
Maliksi and other small batch roasters are at the forefront of a trend that has spilled over from the beer industry  Much like the boom in U S  craft breweries  more and more coffee shops are now roasting their own beans from New York to Chicago to Seattle  The shift away from mass produced coffee lets discerning cafe owners tell caffeinated customers exactly where their beans came from    something sustainability minded clientele increasingly care about 
 5 Coffee
The trend toward self roasting is good news for the millennial cafe goer concerned about where food comes from and who isn t deterred by prices that can be more than double that of a drip coffee at  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   A sign of a more plugged in consumer  it s helping reshape America s coffee industry  where Folgers and Maxwell House once ruled 
The rise of self roasting has been helped by online commerce and social media  which allow newcomers to establish their brands and give roasters an outlet to connect with customers 
Rabobank says roasting shops alone aren t yet a major threat to Big Coffee  but as young consumers move away from traditional brands  that s forcing the old guard to adapt  JM Smucker Co   for example  has rolled out a new line of coffee called 1850 intended to attract younger drinkers who wouldn t think to pick up a pound of sister brand Folgers  Last month  Maxwell House owner Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  Co  took a  15 4 billion writedown on assets in a stunning acknowledgment that changing consumer tastes have destroyed the value of some of the company s most iconic products 
 If this eventually scales up and it takes over more grocery stores  it could be a bigger risk to a large industrial roaster   said James Watson  a beverages analyst at Rabobank  Big brands like Maxwell House are stagnating  Euromonitor data show   and in general there s a move towards smaller batches  more specialty coffee and roasting to match that   he said 
Machine Makers
While big brands may be squirming  the shift to small batch roasting is a boon for the makers of roasting machines  especially as models have grown smaller and cheaper  Bellwether Coffee makes a roaster that s the size of a standard fridge  70 percent smaller than typical models 
At Regalia  where the main coffee roasting machine is affectionately called  Big Mama   a cafe roasting 1 000 pounds a week can save more than  200 000 a year by buying and roasting green beans  instead of purchasing roasted ones  the co op estimates 
Some of the top coffee traders are also adapting their business models to supply the exotic origins and micro lots these specialized shops need  Buyers are looking for smaller batches than traditional 60 kilogram bags and some beans    usually those used in competitions    are so expensive that they are transported by plane  instead of the 20 foot containers that dominate the global coffee trade 
 The equipment has become more available  more accessible   said Rich Futrell  who oversees sales in the U S  Midwest for Genuine Origin  a unit of coffee trader Volcafe  which which operates an Amazon like website for specialty roasters and ships its beans in 30 kilogram cartons delivered via UPS 
 Graphic design  information and knowledge have become more accessible  but green coffee is still traded the way it s been traded for a long  long time   he said 
One way traders are pulling off the gear shift is through M A  Neumann Kaffee Gruppe  the world s largest coffee trader  bought a majority stake in Atlas Coffee Importers in Seattle and Olam International acquired East African coffee specialist Schluter SA  Sucafina  another coffee trader  invested in specialty coffee merchant 32cup 
 It absolutely opens the doors for new ways of doing business   said Cory Bush  managing director of 32cup   Smaller specialty roasters are forcing importers and traders to become more responsive  When people are buying smaller quantities of anything  I think they expect to buy them in the same way they buy stuff from Amazon or their online grocers  We are having to find new platforms and new approaches to sell to people the way they want to be sold to  
Niche Industry
To be sure  specialty coffee is a niche industry and there are still no precise figures on what percentage of the global market it accounts for  Still  Americans report drinking more and more gourmet coffee  A survey carried out by the National Coffee Association earlier this year showed that gourmet s share of all coffee consumed reached a record 61 percent in 2019 
At Regalia  which opens to the public for a few hours every weekend  a filtered cup of coffee might go for anywhere from a few dollars to  10 a pop  depending on what was roasted recently  That s a lot for a coffee in the slightly grittier part of Long Island City  which is more known for the warehouses that house and clean the city s halal meat carts than for the glass high rise apartment towers shooting up in other parts of the neighborhood  But it s not insurmountable 
 You can buy a good cup of coffee for  3 and a great cup of coffee for  5  we are not talking about the difference between buying a Honda Civic and a Ferrari  NYSE RACE    32cup s Bush said   Choosing the better option is not going to fundamentally change your household economics  ",2019-03-14,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/big-coffee-has-a-problem-as-craft-roasters-cut-out-a-middleman-1807440,1807440

94102,315617,SBUX,Big Coffee Has Problem as Craft Roasters Cut Out a Middleman,news," Bloomberg     Jeff Bezos isn t coming to Long Island City anymore  but the future of small batch coffee roasting may already be taking root there 
About a mile north of the site that Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   abandoned for its proposed New York City campus  a tiny coffee roasting co op is welcoming anyone from cafe owners to hip consumers wanting to prepare their own green beans  Regalia s model  which lets customers rent time at its roasting machines  is attracting a wave of trendy Americans looking to ditch the traditional brands that have long dominated the coffee scene in favor of specialty beans and a more artisan cup of joe 
 The visions and the goals of the coffee roasters and the visions and goals of a cafe or bakery owner didn t always align   said Paolo Maliksi  one of the owners of Regalia   We are here to make sure that anyone can come in and roast for whatever reason  
Maliksi and other small batch roasters are at the forefront of a trend that has spilled over from the beer industry  Much like the boom in U S  craft breweries  more and more coffee shops are now roasting their own beans from New York to Chicago to Seattle  The shift away from mass produced coffee lets discerning cafe owners tell caffeinated customers exactly where their beans came from    something sustainability minded clientele increasingly care about 
 5 Coffee
The trend toward self roasting is good news for the millennial cafe goer concerned about where food comes from and who isn t deterred by prices that can be more than double that of a drip coffee at  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   A sign of a more plugged in consumer  it s helping reshape America s coffee industry  where Folgers and Maxwell House once ruled 
The rise of self roasting has been helped by online commerce and social media  which allow newcomers to establish their brands and give roasters an outlet to connect with customers  The internet has also given regular consumers a way to buy unroasted beans 
Rabobank says roasting shops alone aren t yet a major threat to Big Coffee  but as young consumers move away from traditional brands  that s forcing the old guard to adapt  JM Smucker Co   for example  has rolled out a new line of coffee called 1850 intended to attract younger drinkers who wouldn t think to pick up a pound of sister brand Folgers  Last month  Maxwell House owner Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  Co  took a  15 4 billion writedown on assets in a stunning acknowledgment that changing consumer tastes have destroyed the value of some of the company s most iconic products 
 If this eventually scales up and it takes over more grocery stores  it could be a bigger risk to a large industrial roaster   said James Watson  a beverages analyst at Rabobank  Big brands like Maxwell House are stagnating  Euromonitor data show   and in general there s a move towards smaller batches  more specialty coffee and roasting to match that   he said 
Machine Makers
While big brands may be squirming  the shift to small batch roasting is a boon for the makers of roasting machines  especially as models have grown smaller and cheaper 
Bellwether Coffee makes a roaster that s the size of a standard fridge  70 percent smaller than typical models  It s also electric  eliminating the need to pull gas lines into cafes and solving the smoke problems and typical ventilation requirements  said Nathan Gilliland  chief executive officer of the Berkeley  California based manufacturer  The machines also have a feature allowing sustainable minded customers to tip the farmers directly  which in many cases can result in doubling the amount the grower gets for their beans 
At Regalia  where the main coffee roasting machine is affectionately called  Big Mama   a cafe roasting 1 000 pounds a week can save more than  200 000 a year by buying and roasting green beans  instead of purchasing roasted ones  the co op estimates 
Some of the top coffee traders are also adapting their business models to supply the exotic origins and micro lots these specialized shops need  Buyers are looking for smaller batches than traditional 60 kilogram bags and some beans    usually those used in competitions    are so expensive that they are transported by plane  instead of the 20 foot containers that dominate the global coffee trade 
 The equipment has become more available  more accessible   said Rich Futrell  who oversees sales in the U S  Midwest for Genuine Origin  a unit of coffee trader Volcafe  which which operates an Amazon like website for specialty roasters and ships its beans in 30 kilogram cartons delivered via UPS 
 Graphic design  information and knowledge have become more accessible  but green coffee is still traded the way it s been traded for a long  long time   he said 
One way traders are pulling off the gear shift is through M A  Neumann Kaffee Gruppe  the world s largest coffee trader  bought a majority stake in Atlas Coffee Importers in Seattle and Olam International acquired East African coffee specialist Schluter SA  Sucafina  another coffee trader  invested in specialty coffee merchant 32cup 
 It absolutely opens the doors for new ways of doing business   said Cory Bush  managing director of 32cup   Smaller specialty roasters are forcing importers and traders to become more responsive  When people are buying smaller quantities of anything  I think they expect to buy them in the same way they buy stuff from Amazon or their online grocers  We are having to find new platforms and new approaches to sell to people the way they want to be sold to  
Niche Industry
To be sure  specialty coffee is a niche industry and there are still no precise figures on what percentage of the global market it accounts for  Still  Americans report drinking more and more gourmet coffee  A survey carried out by the National Coffee Association earlier this year showed that gourmet s share of all coffee consumed reached a record 61 percent in 2019 
At Regalia  which opens to the public for a few hours every weekend  a filtered cup of coffee might go for anywhere from a few dollars to  10 a pop  depending on what was roasted recently  That s a lot for a coffee in the slightly grittier part of Long Island City  which is more known for the warehouses that house and clean the city s halal meat carts than for the glass high rise apartment towers shooting up in other parts of the neighborhood  But it s not insurmountable 
 You can buy a good cup of coffee for  3 and a great cup of coffee for  5  we are not talking about the difference between buying a Honda Civic and a Ferrari  NYSE RACE    32cup s Bush said   Choosing the better option is not going to fundamentally change your household economics

94103,315618,SBUX,Colombian proposal to ditch NY coffee price may send buyers elsewhere,news,By Julia Symmes Cobb and Ayenat Mersie BOGOTA NEW YORK  Reuters    A proposal by Colombian coffee growers  federation that producer countries sell their high quality harvests untethered from the New York market price could encourage buyers to look for alternative providers  importers and exporters said  The federation in late February said it would discuss a possible unlinking from the New York benchmark price with other producers of high quality arabica and buyers in an effort to sell coffee above production costs  Prices on the New York market have hovered at or below  1 per pound so far in 2019  Last week  the most active ICE  NYSE ICE  arabica futures contract bottomed at a 13 year low of 94 65 cents per pound  Brazil harvested a record large coffee crop last year  and is on track to produce another massive harvest this crop year  despite it being the off year in its biennial production cycle  Colombia  which prices much of its coffee at a differential to futures  is proposing an unlinking that would set its prices between  1 40 and  1 50 per pound  The Colombian federation is already beginning discussions with other producers  it said  But despite the proposal s popularity with struggling growers  an alternative price could have buyers looking elsewhere   There was a time a while ago  when Colombia was so far above everyone else  quality wise   said Shawn Hackett  president of Hackett Financial Advisors  a Florida based futures brokerage and research firm specializing in agricultural commodities   Nowadays  there s some really good quality in Brazil  really good quality in Central America  in Africa    PAST EFFORTS  Colombia s federation has long made the case to large buyers that it is in their interest to ensure producers earn a profit   Colombian farmers need to make 760 000 pesos   245 84  per 125 kg  275 lb  shipment on the domestic market to meet production costs  the federation has said  Prices were at 692 000 pesos per shipment on Monday   Coffee price cartels have been attempted before  but failed   An effort in 2000 to get coffee producers to hold back 20 percent of output until prices climbed to  1 05 per pound was scrapped after just a few producer countries   including Colombia   agreed to participate  The higher the target price  the greater the incentive for those outside a price agreement to increase output  a United Nations report on the effort said   Successful control of coffee prices will also require the participation of importers  who have largely ignored requests to pay more  despite warnings that farmers will switch crops if they cannot turn a profit  Due to slumping prices and delays in certifying organic beans  coffee producers in Peru  for example  have been seen abandoning their crop to work on plantations that grow coca  the main ingredient in cocaine  the federation there said recently  In 2013  some Colombian farmers even floated switching from arabica coffee   which is a smoother tasting  more expensive bean   to the cheaper to grow robusta  which is used more in instant coffee   If the spread between the market and the prices that the Colombian exporters are trying to charge gets big enough  you will probably see a lot of people switch over to other origins   said a U S  importer   People will become less dependent upon Colombian coffee   Colombian exporters agree   I don t think the proposal is realistic   said Giancarlo Ghiretti  of specialty exporter Caravela Coffee   Selling large amounts of coffee outside of the market is difficult and risky  Large buyers will look to replace Colombia with other origins   The U S  National Coffee Association said its members  who include major chains Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and Peet s Coffee   Tea  agree growth requires stability for farmers  but price controls are generally unsuccessful   While the pressure to find quick economic fixes is understandable due to current market dynamics  history shows that policies designed to control price ultimately hurt those they are meant to protect   the industry group s president Bill Murray said in an email  Colombia produced 13 6 million 60 kg bags of washed arabica last year  more than any other country but down 4 5 percent from 2017  Dry weather is expected to help the crop recover this year ,2019-03-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/colombian-proposal-to-ditch-ny-coffee-price-may-send-buyers-elsewhere-1812012,1812012
94104,315619,SBUX,Starbucks Stock Is Hitting New Highs    and Getting Pricey,news,"By Charley Blaine
Investing com   Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  shares are looking more expensive by the day 
The shares for the king of coffee boutiques hit a 52 week high of  73 25 soon after Wednesday s open  but were promptly pulled lower by the overall market slump  Still  Wednesday was the fifth new high for Starbucks in the last six trading days 
The shares are up 13  on the year  And despite falling 12 4  during the November December slump  the shares ended the fourth quarter up more than 13   They re up 54  from a 52 week low of  47 37 reached last June 
The question of priciness is raised because of all those new highs  One result is that Starbucks is trading at 28x trailing 12 month earnings  The Nasdaq s trailing P E ratio is 23 5x earnings  The S P 500 is trading at 21 5x earnings 
The stock s gains may not be justified  Same store sales in the United States were up just 4  in 2018 and basically flat in China  where the company sees the bulk of future growth  the company s fourth quarter earnings report said 
The company sees comparable sales growth of 4  for 2019  even with a deal to sell coffee products to Nestle 
The company had 29 865 outlets worldwide at the end of 2018 and expects to add 2 100 this year  with more than 600 each in the United States and China 
The guidance seems to assume the global economy continues to grow steadily and that the current trade dispute between the United States and China doesn t affect sales in China 
The consensus estimate on the stock  according to analysts polled by Investing com  is  69 40  4 6  below the current price of  72 73  It happens that Wedbush analyst Nick Setya did raise his estimate on the stock on Wednesday by  4 to  70  still below the current price  The value is baked into the price  he wrote  according to Barron s ",2019-03-27,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/starbucks-stock-hitting-new-highs-is-getting-pricey-1820037,1820037

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This coffee chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 56 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 7  
Revenues are expected to be  6 31 billion  up 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 13  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Starbucks 
For Starbucks  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Starbucks will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Starbucks would post earnings of  0 65 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 75  delivering a surprise of  15 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Starbucks doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-sbux-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200408248,200408248

Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Starbucks lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Starbucks currently has an Earnings ESP of  3 29   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 25  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

94137,315652,SBUX,Greenspan Warns of  Extremely Imbalanced  Path of U S  Deficit,news," Bloomberg     While American politicians on both sides of the aisle have been mostly silent as the U S  deficit swells toward  1 trillion and beyond  former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says the lack of attention won t last 
 This is an extremely imbalanced situation   Greenspan  who led the Fed from 1987 to 2006  said in a phone interview   Politically  budget deficits really don t matter  What matters is the consequences  
For Greenspan  92  the ultimate concern is inflation  The last time the nation had to plug a shortfall this large was in the wake of the recession that ended in 2009  Now the economy is in its 10th year of expansion  with the tightest job market since the 1960s 
Inflation is under control    data Wednesday may show it s the tamest since 2016  But should investors start to worry that U S  spending will spur price pressures  they could curtail purchases of Treasuries at a time when a key source of demand    international buyers    is already waning 
 It is only when eventually the budget deficits  as they always do  engender inflation that you get the political system responding   Greenspan said   We see right now the beginnings of stagflation  but we are not there yet   he said  referring to a mix of slow growth and high inflation 
The federal deficit will exceed  1 trillion in fiscal 2022  according to the Congressional Budget Office  In Donald Trump s first full fiscal year as president  the shortfall grew to  779 billion  the highest since 2012  even as tax cuts boosted growth  Deficits were already on course to worsen amid rising outlays for entitlements and interest expenses 
The deteriorating fiscal backdrop combined with the Fed s move to shrink its balance sheet led the Treasury to boost net issuance to  1 34 trillion in 2018  more than double the level of 2017  Beth Hammack  chair of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee  said in a report to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last month that U S  borrowing needs may tally more than  12 trillion over the next decade 
While fiscal hawks on Capitol Hill seem few and far between  investors and business leaders are raising red flags 
Although so far the U S  has avoided having to offer higher yields as it ramps up borrowing  Mark Kiesel of Pacific Investment Management Co  says that won t last  That s because foreign demand is ebbing  and he sees more upside than downside risk to inflation  DoubleLine Capital LP s Jeffrey Gundlach has also sounded alarm bells  calling the increased debt load a  horrific situation  
Parties   Failure 
Former  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   CEO Howard Schultz  who is considering running for president in 2020 as an independent  last month said the debt overhang is an example of both major parties   reckless failure  regarding their constitutional responsibility 
Greenspan s view is that unfunded entitlement spending will crowd out private sector investment and curtail growth  Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sounded a similar note last month  saying  the U S  federal government budget is on an unsustainable path   given rising health care costs and an aging population 
 Entitlements crowd out gross domestic savings  and domestic savings coupled with savings borrowed from abroad is the fundamental source of funding for capital investment   Greenspan said   And capital investment is the basis for productivity growth  ",2019-02-12,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/greenspan-warns-of-extremely-imbalanced-path-of-us-deficit-1777569,1777569

94170,315685,SBUX,U S  Debt Sales Break Records Again  Feeding Deficit Criticism,news," Bloomberg     The U S  Treasury Department announced plans to issue another record breaking amount of debt  giving President Donald Trump s re election opponents more ammunition as they question whether his tax cuts will pay for themselves 
The federal budget shortfall is set to swell  driven by tax cuts  spending increases and an aging American population  As a result  the Treasury is raising its long term debt issuance at its quarterly refunding auctions to  84 billion  the department said Wednesday   1 billion more than three months ago  Such elevated levels of borrowing will finance the widening deficit  with Wall Street strategists projecting new debt issuance will top  1 trillion for a second straight year 
The ballooning national debt is already being drawn into the 2020 presidential election campaign  Former  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   CEO Howard Schultz  who is considering running as an independent  earlier this week said the U S  s debt levels are a example both Republicans  and Democrats   reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility  
Debt sales have already surpassed levels last seen when the country was digging out of its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression  Combined with needing to fund the shortfall  the Treasury has been selling more debt as a result of the Federal Reserve s strategy to slowly let government debt roll off its balance sheet 
Initial tax receipts call into question the Trump administration s projection that extra economic growth would generate enough revenue to offset its tax cuts  Corporate income taxes paid to the U S  Treasury fell to  205 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept  30    a 31 percent drop from the prior year  A decrease of that magnitude is unusual during a period of economic growth 
The Congressional Budget Office forecasts the federal budget deficit will top  1 trillion in 2020  with the U S  government spending about  7 trillion just to service that debt 
The massive fiscal shortfall has drawn concern from investors  with DoubleLine Capital LP s Jeffrey Gundlach calling it a  horrific situation  in his annual webcast  Billionaire investor Seth A  Klarman  in a letter presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  said global social tension  receding American leadership and rising debt levels all present a red flag 
In its refunding announcement  the Treasury said it will keep auctions of nominal coupon and floating rate debt stable over the coming quarter and anticipates boosting issuance of inflation linked securities starting in February 
The Treasury Department reiterated that a suspension period for the nation s statutory debt limit ends March 1  though so called extraordinary accounting measures can continue to finance the government temporarily  In the statement  the Treasury said it s too early to provide a precise forecast for how long those will last 
 Treasury does not anticipate bill issuance to be as volatile as it has been in the past when prior debt limit suspension periods expired   the agency said  It does not expect to reduce bill issuance in advance of the debt limit expiration date 
Strategists at most dealer firms had predicted Treasury would not lift nominal note and bonds sales and begin expanding TIPS issuance  That s because bolstered auction sizes over the past four quarters  along with utilizing bills sales  is seen sufficient to allow the government to finance its funding gap with a second year of over  1 trillion in new debt ",2019-01-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-debt-sales-break-records-again-feeding-deficit-criticism-1763262,1763262

Growth Makes These 5 Stocks Worth BuyingA healthy business with steady sales growth is key to survival in today s fast changing and highly competitive business environment  As such  higher revenues are necessary to drive growth  and most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise Though a company might not be profitable over a particular period  it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations  In cases when companies tend to incur a loss on a temporary basis  they are valued based on sales  This is because sales growth  or decline  is usually an early indicator of the company s future earnings performance The Price to Sales  P S  ratio takes into account a company s revenues when valuing it  It is key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to manipulate sales numbers as they can with earnings While sales growth is an important metric for any corporate for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision making  this in isolation doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits So  consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and further potential investments  Also  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment

94192,315707,SBUX,Is Mass Adoption Of Crypto Around The Corner ,opinion,"As of April 3rd  the US s largest supermarket chain will stop accepting payments by Visa  NYSE V  at 142 stores and 108 gas stations across seven states 
With 2 800 locations across the States  Kroger  NYSE KR  has long been at odds with Visa and due to rising transaction costs  last July they shut the option at 21 locations in California  This latest update is a significant escalation 
Some are hopeful that the supermarket giant might be keen to adopt bitcoin lightning as a cheap alternative to Visa cards  While that would be totally wumbo  I m not sure that the LN network is quite ready for that just yet as the infrastructure is still very much under construction 
The question of mass adoption of cryptocurrencies is one that has been pondered by many industry advocates and certainly is not without its hurdles 
Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  is planning to accept bitcoin through Bakkt by the end of the year  Birks Group in Canada has already started accepting bitcoin for Jewelry in some stores  Rakuten in Japan is also reportedly setting up an option for crypto payments that could go online soon 
In stable economies  the question is more about convenience than necessity and so adoption will only take place once it s cheaper and easier for consumers  Kroger s latest move has highlighted the  cheaper  part  the infrastructure for  easier  is being built as we speak 
Today s Highlights
Not Another Brexit Vote
Where did Bitcoin Transactions go 
Alt Season Continues
Please note  All data  figures   graphs are valid as of March 12th  All trading carries risk  Only risk capital you can afford to lose 
Traditional Markets
With 17 days left to the official Brexit deadline  things are getting tight  Today Parliament will vote on yet another version of May s deal with the EU  The deal has reportedly only been altered slightly since the last time Parliament voted it down in a historic defeat for the British Prime Minister 
Should the vote fail again  Parliament is preparing another vote to close the possibility of a  no deal Brexit  and take the option off the table  After that  we ll probably see some sort of attempt to delay the March 29th deadline 
Judging by the Pound s surge over the last 24 hours  purple circle   it seems the market is pricing in a delay 

Meanwhile across the pond  President Donald J Trump has proposed a new  4 75 trillion budget to Congress that is ruffling some feathers  The deadline to avoid another shutdown is months away though  currently set for October 1st  So  we can probably expect a lot more wrangling in the meantime 
Stocks were doing pretty well in the Asian session but the rally seems to have come into question after the European opening 

Missing Bitcoin Volumes
In yesterday s market update  we posted the following graph of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain  which has seen a sharp decline since the start of the month 

So  the obvious question that some of my readers have asked was  where did they go 
One suggestion was that it could be due to massive power outages in Venezuela  According to data from coin dance  volumes are down in the country by about 50  since their peak a month ago 

Another reason could be that the startup known as Veriblock has ended their testnet  Veriblock was reportedly responsible for about a third of BTC transactions in the last few months 
Due to the anonymous nature of bitcoin  it s very difficult to know for sure  Though if anyone has any other theories as to why it s happening  or confirmation of the two above  I d be glad to hear them 
Though this specific data point may no longer be as relevant  my end conclusion from yesterday is unwavering 
Welcome to alt season folks 
Alt Season Continues
Because we re coming off a particularly harsh winter  we can t exactly expect conditions to warm up immediately and turn to summer without any transition phase 
The term alt is short for altcoins  which basically means any crypto asset that isn t bitcoin  Some of these tokens have seen staggering results over the last few weeks  Yesterday  two rather obscure coins saw triple digit percentage returns within a 24 hours period 
Trading on such cryptos can be extremely risky so if you are doing so  please do it with caution and due diligence 
We noted the gains from XLM yesterday and it seems optimism is still high for Stellar Lumens  Many expect a groundbreaking announcement from Stellar and IBM  NYSE IBM  at the 20 20 conference in Singapore next week 
Yesterday afternoon  Cardano managed to raise some eyebrows by rising 7 4   in 12 hours while the rest of the cryptos were largely flat 
For long term investors  it s usually best to have a diversified portfolio and stick to your strategy  For short term traders  feel free to make a chart like this one that has all the cryptos on one graph to try and forecast which ones will outperform

This is looking increasingly like a new bear market  It s not 100  confirmed  at least technically speaking  But as I like to say  if it looks like a bear  smells like a bear  and acts like a bear  what else could it be 
That doesn t mean we won t be able to find any profit opportunities  There are also going to be stocks that buck the trend because they offer the right combination of defensiveness  dividend yield  and lower volatility 
With that in mind  there is one opportunity worth targeting   Starbucks  SBUX   The coffee chain operator struggled for most of the past couple years  But its shares soared 12  on Nov  2  2018   the biggest one day gain since 2009 
The catalyst was SBUX s fiscal fourth quarter earnings report  It showed comparable sales growth of 4  in the Americas region  improved loyalty program growth  a rebound in Chinese sales  spending reductions and other positive metrics 
Throw in Starbucks  market beating dividend yield of 2 1   its solid Weiss  buy  Rating and the fact my two teenage daughters seem to spend half their lives and most of their money there   and you have the makings of a very interesting long term investment

94219,315734,SBUX,Impressive Sales Growth Makes These 5 Stocks Worth Buying,opinion,A healthy business with steady sales growth is key to survival in today s fast changing and highly competitive business environment  As such  higher revenues are necessary to drive growth  and most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise Though a company might not be profitable over a particular period  it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations  In cases when companies tend to incur a loss on a temporary basis  they are valued based on sales  This is because sales growth  or decline  is usually an early indicator of the company s future earnings performance The Price to Sales  P S  ratio takes into account a company s revenues when valuing it  It is key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to manipulate sales numbers as they can with earnings While sales growth is an important metric for any corporate for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision making  this in isolation doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits So  consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and further potential investments  Also  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control  and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening     Based in Los Angeles  CA  Oaktree Capital Group  LLC   NYSE OAK   operates as a global

94221,315736,SBUX,Top Picks 2019  Starbucks SBUX,news,"Coffee drinkers don t care about market corrections  Perhaps that s why Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  has come through the worst market correction in a decade not only unscathed  but in a better position   10   than it was when the downslide started in October  suggests Chris Preston  vice president of content at Cabot Wealth Network 
For a stock to not just tread water but thrive over the last three months bodes well for its prospects as the market recovers  And that s why Starbucks stock looks so attractive right now 
A big fiscal fourth quarter earnings report in early November sent the stock gapping up from  58 to  68 in a week thanks to much better than expected same store sales  spurred in part by the recently introduced late afternoon  happy hour  deals  While it has since pulled back to as low as  60  it remains comfortably above its 200 day moving average 
Where does the stock go from here  It s already recovered nicely from its early December pullback  and looks buyable below month long resistance at  67  Any push above that level  especially if the market offers a tailwind instead of a headwind  and the stock could zoom past record highs 
Beyond that  the fundamentals look good   the stock trades at a reasonable price to earnings ratio of 20 even after the recent run up  and analysts anticipate 9 5  EPS growth and 5 6  sales growth in 2019 
Add in the positives in the chart  with both moving averages on the rise since late August  and there s a lot to like about Starbucks heading into the new year  Starbucks might be just the wake up call your portfolio needs after a three month slumber

94222,315737,SBUX,Democratic Senator Kamala Harris jumps into 2020 White House race,news,"By John Whitesides and Amanda Becker WASHINGTON  Reuters    First term Democratic Senator Kamala Harris of California  a rising party star and outspoken critic of President Donald Trump s immigration policies  launched her 2020 campaign for the White House on Monday by touting her experience as a prosecutor  Harris  54  the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India  enters the race with the potential advantage of being the Democratic candidate who looks most like the party s increasingly diverse base of young  female and minority voters   This is a moment in time that I feel a sense of responsibility to stand up and fight for the best of who we are   Harris said on ABC s  Good Morning America  in announcing her candidacy  Harris  who made history in 2016 as the first black woman elected to the U S  Senate from California  timed her announcement for the U S  Martin Luther King Jr  Day holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader  She said he was an aspirational leader   We are the best of who we are when we fight to achieve these ideals   she said on ABC  Harris  a former California state attorney general  has become popular with liberal activists for her tough questioning of Trump administration appointees and officials  including Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions  during Senate hearings  Harris  campaign will focus on reducing the high cost of living with a middle class tax credit  pursuing immigration and criminal justice changes and a Medicare for all healthcare system  aides said  She has said she will reject corporate political action committee donations  Harris joins what is expected to be a crowded field to challenge Trump  the likely Republican candidate  in 2020  A half dozen Democrats have taken steps to run and four of them   Harris  Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand and U S  Representative Tulsi Gabbard   are women  There are more than a dozen other potential Democratic candidates  and CNN reported former Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  chief Howard Schultz is exploring an independent candidacy   This is a robust signal of who we are as a democracy and everyone should run who is thinking of running   Harris told reporters in Washington after her announcement  In the first 30 minutes after entering the race  Harris received individual online contributions from all 50 states  spokesman Ian Sams said on Twitter  Her slogan will be  For the People   in a nod to Harris  roots as a prosecutor  aides said  As one of the earliest congressional critics of Trump s immigration policies  Harris has pushed hard for a deal to protect from deportation those immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children  a group known as Dreamers  BEST CHALLENGER  Harris and other Democrats will have to navigate the party s debate about whether an establishment figure who can appeal to centrist voters or a fresh face who can energize its increasingly diverse and progressive base offers the best chance to beat Trump in 2020  The Republican National Committee criticized Harris as  the least vetted  of the Democratic candidates  calling her unqualified and out of touch   All she has to show for her brief time in the Senate is a radically liberal voting record   RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens said in a statement  Harris has embraced the party s diversity ahead of a Democratic nominating campaign where minority voters and liberal activists are expected to have a loud voice  The former San Francisco prosecutor drew notice when her rapid fire grilling of Sessions during a 2017 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing caused him to complain that  it makes me nervous   In September  she was among a handful of Democrats who aggressively questioned Kavanaugh at his Supreme Court confirmation hearing about his views on abortion and on the special counsel investigation of potential Russian meddling in the 2016 election  In the Senate  she has introduced a bill to give lower income families cash payments and tax credits to help battle wage stagnation and rising housing costs  and has been a strong advocate of criminal justice reforms  Harris started a book tour in early January to promote a memoir  making a series of media appearances that boosted her visibility ahead of her campaign announcement  Her campaign could be aided by the schedule for the state by state party nominating process that is scheduled to begin in February 2020  The kickoff state of Iowa has a strong base of liberal activists and the race will move quickly to more diverse states such as Nevada and South Carolina  Harris  home state of California also has moved up its primary to increase its influence  Political foes will pore over Harris  record in California  where some activists questioned whether she should have pushed harder for changes to the criminal justice system  She also has come under scrutiny for declining as attorney general to prosecute OneWest  the bank once headed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  for alleged foreclosure violations  Harris  who voted against Mnuchin s confirmation as Treasury secretary  has said she  followed the facts  in declining to prosecute  
She also has been criticized for saying she was not aware of sexual harassment allegations against one of her top aides  who resigned in December after a California newspaper asked him about a 2016 harassment lawsuit  Xavier Becerra  who replaced Harris as attorney general  settled the lawsuit in May 2017 for  400 000 ",2019-01-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/democratic-senator-kamala-harris-jumps-into-2020-white-house-race-1752360,1752360

quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein both top and bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third straight quarter  Results benefited from robust performance by the Americas and China Asia Pacific segment and store openings  Ownership change in the East China business and robust performance during the holiday season too aided the company s quarterly performance  Meanwhile  comparable sales from China increased for the second straight quarter Earnings  Revenues   Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 75 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents and grew 15 4  on a year over year basis Total revenues came in at  6 6 billion  which outpaced the consensus estimate of  6 5 billion and increased 9  from the year ago level  The upside was driven by robust new store performance  comparable sales growth  consolidation of the company s East China business and streamline driven activities Global comparable store sales increased 4  compared with 3  registered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  Global comps were driven by a 3  increase in average ticket  However  transactions remained flat compared with a 1  decline in the preceding quarter In the quarter under review  Starbucks opened 541 net new stores worldwide  bringing the total store count to 29 865 across 78 markets  The company said that more than two thirds of the net new stores were opened internationally  It plans to build 600 net new stores annually in Mainland China  which will double the market s store count to 6 000 across 230 cities by 2023 from the figure at fiscal 2017 end  In first quarter fiscal 2019  the company opened 259 stores in China Margin Contraction ContinuesOn a non GAAP basis  operating margin contracted 180 basis points  bps  year over year to 17 4   The impact of investments associated with the U S  tax law change and strategic investments in the company s cyber retail business resulted in the downturn  Rise in costs due to investment in digitalization also dented the company s operating margin  Higher spending in its store partners  employees  along with the impact of its ownership change in the East China business added to the woes  On a GAAP basis  operating margin declined 310 bps to 15 3  Segmental PerformanceAmericas  Net revenues at this flagship segment increased 8  year over year to  4 6 billion driven by 807 new stores opened in the quarter Comps growth of 4  in the quarter comprised a 4  increase in average ticket  Additionally  U S  comps improved 4  in the same time period Markedly  segmental growth was driven by robust performance of beverage   the company s highest margin category  Meanwhile  core beverage  which includes espresso  tea and refreshers  reported 3  growth Also  membership

asset impairments as well as higher spending in its store partners China Asia Pacific  CAP   At this segment  net revenues were up 45  to  1 2 billion  The upside can be attributed to increased sales from ownership change in East China  1 010 new store openings over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales Comps were up 3  compared with a 1  gain registered in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  Increase in comps was on account of  a 1  rise in comps from China and mid single digit comps growth in Japan  In the fiscal fourth quarter  China posted comps growth of 3  However  operating margin contracted 530 bps year over year to 18  in the quarter under review due to the impact of its ownership change in the East China business Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA   Net revenues dropped 1  year over year to  266 3 million at this segment  The downside can be attributed to foreign currency headwinds  which overshadowed higher sales from the addition of 324 new stores in the past 12 months and comps growth That said  comps decreased 1  year over year  against 2  gain in the preceding quarter   On the flip side  operating margin expanded 200 bps to 10 1  primarily owing to higher business reorganization costs Channel Development  Net revenues at this segment decreased 20  to  504 6 million  The downturn was due to licensing of the company s CPG as well as foodservice businesses to Nestl   following completion of the deal on Aug 26  2018  and the sale of Tazo brand Moreover  operating margin contracted 810 bps to 34 8  Fiscal 2019 GuidanceStarbucks reiterated its

94266,315781,SBUX,9 Inexpensive Consumer Services Sector Stocks  Part 5 ,opinion,"Introduction
As I stated in the introduction in Part 4 of this series  my primary objective is to provide the reader with a clear perspective of just how different individual stocks are and how different companies operating in different sectors are  Consequently  I will be covering every sector that FactSet covers  As this relates to the Consumer Services Sector  it is not a sector that I am especially enthused about  For example  one of my primary screening criteria was an S P credit rating of BBB  or better  There were only 56 companies in this sector that met that quality threshold and only 9 of which that I considered fairly valued and worthy of presenting 
To clarify further  there were only 5 restaurant subsector constituents  and none of them were attractively valued  However  3 of those 5  Darden Restaurants Inc  NYSE DRI   McDonald s  NYSE MCD  and finally Starbucks Corp  NASDAQ SBUX   are all excellent businesses  However  I do not consider any of them attractive enough to invest in currently 
Of the 9 companies that I am reviewing in this article  8 of them pay dividends  However  Discovery may offer the highest annualized future total return potential even though it is the only one that does not pay a dividend  The opportunity here is available as a result of very low valuation and a very high expectation of growth for the fiscal year 2019  Consequently  it might be attractive to the aggressive investor seeking a high intermediate term total rate of return   Note  on January 30  2019  eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  announced the initiation of their first dividend  however  it is not yet reflected on the FAST Graph even though its dividend yield is reported in the FAST FACTS  
A Sector By Sector Review
This is part 5 of a series where I have conducted a simple screening looking for value over the overall market based on industry classifications and subindustry classifications reported by FactSet Research Systems  Inc  In part 1 I covered the consumer services sector  In part 2 I covered the communication sector  In part 3 I covered the Consumer Durables sector and its many diverse subsectors  In part 4 I covered consumer nondurables  In this part 5  I will be covering companies in the Consumer Services sector 
In each article in this series  I will be providing a listing of screened research candidates from each of the following industry sectors  the sector I m covering in this article is marked in green 

A Simple Valuation and Quality Screening Process
With this series of articles  I will be presenting a screening of companies that have become attractively valued primarily as a result of the bearish market activities experienced in 2018 from each of the above sectors  I will be applying a rather simple valuation and quality oriented screen across each of the sectors  First  I have screened for investment grade S P credit ratings of BBB  or above  Next  I have screened for low valuations based on P E ratios between 2 and 17  Finally  I have screened for long term debt to capital no greater than 70  
By keeping my screen simple  and at the same time rather broad  I will be able to identify attractively valued research candidates that I might have overlooked through a more rigorous screening process  In other words  I m looking for fresh ideas that I might have previously been overlooking  Furthermore  I want to be clear that I do not consider every candidate that I have discovered as suitable for every investor  However  I do consider them all to be attractively valued  Additionally  I also believe that every investor will be able to find companies to research that meet their own goals  objectives and risk tolerances as this series unfolds

94267,315782,SBUX,Lightning Network  Small Fees  Small Capacity  ,opinion,"Today we ll talk about the Lightning Network  one of the next big developments for Bitcoin  While Bitcoin s price is finally receiving some love  is lightning going to strike 
Back in the early days of Bitcoin  the developers saw that the standard blockchain wasn t big enough to handle everyone s transactions  To solve this problem  some of them decided to attach a new payment network to Bitcoin one that was faster and cheaper than the main blockchain 
The Lightning Network uses Bitcoins  but it operates on a completely different principle  Instead of waiting for transactions to be mined  users simply exchange vouchers  like an IOU  which is an informal document that acknowledges a debt that s owed  The system is optimized towards micropayments  so the fees were designed to be tiny  Using the lightning network  you can send someone less than a penny  but for large payments  you better use the main blockchain 
The Lightning Network has also got some problems  One of the main criticisms of the system is that you can send at most a few hundred dollars at a time  That should improve as the network gets bigger  but you won t be using it for anything big  Speaking of users  there aren t that many of them  The total capacity has now reached two million dollars  but that s nothing compared to Bitcoin s 60 billion dollar market cap  With these figures  it will be a long time before you can shop at Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  with Bitcoin

94268,315783,SBUX,McDonald s Stock Has Momentum As Turnaround Plans Gain Traction,opinion,"Last month  when McDonald s  NYSE MCD  reported  Q4 2018 earnings  they showed 4 4  growth in overall same store sales  beating the 4  average of analysts  estimates  Achieved during a tough period for fast food outlets  the results provide reassuring evidence that the global restaurant giant is firmly in control of its turnaround plans 
The current environment for fast food restaurants is challenging  the industry is seeing threats to growth from changing consumer preferences  as customers increasingly seek healthier options and cut back on junk food consumption  while technology disruptors that make home deliveries more affordable and have become a first choice for many millennials  are reducing store traffic 
In addition  the restaurant business is a constant work in progress  Investors hungry for some growth and steadily increasing dividend income have to be very selective when buying the stocks of companies that run large global food chains  McDonald s is doing many things right to keep its growth momentum strong when compared to competitors 

The company s successful strategy is also rewarding loyal investors  who have seen the stock rise 10  in the past year  Shares were up 2 3  yesterday to  179 97 at market close  and have 10  upside potential according to analyst consensus forecasts for the next 12 months 
McDonald s Is in Control of its Destiny
McDonald s has beaten earnings estimates in all but one quarter since 2015  Comparable sales  or sales at stores open for at least 13 months  in the U S  rose 2 3  in the fourth quarter  Global growth was much stronger  Comparable sales at restaurants in top global jurisdictions  including the U K   Europe and Australia were up 5 2  in the last quarter 
This winning streak is impressive  especially compared with other large global fast food operators  The coffee giant Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   for example  is struggling to attract more customers to its massive network of coffee shops and is betting big on China  where competition from smaller players is escalating 
For McDonald s  one concern keeping some investors on the sideline is whether Big Mac will be able to maintain this winning streak in the face of some powerful headwinds  Economic growth is slowing in China and Europe  while escalating wage costs and heightened competition in the U S  have the potential to hurt McDonald s future growth 
But in our view  the owner of Golden Arches is still one of the best defensive bets to play the economic uncertainty 
As part of CEO Steve Easterbrook s strategy  McDonald s has been recovering market share through a variety of initiatives including all day breakfast offerings  menu innovation such as healthier food choices  as well as higher quality ingredients and improvements to the overall restaurant experience 
Remodelling its stores has been a big part of Easterbrook s push to bring in more customers  The  6 billion plan to overhaul most of its 14 000 U S  restaurants has been designed to give visitors a fresh and modern look with digital kiosks  new furniture and decor 
These efforts have no doubt kept McDonald s ahead of the game and fueled gains in its shares  which have consistently beaten the broader market over the past five years  The stock has delivered 86  returns  including dividends  during that period when compared with 50  gains from S P 500 Index 
McDonald s is proving a good bet for long term income investors who want to benefit from the burger chain s growing cash flows  Last September  the company hiked its dividend 15   raising it to  1 16 per share each quarter  up from  1 01  Its payout ratio is a very healthy 39 4  This was the 42nd year in which McDonald s has had an annual dividend increase 
Bottom Line
We believe McDonald s growth momentum will help the company to continue with its generous payout policy  At its current price  that translates to an annual dividend yield of 2 64   If you re looking to add a quality income stock to your portfolio  the timing looks right to consider MCD ",2019-02-19,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcdonalds-stock-has-momentum-time-to-buy-200389502,200389502
94269,315784,SBUX,Bull Of The Day  Casey s General Stores  CASY ,opinion,"Today s Bull of the Day will offer a glimpse into the practices of professional money managers  We re not talking about hedge funds  but rather the huge institutions that manage billions or even hundreds of billions of dollars for pensions  municipalities  foundations  university endowments and other giant entities 
This is the investment realm where the managers don t care much about a flashy name or an exciting story  They care about returns  consistent  market beating returns  Although the objectives vary from fund to fund  they tend to have a relatively long time horizon and also to be fairly risk averse 
Because of their sheer size  small increases in returns over time translates to huge amounts of money   but of course  losses mean huge amounts of money gone  putting the fortunes of retirees  students and charities at risk   Conservative  investing is the name of the game 
Casey s General Stores  operates roughly 2 100 convenience stores in 16 midwestern states  Though it s far from a glamorous  high tech story  87  of Casey s shares are held by institutions because the company consistently produces quality results  even as it expands 
While gasoline sales are the most visible part of the operation  it s the groceries  snacks and drinks that really drive profits  In the most recent quarter  fuel sales accounted for 64  of total gross revenues  but because of razor thin margins of just 20 cents gallon  7 3    fuels only contributed 23  of net revenues   after the cost of goods sold 
In comparison  Groceries sold at gross margins of 32  and Prepared Food and Fountain Drinks enjoyed gross margins of 64   With clean and inviting locations and its own lines of high margin food items  Casey s has become a go to spot for its customers to pick up their favorite beverage as well as breakfasts  lunches  and more 
In many urban areas  professionals descend on a Starbucks  or similar competitors for their daily fix  In the rural Midwest  that role is often filled by a Casey s General Store  Management noted in the latest earnings release that breakfast food and drinks  continues to be a strong contributor to overall results  
A popular loyalty program and heavy emphasis on fleet fuel sales keep customers coming back to Casey s on a regular basis 
To understand why institutions invest in Casey s for the long term  let s look at two charts showing 15 years of history 
Notice that not only has the share price been climbing steadily over the past 15 years  it was also minimally affected by the financial crisis in 2008  recovering all of the lost value by the middle of 2009  something it took some of the  former  technology and finance high flyers many years to do 
This is why the shares keep climbing   so do the earnings  And the estimates show that same  beautifully boring uptrend  Recent upward revisions earn Casey s General Stores a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Casey s  which has grown from a single Iowa location in 1968  has exactly the kind of balance sheet you d expect from what started as a family owned midwestern business   with a healthy cash position and near total ownership of real estate and other assets 
That insulates Casey s from fluctuation in rent prices it can t control  Its two company distribution centers supply 90  of in store items and 75  of gasoline  helping to control costs and stabilizing earnings performance 
Learn From the Pros
Everyone has different investment objectives and time horizons  so it doesn t make any sense to follow the institutions blindly into any particular holding  but   paying attention to what they re buying is a great place to start for savvy individuals 
Casey s general Store is a great example of the rock solid performance that the huge money managers seek out  Sure  you could say gas stations and convenience stores are boring  but there s boring about making money

94291,315806,SBUX,5 ROE Stocks To Profit Amid Soft Earnings Season,opinion,After a flurry of solid back to back performance in the past few quarters  fourth quarter earnings season has flagged off on an unimpressive note  This  coupled with decline in 2019 estimates  reflects the widespread fear that the trend is reversing  With a global economic slowdown  the fourth quarter is expected to register soft earnings and revenue growth on a year over year basis As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE ROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow lesser than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for  1 of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This

Regarding the Chinese economy  Evans said there s  some uncertainty about what will happen going forward   while noting growth in the country is still running at about 6 5 percent a year 
Alibaba has seen softer demand for big ticket items  such as washing machines  televisions and automobiles  Evans said  But other sectors  like cosmetics  food  fashion and apparel  are still going strong  The company is focusing on the 300 million Chinese people who are expected to enter the ranks of the middle class over the next five years  Evans said

Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Starbucks is 16 5   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 12 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9 7  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Starbucks is 14 6   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 4  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Starbucks have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Starbucks a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

94360,315875,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  Reports Next Week  What You Should Expect,opinion,"Starbucks  SBUX  is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This coffee chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 65 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  6 49 billion  up 6 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 32  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Starbucks 
For Starbucks  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 95  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Starbucks will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Starbucks would post earnings of  0 59 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 62  delivering a surprise of  5 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Starbucks doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-sbux-reports-next-week-what-you-should-expect-200376671,200376671

94362,315877,SBUX,Exclusive  China to keep hitting back at U S  over trade  to boost government spending   finance minister,news,By Ryan Woo  yan shen and Yawen Chen BEIJING  Aug 24  Reuters    China will keep hitting back at Washington as more U S  trade tariffs are imposed  but its counter strikes will remain as targeted as possible to avoid harming businesses in China   whether Chinese or foreign  Finance Minister Liu Kun said  For now the impact of the China U S   trade frictions  on the Chinese economy has been small  but he is concerned about potential job losses and lost livelihoods  Liu  61  told Reuters on Thursday in an interview at the finance ministry  his first with the media since taking up the position in March  He said that the Chinese government will increase its spending to support workers and the unemployed who are hurt by the trade conflict  and also predicted bond issuance by local governments to support infrastructure investment this year will pickup and blow past 1 trillion yuan   145 48 billion  by the end of the current quarter   The trade conflict further escalated on Thursday as the United States and China heaped more tariffs on each other s goods  Since early July  the world s two largest economies have slapped each other with tariffs on a combined  100 billion of goods    China doesn t wish to engage in a trade war  but we will resolutely respond to the unreasonable measures taken by the United States   Liu said   If the United States persists with these measures  we will correspondingly take action to protect our interests   So far  China has either imposed or proposed tariffs on  110 billion of U S  goods  representing most of its imports of American products  Crude oil and large aircraft are key U S  goods that are still not targeted for penalties   Trade talks between mid level U S  and Chinese officials ended on Thursday without any sign of major progress  PRECISELY TARGETED MEASURES When asked if China would consider increasing tariffs on U S  goods that are already facing higher taxes  Liu said China will respond with precision   We re responding in a precise way  Of course  the value of U S  imports of Chinese goods isn t the same as the value of Chinese imports of U S  goods  We ll take tariff measures in accordance to this situation   he said  without elaborating  But China is conscious of the potential for bystanders to be caught in the line of fire  he said    When we take measures  we try our hardest not to harm the interests of foreign businesses in China  That s why our tariff measures are targeted to avoid affecting them as much as we can   said Liu   Some American businesses and industry lobbies  including the U S  Chamber of Commerce  have criticized U S  President Donald Trump s imposition of punitive tariffs on Chinese goods  saying the Chinese retaliation it is triggering will hurt businesses that already face greater competition from local rivals in China  U S  fast food  beverages and coffee chains including Starbucks  O SBUX  and Yum China s  N YUMC   N YUM  KFC brand are ubiquitous in Chinese cities  U S  branded infant formula  apparel  cars and phones are also popular  CHINESE JOBS The U S  tariffs have affected China s economic growth   albeit modestly   and their impact will become even more pronounced if the trade frictions persist  Liu said   Liu spent more than two decades in the Guangdong provincial government  taking on various roles including the head of its finance bureau  He became the vice governor of the export oriented southern province in 2010   Liu said he is very concerned about the Chinese jobs that could be lost    From my perspective  I d pay more attention to the impact that the China U S  trade frictions has on jobs in China  After all  some firms will be affected  exports will be reduced and production will be cut   he said  China s urban survey based jobless rate rose to 5 1 percent from 4 8 percent in June  The government aims to keep the rate below 5 5 percent this year  China plans to increase its fiscal spending to support workers or jobless hurt as higher tariffs kick in   We will make adequate preparations in terms of fiscal policy  and help unemployed workers find new jobs and ensure their basic social security   Liu said  The expenditure will not cause China to overshoot its 2018 budget deficit target of 2 6 percent of gross domestic product  he said  Liu is optimistic about government revenues this year  saying they might even exceed expectations   Beijing is expediting plans to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure projects as its economy shows signs of cooling further  Earlier this month  the finance ministry told local governments to speed up issuance of special bonds used to fund infrastructure projects   Local governments are allowed to issue 1 35 trillion yuan   196 billion  of special bonds this year  In the first half  more than 300 billion yuan of them were issued  a speed which the finance ministry called  slow   Issuance could pickup and exceed 1 trillion yuan in the first three quarters of the year  Liu said   There are three things China needs to do well   lowering taxes and cutting fees  preserving the intensity of its fiscal spending so that its effect can be better felt  and supporting the real economy and lightening the burdens of companies  he said  The cuts in taxes and fees would be more than 1 1 trillion yuan this year  beating government forecasts  Liu said   On May 1  China cut the value added tax in the manufacturing  transportation  construction  telecommunication and agricultural sectors  But all that does not mean China will unleash massive stimulus or go back on its campaign to reduce leverage in the economy    When we re talking about a more proactive fiscal policy  we aren t talking about massive stimulus  nor do we want to incur financial risks  let alone getting the government to take care of everything

Heading into today  shares of the coffee chain had lost 5 07  over the past month  outpacing the Retail Wholesale sector s loss of 6 6  and the S P 500 s loss of 7 29  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from SBUX as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be January 24  2019  On that day  SBUX is projected to report earnings of  0 65 per share  which would represent no growth from the year ago period  Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  6 48 billion  up 6 76  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  2 64 per share and revenue of  26 13 billion  These totals would mark changes of  9 09  and  5 69   respectively  from last year 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for SBUX  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 18  lower  SBUX currently has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Bloomin  Brands is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Starbucks has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that BLMN has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
BLMN currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 36  while SBUX has a forward P E of 24 58  We also note that BLMN has a PEG ratio of 1 31  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  SBUX currently has a PEG ratio of 1 82 
Another notable valuation metric for BLMN is its P B ratio of 27 63  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  SBUX has a P B of 74 49 
These metrics  and several others  help BLMN earn a Value grade of A  while SBUX has been given a Value grade of C 
BLMN sticks out from SBUX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that BLMN is the better option right now ",2018-12-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/blmn-vs-sbux-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200369541,200369541
94382,315897,SBUX,Purchasing Power Parity Shifts In 2018,opinion,"Nearly every investment strategy seems to fall in one of three buckets   There is trend following  go with the underlying direction of prices  and its opposite  mean reversion  look for the trend to be reversed  Lastly  there are arbitrage strategies  We would put carry trades  where a low yielding currency is borrowed to finance the purchase of a higher yielding currency  or asset  
The Bollinger Bands offer one way to operationalize reversion process  When a currency moves more than two standard deviations from the 20 day moving average  it is often seen as over extended  signaling a likely loss of momentum and a reversion to the average  It is a dynamic mean 
Another way to implement a mean reversion strategy is almost the equivalent of the Dogs of the Dow  where the worst performing Dow stocks or the next to worst Dow stocks are bought  In the currencies  one can buy the under valued currencies and sell the over valued currencies  
Valuation is particularly difficult in the currency market  which has become unmoored to gold or silver  What is the value of a fiat currency  Economists have developed a valuation metric  Purchasing Power Parity  In its simple form  it says that the price of an internationally traded basket of goods  Big Mac  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  coffee  iPhone  should sell for the same price in different currencies  To the extent they do not  implies a currency misalignment  
Like with other tools  PPP is often misused  Here s how  Consider that ant  Reports suggest that depending on the particular species  and what they had for breakfast    an ant could lift 10  20 and even 50x their weight  Average people cannot even come close  In this sense  an ant is stronger than a person   Consider a lightweight boxer  Given how much weight she can lift proportioned to her weight  she might be said to be pound per pound stronger than a heavy weight boxer  It does not mean she can bench press or squat more  The heavyweight fighter is still absolutely stronger 
Purchasing Power Parity is the pound per pound measure applied to currencies  According to some measures  if the Chinese yuan were to trade levels implied by PPP  the Chinese economy might be bigger than the US  This leads to all kinds of doom and gloom in the US and may spur more aggressive policies  In China  it can lead to over confidence and adventurism abroad  This is not what PPP means  any more than the lightweight fighter is stronger than the heavyweight  It is a theoretical construct that is still very helpful when used properly 
The OECD has its own model to calculate PPP  What would happen if one sold the currencies that the OECD said were the most over valued at the end of last year and bought the most under valued currencies  
At the end of 2017  the Swiss franc  Norwegian krone  and the Danish krone were over valued by nearly 21   19   and 15 5  respectively  They fell this year against the dollar  The Swiss franc has fallen around 1 3   the Norwegian krone about 2 3   and the Danish krone fell by about 2   The OECD still regards these three as the most overvalued against the dollar  18   15   and 9  respectively  
What about buying the most under valued currencies  At the end of last year  these were the yen   12 5    the euro   10 5    and sterling   5 5    All three have fallen against the dollar this year  The yen has eased around 1   the euro 1 5   and sterling has slipped around 2   They have fared a little better than the over valued currencies  but the margin is not meaningful given the volatility 
Another way to illustrate that this mean reversion strategy struggled this year is that the order of most overvalued to the most undervalued has hardly changed  The only change looking at the top ten currencies is that the euro and yen switched so that now the euro is more undervalued   17   than the yen   13 5    Alongside the euro  yen  and sterling  the Canadian dollar is the other that OECD says is undervalued  At the end of 2017  it was less than 0 5  off PPP  Now it is nearly 7  cheap  This year  the New Zealand dollar and Swedish krona are near fair value ",2018-12-20,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/purchasing-power-parity-shifts-in-2018-200369709,200369709

94384,315899,SBUX,Will Starbucks  SBUX  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Starbucks  SBUX   This company  which is in the Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This coffee chain has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 21  
For the last reported quarter  Starbucks came out with earnings of  0 62 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 59 per share  representing a surprise of 5 08   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 60 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 62 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Starbucks  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Starbucks currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 21   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 24  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-starbucks-sbux-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200370873,200370873

94386,315901,SBUX,Ding  Alibaba office app fuels backlash among some Chinese workers,news,"By Yawen Chen and Christian Shepherd BEIJING HANGZHOU  China  Reuters    In the cramped former home of Jack Ma  founder of the Chinese e commerce giant  Alibaba   NYSE BABA   about thirty young engineers sit elbow to elbow  working to attract the next million users for DingTalk  Alibaba s workplace communication software  Their installation in the hallowed flat where Ma got his start in the eastern city of Hangzhou reflects DingTalk s place in the pecking order of the company s sprawling collection of start up projects  Since December 2014  DingTalk has grown exponentially to become the world s largest chat service designed for companies  with over 100 million individual users and 7 million employers across China  The company says  without providing numbers  that it also has a growing presence in Europe  the United States and Southeast Asia  But its rapid rise   propelled by a promise to boost productivity through better monitoring of employee movements and faster responses to important messages   has sparked a backlash from Chinese workers who say the app fuels an unhealthy work culture   That also raises questions about DingTalk s ability to expand into the West  where people are typically guarded about their workplace privacy  In China  surveillance by the authorities and employers is already common  Like WhatsApp  DingTalk lets senders see if recipients have read messages  but it also has a  ding  feature that can bombard recipients with repeat notifications  text messages and phone call reminders  On top of this original feature  the company has added a wide range of functions that include automatic expense claims  a clock in system to monitor the whereabouts of employees  as well as a  daily report  function that requires workers to list completed tasks  As DingTalk has grown  many Chinese office workers have vented their frustrations online about the service  saying it is inhumane and destroys trust   On Zhihu com  a question and answer website  a thread entitled  how does it feel like to be forced to use DingTalk at work  has more than a thousand posts and has been viewed over 7 7 million times  An informal Reuters poll of 30 workers using DingTalk showed that about half had negative feelings about the app  while the rest said they were fine with it   often because their companies had not adopted features such as the clock in function   There s a saying in my circle  that you should quit the day your company installs DingTalk   said Robert  who works in luxury retail in the northwestern province of Shaanxi and complains that DingTalk has  fragmented his time into pieces   He declined to provide his surname  Li Xiaoyang  a former software sales agent in Beijing  said he had to use DingTalk s geo location function at his previous firm whenever he met a client  and use a face scanner to verify he was attending meetings   I felt so disgusted by it   he said  adding that he was constantly dinged by managers    Every level of management thinks their demand is the top priority and should be dealt with first   he said   Even worse  they will ding you through DingTalk even on holiday and you can t pretend you didn t see it   A company spokesperson said in response to the poll that DingTalk provided an effective communications tool for the workplace   DingTalk has many satisfied customers using our tool in Asia  Europe and the U S   which points to its success and customer satisfaction   The spokesperson also said that DingTalk had security technology built into the app to protect the privacy of employees and companies  confidential corporate data    DingTalk has not only helped companies improve workflow efficiency through a unified communications platform  but also encouraged transparency and accountability within the workplace   WECHAT RIVAL DingTalk sprang from Alibaba s unsuccessful attempt to challenge the WeChat instant messenger of its arch rival  Tencent Holdings Ltd  the service s chief executive  Wu Zhao  said in an interview   We came to understand that we did not understand social media platforms   Wu said at DingTalk s offices in Hangzhou  where Alibaba has its headquarters   Instead  Wu s team sought another niche  tackling a common managerial complaint in China  workers who fail to reply to messages and later feign ignorance  The driving force behind DingTalk s growth has been solving the organizational concerns of Chinese firms and providing   for free   a platform that gives companies a level of efficiency similar to Alibaba s  Wu said   What Jack Ma said to me was   Wu Zhao  helping small and medium enterprises is our company s mission  You go do that  don t concern yourself with making money    he said  Asked about DingTalk s business model  Wu said the company was focusing on helping companies become transparent and efficient  rather than making a profit   The app s basic features are all free  but users have to pay for hardware and additional cloud storage or conference call minutes  as well as for third party services  Alibaba does not specify DingTalk s revenue in its financial statements  Wu is aware of the backlash DingTalk is facing  but says the problem is a  toxic work culture at some companies  and misuse by some employers   The tool itself is not the problem  the way it is used is the problem   he said   DingTalk s goal is to encourage transparent and equal communications among all staff   Wu said   We believe only by creating an equal  transparent and effective communications environment that bottom up and real innovation can be realized   FRUSTRATIONS Records from the app have been used by companies as evidence to fire employees and dock pay  according to labor related lawsuits seen by Reuters in court filings  But DingTalk also wins praise as a productivity aid   It saves a lot of time as you no longer need to sit in physical conference calls and make phone calls  For important matters  you just need to ding someone   said Liu Sufen  a spokeswoman at the Chinese bicycle sharing firm Hellobike  For larger companies  like Dongguan Meishang Clothing  which has a nation wide client base and more than 3 000 employees  DingTalk has helped reduce costs and increase efficiency  said Peng Xiang  the company s information director   Before we used DingTalk  it was nearly impossible for employees to communicate directly with the boss  however with DingTalk this becomes possible and easy   Peng said approval processes that once took a week could now be done in an hour on DingTalk  Despite the grumbling  Wu believes the service will translate across borders and cultures   even in the West    If you come into Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  in the morning and you are told you can t buy coffee because their staff hasn t arrived  will you accept that  Even the Europeans won t accept tardiness   However  Chen Bikui  a partner at Liuhe Ventures who invests in enterprise software startups  said he doubted that DingTalk would succeed abroad  citing issues like privacy concerns in the West  
 DingTalk is so much tailored to Chinese companies   it would be hard for it to be adopted by companies from other countries   he said ",2018-08-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/ding-alwayson-alibaba-office-app-fuels-backlash-among-chinese-workers-1558916,1558916

fiscal 2018 results  wherein both top and bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second straight quarter  Results benefited from robust performance by the Americas segment  store openings over a year s time and ownership change in the East China business  Also  comparable sales form China rebounded  following a decline in the last reported quarter Earnings  Sales   Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 62 cents per share surpassed the consensus mark of 59 cents and grew 13  on a year over year basis Total sales came in at  6 3 billion  which outpaced the consensus estimate of  6 19 billion and increased 10 6  from the year ago level  The upside was driven by robust new store performance  comparable sales growth and consolidation of the company s East China business Global comparable store sales increased 3  compared with 1  registered in the third quarter of fiscal 2018  Global comps were driven by a 4  increase in average ticket  However  transactions decreased by 1  compared with a decline of 2  in the preceding quarter In the quarter under review  Starbucks opened 604 net new stores worldwide  bringing the total store count to 29 324 across 78 markets  It plans to build 600 net new stores annually in Mainland China  which will double the market s store count to 6 000 across 230 cities from the figure at fiscal 2017 end  In the fourth quarter  the company opened 139 stores in China Margin Downtrend ContinuesOn a non GAAP basis  operating margin contracted 190 basis points  bps  year over year to 18 1   The decline can be attributed to an impact of investments associated with the U S  tax law change  product mix shift largely toward food and planned partner  Rise in costs due to investment in digitalization and unfavorable impact of 40 bps associated to the Nestl  transaction also dented the company s operating margin  Higher spending in its store partners  employees  along with the impact of its ownership

94406,315921,SBUX,BOJA Or SBUX  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Retail   Restaurants stocks are likely familiar with Bojangles  BOJA  and Starbucks  SBUX   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  Bojangles is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Starbucks has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that BOJA s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
BOJA currently has a forward P E ratio of 22 79  while SBUX has a forward P E of 25 22  We also note that BOJA has a PEG ratio of 1 82  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  SBUX currently has a PEG ratio of 1 87 
Another notable valuation metric for BOJA is its P B ratio of 2 07  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  SBUX has a P B of 70 40 
Based on these metrics and many more  BOJA holds a Value grade of B  while SBUX has a Value grade of C 
BOJA is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that BOJA is likely the superior value option right now ",2018-12-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/boja-or-sbux-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200364505,200364505
94407,315922,SBUX,Starbucks Won t Return To Growth Glory  But It s A Solid Stock Long Term,opinion,"Shares of Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  are coming back  Their late surge in 2018 has put this coffee chain company in the club of a few consumer stocks that are still posting double digit gains this year after a massive selloff in the fourth quarter 
Is this resurgence a sign that the company s frappuccinos and pumpkin spiced lattes are back in demand or an indication that the company s turnaround efforts are paying off 

In our view  investors are regaining confidence in Starbucks stock after seeing a rebound in store traffic and improved profitability  In the fiscal fourth quarter  earnings per share came in at  0 62   0 02 better than expected  and global same store sales rose by a strong 3  from a year earlier 
U S  Same Store Sales Show Promise
To keep things in perspective  this rebound came after many years of dismal performance  especially in the U S  home market  where Starbucks runs 14 000 stores  U S  comparable sales growth since 2015 has averaged less than half what it had been in the previous three years 
For some  this weakness was a sign that the company is losing its status as a top  growth oriented  food retailer that managed to raise its earnings at a 20  plus rate for many years 
The company reported U S  same store sales growth of 4  in the fourth quarter as more customers bought beverages  This was well ahead of the 2 7  growth Wall Street had forecast for the period 
To counter its slowdown in the U S   Starbucks is closing 150 company operated stores during the next fiscal year  three times the annual number it historically shutters  In its new turnaround plan  America s suburbs and China are the two areas that will drive future growth 
The company anticipates that more than 80  of store growth over the next few years will come from drive through locations  particularly in suburban Middle America and the South 
Time To Look At Dividends Rather Than Growth
Bill Ackman  a billionaire hedge fund manager who accumulated more than  900 million in stock  thinks Starbucks shares have huge upside potential and could double in the next three years 
According to his presentation  China is Starbucks  massive long term growth opportunity where coffee consumption is rising  With its first mover advantage  premium positioning and the rollout of delivery services through Alibaba s  NYSE BABA  Ele me platform  Starbucks has a competitive advantage in the world s second largest economy that is hard to match  Ackman says 
In our view  it will probably be tough for Starbucks to repeat its last decade of performance when its shares returned about 1000   including dividends  as consumers are becoming more health conscious and shunning sugary drinks 
But Starbucks stock still has a great appeal for long term investors whose aim is to earn steadily growing income  As the company matures and enters a period of slowing growth  it has been returning more and more cash to investors 
One rarely finds a dividend stock yielding more than 2  that offers such impressive dividend growth  During the past three years  Starbucks delivered about 24  average dividend growth per share and with a median payout ratio of about 42  over the last four years  that pace of cash return doesn t look likely to slow anytime soon 
When it presented its long term strategic plan in June  Starbucks also announced it would return  25 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends through fiscal year 2020  That represented a  10 billion jump from the cash return target announced in November last year 
Bottom Line
The Street s opinion on whether Starbucks will rebound is divided  The stock might prove to be a great turnaround bet if its growth returns in the U S  and the China story proves to be as good as some investors believe  Either way  we believe Starbucks is a good long term investment and investors should take advantage of any future weakness in its share price 
Starbucks shares trade at a very reasonable valuation and with the company s aggressive share repurchase plan and robust growth in its payout  it offers a good risk reward equation for the buy and hold investors ",2018-12-04,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-wont-return-to-growth-glory-but-its-a-solid-stock-long-term-200364597,200364597

94411,315926,SBUX,Your Money  How to wade into the daunting waters of flood insurance,news," In July 31 story  corrects date of congressional approval to Tuesday instead of Wednesday  paragraph 6  By Beth Pinsker NEW YORK  Reuters    Donna Childs recently bought a home in Rhode Island about 5 minutes from the Pocasset River  and  despite past flooding  everyone told her she did not need flood insurance   As a risk management expert  she knew better    I m far from the water  but basically for the cost of a Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   coffee   I can have insurance   Childs  author of  Prepare for the Worst  Plan for the Best   said in a recent interview  Many people decide to invest in flood insurance policies after a scary weather event  But sometimes they let the insurance lapse because it is too expensive  and also because they might misunderstand that familiar term from news and weather reports   100 year flood    It is natural to think that  100 year flood  means that once a big flood hits  you then have 99 more years before you have to worry about another one  But what it actually refers to is a flood event that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year  said Lynne McChristian  consultant with the Insurance Information Institute and a professor of risk management at Florida State University   Even the U S  government  which provides funding for the National Flood Insurance Program  floodsmart gov   is examining whether flood insurance is worth the cost  The 50 year old program was set to expire by July 31  but Congress on Tuesday approved a stopgap extension hours before the deadline to take it through hurricane season   With so many recent flooding disasters   from hurricanes Sandy  Harvey and Maria to unnamed ones like the waters that overtook Ellicott City  Maryland  in May   payouts are huge  raising the cost of premiums   Since flood insurance tends to be bought only by certain residents of the most danger prone areas  it is expensive because the risk pool is not large enough to spread around the cost  The NFIP has only about 5 million policies in force  despite the fact that flooding can hit any part of the United States at any time  even if it is only a creek overflow or sewer backup   FINE PRINT The biggest mistake people make with flood insurance is that they believe it is included with their homeowners  policy  In reality  it is specifically excluded   While the lack of coverage is usually noted in a footnote on annual declarations for homeowners  policies  some states are making an effort to better inform consumers  Florida  for instance  mandates that policy statements point this out in big bold letters   Many homeowners also think that in the event of flooding  the Federal Emergency Management Agency will come to their aid  Yet FEMA grants come into play only in major disasters  and even then they will likely not cover the cost to rebuild your home  Most funds available to homeowners are in the form of loans   For those who do wade into the flood insurance process  the government is not the only option  said Craig Poulton  an insurance consultant based in Utah  Private companies broker policies for the National Flood Insurance Program  and there are also fully private policies  underwritten by insurance companies   The range of coverage is large  Donna Childs  very low risk house costs just  350 a year to insure against flooding  A mansion on a coastal waterway in Florida may run  2 500 or more  On average  homeowners pay  700 annually for flood insurance  according to the Insurance Information Institute  The NFIP will insure only up to  250 000 in losses  but private insurance can go into the millions   The amount is largely determined by the flood map for your area  which assigns risk zones  These are drawn with very broad strokes   not gerrymandered like political precincts   HOW TO SAVE First  decide what risk you are willing to take and how much you are comfortable spending for protection  The best way to save is to obtain a flood elevation certificate specifically for your house  which could cost from  500 to  800 from a survey company or engineer   If you live in a high risk area but happen to be in a safer section  you could shave hundreds of dollars a year off your insurance bill   Some municipalities are jumping in to help residents get these certificates  New York City  for one  has a pilot program funded by Hurricane Sandy recovery money to provide free certificates for homeowners  said Rachel Stein  deputy director of sustainability and resiliency for the Center for NYC Neighborhoods   Another way to lower costs is to install flood vents in your crawl spaces to help give the water a path to exit your house instead of building up   
When purchasing flood insurance  you could also consider a policy to cover just the structure of your house and not the contents to save money  It is a risky move if a flood hits  because if water comes into your house  all of your stuff will be soggy ",2018-08-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/your-money-how-to-wade-into-the-daunting-waters-of-flood-insurance-1554155,1554155

94413,315928,SBUX,Gold Stocks  Twin Technical Turbos,opinion,"The double bottom is the world s most stressful chart pattern  It forms after a significant price decline  The first low in the pattern creates substantial panic and fear in most investors 
The second low in the pattern is  softer   but no less dangerous to emotionally vulnerable investors  The volume is generally weak and the price action makes investors feel like they are in some kind of financial gulag 

Then the sun bursts out from behind those financial clouds  and glorious upside action begins  Spectacular price action on this daily gold chart 
The long term fundamentals and liquidity flows for gold should never be confused with the medium or short term  In the long term  the biggest driver of gold price appreciation is the Chindian  wealth effect  
It s all about Chinese and Indian citizens growing their standard of living and buying ever more gold to celebrate the good times 
In the West  inflation is the most potent driver of the gold price and America is beginning an enormous inflation cycle that will likely continue for fifteen to twenty years 
As Chindians bring respect to gold as an asset class  Western gold bugs won t need to hide in the closet when they buy it because everybody will be able to get it online from companies like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  
It will be as mundane as buying a coffee at Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  is now  but much more profitable 
In a nutshell  the love trade of three billion Chindians combined with the inflation trade of at least 500 million Westerners will soon completely restore gold s shimmer and place as the ultimate asset 

All investors should keep their eye on the price action taking place on this long term gold chart  Note the RSI oscillator  It s poised to leap above 50 and that s in sync with the arrival of Chinese New Year seasonality 
Some heavyweight money managers believe that an inflationary surprise is coming to America  and it could happen as early as this Friday s jobs report 

A surprising uptick in US wage inflation is imminent and it will be a tremendous tail wind for silver s upside price action  I don t know if that inflationary surprise happens in Friday s jobs report or not  but I do want investors to be positioned to get richer if it occurs 
In the short term precious metals market  I might be shorting GDX  NYSE GDX  via Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares  NYSE DUST   although the good news is that I currently hold Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares  NYSE NUGT    but that has nothing to do with the fabulous long term fundamentals in play for the entire precious metals market 
At my short term  trading service the average NUGT DUST or UDOW SDOW trade lasts only a week or two  I increased my average trade size threefold yesterday  to enhance the adrenaline rush and the profits  with professionally managed risk  Investors should always separate trading accounts from long term core position investing accounts  They are as different as night and day 

Jay Powell had to  blink  with rate hikes and so did Donald Trump with tariff taxes or the US stock market would have incinerated yesterday  So  when Trump  supersized  Powell s blink with his tariffs blink  the US stock market rocketed higher and I promptly sold half my UDOW swing trade position as the market opened  From there  the rally faded  Pros sold the news 
In the big picture  I think most stock market bulls and bears are working a bit too hard to predict either  make my stock market great  higher prices or the end of the bull market 
It s simply later in the US business cycle now than it was a year ago  and it will be even later as 2019 gets underway  As the cycle matures  volatility typically grows and that makes analysts a bit desperate about trying to figure out what comes next 
Reality check  What comes next is vastly much wilder price action than has occurred at any point in this bull market  That s just what happens as earnings fade and inflation rises in an environment of debt worship 

Whether it s the US government s maniacal obsession with debt growth and citizen extortion via income and capital gains taxation  the emergence of wage inflation  the negative effect of quantitative tightening on corporate stock buyback programs  or the inverting yield curve  what matters is that it s all happening in the late stage of the business cycle  Price volatility is poised to go  off the charts  in 2019 as these forces intensify dramatically and synergistically 
Stock market investors should not waste time trying to figure out what comes next  There s only one course of obvious tactical action for long term US stock market investors  and that is  Reduce trade size now 
With the daily gold chart looking spectacular  what can gold stock investors expect  Well  for 2018 I ve predicted that the  tax loss selling  of the past few years will be confined mainly to the tiny CDNX listed juniors  GDX  GDXJ  and SIL and their component stocks are in great shape and poised to join gold in a  shotgun  move higher for the medium term 

This is the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX  daily chart  GDX is sporting dual inverse head and shoulders patterns 
From a technical perspective  GDX can be viewed as a sports car with twin technical turbos that is revving its engine now  GDX appears poised to rise to the minor highs around  20 50  and then race straight to my  23 50 target zone 
There could be some wild volatility around Friday s jobs report and the December 19 Fed meeting  but the dual H S patterns are a powerful technical force to be reckoned with  When both the short term technicals and the long term fabulous fundamentals are weighed carefully  most gold stock investors should be in great spirits and ready for the upside journey of a lifetime ",2018-12-04,Stewart Thomson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-stocks-twin-technical-turbos-200365116,200365116

94415,315930,SBUX,Delivered hot  Starbucks bets on Alibaba tie up to revive China sales,news,"By Brenda Goh and Pei Li
SHANGHAI  Reuters     Starbucks Corp   O SBUX  is partnering with  Alibaba   N BABA  to deliver its coffee in Chinese cities starting this fall  betting the move will revive sales growth in its second largest market that is witnessing aggressive local competition 
Starbucks flagged in June that it was pursuing such a tie up after reporting a sudden slowdown in China sales growth  which it blamed partly on a crackdown on third party delivery firms that had previously helped drive orders at its cafes 
 I consider this strategic partnership to be one that     will just be rocket fuel for Starbucks  growth and continued expansion in China   Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson told reporters in Shanghai on Thursday 
The Seattle based company will pilot delivery services from 150 Starbucks stores in Beijing and Shanghai and plans to expand that to more than 2 000 stores across 30 cities by the end of the year  Starbucks and Alibaba said in a joint statement 
Starbucks expects to start seeing some of the benefits from the partnership in the next quarter and the full impact in 2019  Johnson said 
The companies will collaborate across businesses within the Alibaba group  including delivery platform Ele me  supermarket chain Hema  online retailers Tmall and Taobao  and mobile and online payment platform Alipay  Starbucks will also open a virtual store on Alibaba s platforms where customers can buy Starbucks merchandise  they said 
The delivery program will leverage Ele me s 3 million registered riders  with an aim of delivering orders within half an hour  Starbucks will establish  Starbucks Delivery Kitchens  inside Hema stores and use the supermarket s delivery system to fulfill Starbucks delivery orders 
Starbucks had no formal online delivery in China before this deal 
Instead  unapproved third party delivery services had filled that gap by picking up bulk orders for their own customers  Analysts have said an official delivery arrangement would push up costs for Starbucks 
Starbucks said its delivery menu will only contain items that can meet its half hour deadline  but did not specify whether it will charge for the deliveries  Its pilot delivery program in Manhattan and Seattle a few years back fizzled partly because it charged too much   5 99 per delivery 
Luckin Coffee  a local startup that wants to go toe to toe with Starbucks  charges less than  1 per order and has said its deliveries took an average of 18 minutes 
Starbucks and Alibaba did not give financial details of the partnership and declined to say whether the companies had discussed taking equity stakes in each other 
Some parts of the agreement  including the Ele me tie up was exclusive  while others were not  Starbucks executives said  The partnership had been discussed for more than a year  the companies said 
OPPORTUNITY   COMPETITION
China has offered Starbucks rich pickings in recent years  thanks to a burgeoning cafe culture which has helped offset saturation in the United States  It has 3 400 stores in the country and plans to almost double that number by 2022 
But there is pressure from local companies such as Luckin  which has expanded rapidly and offers cheap delivery  online ordering  big discounts and premium pay for its staff 
Luckin said on Wednesday it planned to more than double its number of stores in China to 2 000 by the end of 2018 
Johnson acknowledged the competition but added that the significant opportunity in China made that unsurprising 
Starbucks  move to offer delivery  is in part to make sure they don t fall behind Luckin Coffee in terms of offering high quality delivery services  to a customer group of young office workers who do not want to stand in line  said Ben Cavender  an analyst at China Market Research Group 
The partnership is also a leg up for Ele me in its race for market share in the Chinese delivery market against Meituan Dianping  which is backed by gaming giant Tencent Holdings  HK 0700  

Ele me said last week that it will spend more on subsidies at a time when Meituan is preparing for a  4 billion Hong Kong listing ",2018-08-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/starbucks-alibabas-eleme-forge-coffee-delivery-tieup-in-china-1556538,1556538

94424,315939,SBUX,China s caffeine war  Fast growing Luckin brews up a threat to Starbucks,news,"By Pei Li and Adam Jourdan BEIJING SHANGHAI  Reuters    Qian Zhiya may be Starbucks  worst nightmare  The 42 year old Chinese entrepreneur says she is betting that her fledgling Luckin Coffee brand will eventually have more cafes in China than Starbucks  O SBUX   and she has Singapore s sovereign wealth fund and other investors bankrolling her plan  Luckin  which only officially launched in January  has opened more than 660 outlets in 13 Chinese cities thanks to a supercharged growth plan based on cheap delivery  online ordering  big discounts and premium pay for its staff  Its assault comes at a crucial time for Starbucks  which has 3 400 stores in China   its second biggest market after the U S    and plans to almost double that number by 2022  And the speed of the attack is a warning to other established consumer brands in China that they too could be vulnerable to a start up s attempt to reinvent a market  brand consultants say  Starbucks  shares were pummelled in June after it warned same store sales growth in China had plunged to zero or worse last quarter  against 7 percent growth a year earlier  Its fiscal third quarter results are due out on Thursday  Starbucks said some new caf  openings were cannibalising customer visits at nearby stores and it also blamed a drop off in orders through delivery firms  While it did not mention increased competition  investors and analysts said it is clear that Luckin does represent a threat   However  they also point out that Starbucks  brand has been very resilient to challenges from rivals around the world over the years  largely because of the ambience of its stores  its service and the consistent quality of the coffee served  There is also no sign that Chinese consumers have turned against such a very American brand as a protest over U S  President Donald Trump s imposition of punitive tariffs on Chinese exports  BIG PROMOTIONS Reuters spoke to 30 consumers in Beijing Yintai Center  a shopping mall that has a Starbucks  Costa Coffee and Luckin outlet  among others  Half of those polled said they had tried Luckin  most said they liked it  though more than two thirds said their top choice remained Starbucks  The majority drank coffee in store or bought to take away  with only a small number saying they had coffee delivered  a potential challenge for Luckin s delivery focused strategy  Taste  convenience and environment were their top three priorities  more than price  Luckin s customers can order coffee via an app  watch a livestream of their coffee being made  and have it delivered to their door in an average of 18 minutes  the company says  A regular latte  roughly the size of a Starbucks grande  costs 24 yuan plus 6 yuan for delivery  free delivery for orders of more than 35 yuan   but can be half price after promotions  A grande latte at Starbucks costs 31 yuan  More than half of Luckin s stores are larger  relax  outlets or pick up stores with some seating  The rest are delivery kitchens  The speed of Luckin s growth is extraordinary   it took Starbucks about 12 years to open as many stores  In many ways it echoes the way in which some major Chinese technology firms  such as ride hailing platform Didi Chuxing  have burned through cash to grab market share and been valued highly as a result  Qian  who was previously chief operating officer at Chinese ride hailing firm Ucar  says Luckin s focus now is all about increasing customers   I don t have a timeline for profit   Qian told Reuters at the firm s Beijing headquarters as she sipped her third Luckin coffee of the day   For us  what we care about now is the number of users and if they are coming back to us  whether they recognise us  whether we can take market share   The firm raised  200 million this month to help fund its expansion  including an undisclosed sum from Singapore government fund GIC  a funding round which Luckin said valued the firm at  1 billion   In the future we will have more cafes than Starbucks   she declared  One of the investors in the latest fundraising said it is the logical time for there to be a shake up of the coffee world in China   This model will appeal to young customers amid the country s consumption upgrade   said David Li  former head of Warburg Pincus Asia Pacific  He led the financing round for Luckin via his new investment firm Centurium Capital  The use of online ordering and delivery should be enough to unnerve many established brands  said Bruno Lannes  Shanghai based partner with consultancy Bain   Co   It s a big threat  that s why western brands need to pay attention   he said   FLASH MOB  Still  not everyone agrees the internet model translates easily to the coffee business  given the need for costly stores and quality control   It remains to be seen if they can really hook consumers in and create a monopoly in the market  like those we see in sectors like cab hailing   said Liu Xingliang  president of tech consultancy China Internet Data Center  And some of the consumers Reuters spoke to in the Beijing mall saw hurdles ahead for Luckin  Liu Xu  23  an advertising professional  who compares Luckin to a  flash mob  that came out of nowhere  said he tried the firm s coffee out of curiosity but prefers hand drip single origin coffee  And Lian Yiheng  22  a student  said she was attracted by Luckin s promotions and the convenience of delivery  but felt it needed to improve its selection of coffees and store decoration to lure people in the longer run  Qian said the plan was to have more sit in stores and reduce the proportion of delivery only outlets  which would require higher spending on setting up in better locations and on d cor  On the question of quality  she says that it uses select arabica beans from Ethiopia  Luckin s expansion comes as Starbucks  global rivals  like Canadian chain Tim Hortons  are also pushing hard in China  Tim Hortons plans to open 1 500 outlets in China over the next 10 years  while smaller local chains are also popping up fast  As China s middle class continues to increase in size and the coffee chains move into many smaller towns and cities  the market is growing at 5 7 percent a year  according to research firm Mintel  Li Yibei  owner of Double Win Caf   which has a chain of eight coffee shops in Shanghai  said Luckin would have an impact on the market  but there was plenty of space left   Maybe they will hit Starbucks to some extent  but remember Starbucks has many die hard fans  Maybe they can grab some followers from them  but I don t think that many   she said  Starbucks may also soon be moving more formally into online delivery in China  Howard Schultz  Starbucks  departing executive chairman  said in Shanghai this month that he was close friends with Jack Ma  the head of  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd  N BABA   which controls food delivery platform Ele me   and suggested the two could work together on Starbuck s online delivery in China  Schultz also said he isn t wasn t worried about the China slowdown

and a record breaking run to unicorn status by a Chinese coffee startup suggests it is not cooling yet  Luckin Coffee took just six months to reach a  1 billion  unicorn  valuation  a performance that is helping boost investor appetite for Chinese startups  even as they estimate that valuations are far outstripping U S  ones  This month at Hong Kong s RISE technology conference  a key stop on the Asian venture capital circuit  investors told Reuters that startups in China were 30 to 40 percent more expensive than their U S  counterparts and in some cases  were even valued at twice the price    If I put my U S  lenses on  this is insane   said Edith Yeung  partner at 500 Startups  a California based venture capital firm  But  she said  the calculus for investors was the sheer size of the Chinese market  noting that the WeChat social media platform had three times more daily users than the population of the United States   Everything is sort of relative   Yeung said  BREWING COFFEE  NOT BUBBLES Luckin Coffee typifies the optimism evident in China s start up scene  The Beijing based coffee delivery firm only began operating in January and has plans to expand its 660 strong network to challenge Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   with 3 400 stores  Detractors point out that Luckin s fast growth has relied heavily on cut price promotions and warn it also faces heavy competition from other chains such as Canada s Tim Horton s  Its backers still see value however    Luckin s valuation is not cheap or lofty   it s reasonable   said David Li  head of Centurium Capital  The former head of Warburg Pincus Asia Pacific led Luckin s recent  200 million financing round and maintains it is not a conventional start up  pointing to a management of experienced  serial entrepreneurs  At the other end of the scale from Luckin sits Ant Financial  ANTFIN UL   the Chinese payments giant that became the world s largest unicorn in June when it secured  14 billion in fresh funds that valued the

94476,315991,SBUX,Sugar  Coffee Seen Joining Cocoa In Q4 Rally As Prices  Demand Turn,opinion,"Sugar and arabica coffee seem ready to share the bullish spotlight with cocoa  This potential fourth quarter rally would come as exhaustion in their price downside occurs just before year end festivities across the globe raise demand for such soft commodities 
 Low prices cure low prices and I think we have seen the lows of the year for sugar and arabica   said James Cordier  founding broker and analyst for soft commodities at Optionsellers com in Tampa  Florida  He added 

 Cocoa has had a nice rally over the last couple of months and we don t see it going up a whole lot  but we do see sugar and coffee being good performers between now and the fourth quarter  


Cocoa has been the number 1 performing commodity of 2018  having gained 16 percent year to date 
In the case of sugar  the front month October contract in New York gained more than 9 percent after hitting 10 year lows  below 10 cents a pound a month ago  helped by charts indicating extreme oversold conditions 
Sugar Near 2 Month High

While Wednesday s settlement of 10 76 marks the first positive finish in four sessions for October sugar  the contract has also seen four successive weeks of gains since August 19  The peak was a two month high of 11 80  achieved last week 
Investing com s technical outlook has mixed calls on October sugar  with the strongest Level 3 Fibonacci resistance indicated at 10 92 meaning the contract could rise another one to two cents  Mike Seery of Seery Futures in Plainfield  Illinois  said October sugar was trading above the 20 day moving average but under the 100 day MA  resulting in the mixed trend 
 It looks to me that a  V  bottom has been formed as prices bottomed out on August 22nd at  9 91   Seery wrote in a commentary  adding that  all of the poor fundamental news has already been reflected into the price  
Shawn Hackett of Hackett Financial Advisors in Boca Raton  Florida  said dramatic reductions in EU sugar beet production due to drought had also sparked the rebound in the sweetener s prices from August lows  Reduced acres and large use of sugar for ethanol making provided additional support  he said 
But Hackett also noted the strong rally of the past month was also a red flag  as normally  prices retest lows after an initial major low   He urged sugar bulls to be cautious of a possible setback in coming weeks 
Cordier was more optimistic  saying he expected March sugar  which some traders preferred as a benchmark over October  to reach above 13 cents over the next three months from Wednesday s settlement at 11 64   I think if we rally to 13 cents on March  that will be a pretty good performance  considering both the supply and demand that will be coming out of India   he said 
Festivities Ensure Demand
The fourth quarter is usually the heaviest period for sugar consumption in India  the second largest producer of the sweetener after Brazil  A string of religious and other festivals over the next two months result in huge demand for sweets and other delicacies in mostly Hindu India  beginning with October s  Navarathiri   the nine night celebration of the goddess triumvirate Durga  Saraswati  Lakshmi  and culminating with late November s  Diwali   or the festival of lights 
In the western world  meanwhile  the celebrations of Thanksgiving  Hanukkah  Christmas and the New Year holiday also lead to heightened demand for sugar during this period  as the eating and giving of chocolates and baked delicacies become a main event  Premium coffee chains  including Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   Retail Food Group s  AX RFG  Gloria Jean s and Whitbread s  LON WTB  Costa are known to have some of their highest sales in the fourth quarter 
For coffee  Cordier says he expects the March arabica contract to hit  1 15 a lb by the year end  versus Wednesday s settlement of  1 0005

Other than the apparent bottoming out in coffee prices and year end retail demand  arabica could see steadily lower output from here through 2020  said Cordier

94477,315992,SBUX,Why Sound Valuation Is More Important Than Time In The Market ,opinion,"Introduction
I believe that two of the most important investing principles that prudent investors should embrace are valuation and time in the market  Consequently  the title of this article is mildly misleading  because both concepts are extremely important towards achieving long term investing success  In other words  I believe attempting to argue the importance of one over the other is a waste of time and energy  What is truly important is to understand the significance of both concepts  and then embrace them both intellectually and practically while implementing your investing strategies  Together  these two strategies are powerful 
Additionally  this article was inspired by comments made in my previous article suggesting that time in the market is more important than valuation  Consequently  I took the devil s advocate with my title  However  to properly debate these issues  we must evaluate what the word  important  means and how it applies  My interpretation would suggest that importance is determined by identifying which principle leads to the highest long term rates of return  In simpler terms  which will make you more money  time in the market or being disciplined to only purchase when valuation is attractive  Furthermore  importance would also relate to which principle controls risk better 
Time In The Market  Versus  Market Timing
One of the primary aspects that distinguish investors from speculators is the amount of time they are willing or considering committing to  Investors tend to take a long term view  while speculators are shorter run oriented  Consequently  for clarity  it would be useful to attempt to define long term versus short term  To me  the long run when investing in equities implies owning them for at the minimum over a complete business cycle  A business cycle typically runs between a minimum of 3 to 5 years or longer 
This is important because it relates to how and over what timeframe a business generates returns for its owners shareholders  Businesses make money for their shareholders by profitably selling products and or services to customers  Moreover  businesses tend to report their progress over quarterly and annual timeframes  In other words  it takes time for businesses to make the money from which to reward their owners  Even though a growing business is constantly becoming more valuable  it takes time for that value to manifest in a meaningful way 
With this concept in mind  consider the reality that short term stock price movements might not be truly indicative of the true value of a publicly traded company at any specific point in time  This is true because the actual cash flows  profits and business opportunities  etc  are usually not publicly available except when companies file their quarterly or annual reports  Consequently  short term price volatility is by its nature speculative 
The above applies to both public and private operating businesses  However  with publicly traded businesses there are minute by minute and hour by hour daily trading activities occurring when the markets are open  This provides a very important liquidity advantage  but it also provides enticements that can be financially dangerous  More simply stated  a rising price can tweak people s greed whereas a falling price can elicit fear  In either case  irrational decisions are prone to be made  Emotions can and often do cause people to buy when they should sell   and vice versa  Additionally  short term price volatility is highly unpredictable in great part simply because it is often emotionally charged 
Nevertheless  people have historically   and will in the future   continue to try and time the market  always have  always will  This behavior continues notwithstanding the reality that a preponderance of evidence suggests that market timing cannot be accomplished except by chance  Stated differently  short term market timing tends to work until it doesn t  Sure  market timing occasionally does produce enticing results  but those results are typically followed by disastrous ones  Consequently  market timing is speculation and a very close cousin to gambling 
In contrast  time in the market implies investing behavior where the investor positions themselves as an owner partner of the business they chose to invest in  Owners partners do not intend to impetuously sell their ownership  instead  they intend to participate in the long term results they believe the businesses can generate on their behalf  Consequently  true owner partners are less likely to react to short term volatility because their focus is on business results instead  Therefore  rather than obsessing over minute by minute price quotations  they place their attention on evaluating quarterly and annual reports 
In summary  time in the market works because it aligns the investor with the operating success that their business achieves  However  at this point  it s important to understand and acknowledge that operating success is functionally related to growth  The better the company s growth rate  the more cash flows  earnings and dividends it can provide to its stakeholders  In other words  a faster growing company produces a much greater income stream that can be shared by its owners thereby making it more valuable as time passes than a slower growing business  Importantly  this is where valuation comes into play 
Fair Valuation Is a Mathematical Reality Not an Opinion
In my personal experience when dealing with investors I have anecdotally surmised that people often confuse fair value with the commonly used metrics to measure it  This is where arguments arise about what is the best metric to value a stock with   P E ratios  PEG ratios  multiples of free cash flow  enterprise value to EBITDA  etc  Personally  I think these debates are silly because all the aforementioned metrics  and others  can be skillfully utilized in order to ascertain a business  intrinsic value relative to its fundamental strengths  Moreover  certain metrics are more applicable to certain kinds of businesses  Nevertheless  I believe that intrinsic value or fair value can be calculated  and more importantly should be calculated  within reasonable ranges of error and or accuracy 
Valuation is not in the eyes of the beholder  nor is it arbitrary or capricious  Moreover  there is a difference between historical  current and future valuation calculations  Historical valuation calculations are generally factual because they are based on actual reported and generated fundamentals  Current valuations are related to historical results because past success does leave clues to future success  It is certainly true that past results do not guarantee future results  However  it is also true that companies with great track records tend to continue being great companies in the future 
Of course  there are always exceptions  but exceptions are not and should not be the rule  This relates to additional debates suggesting that quality is paramount and trumps valuation  However  quality is typically evaluated based on the company s past results  Dividend Aristocrats  AA rated or better stocks  companies with little debt or great historical growth achievements are typical examples of so called quality 
In contrast  future valuations are the most subjective and difficult to calculate  The future is always uncertain  but as investors  we can only invest in the future  Consequently  it is my opinion at least  that it is incumbent upon us to have a clear idea  estimate or forecast of what the future results a company we are considering investing in can generate 
Finally  with all that said  the same mathematical principles apply to all valuation calculations  Whether we are ascertaining historical value  current value or future value  it all comes down to simple mathematics  Stated more clearly  do the numbers support the valuations  This question then begs another question  What do the numbers have to be to represent attractive or sound valuation  Although I would admit that there is no exact answer to either those questions  there are certainly reasonable ranges of answers that most people would accept or agree upon 
To my way of thinking  the best way to understand sound valuation is to think about it from the perspective of a business owner  In this vein  you should be asking yourself whether the business is generating a high enough return through its internal operations to reward you for the risk you are taking by owning it  One thing that I hope all investors and or traders would agree upon is that investing in publicly traded stocks is risky  Consequently  one of our primary objectives should be determining whether we are being adequately compensated for the risk we are taking  In plain terms  what rate of return or rates of return would be acceptable and what rates would not  At the end of the day  this is what value investing is all about 
Consequently  I ask you to answer the above questions for yourself  What for you is an acceptable rate of return  Would it be 6   7   10   15   20    or plug in your own number  Once you determine this  then ask yourself if the companies you own or are considering owning in the future  are capable of generating those returns through their business results  Not how the market is currently and temporarily treating the market prices of these companies  but how the companies are internally generating revenues  cash flows and profits on your behalf 
With that said  here is the important part  Fair valuation is relative to the internal operating results of the business and not its recent stock market performance  What people are currently willing to pay to invest in the stock is not controlled by the company management or the business results  In other words  management cannot control their stock market price  they can only have control over how the business performs  It is precisely for this reason that market price does not always reflect intrinsic value 
This is the heart and soul of Ben Graham s famous metaphor   in the short run the market is a voting machine  but in the long run it s a weighing machine   I can t count the number of times I shared his quote  but I can easily count how many times people have recognized its value and or its true meaning  Nevertheless  regarding fair valuation  it always comes down to running the numbers out to their logical conclusion  More precisely  don t just invest in a stock hoping that it will make you money  Instead  estimate how much growth you believe the company can generate and then calculate what rate of return that income stream would produce for you  If you cannot do this within a reasonable range of accuracy  then you are speculating  not investing 
Once you ve answered the questions above regarding what rate of return you would consider acceptable  there is a simple way to determine whether the stock you are considering meets those objectives without speculating on future stock price movement  Simply calculate the current earnings yield  This is a simple calculation  instead of price divided by earnings  P E ratio  you simply divide the earnings by price  E P   In my opinion  nothing provides an indication of current fair value better than the earnings yield calculation 
The earnings yield is telling you what your return  yield  would be if you owned 100  of the business and it paid you 100  of its profits  Therefore  don t just simply say the P E ratio is 20  or the P E ratio is 15  or the P E ratio is 30  Instead  understand what earnings yields those P E ratios represent  Again  this is the essence of sound valuation  This process is empowering you to answer the simple question  does this compensate me for the risk I m taking 
Finally  as a value investor  the only reason I would accept a low current earnings yield would be if I expected future growth to be extremely high  Because  if that were to occur  then my future earnings yield would be high enough to compensate me for my risk  However  this is also one of the reasons why high growth stocks are riskier than blue chip dividend paying stocks  It s hard to grow fast enough long enough for a current low  earnings yield  to produce a high enough future earnings yield 
FAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video Valuation Versus Time in The Market
Both time in the market and investing prudently at sound valuation participate in the important investing concept  the time value of money   The time value of money is important because it encompasses both the present value and the future value of money  The basic principle can be summed up by stating that a dollar in your hand today is worth more than a dollar that is collected in the future  Without going into too much detail  the money you have today can earn you future money  where money you re going to receive in the future you must wait for before you can use it to make money 
The following video will review the importance of valuation versus time in the market on Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   Campbell Soup Company  NYSE CPB  and FactSet Research Systems Inc  NYSE FDS  

Summary and Conclusions
In this part 1 of a 2 part series  I attempted to articulate the philosophy of valuation and time in the market  Personally  I believe both concepts are extremely important for true investors to embrace  We should be prudent with how we initially invest our money  and once invested  we should be patient enough to allow the business we own the time to make us money 
In part 2  I will focus more on the simple mathematics that valuation is all about  With the next article I will attempt to illustrate that valuation is not some vague notion  A true understanding of valuation is based on simple mathematical principles that are rooted in common sense  Metrics such as the P E ratio are only measuring sticks or barometers  if you will  that provides a quick insight into whether a common stock is overvalued or not 
In closing  it doesn t make sense to me to take a high risk for low a reward  Valuation is a great risk mitigator  certainly not the only one  but a very important one that can be easily implemented and practically applied with patience and a little understanding of what the true essence of valuation is  In part 2  I will be providing these concepts by showing the simple mathematics that supports the philosophy

94478,315993,SBUX,Underperforming Properties  A Pain In Starbucks  Assets,opinion,"Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  is one of the world s most recognized quick service restaurants with over 28 000 locations worldwide  The high consumer demand for their premium coffee has led to a Starbucks on nearly every metropolitan corner   or so it seems 
Not all of their stores  however  are making the grind  Starbucks announced in a recent press release that they plan to close 150 stores in 2019  150 Out of 28 000 hardly seems to be a matter of concern  but this figure is three times their annual store closure average  In a typical year  Starbucks normally closes only around 50 stores 
Why Is Starbucks Closing 3x The Number Of Stores In 2019 
Having multiple locations within a limited demographic area creates an over saturation of the market and leads to cannibalism of each other s profitability  As better locations become available  older non performing stores are traded out when their leases expire to make room for more income growth at the superior location 

Once in a while  a Starbucks location will not perform as well as their feasibility study indicated  If that location cannot meet brew up enough income  the corporate office will not accept the next renewal option 
The New Starbuck s Initiatives
Starbucks will be implementing several new initiatives in 2019 which will affect income growth and expansionary decisions 

Focus will be shifted away from over caffeinated urban markets and into unaddicted markets in the South and Midwest 
Sugar and calorie dense coffee offerings  think Frappuccinos  will move over and make way for more health conscience offerings such as teas and natural refreshers 
Continued vigorous expansion into foreign markets   predominately China   with less aggressive expansion in the U S 
Digitizing coffee through their new app and their redesigned Starbucks Rewards program 

How Will Starbucks  2019 Initiatives Affect Stock Investors  
Opening up new under caffeinated markets will position Starbucks to unlock previously untapped income sources  Acting on health and wellness behavioral trends will keep their customer base solid  Plus the rewards potential for caffeinating over 1 3 billion Chinese seems unimaginable 
This shift in perspective  however  is coming at a cost  The predicted 2018 third quarter sales growth of 1  is a far cry from Wall Street s estimate of 3   It will be the company s weakest sales performance in nine years  according to Bloomberg News  The growth rate over the next two years is forecasted to increase somewhere between 6 to 10  annually  This is in harmony with their average growth over the last couple of years 
Starbucks wants to ensure that its shareholders do not take the temporary profitability decline as a sign of weakness  They will be dramatically increasing their payments to shareholders through the 2020 fiscal year  Dividend payouts and buybacks will total  25 billion   a  10 billion increase over previous payouts 
These actions seem to be following a 10 year trend  Back in 2008  Starbucks closed 600 of their underperforming stores and worked hard to rebuild brand trust through the  My Starbucks Idea  exchange and social media based marketing  It was a good move  Shares hit rock bottom in November 2008 at  4 47 but then nearly doubled one year later at  11 37  Now  10 years later  the 52 week high crossed  61 00 

Stock price inconsistency since 2015 indicates that another strong initiative is needed  Shareholders love consistency   but companies that do not change  grow  and reorganize eventually begin to taste like stale coffee   something Starbucks abhors 
Should a triple increase in store closings concern shareholders  Absolutely not  Underperforming leases that are expiring will simply not be renewed  Those that need to be closed before the lease expiration will be paid their early termination fees and Starbucks will cut their losses and move on to what s brewing in better neighborhoods  The saved rent will be funneled into more profitable and less saturated markets 
How Will Starbucks  Store Closings Affect Real Estate Investors  
Similar to many other national corporations  Starbucks does not own their individual locations   even their freestanding buildings  They prefer to lease rather than own  The 2019 directive to close 150 stores means that a minimum of 150 property owners are going to be dealing with a devastating vacancy of a tenant that pays an average of  60 00 per square foot for a 2 000 square foot building 
Should Starbuck s reorganization actions deter investors from purchasing properties with a Starbuck s tenant  Not necessarily   if you know what to watch out for  While Starbucks is an investment grade tenant with an upper medium investment rating  they are known for playing hardball when it comes to lease negotiation  Investors need to be aware of their new negotiation tactics 
A typical lease with Starbucks will be for an initial 10 year term with several 5 year options and 10  rent increases at the start of each option  Most leases are net net lease which will hold the landlord responsible for roof maintenance and structural repairs  This should not be much of a concern for investors since most locations will be of new construction and should carry a roof warranty  If so  then investors would effectively be looking at a NNN lease situation 
Investors will  however  want to keep a keen eye out for their newly demanded termination clause  New leases will allow Starbucks to terminate the lease in year 5 if they do not meet a certain dollar amount in sales  Also  watch out for clauses allowing sub lease arrangements  Both of these clauses will increase the risk of a Starbucks leased real estate investment 
We are also noticing that prior to the termination of the initial 10 year term  the Starbucks Corporation has been approaching landlords about signing a new 10 year lease rather than exercising their renewal option  Typically at the 10 year mark  Starbucks will renovate and upgrade the store  This usually requires significant capital investment to bring the store in harmony with their latest design layout  A new 10 year lease helps to ensure a return on their capital investment by securing the location 
While this sounds appealing to a property owner  there is a darker side to their offering  A new 10 year lease will allow them to try and sneak in the termination and sub let clauses which may not have existed in the initial lease agreement 
An early termination clause will add a degree of investment risk  Yet  this creates a case of the coffee cup that is half empty versus half full  While an early termination clause gives the tenant a way out  knowing that Starbucks will be spending considerable funds to renovate the building and sign a longer lease indicates that they expect the location to remain profitable  Investors can create a little insurance of their own by including with the early termination clause a required 6 months  notice and a sizable early termination penalty 
The Starbucks Pain In The Assets
Like many national corporations  Starbucks rents their locations rather than owns them  This allows the company to focus on cash flow rather than equity on a balance sheet  The difficulty faced by Starbucks now is that their long term lease agreements pose a significant legal responsibility 
Early termination of a 10 year lease will result in either significant penalties or continued rental payments until another viable tenant is located  This creates a significant direct income loss  The closure of 600 stores back in 2008 cost Starbucks over  340 million in charges and write offs 

For the majority of Starbucks  locations  they will be bound to adhere to the lease   as painful as it may be   until the term expires  Locations that cannot support renovation to include a drive thru window may not be renewed  Many of the 150 store closings will most likely be older buildings without drive thrus   an acceptable pain in the assets in order to caffeinate the world ",2018-09-27,Eli Schultz,https://www.investing.com/analysis/underperforming-properties-are-a-pain-in-starbucks-assets-200345896,200345896
94479,315994,SBUX,Starbucks Bribes Shareholders To Hold On,opinion,"Starbucks  3Q sales growth was 1    1 3 of the analysis  estimates 
Forecasted sales growth through 2019 will be lower than normal 
Starbucks is promising shareholders higher than average dividends and share buybacks

Investors love Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX  because of their stable business operation  decade s long growth  and reliable returns  From here on through the next fiscal year  however  corporate offices are expecting lower than average profits and dismal sales growth 
This is disappointing to shareholders 
Factors Causing Weak Sales Growth for Starbucks
Analysts estimated that 3rd quarter sales growth in 2018 would reach 2 9   but the reality turned out to be only 1   According to Bloomberg News  this will be the company s  worst performance in about nine years  
There are several factors that are contributing to weak sales growth 

Starbucks will be closing 150 stores in 2019   3 times the annual average 
Continued attention will be directed toward expanding Starbucks  digital reach through active reward memberships and store digitalization 
Focus will be shifted away from conventional urban markets and into opening up new markets in the South and Midwest 
A new line of teas and natural refreshers will be released and need greater marketing 
Priority will continue to be placed on accelerating growth in China 

These are part of the new Starbucks  initiatives to reinvigorate customer interests which have been waning towards their line of heavier  calorie intense offerings  They are also positioning themselves to expand into secondary markets and reduce urban dominance  Caffeinating the 1 3 billion tea drinkers in China is also a high priority  These shifts are coming at a cost   albeit even if a temporary one  Fourth growth is anticipated at 3  to 4  with full year comps to come in just below their typical range of 3  to 5  
Starbucks is Bribing Shareholders to Stay Calm
The corporate office wants to assure their shareholders that a temporary slowing in profit growth is just that   temporary   and that the future for Starbucks is brighter than ever  To keep their shareholders  anxiety at bay  Starbucks will be dramatically increasing buybacks and dividend payouts to their shareholders through the 2020 fiscal year  The commitment to return  15 billion to shareholders was made last November and has since been increased to  25 billion according to the Q3 2018 Earnings Call 
The most recent dividend payment was made paid out on August 24th at  0 36 per share  This represented a 20  increase over the May payment  There are typically four dividend payments per year  The next dividend payment is predicted to fall on November 30th  The ex dividend date is approximately two weeks prior 

When you compare the closing share prices to the dividend payouts  owning SBUX shares for the dividend payment is a significant incentive  This is even more so when you consider that while the trailing annual dividend yield is currently at 2 24   up from 1 6  a year ago  is expected to increase over the next twelve months to 2 58  
The majority of the  25 billion  however  will be paid in the form of share buybacks  According to Starbucks  October 12 press release   the Company is currently executing a  5 billion accelerated share repurchase program  ASR  of the Company s common stock   They will be using proceeds from the completed transaction with Nestl  S A  to complete the ASR no later than March 2019 
So there s the carrot    25 billion in stockholder rewards   in exchange for some patience as Starbucks positions themselves for a Chinese caf  invasion and U S  market domination of hot and cold refreshments ",2018-10-15,Eli Schultz,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-is-bribing-shareholders-to-hold-on-200348520,200348520

94509,316024,SBUX,Seattle City Council repeals  head tax  weeks after enactment,news,"By Eric M  Johnson SEATTLE  Reuters    The Seattle City Council on Tuesday repealed a newly enacted  head tax  on the city s largest companies  including Amazon com  in the face of seemingly insurmountable big business opposition to a revenue measure meant to combat homelessness  The 7 2 vote in favor of repeal capped an acrimonious public hearing interrupted by chanting supporters of the tax  conceived in response to a local economic boom that has driven up real estate costs at the expense of the working class  The council s stunning reversal came as momentum was building for a referendum drive against the measure  just weeks after it was unanimously adopted by the council and signed into law by the mayor   This is a cowardly betrayal of the needs of the working people   Councilwoman Kshama Sawant  a leading proponent of the tax who voted against repeal  said to thunderous applause moments before the council completed its vote  But Councilwoman Lisa Herbold said she was reluctantly voting for repeal rather than drag the city through a protracted political fight she called  not winnable at this particular time    The opposition has unlimited resources   she added  Amazon com  O AMZN   the city s largest employer  was at the forefront of a coalition of businesses running a well financed campaign to place a repeal referendum on the ballot for the November elections  Amazon Vice President Drew Herdener hailed Tuesday s vote as  the right decision for the region s economic prosperity   The tax would have applied only to the city s largest companies by revenue  those grossing at least  20 million a year  It was expected to be borne by about 500 companies  Opponents had already collected nearly 46 000 signatures from voters in support of a repeal initiative  well more than the 17 000 needed to qualify for the ballot  according to the Downtown Seattle Association  a business group which led the petition drive  The effort quickly raised  300 000  including contributions of  25 000 each from Amazon and coffee retailer Starbucks  O SBUX   another major Seattle stalwart  and  30 000 from a grocers trade group  said Jon Scholes  president of the Seattle Association  HELP FOR THE HOMELESS The measure  passed on May 14  would have levied a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city to raise at least  45 million over five years  The revenues were earmarked to build affordable housing and furnish support services for the homeless  Sponsors of the tax said Seattle s biggest earning businesses should shoulder some burden for easing a low cost housing shortage they helped create through an over heated real estate market that has left the working poor and many middle class families unable to afford to live in the city  Opponents branded the measure a  tax on jobs  and said they feared it would spark an economic backlash  Amazon had threatened to abandon plans for a major downtown office building if the head tax was approved  After Tuesday s vote  Herdener said Amazon was committed to  being part of the solution to homelessness  and would continue to invest in nonprofit groups addressing the problem  Advocates for the poor say that rampant homelessness in the city is an extension of a larger crisis in affordable housing   They cite data showing Seattle s median home prices have soared to  820 000 and that 41 percent of renters ranked as  rent burdened   meaning they pay about a third or more of their income on housing   The Seattle metropolitan area is home to the nation s third largest concentration of homeless people  nearly 12 000 counted in a January U S  government survey and almost half of them living on the streets  
The debate has been closely watched by politicians in major cities nationwide  Last month  about 40 elected officials from across the country  some from local governments vying to host Amazon s second headquarters  published an open letter to Seattle in support of the head tax and expressing concern that Amazon opposed the measure ",2018-06-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/seattle-city-council-repeals-head-tax-weeks-after-enactment-1490367,1490367

1  Existing Home Sales  Trade War Turmoil in Focus
While potential developments on the trade war front will likely dominate trading direction  further evidence supporting the narrative of a strong U S  economy could lift investor sentiment 
Existing Home Sales due 10 00AM ET is expected to show a rise of 1 5  for May to 5 55 million units from 5 46 million units the prior month 
The ongoing exchange of trade salvos between the U S  and China prompted traders to flee risk assets in favour safe haven but JPMorgan said it s unlikely President Trump s latest tariffs would see daylight as it would hurt U S  businesses 
Trump s  400 billion tariff threat is unlikely to be imposed as it could hurt US companies as a significant portion of China s exports are Western products manufactured locally  JPMorgan said 
Traders were said to be in wait and see mode to assess whether China would retaliate with fresh tariffs  raising the prospect of an all out trade war between the world s two largest economies 
The dollar hit nearly one year high against its rivals on Tuesday 
2  U S  Crude Oil Stockpiles in Focus  
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration  EIA  on Wednesday at 10 30 a m  ET is expected to show crude supplies fell for a second straight week 
Yet  U S  inventory data could play second fiddle to any OPEC and non OPEC jawboning on potential crude output hikes ahead of the OPEC meeting later this week 
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 1 898 million barrels in the week ended June 15 
Crude oil futures settled 1 2  lower at  65 07 on Tuesday on fears of an aggressive output hike amid comments from Russia s energy minister 
3  Investors Cool on Starbucks as Shares Tumble 
Shares of Starbucks fell sharply in after hours trade as the coffee chain slashed its third quarter fiscal 2018 same store sales growth from a previous estimate in April 
The coffee chain cut its forecast for third quarter same store sales to 1  from a previous estimate of between 3  and 5   undershooting Wall Street estimates for same store sales growth of 2 9  
Starbucks also said it would scale back its U S  retail footprint at a more rapid pace in 2019 as it seeks to ramp up the number of company operated stores in under penetrated markets 
 In FY19  this will result in a slightly lower growth rate in net new company operated stores   Starbucks said

94514,316029,SBUX,Daily Report July 31   Dollar  CRB  Copper  Aluminum  Euro  Oil,opinion,"Just a quick update for commodities and currencies 
Now that it looks like Trump is going to step away from the EU tariffs  there should be no reason for the ECB to keep pinning down the euro which it has been doing since early June  As a result of this  the euro was pushed into a basing pattern which seems to be nearing its end 
We are in a major pivot point for a lot of hard commodities as well as  oil and EUR USD  The dollar index is still signaling negative divergence which I suspect will signal a top for this bear market rally 







The euro could still be due for a daily cycle low as the low on 19th of July didn t really qualify for a daily cycle low  Then again  the euro could just break out from the basing pattern this weeks and we d be off to the races for the euro and the commodities sector including gold and other precious metals  The cycle count in currencies is a mess and so the outcome could be anything for now before we break to one side or the other in EUR USD 
It all comes down to the currencies  Euro is in a bull market and so it should breakout to the upside from the basing pattern  We have a chance for that this week and if we go down to make a daily cycle low this week  I suspect we ll get another chance for a breakout next week 
I bought yesterday some out of the money calls for oil just in case we are to get the 100  YoY gain that has been more than a rule since the 70s for US recessions  As can be interpreted from the previous phrase  the crude oil calls are  in case of a recession  type of a trade and I m not putting much of my capital on the trade  Statistically we are due for a recession in the US  gold is in a bull market for now at least and the dollar is still in a 30  year secular bear market  I suspect that we also started a cyclical bear market in January 2017 which should run in total for 6 to 8 years  The next 3 year cycle low in the dollar is due next year and so we should see the dollar index making new lows below 88 in 2019  There are also some micro level indications that consumer consumption is slowing down in the US  For example  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  has signaled stagnating growth in sales and so on 
This could also be a good spot for some straddle trades for commodities  Short time horizon on the short side and longer time horizon on the long side as that s where I expect commodities to go once the dollar break down and continues towards an ICL ",2018-07-31,Sam Laakso,https://www.investing.com/analysis/daily-report-july-31--dollar-crb-copper-aluminum-euro-oil-200334801,200334801
94515,316030,SBUX,3 Compelling Dividend Stocks That Pay In August,opinion,"Most companies pay dividends each quarter  but not all stocks pay on the same schedule  In any given quarter  companies might pay dividends in each of the three months  Many dividend stocks will pay their 2018 third quarter dividend in August  Since they pay in August  they will also pay in November  meaning investors are set to collect two dividend payments before the end of the year 
Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   AT T  NYSE T  and General Mills  NYSE GIS  are three examples of dividend stocks that will pay dividends in August  They also have strong brands  competitive advantages  and growth potential  which makes them high quality dividend growth stocks 
Dividend Growth Is Percolating
Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  has a current dividend yield of 2 3   which might not be too exciting for income investors  This yield is only slightly higher than the average dividend yield in the S P 500 Index  which currently stands at 2   However  Starbucks makes up for a low yield with high dividend growth rates  On July 26 the company increased its quarterly dividend by 20   to  0 36 per share  The new quarterly dividend will be paid on August 24  to shareholders of record on August 9  With the increase  Starbucks  five year dividend growth rate is 28   which makes Starbucks a highly attractive stock for dividend growth 
Starbucks can provide such high dividend growth rates  because of the company s strong earnings growth over the past several years  It has continued to grow so far in 2018  Over the first three fiscal quarters  Starbucks reported 2  growth in comparable sales  which measures results at locations open at least one year  The number of transactions has declined to start the year  but Starbucks has a unique ability to raise prices on a regular basis 
Starbucks is also aggressively opening new stores to fuel growth  particularly in the emerging markets  Starbucks expects 2 300 net new store openings for fiscal 2018  China is a key market for the company moving forward 

Source  Investor Presentation  page 7
China is a major growth opportunity for Starbucks  The Chinese middle class is expected to double by 2022  to 600 million  In addition  coffee consumption in China is currently very low  While the average American drinks 300 cups of coffee per year  the average Chinese consumer drinks less than 1 cup  Starbucks believes it can change this  and as a result has made China a focal point for future expansion 
Starbucks announced plans to build 600 net new stores each year in China over the next five years in Mainland China  This expansion will double Starbucks  store count from 2017 2022  to 6 000 across 230 cities  For the full year  Starbucks expects adjusted earnings per share in a range of  2 40 to  2 42  at the midpoint of guidance  the company expects earnings per share growth of 17  
Starbucks stock trades for a reasonable price to earnings ratio of 21 8  Even if the stock valuation remains flat  Starbucks will generate strong shareholder returns  If the company grows earnings by 12  per year  total returns could exceed 14  per year over the next five years 
Dialing Up A High Dividend Yield
While Starbucks is a high dividend growth stock with an average yield  telecom giant AT T  NYSE T  is virtually the opposite  It grows its dividend at a fairly low rate around 2  to 3  per year but it has a high current yield of 6 2   which makes AT T a highly appealing stock for retirees  And while AT T s dividend growth rate is not overly impressive  the company does have a long history of dividend increases  In fact  AT T has increased its dividend payout for over 30 years in a row  This makes it a member of the exclusive Dividend Aristocrats  a group of 53 stocks in the S P 500 Index with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend increases 
AT T can afford such a generous dividend payout because it has huge competitive advantages  and a highly stable business model  AT T is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the U S   with a variety of services including wireless phone and Internet  along with cable and satellite television  On 7 24 18  AT T reported mixed second quarter financial results  Revenue of  38 99 billion fell by 2 1   but adjusted earnings per share increased by 15  and operating cash flow increased 18  from the same quarter a year ago

AT T has a long runway of growth up ahead  as the company is wrapping up some major acquisitions  AT T completed its  81 billion acquisition of media giant Time Warner Inc  NYSE TWX    which will make AT T into a content giant  Time Warner owns several huge media properties  including TBS  TNT  HBO  and the Warner Bros  movie studio  The deal will provide AT T with a diverse new revenue stream and provide it with a valuable hedge against rising content costs  AT T will also acquire AppNexus  for approximately  1 6 billion  which will boost its advertising and analytics platform  These deals will help AT T continue to rake in huge amounts of cash flow  which finances its hefty dividend to shareholders 
AT T stock seems to be significantly undervalued  particularly if its earnings growth accelerates moving forward  With earnings per share expected to reach  3 45 in 2018  AT T trades at a price to earnings ratio of just 9 3  expansion of the valuation multiple could generate 7  8  annual returns for shareholders  In addition  the stock has a 6 2  dividend yield  AT T s dividend is a key part of its shareholder returns  Assuming 6  7  earnings growth each year  AT T s total shareholder returns could exceed 20  per year over the next five years 
Reliable Dividends For Income Starved Investors
Food and beverage giant General Mills  NYSE GIS  has had a rough year the stock is down 22  year to date and has deeply under performed the S P 500 to start the year  Investors have turned negative toward General Mills  due to the company s slowing growth and inability to respond to changing consumer habits 
These challenges were evident in General Mills  most recent earnings report  For fiscal 2018  organic sales and adjusted earnings per share were both flat  The major culprit for General Mills  poor performance is yogurt  led by its Yoplait brand  General Mills saw its U S  yogurt sales decline by 12  for the full fiscal year  In response  the company is turning to acquisitions to boost growth  General Mills will expand its brand portfolio even more after the  8 billion acquisition of Blue Buffalo  This huge deal gave General Mills access to the large and growing pet food market  a  30 billion industry that has grown at a 5  annual rate over the past 10 years

General Mills has also expanded into organics  with the  820 million acquisition of Annie s in 2014  General Mills expects its natural and organics portfolio to reach  1 billion in sales next year  General Mills still has plenty of strong brands in its portfolio  a few of which include several prominent cereal brands  Haagen Dazs  Betty Crocker  Pillsbury  Old El Paso  and more 
While the stock has not rewarded investors in 2018  investors buying in at the current price could earn strong returns over the next several years  Because the stock has declined over 20  this year  the dividend yield has risen to 4 3   This is a high yield  more than double the average dividend yield in the S P 500  And  General Mills can continue to increase its dividend regularly  as the company is highly profitable  General Mills has increased its dividend for over 10 years in a row and has paid dividends for 118 years 
The other major benefit of a falling share price  is a much more attractive valuation  Based on fiscal 2018 earnings of  3 11 per share  General Mills stock trades for a price to earnings ratio of 14 8  a reasonable multiple for a high quality company 
Even if General Mills grows earnings at a relatively slow pace  the stock can still be rewarding for investors  based on its low valuation and high dividend yield  The combination of valuation expansion  dividends  and earnings growth could yield total returns of 10   each year over the next five years ",2018-08-01,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-compelling-dividend-stocks-that-pay-in-august-200335336,200335336
94516,316031,SBUX,Wait Until You See The Price Of Gold In Venezuela,opinion,"Last month in Venezuela s capital city of Caracas  a cup of coffee would have set you back 2 million bolivars  That s up from only 2 300 bolivars 12 months ago  meaning the price of a cup of joe has jumped nearly 87 000 percent  according to Bloomberg s Caf  Con Leche Index  And you thought Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  was expensive 
But that was July  Prices in Venezuela are doubling roughly every 18 days  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  now projects inflation to hit an astronomical 1 million percent by the end of this year  This puts the beleaguered Latin American country on the same slippery path as Zimbabwe a decade ago and Germany in the 1920s  when a wheelbarrow full of marks was barely enough to get you a loaf of bread 
Venezuela s socialist president Nicolas Maduro who only this past weekend survived an assassination attempt involving several explosive laden drones announced recently that the country plans to rein in hyperinflation by lopping off five zeroes from its currency  If you recall  Zimbabwe similarly tried to combat soaring prices of its own by issuing a cartoonish  100 trillion banknote which in 2009 was still not enough to buy a bus ticket in the capital of Harare 
Without structural governmental reforms  a new bolivar is just as unlikely to steady Venezuela s skyrocketing inflation or remedy its crumbling economy 
Gold Could Save Your Life
So where does this put gold  At some point  hyperinflation gets so ludicrously out of control that discussing exchange rates becomes pointless  But as of July 30  an ounce of the yellow metal would have gone for 211 million bolivars an increase of more than 3 1 million percent from just the beginning of the year My point in bringing this up is to reinforce the importance of gold s Fear Trade  which says that demand for the yellow metal rises when inflation threatens to destroy a nation s currency as it s doing right now in Venezuela  A Venezuelan family that had the prudence to store some of its wealth in gold would be in a much better position today to survive or escape President Maduro s corrupt  far left regime In extreme cases like this  gold could literally help save lives 
Such was the case following the fall of Saigon in 1975  If not for gold  many South Vietnamese families might not have managed to escape the country  A seat on one of the thousands of fleeing boats reportedly went for eight or 10 taels of gold per adult  four or five taels per child   A tael is slightly more than an ounce   Gold was their passport  Thanks to the precious metal  tens of thousands of Vietnamese  boat people   as they re now known  were able to start new lives in the U S   Canada  Australia and other developed countries 
Venezuela s Once Prosperous Economy Destroyed By Corruption And Mismanagement
But back to Venezuela  Amid the corruption and mismanagement  the only thing helping the country pay its bills right now is gold  Two years ago  it had the world s 16th largest gold reserves  Today it stands at number 26 as it s sold off more than half its holdings since 2010  While countries such as China and Russia continue to add to their holdings  Venezuela has been the world s largest seller of gold for the past two years It s hard to remember now  but as recently as 2001  Venezuela was the most prosperous country in all of South America  Like Zimbabwe  the OPEC nation is rich in natural resources  home to the world s largest oil reserves and what s believed to be the fourth largest gold mine  Oil exports account for virtually all of its export revenue 
In 2016  Venezuela was the third largest exporter of crude to the U S  following Canada and Saudi Arabia  but with output in freefall  this is changing rapidly  For the first time ever in February  Colombia sold more crude oil to the U S  than its eastern neighbor did  And in June  Venezuela s state owned oil and gas company  Petr leos de Venezuela  PDVSA   informed at least eight foreign clients that it would be unable to meet supply commitments  According to GlobalData  production is on track to fall to only 1 million barrels per day by 2019  down from 3 million a day in 2011  meaning the petrostate might soon have nothing left to deliver 
President Maduro now has the ignoble distinction of reigning over an economic recession that rivals the very worst in modern history  Last month  the IMF forecast that the country s real gross domestic product  GDP  would fall 18 percent this year the third straight year of double digit declines A mass exodus of young  working age Venezuelans  many of them college educated  is unlikely to help  Estimates of the number of people who have fled the country in the past two years alone range from 1 7 million to as high as 4 million 
Their escape is no easy task  as numerous international airlines  citing rampant crime and a lack of electricity  have canceled all flights in and out of Caracas  The only U S  carrier still operating in the country is American Airlines  which offers a single daily flight from the nation s capital to Miami  Just two years ago  there were as many as 40 nonstop American flights  not to mention those of rival carriers  between the two cities a sign of just how dramatic and swift Maduro s mismanagement has been in crippling Venezuela s once robust economy 
The Diversification Benefits Of Gold
The gold bears were on top last week  with the metal trading as low as  1 205 on Thursday  That s the closest it s come to dipping below  1 200 since February 2017  Friday s lower than expected jobs report gave gold a modest boost  but it wasn t enough to prevent a fourth straight week of price declines 
In times like this  it s important to remember that  according to gold s DNA of volatility  it s a non event for the metal to close up or down 1 percent at the end of each session  2 percent for the 10 day trading period  And guess what  The S P 500 Index has the same level of volatility Ten days ago  gold was trading just under  1 230 an ounce  or 0 6 percent more than today  The math is sound 
It s also worth remembering that gold has traditionally had a low to negative correlation with other assets such as equities  This is why many investors over the years have used it as a portfolio diversifier 
Case in point  On June 26  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  suffered its worst single day decline since the company went public in 2012  Its stock plunged 19 percent  erasing some  120 billion in market capitalization the most ever in history for a single trading session Gold  meanwhile  held relatively steady  slipping only 0 62 percent

94517,316032,SBUX,Amazon And Starbucks To Accept Bitcoin  ,opinion,"Rumors have been circulating for months that Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  or Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  might begin accepting cryptos as payment  If that does occur  it would  in my opinion  be a significant boon for both the adoption and the price action of the crypto sector 
Remember that in December when the price started rising  all of a sudden there was a mania of new interest  Which admittedly included a lot of speculation 
Although what was missing back then was further adoption  Which could be in the cards if the proposed Amazon or Starbucks crypto ventures should manifest itself 
Consider the following scenario 
People are waiting online at Starbucks and see a sign saying that Bitcoin or Litecoin are accepted as payment  Certainly it s at least great advertising  Because while some might see it and not think twice initially  there are still a lot of people seeing something new about cryptos  Who may well ask more about it 
Also given the psychological nature of how investors often begin to pile in once the price starts to move  it s interesting to think about how this could affect the pricing 
Certainly if you want to debate from a trading standpoint whether that s a good strategy  there s room for discussion  Yet to the degree that this is how people often respond in today s markets  it s easy to imagine a self perpetuating loop developing  And there s also a degree to which the people who won t look initially will still be seeing more and more about cryptos over time  Which would likely lead to them begin to develop a level of familiarity and comfort  At the same time the adoption is growing 
As more people see the crypto option and begin to use it  that in itself will force the price higher  And as the price goes higher  more people begin paying attention 
Add in the rapidly deteriorating dollar system to the equation  and should there be a break in the establishment markets at the same time cryptos are being used more for everyday transactions  that could well be the spark for the next leg of the rally 
Some still argue that cryptos don t provide any tangible value  But it s not easy to come up with an argument against cryptos that doesn t even more aptly apply to paper and electronic dollars  if you have one I d be happy to hear it and discuss it   And just as an example  this morning I had money wired  which cost around  40 and took almost 2 hours to arrive  Whereas had I been able to use cryptos  Litecoin in particular   the transaction would have been much quicker  And less expensive 
Throw in that Litecoin can t be printed at will in the shadows of the government dark money pools  that the dollar has lost 99  of it s value to inflation since the Fed s inception  and that the cryptos certainly appear to have the dominant technical infrastructure  Certainly I d take my chances on cryptos over Federal Reserve paper 
Keep in mind that these crypto adoption deals are still being developed  So that s different from being a done deal 
Yet the developments and underlying fundamentals indicate which way the trend is heading  And especially with the recent sell off in the crypto sector  it sure seems like an incredible buying opportunity to me

94542,316057,SBUX,Starbucks deal gives Nestle more punch in fight with JAB,news,"By Martinne Geller  Silke Koltrowitz and Lisa Baertlein LONDON ZURICH LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Nestle s  S NESN   7 billion licensing deal for Starbucks   O SBUX  retail business gives it a much needed boost in its battle against JAB  the privately owned investment firm stirring up the coffee industry with a string of deals  JAB  the family office of Europe s billionaire Reimann clan  has built up the world s second largest coffee business over the past five years  It controls packaged brands such as Kenco and Douwe Egberts  retail chains like Peet s and Espresso House  and Keurig  the leading at home single serve brewer system in the United States   JAB is unlikely to make another major move right away  analysts say  as it is still busy with a giant deal to buy soft drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple  turning its coffee fortress into a wider drinks empire  This may help blunt the blow of Nestle s incursion onto its home U S  turf  But JAB is expected to keep growing  especially now that Starbucks will get super charged by Nestle    There is no other brand like Starbucks so we would expect JAB to respond by continuing to innovate and acquire businesses to increase the breadth of their offering and their resources for innovation   said Christopher Rossbach  chief investment officer at London based private investment office J  Stern  a long term Nestle shareholder  Coffee is one of the few bright spots in a drab packaged food landscape  Because it is still fragmented  analysts and bankers expect more deals to come in a category fueled by young consumers  How Nestle and JAB position themselves against growing competition will determine their future success    It s two players in an arms race  each looking for ways to reinforce their positions   said Will Hayllar  partner at OC C Strategy Consultants   Nestle  the world leader by far  has risen to the challenges as its flagship instant Nescafe has been overtaken by fancier brews  with new products such as barista style Nescafe Azera coffee and its mass market Nescafe Dolce Gusto brewer system   It has also launched Nespresso Vertuoline  catering to American tastes for big servings  and relaunched the Nescafe brand globally   But the licensing deal with Starbucks is its boldest step yet  It bolsters Nestle in the United States where it was weak  and gives it a presence in  roast and ground  coffee  big in grocery stores and food service outlets    Both of these areas are JAB territory so it carries the competitive fight there   said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox  A spokesman for JAB in New York played down the impact    Starbucks has always had a well run consumer goods business  and we are sure after this deal under Nestle it will continue to be a well run business   the spokesman said   It has no impact on JAB   EVOLVING STRATEGY With more than 10 acquisitions  JAB has sought a presence anywhere coffee is drunk   at home  in restaurants or on the go  It has taken big gulps  like the Dutch coffee business spun off from Sara Lee  and small sips  like high end U S  roaster Intelligentsia   Thanks to Dr Pepper s distribution network  it will be able to flood grocery stores  convenience stores and restaurants with its coffee  This could help boost margins at the U S  focused Dr Pepper business  as many Americans cut back on sugary sodas    JAB is now moving into a broader drinks business  It s interesting because the strategies are diverging a bit   said Stanislas Duquesnoy  senior credit officer at Moody s and lead analyst for JAB  comparing JAB to Nestle  He doubts JAB will do another sizeable deal in the near term  given the Dr Pepper one  He estimated JAB s net debt to be about 20 percent of the overall market value of its portfolio   a pretty healthy level     in line with a pretty high rating   Moody s rates JAB Baa1 with a stable outlook  while S P gives it a BBB  with a  watch positive  outlook  The Reimann fortune comes from Germany s Benckiser chemicals company that merged with Britain s Reckitt   Colman in 1999 to form  Reckitt Benckiser   L RB   Reckitt s former CEO Bart Becht is one of the three principals running JAB s investments on behalf of the family  The other two are Olivier Goudet  chairman of  Anheuser Busch InBev   ABI   BR ABI  and former finance chief of Mars  and Peter Harf  previously chairman of ABI and deputy chairman of Reckitt  JAB is also the biggest shareholder of beauty company Coty  N COTY   controlling more than a third of its shares  and the second largest shareholder of Reckitt  It has been offloading luxury brands as it scales up in drinks  BATTLE BREWING AT HOME  One uncertainty resulting from Nestle s Starbucks deal is in the area of Starbucks single serve coffee pods used for JAB s Keurig at home brewers   The agreement between Nestle and Starbucks calls for Keurig to continue manufacturing Starbucks coffee K cups in the United States  where the bulk of Keurig sales are  and for Nestle to market and distribute them  Starbucks and Nestle will jointly determine any future K cup products   Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo likened the arrangement to a potential Trojan horse  but said JAB was unlikely to retaliate with harmful measures  since both parties would get bruised   JAB said Starbucks was  an important brand and valued partner  with a multi year agreement   
 We view this as business as usual for us and look forward to Starbucks continuing to be available in the Keurig system   the spokesman said ",2018-05-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/starbucks-deal-gives-nestle-more-punch-in-fight-with-jab-1439313,1439313

94548,316063,SBUX,Starbucks Vs  McDonald s  What s The Better Choice For Income Investors ,opinion,"Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX  five year winning streak versus McDonald s  NYSE MCD  just came to an end  The multinational coffee behemoth is seeing the brakes grind to a halt in the current quarter for its unprecedented domestic growth  Starbucks  same store sales  which are expected to rise globally by an anemic 1  for the current quarter  signal that the company is now struggling to win back customers who ve grown tired of its Frappuccino based beverages 
Conversely  McDonald s  the global fast food giant  is in the middle of a turnaround  Its shares have gained about 7  this year  while Starbucks  stock has dropped 14  over the same period  After underperforming Starbucks during most of the past half decade  McDonald s is resurgent 
That makes it a bit more complicated to decide which of the US s largest restaurant stocks is worth an investment  but not impossible  Here are the metrics worth noting 
Starbucks  Caffeine Fueled Growth Ending
This past week was not a good one for shareholders of the world s largest coffee chain 

Starbucks  shares plunged to a three year low after the company s announcement that same store sales for the quarter would disappoint  coming in below Wall Street s forecast of 3  
Perhaps the biggest disappointment  however  was the company s flat performance forecast for China  which was expected to be Starbucks  next growth engine after sales in the saturated domestic market stalled  With about 14 000 stores in the US  it seems Starbucks is fast running out of options for ways to keep domestic customers excited 
Indeed  poor foot traffic is forcing the company to close 150 company operated stores in densely penetrated US markets during the next fiscal year  three times the number it annually shuts down historically  The company announced these closures last week after the company s product initiative over the last two years failed to connect with consumers  who are looking for less sugary  healthier beverage choices 
Despite these disappointments  long time  former CEO and outgoing Chairman Howard Schultz believes shares of Starbucks are  cheap and undervalued   He says the coffee purveyor has a solid plan to recover from this downturn  something that s common in the life cycle of food restaurants 
Starbucks has a number of initiatives in the works to turn around their weak sales  including offering a more diverse range of cold beverages  revamping its rewards program and increasing its marketing digitally via the company s mobile app  The company expects these new digital efforts to contribute 1 2  to same store sales in the Americas in 2019  Globally  China remains the center of Starbucks  growth plan  It sees revenue there tripling over the next five years 
McDonald s  Recovery Is Taking Hold
As restaurant chains struggle to get diners into their stores amid changing consumer preferences  McDonald s appears to be doing something right  Their recovery is taking a firm hold 

The first quarter of 2018 was the 11th consecutive quarter of solid global comparable sales growth for McDonald s  Global same store sales during the quarter surged 5 5   exceeding analyst estimates of 3 7   as the number of customers coming through the doors rose 0 8  
This rebound is a clear indication that CEO Steve Easterbrook s turnaround efforts over the past three years are paying off  So is now the time to get excited about the future of MCD s Golden Arches 
As part of Easterbrook s strategy  McDonald s has been recovering market share through a variety of initiatives including all day breakfast offerings  menu innovation such as healthier food choices  as well as higher quality ingredients and improvements to the overall restaurant experience  That propelled its shares to an all time high of nearly  179 in late January  it closed yesterday at almost  161 
The major push within the company s growth strategy  however  was to shift away from restaurant ownership and grow franchising  The transformation is in progress  80  of McDonald s restaurants are already owned and operated by franchisees  but the company wants to increase that number to over 90  by the end of 2018 and ultimately to 95  as part of its cost cutting efforts 
Bottom Line
The above analysis clearly shows that McDonald s is a less risky bet for income investors at a time when the burger chain is pursuing a successful turnaround plan while also generating strong earnings momentum 
Trading at almost  161 at the time of writing  MCD shares have 13  upside potential according to analyst consensus forecasts for the next 12 months  We believe the timing is right for income investors to add McDonald s shares to their portfolios in order to see both price growth and earn a steadily growing dividend  The company pays quarterly dividends of  1 01 per share  At its current price  that translates to an annual dividend yield of 2 52  
Though Starbucks also pays a quarterly dividend  albeit of 36 cents per share  for an annual yield of 2 84   we think this is a  show me  moment for the company  rather than a time to buy in 
There s no doubt the company is taking action to arrest its slowdown  but we don t see any sign of a meaningful recovery just yet  And it s not clear how long it will actually take for Starbucks to translate its strategy into improved earnings  That s especially significant when its biggest bet China isn t showing the kind of growth prospects investors  and Starbucks  management  were expecting ",2018-06-27,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-vs-mcdonalds-which-stock-is-a-betty-buy-for-income-investors-200327951,200327951

A new consultant report calls for Starbucks to check staff diversity  improve training  and work with local police to reduce racial bias against some customers  The consultants were hired after an infamous racial incident in Philadelphia  where two black entrepreneurs who arrived early for a meeting with the real estate broker were arrested by local police after a manager requested assistance with the two black  trespassers  because they refused to buy an item while they waited 
This incident sparked widespread outrage  as it was widely acknowledged that Starbucks seemed to have one policy for white customers vis a vis using facilities without purchases and those of color  They company shut down all stores recently for a day or racial sensitivity training  but the latest consultant report recommends even more policy and training changes moving forward 
A key change suggested by the consultant report is for Starbucks to   make clear in company policy that law enforcement should only be called to address criminal activity or threats to public safety

94550,316065,SBUX,What s Wrong With Starbucks  SBUX  ,opinion,"Stock and ETF charts in this post are powered by MarketSmith 

Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  has tripled its earnings since 2011 and yet its stock is trading near 3 year lows  It has underperformed 88  of all stocks and ETFs in the past year  What s wrong with it 
Last week  Starbucks announced that it will close 150 of its underperforming stores in heavily penetrated areas  The next day  SBUX gapped down and it has been in a falling mode ever since 
150 is a drop in a bucket  Starbucks has more than 27 000 stores worldwide and it regularly closes about 50 a year  Then why the fierce market reaction 
There are two major ways a profitable company s stock can appreciate 
a  Earnings growth
b  Multiple expansion   when the market is willing to pay a higher multiple for a company s earnings  And by multiple  obviously  I mean P E or a Price to Earnings ratio 
P E reflects the market s expectations about the near term future of a company  SBUX is currently trading with a P E of 21  which is its lowest multiple in the past 5 years 
The market is forward looking and apparently  it has lost faith in the ability of Starbuck s management to continue to grow at the same pace 
This is not an actionable post  I imagine a pullback near  40 will attract the attention of many value oriented dip buyers because Starbucks is still a cash printing machine and one of the most recognized brands around the world  They will probably figure out a way to jump on the current taste trend and offer better variety and organic options  They certainly have the money to acquire chains that are excelling in those attributes 
Buying on weakness is not my cup of coffee  I rather buy stocks that break out to new 52 week highs from solid bases  Risk management is a lot easier when I trade in the direction of the trend ",2018-07-06,Ivaylo Ivanhoff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whats-wrong-with-sbux-200329513,200329513
94551,316066,SBUX,Commodities Week Ahead  Oil Bulls Under Siege  Shock For Coffee Bears ,opinion,"by Barani Krishnan
Energy traders and investors will be warily watching US crude this week to see how far below  70 per barrel oil might fall and whether it recovers  a phenomenon likely after oil s sharpest one day price tumble in two years last week  and losses so far during July 

On the broader commodities front  the worsening US China trade war will potentially take center stage again  hammering prices of most natural resources  The Bloomberg Commodities Index  a measure of 26 raw materials  lost 2 7 percent during the week that was  the most since February  Soybeans were the hardest hit  falling 6 5  to a near decade low  as China s duties on US supplies took effect 
Even so  some commodities may rebound on improving fundamentals  Arabica  for instance  could soon land a sting on coffee bears who misread Brazil s bumper harvests  say veteran traders who ve started amassing longer dated futures for the bean 
WTI Vulnerable
US crude  pegged to the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange  rose 1  to settle at  71 01 a barrel on Friday  Brent  the North Sea  UK based global oil gauge that trades on the Intercontinental Exhcange settled up 0 6  at  74 92 per barrel on Friday 
Despite rising on the day  both oil benchmarks lost nearly 4  on the week  They were also in the negative for a second straight week as mixed supply signals scaled back investor expectations for a global oil supply shortage  Both have also started this trading week by moving lower 
Data showing US crude supply fell by 12 633 million barrels for the week ended July 6 were overshadowed by Libya s plan to reopen four oil export terminals  which could bring as much as 0 7 million barrels per day back to the market  The White House s consideration of sanctions relief for some buyers of Iranian crude beyond a previously determined November deadline also led to the notion that the outage of Tehran supplies may not be that severe after all 
That  and rising output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   the powerful oil cartel that steadily drove up prices the past year by cutting production instead  created a perfect storm for crude prices last week  Brent plunged almost 7 percent on Wednesday alone  the steepest one day drop in two years 
This week  WTI looks particularly vulnerable  as it returned  as of this writing  to  60 levels  A year ago  WTI was trading below  50 around this time  before rallying a whopping 50  on OPEC output cuts 
 High prices fix high prices   Scott Shelton  energy broker and analyst for ICAP in Durham  North Carolina  wrote in his pre weekend note on US crude   WTI  for a long time  was the cheapest barrel and now it isn t  This market is driven by flow  not differentials or margins or inventories   Shelton added  referring to speculative money 
Mindful that more oil bears might show up after this  OPEC President Suhail al Mazrouei cautioned last week that volatility in the crude market was undesirable and that the cartel preferred a more stable price environment  Many read that as a desire for higher for longer prices 
Some analysts with a bullish view on oil think the market will be in for a wild ride  regardless of what OPEC says  although prices could eventually work to the cartel s favor   While the next few weeks will be crazy  our beginning of the year target of above  80 a barrel remains firmly in place   Phil Flynn of the Price Futures Group wrote in his Friday analysis 
 The global oil market can flip from a global supply surplus to a global supply deficit at the drop of a hat   said Flynn  who typically has a long bias toward crude   The balance between daily production and global demand is too tight to be ignored and eventually will demand higher oil prices  
Those who tasted blood by selling WTI short before Wednesday s plunge seem determined to go for the kill at below  70  That could happen this week   The summer demand for oil has peaked and without additional supply issues  there s no reason for WTI to be trading above  65   noted Phil Davis  founder of PSW Investments in New York 
Davis says he  made a ton  selling US crude at  70 a barrel when it was trading above  74 before the 4th of July holiday  His bet  the market had overestimated gasoline consumption for the peak summer driving period 
Arabica Anomaly
Likewise  prices of arabica  the coffee bean of choice for top retailers including Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   has been languishing  down 12  on the year  because of  sheer hype  of a seasonal anomaly in Brazilian production that led to fears of a glut  said Davis  To underscore his point  Brazil s coffee exporting group Cecaf  said on Friday that June s end season arabica exports slumped instead by 10 percent to 26 16 million bags 

 A shortage of arabica will be looming soon and coffee prices will go much  much higher   said Davis  who has started building long positions in futures of the bean trading for July 2019 at  1 2180 a lb  to exploit the differential to the spot price of under  1 10 a lb 
Max Pain For Metals
Copper  charts indicate the red metal will likely tumble till it reaches  5 800 a tonne as the US China trade war further weighs on a market that already fell to  6 180 last week for its worst weekly losing streak since 2015   I know it seems a bit draconian but that s where max pain lies   said Andrew Cosgrove of Bloomberg Intelligence 
In gold  the dollar looks likely to remain a significant headwind for the precious metal this week  continuing bullion s bearish streak despite growing risk aversion  Gold futures for August delivery settled down 0 39  at  1 241 80 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange to close the week  For the week  prices were down 1   the fourth weekly loss in five weeks ",2018-07-16,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/commodities-week-ahead-oil-bulls-under-siege-shock-for-coffee-bears-200330996,200330996

94577,316092,SBUX,Why Did Starbucks  SBUX  Stock Tumble Today ,opinion,"Shares of Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   were down more than 9  through morning trading hours Wednesday after the coffee retailer issued sluggish comps guidance and said it would close more than 150 U S  stores in fiscal 2019 
Kevin Johnson  Starbucks president and CEO  revealed the store closure details during an Oppenheimer conference on Tuesday  Starbucks has historically closed about 50 stores per year on average  so its new plan marks a significant uptick from the norm 
The affected stores are located primarily in urban areas that are already densely populated with other Starbucks locations 
The ramped up closures are one piece of a larger shift for Starbucks stores  with the company focusing on underpenetrated markets  slowing licensed store growth  doubling down on its Roastery and Reserve concepts  and investing more in U S  digital efforts 
Starbucks will also look to expand its international influence through the Global Coffee Alliance  a partnership with Nestle   OTC NSRGY   
While some might view these initiatives as a necessary trimming of the fat  investors have not reacted positively to the news so far today  After closing at  57 43 per share on Tuesday  Starbucks opened in the red and eventually sunk to an intraday low of  51 87  down about 9 7   in morning trading 
Today s selling is likely coming on the back of Starbucks also mentioning that it now sees comps growth at just 1  for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 
Johnson brought up the company s decision to close thousands of stores for one day to host racial bias training for its employees while discussing this comps guidance  although he did say the event was  not an excuse  
Still  sluggish near term guidance clearly has plenty of investors worried today despite management s efforts to assure shareholder value 
In a   Starbucks said it was raising its target for cash returned to shareholders to  25 billion through fiscal 2020  including a 20  increase in its regularly scheduled quarterly dividend  The company also said that new digital initiatives will contribute approximately 1  to 2  attributable comps in 2019 
It will be interesting to see what this guidance does to analyst sentiment for the coffee behemoth s fiscal 2019  which has not been very positive recently  Starbucks has seen eight downward revisions to its 2019 earnings estimates within the past 60 days  compared to just one upward revision in that time 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SBUX s 2019 earnings has slumped about three cents thanks to this revision activity  Prior to the release of its new guidance  analysts were expecting Starbucks to see EPS growth about 11  from its projected 2018 totals 
Mixed revision activity for the remainder of 2018 has kept SBUX at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but its analyst outlook is likely to see some adjustments soon

94608,316123,SBUX,Financials Boost Markets As ECB Prepares QE Exit,opinion,"Financial  s Boost Markets As ECB Prepares QE Exit  Success is the natural consequence of consistently applying the basic fundamentals  Jim Rohn
People admire excellence in any area  but especially in subjects which gather a great deal of attention  like sports  music  business  and politics  As one examines the enduring aspects of success  what you discover is sticking to the basics  the fundamentals  mockingly called funnymentals   might be considered routine  dull  not exciting  even boring  but they win out  In business  friendly customer service  good merchandising  an efficient supply chain  and well thought out financing are easy to talk about  but difficult to put into practice  Any element of these can be a major problem against good competitors  With the constant focus on automation these days  the human element doesn t get enough attention  In fact  most businesses can only survive by having great employees who keep their customers coming back to routinely  Anyone can get a customer once  keeping them coming in the door for thirty years is how great enterprises are built  Trying to find these businesses  or those who have the potential to be built into a great establishment  is what investing is about  at a reasonable price  of course  
After the May jobs report came in strong last week  the ECB announced that they are considering winding down their version of QE  potentially as early as September  It gave a boost to the financial sector  although Italian bond yields went higher and European markets sold off slightly  Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffet made a joint appearance to discuss their newfound emphasis of trying to dissuade corporations from the focus on quarterly guidance  It was received with a mixed response  as some echoed the long term approach while others noted more shareholder voting rights might be a better solution  The G 7 meeting in Canada has Mr  Trump ruffling the feathers of his fellow leaders by suggesting that no tariffs  taxes  or subsidies should be the preferred approach for the largest economies in the world  In the midst of NAFTA negotiations  an election for a new leader in Mexico  who will probably be a difficult partner   and next week s Singapore summit with the nutball from North Korea  our understated President sure has a full plate  Founder and long time CEO of Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   Howard Schultz  resigned from the Board of Directors and hinted at a potential run for public office  He is trying to claim a move to the center is where the Democratic party should be headed  as opposed to being left of Mao Tse Tung  like Bernie and Elizabeth   He noted the country s 21 trillion dollar deficit and entitlement problems which need to be addressed  Amen  Whether the Democrats will listen to Mr  Schultz is another question as they have got Donald on the brain  and then some

94635,316150,SBUX,Nestle Starbucks Distribution Deal  Win Win,opinion,"Nestl  is paying Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX    7 15 billion plus royalties for the global distribution rights to several Starbucks brands including Starbucks Reserve and Seattle s Best Coffee packaged coffees  and Teavana packaged teas  with combined annual sales of around  2 billion  The Starbucks brands join Nestl  s portfolio that also includes the Nescaf  and Nespresso brands 
Nestl  expects the deal to be accretive to its 2019 earnings  Starbucks will use the  7 billion cash infusion to increase its share buyback authorization  It will now return  20 billion to shareholders over the next three years through buybacks and dividends  The deal is expected to be accretive to its earnings by 2021 
Direct Benefits For Both
The deal also includes Starbucks branded capsules for Nestl  s Nespresso and Dolce Gusto single serve brewers that have only been available for Keurig cups thus far  But Europe s JAB Holdings  with a view to strengthen its global coffee business  recently picked up both Keurig Green Mountain and Peet s Coffee   Tea  potentially increasing competition for both Nestl  and Starbucks  While the Keurig deal will likely continue  it makes sense for Starbucks to expand to a competitor s offerings as well 
According to Euromonitor  the Nescafe and Nespresso brands commanded 15 0  and 4 5  market share globally in 2017 compared to Starbucks  global market share of 2 4   However  in the U S   the two Nestle brands were limited to 2 2  and 2 5  shares with Starbucks accounting for 12 8   So being able to sell Starbucks can help Nestle increase sales here while Nestle s huge distribution network can help Starbucks grow sales internationally 
And that s exactly how the arrangement is being worked out  Nestl  is not buying equipment from Starbucks  but is taking over 500 employees as part of the deal  It will be in charge of producing Starbucks packaged coffees from beans sourced by Starbucks outside the U S  in accordance with the terms of the license  while Starbucks continues to produce packaged coffee and other goods in North America  All sales will be booked by Nestle 
The deal is even sweeter for Nestl  because its Nescafe brand of instant coffee has been losing market share over the past few years  Euromonitor  
Feeds Starbucks  Broader Growth Strategy
Starbucks needs to strengthen its position in the domestic market and quickly expand in emerging international markets 
Domestic
So as far as the domestic market is concerned  the coffee drinking culture  starting from teens hanging out at a coffee shop because it s cool to an old timer taking it at home  helps the company a lot  In fact  according to the National Coffee Association s  NCA  National Coffee Drinking Trends  NCDT  report for 2017  coffee consumption  especially of gourmet varieties  is increasing across all age groups 
Gourmet is especially popular in the two youngest age groups of 13 18 year olds  29  consume daily  and 18 24 year olds  39  consume daily   Even among older adults  gourmet consumption is growing much faster than overall consumption  making it a very important category 
Gourmet is a loosely defined term based on consumer perceptions in which the NCA includes any sort of non instant arabica or arabica blend coffee product  including certain K cups  premium arabica roasts from local roasters  bagged grocery coffee  or filter coffee and espresso drinks served in independent and chain coffee shops 
So it basically requires specialty coffees served in unique and innovative ways  Since specialty coffee is dependent on soil and climate conditions  fermentation and roasting techniques  and other processes  now more than ever before  there is the need for a connection between the farmer and the end consumer 
The coffee chain can be that important link  as it also experiments with innovative ways of serving up coffee  In addition to cold brews  these innovations could include the kind of water tonic being used for rendering different textures  the health aspect  using mushrooms  and appealing to the younger demographic with sweeter and creamier options 
As Starbucks turns its entire focus to its chains  that have taken a slight hit from lower mall footfall due to the shift online   it can do a better job of focusing on these customers

Coffee drinking is a cultural thing  so there are parts of the world  like the Nordic region  which consumes the most  to places like North America  most of Europe and parts of South America and Africa  which follows  But the coffee drinking culture is practically absent in Asia  where tea consumption is customary  So the ability to sell the social aspect to the upwardly mobile middle class in countries like China presents an attractive growth opportunity  China is all the more attractive because of its huge and growing middle class 
Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson has said that the two biggest growth engines for the company are the U S   where it focuses on premium sales  and China  where it is introducing the coffee culture to tea drinkers  So it is opening 500 stores a year in China with the goal of getting to 5 000 stores by 2021  Because it is easier to cater to customers that are learning about coffee  this is the company s fastest growing market 
In December last year  the company opened a 30 000 square foot Reserve Roastery in Shanghai that is even bigger than its flagship roastery in Seattle  A third roastery is set to launch in New York this year  A Starbucks roastery showcases the processes through which various coffee beans pass to reach the customer  It s a huge branding and marketing exercise designed to build a premium clientele over time    
Starbucks also bought out the 50  interest of its China JV partners Uni President Enterprises Corp and President Chain Store Corp  for  1 3 billion in cash  making all its Chinese stores company owned  Concurrent with the store expansion  it is racing to build customer relationships to ensure that people keep coming in 
Summing Up
Licensing the retail operations out to Nestle will allow the company to focus better on its key growth engines while helping to build brand awareness in other tea drinking populations like India where the Nestle brand is strong 
While strained U S  China relations are an overhang on all companies dependent on China  Starbucks has spent 18 years building relationships with its Chinese partners and its stores create a good employment opportunity for Chinese people  So  because of the positive commercial effect of its operations and the non threatening nature of its business  it s likely that the Chinese government will take a more pragmatic view of its operations in the country

94636,316151,SBUX, Stock Market News For May 16  2018,opinion,Wall Street witnessed broad based declines on Tuesday with all three major indexes closing in the red  This was primarily attributable to the yields on 10 year U S  Treasury Note which hit a seven year high  Jump is bond yield is possibly due to U S  retail sales which rose two consecutive months of March and April raising fear of inflationary pressures  Moreover  U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U S  Ambassador to China Terry Branstad commented that trade tensions between United States and China are far from over The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  closed at 24 706 41  decreased 0 8  or 193 points  The S P 500 Index  INX  decreased 0 7  to close at 2 711 45  The Nasdaq Composite Index  IXIC  closed at 7 351 63  decreased 0 8   A total of 6 60 billion shares were traded on Tuesday  lower than the last 20 session average of 6 67 billion shares  Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1 87  to 1 ratio  On the Nasdaq  decliners had an edge over advancers by 1 14 to  1 ratio  The CBOE VIX increased 13 2  and closed at 14 63  This was Wall Street s fear gauge s largest gain in one day since Apr 2 How Did the Benchmarks Perform The Dow lost 0 8  ending its eighth straight positive session  This was the blue chip index s biggest decline in three weeks  Notably  26 of the 30 stocks in the index closing in the red while 3 traded in the green and 1 remains unchanged   The S P 500 decreased 0 7  led by 1 7  decline of the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR  XLRE  and 1 3  decline of Healthcare Select Sector SPDR  XLV   Notably  10 out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory The Nasdaq Composite also decreased 0 8  led by fall in large tech stock s prices   Surge in U S  Government Bond YieldsOn Tuesday  yield on 10 year Treasury note surged 7 5 basis points to 3 070   its highest since July 2011  This was the biggest jump of the 10 year U S  Treasury Note in a single day since Mar 1  2018  Likewise  the 30 year bond yield spiked to 3 210  after gaining 8 1 basis points Since bond price and yield are negatively correlated  investors opted for safe haven bonds instead of risky equities  One possible reason for hike in treasury notes yield is strong retail sales data for the month of April as well as March which was revised upwardly  This indicates strong fundamentals of the U S  economy Higher consumer spending may generate inflationary pressure prompting the central bank to pursue aggressive interest rate policy to cooldown the economy  Consequently  hike in interest rate will raise cost of funds for both corporates and individuals resulting in stock market volatility Surge in U S  government bond yields had another negative effect on the economy  The dollar index  which measures the U S  dollar against a basket of six other currencies  was up 0 7  to 93 22  During Tuesday  the index was up overnight at 93 457  its highest since Dec 22  2017  A strong dollar will hurt U S  export Trade Tensions Lingers The ongoing trade conflict between United States and China is showing no sign of abating  The trade tensions which began in March after President Trump imposed tariffs on a large number of Chinses imports have only escalated thereafter  On Tuesday  U S  Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said that the countries are  very far apart  on trade issues On Monday  U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross failed to give any specific reason for resolving the U S  China trade conflict and hoped that good personal relationship between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may pave the way for a possible solution Any escalation of trade conflict will result in imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs between two countries  This will raise general price level of the economy resulting into inflation  Consequently  the Fed will have to raise interest rates more aggressively Economic DataThe Commerce Department reported that U S  retail sales rose 0 3  for the month of April  at par with the consensus estimate  Retail sales are up for two straight months and also rose 4 7  year over year  Notably  the March reading was revised to an increase of 0 8  from the previous figure of 0 6   Notably  9 out of a total of 13 industries witnessed an increase in sales in April The National Association of Home Builders reported that their sentiment index for the month of May rose 2 points to touch 70  April s reading was revised down 1 point to 68  The index stood at 69 in May 2017  Notably  any

94637,316152,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  Down 2 9  Since Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX    Shares have lost about 2 9  in that time frame 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is SBUX due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 ResultsStarbucks reported in line earnings but exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2018  The company s results benefited from an improved performance in the Americas segment  mainly in the United States   the ongoing momentum in China  following the takeover of East China  and strongest comps growth in Japan in the last five quarters Earnings  Sales   Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share  EPS  of 53 cents met the consensus mark but grew 17 8  year over year Total sales of  6 03 billion surpassed the consensus estimate of  5 9 billion by 2 3  and increased 13 9  from the year ago level  Notably  the acquisition of the East China business as well as other portfolio reshuffling activities lent a 3  net benefit to its top line  These activities include the closure of the Teavana mall store in the quarter  Tazo divestiture in December and conversion of certain international retail operations from company owned to licensed models  Meanwhile  currency translation had a 2  positive impact on the revenues The year over year performance was also driven by higher revenues from the opening of 2 103 net new stores over the past 12 months and higher global comps growth Global same store sales increased 2   same as first quarter fiscal 2018  Global traffic increased 3   better than 2  increase witnessed in the first quarter  Transactions were down 1  versus no growth recorded in the preceding quarter  The company opened 468 net new stores globally  bringing the total store count to 28 209 across 76 markets  It also closed 298 Teavana stores in the quarter Margin DownOperating margin decreased 490 bps year over year to 12 8  in the quarter  due to a product mix shift largely toward food and restructuring costs associated with the company s ongoing efforts of streamlining business operations  Again  higher spending in its store partners  employees  along with the impact of its ownership change in East China added to the woes On a non GAAP basis  operating margin declined 170 bps to 16 2  Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas  Net revenues in this flagship segment were up 8  year over year to  4 billion Comps growth of 2  in the quarter  same as the first quarter of fiscal 2018  comprised a 3  increase in average ticket  U S  comps also grew 2  albeit less than the 3  increase during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Importantly  this is the second consecutive quarter of 2  comps growth in Americas  mirroring concerns that its increased promotions somehow failed to attract a huge number of customers Food comps were more than 1  and food has consistently contributed in the 1 2  comps range for many years now  This momentum continued in the quarter as well with food s share of total U S  sales being 22   up 100 bps from the prior year quarter  Meanwhile  iced beverages contributed almost 40  to overall revenue growth Membership increased 12  year over year to 14 9 million in the My Starbucks Rewards  MSR  program  Customers in the United States are using the chain s mobile app to order and pay for their drinks  and are joining the company s rewards program  Mobile payments represented 12  of the U S  transactions  reflecting an increase from 8  a year ago Operating margin in the segment  however  contracted 220 bps to 20  as a strong sales leverage was more than offset by the impact of a food related mix shift and higher spending in its store partners China Asia Pacific  CAP   Net revenues increased 54  to  1 2 billion on the back of higher revenues from the acquisition of East China operations  new store openings and comps growth Comps grew 3   higher than 1  growth recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018  China continued to post impressive comps growth  with 4  improvement witnessed in the quarter  softer than 6  in fiscal first quarter   The softer sequential growth was attributed to a shift in the timing of the Lunar New Year  Meanwhile  Japan delivered its first quarter of positive comps since the first quarter of fiscal 2017  buoyed by a strong beverage lineup However  operating margin at the CAP segment contracted 570 bps year over year to 17 2  in the quarter  owing to the impact of its ownership change in East China Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA   The segment s net revenues were up 15  from the prior year quarter at  266 1 million  The improvement was prompted by higher revenues from the addition of new stores and a positive currency effect That said  comps declined 1   compared with a 2  decline in fiscal first quarter  Operating margin declined 1 360 bps due to a partial impairment of goodwill related to the Switzerland retail business and sales deleverage on company operated stores Channel Development  Net revenues improved 8  to  500 2 million  The growth was driven by higher sales of premium single serve products Operating margin improved 100 bps to 43  All Other  The segment comprises Seattle s Best Coffee  Starbucks Reserve Coffee and Roastery businesses  and Teavana branded stores  Revenues at the segment decreased 32  to  75 6 million Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks expects global comps growth at the lower end of its earlier projected guidance of 3 5   The company still expects to add approximately 2 300 net new stores globally  Consolidated revenue growth is expected in high single digits The company expects its GAAP EPS in the range of  3 32  3 36 Starbucks expects non GAAP EPS in the range of  2 48  2 53 compared with  2 30  2 33 expected earlier  Although the guidance is consistent with the company s earlier projection  it excludes the impact of its previously announced plan to close more than 8 000 company owned stores in the United States on May 29  2018 to conduct racial bias training for all partners  employees  in the United States

 Our forward thinking approach to commerce is what has brought Israeli based Cafe Joe to American homes  and now to crypto coffee lovers around the world   it added

94655,316170,SBUX,Trump escalates attack on Amazon  focusing on tax  shipping,news,"By Lisa Lambert and Jeff Mason WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump accused Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  on Thursday of not paying enough tax  taking advantage of the U S  postal system and putting small retailers out of business  but he offered no evidence to back up his criticisms and did not suggest any actions he would take  Trump has attacked Amazon and its Chief Executive Jeff Bezos several times  and his latest comment came a day after news website Axios reported he was obsessed with the world s largest online retailer and wanted to rein in its growing power  possibly with federal antitrust or competition laws   I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election  Unlike others  they pay little or no taxes to state   local governments  use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy  causing tremendous loss to the U S    and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business   Trump tweeted early on Thursday  Amazon shares fell as much as 4 5 percent in morning trade  but recovered and closed up just over 1 percent  The stock dropped 5 percent on Wednesday following the Axios report  Amazon declined to comment on the tweet   The retailer and cloud computing pioneer is the latest company Trump has singled out for praise or condemnation  although the effect on stock prices of his targets is generally short lived  Trump s criticism did not diminish U S  fund managers  long term enthusiasm for Amazon  whose stock has risen more than five fold in the last five years    If there really was teeth or real concern that something would come out of the government and regulatory oversight  Amazon s stock drop would be a lot lower than it is today   said Robert Bacarella  portfolio manager at Monetta Financial Services in Wheaton  Illinois  which holds Amazon shares  TAX BREAKS  Trump s attacks on Amazon reflect a broader debate about its effect on the U S  economy  It employs many of its 566 000 full and part time staff in the United States and has allowed some small vendors to thrive on its service  but it has also been blamed by some for putting brick and mortar stores out of business as more people shop online   The Seattle based company has promised to create 50 000 new jobs as it invests  5 billion in a second headquarters in North America  Amazon s choice of location for the new campus  winnowed to 20 candidates in January  has sparked fierce competition between state and local governments offering extensive tax breaks   Trump does not have any new policies planned that would affect Amazon  a White House official said on Thursday  adding that Trump was prompted to speak out on the subject in reaction to news reports this week   Amazon has been criticized for attempting to skirt state sales taxes  but since April last year it has voluntarily collected state sales tax on items it sells direct to customers in all 45 states that have one  Amazon does not have to collect taxes on third party sellers using its Marketplace service  That issue was the cause of some of Trump s ire  White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett told Fox Business Network   Amazon vendors that can run through the Amazon Marketplace     don t collect the sales tax  And that s about half of their sales   he said  Washington and Pennsylvania recently enacted laws requiring collection of third party merchants  sales taxes  and other states are expected to follow   The issue is still being disputed at the federal level  with the U S  Supreme Court set to hear oral arguments on April 17 in a case which could reverse a 1992 decision that only companies with a physical presence in a state are required to collect state sales tax  Investors largely waved off concerns about that on Thursday    If there is a law that regulates how you tax third party sellers  it s going to apply to everyone and Amazon s position will remain the same   said Steve Chiavarone  a portfolio manager at Federated Investors  Amazon has carved out an influential position in Washington through lobbying  campaign contributions and pushing policy issues like job creation  but it could still face problems if Trump takes action against it   There s a lot of things where the federal government can do real damage to any business  and that s precisely why we don t want the president to attack individual companies  certainly not for political reasons   said Stan Veuger  an expert on politics and finance at the conservative American Enterprise Institute  POST DISPUTE  It is not clear that Amazon is responsible for the United States Postal Service  USPS  losing money  although Wall Street analysts have estimated it pays USPS roughly half what it would to  United Parcel  Service Inc  N UPS  or FedEx Corp  N FDX  to deliver a package   Details of Amazon s payments to USPS are not publicly known  USPS declined to comment on Trump s tweet   An independent agency of the U S  federal government  USPS reported a net loss of  2 7 billion for fiscal 2017  largely due to increased costs of retirement benefits   Deliveries for Amazon and other online retailers are the fastest growing part of USPS  business  helping offset a sharp decline in regular first class mail  Its revenue from shipping and packages in fiscal 2017 was  19 5 billion  up 13 percent from the previous year    Common sense suggests USPS needs Amazon more than Amazon needs USPS   Stifel analysts wrote in a research report this week   Amazon has undoubtedly contributed to the closure of many brick and mortar stores and the bankruptcy of some chains as more people shop online instead of in malls  But there are other factors  such as high debt  and Amazon is not solely responsible   Yes  Amazon has put thousands of retailers out of business   said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter   Walmart  NYSE WMT  has also put thousands of retailers out of business  So has Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   Barnes   Noble  NYSE BKS   Kroger  NYSE KR  and any other superstore that took share from small businesses   Amazon founder Bezos also

94656,316171,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  To Close Stores For Antibias Training,opinion,Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   has announced its plan to close more than 8 000 company owned U S  stores for several hours next month  to conduct anti bias training for nearly 175 000 workers  This move of the coffee chain giant is mainly aimed to address the recent uproar over the arrest of two black men at one of its stores in Philadelphia The company s CEO Kevin Johnson called the incident  reprehensible  and apologized to the two men face to face  Johnson said   Closing our stores for racial bias training is just one step in a journey that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local communities  Starbucks  being one of the most high profile brands  announced that it will also provide training materials for non company workers at roughly 6 000 licensed Starbucks cafes that will remain open in locations such as grocery stores and airports The incident is one of the major trials for Johnson  who has already been struggling to increase the company s traffic  The coffee chain giant has been posting weak sales growth amid persistent decline in the country s restaurant sales  Starbucks reported tepid 2  comps growth in fiscal first quarter in the Americas segment compared with 3  in the year ago period  Again  competition from other coffee sellers comprising hipster cafes or fast food chains and convenience stores are added concerns Now  apart from tepid sales growth  Starbucks will likely miss revenues owing to store closures  Per MarketWatch calculations  the latest store closures will cost the company about  12 million in lost revenues  Starbucks had earlier closed stores for training in 2008 that cost the company about  6 million Although the company will have to bear the burnt of revenue loss owing to store closures  the company s move in offering company wide training is the right thing for Starbucks  business to sustain its reputation Share Price PerformanceStarbucks  shares have gained 8 4  in the last six months compared with the  s growth of 2 7   The company is strengthening its portfolio with major innovations  best in class loyalty program and digital offerings to counter tepid sales growth  Meanwhile  earnings estimates for the current quarter have moved down one cent while remaining unchanged for the current fiscal year over the last 30 days  Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Some better ranked stocks in the same space are Dine Brands Global  Inc    NYSE DIN    Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc    NYSE ARCO   and Ruth s Hospitality Group  Inc    NASDAQ RUTH    each sporting a Zacks rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Dine Brands is expected to witness 22 7  earnings growth in 2018 Arcos has a 3 5 years expected EPS growth rate of 19 4  Ruth s Hospitality s 2018 earnings are expected to grow 22 7  Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this year  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events  But some stocks are better investments than others Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to help Zacks com readers make the most of the  170 billion per year investment opportunity created by hackers and other threats  It reveals 4 stocks worth looking into right away ,2018-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-sbux-to-close-stores-for-antibias-training-200306520,200306520
94657,316172,SBUX,Should You Buy Starbucks  SBUX  Stock Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   battled into the green on Wednesday afternoon amid up and down trading throughout the market  with investors juggling between solid earnings growth and concerns about rising Treasury yields as bullish and bearish catalysts  Nevertheless  with a consumer company the size of Starbucks set to report its latest quarterly results on Thursday  investors will want to be prepared 
Starbucks grabbed headlines recently when its CEO decided to close all U S  locations for mandatory racial bias training after a troubling profiling incident at one of its stores  But that closure will not happen until May  and investors will want to be ready for the coffee giant s second quarter fiscal 2018 report this week 
So what should investors expect when Starbucks announces its Q2 results on Thursday afternoon  Let s take a closer look 
Latest Outlook and Valuation
According to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates  analysts are expecting Starbucks to report earnings of  0 53 per share and revenue of  5 90 billion  These results would represent year over year growth rates of 17 8  and 11 4   respectively 
 
As we near its report date  Starbucks is trading at about 21 7x forward 12 month earnings  Over the past year  its Forward P E has been as high as 25 1 and as low as 20 7  It has traded with a median forward earnings multiple of 23 2x in that time  The company s industry peers are currently sporting an average Forward P E of 21 0  Investors might conclude that SBUX is trading at a slight premium to its industry but remains on the low end of its recent valuation range 
Earnings ESP Whispers
Investors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Starbucks surprises investors with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Starbucks is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an Earnings ESP of  0 3   This means that the most recent estimates have been lower than the consensus  In other words  our model is not conclusively calling for a beat 
Surprise History
Another important thing to consider ahead of Starbucks  report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices  The coffee retailer is a respectable earnings performer  having met or surpassed estimates in each of the trailing nine quarters 
However  we prefer to judge the price effect of earnings announcements by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report  Over the course of its recent streak  Starbucks has moved higher in just three of these windows 
Bottom Line
Starbucks is a bit pricier than the broader market  although its ability to witness double digit growth on the top and bottom line this year might warrant that premium  Either way  earnings season tends to be a volatile time for the stock  and investors will be interested in the company s guidance more so than anything else

94667,316182,SBUX,3 REITs Paying 6   That Are  Cheap For A Reason ,opinion,"I love nothing more than bargain real estate   especially if I can buy it with a single click of my mouse  or one tap from my smartphone  
REITs  real estate investment trusts  are as cheap as they ve been this decade  Prices are low  and yields are high   making this an ideal time to buy 
Unless  of course  their tenants are watching their own business models vanish before their very eyes  If clients can t pay the rent  then their REIT landlords won t be able to pay us our dividends 
And if we re not banking dividends from REITs  then what s the point  Here are three REITs that appear  pointless  to own right now 
Urstadt Biddle Properties  UBA  Dividend Yield  5 9  52 Week Decline  16 
Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc  NYSE UBA  is a primarily retail focused REIT   with tenants such as Party City Holdco Inc  NYSE PRTY   Aldi and Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX    that operates across New York  New Jersey  New Hampshire and Connecticut  It also has a little exposure to office space and storage  but that slight amount of diversification hasn t been enough to shield it from the malaise currently affecting its industry 
Back in November  I pointed out Urstadt Biddle as one of   Sure enough  UBA pulled through with a 9 1  hike to 24 cents per share  good for a 24th consecutive year of higher payouts 
That s the good news 
As I also mentioned at the time  Urstadt Biddle had seen occupancy decline in the first three quarters of 2017  and the REIT capped off the golden sombrero with its Q4 report  Occupancy declined to 91    off from 91 6  at the end of Q3  and all the way down from 92 8  at the end of fiscal 2016  Moreover  properties were 92 7  leased  off from 93 3  a year ago 
The company also had a lousy quarter on the operational front  with funds from operation plunging from 36 cents per class A share in the year ago period to just 21 cents  That sent full year FFO down from  1 25 per share to  1 15 
So despite the fact that that UBA is trading at levels last seen in 2015  it s still going for roughly 16 times FFO  That hardly screams  value   It s just cheap 
GGP Inc Pref Series A  NYSE GGP pa  Dividend Yield  4 2  52 Week Decline  13 
GGP Inc   GGP  is a particularly alluring choice at the moment not just because of its far higher than normal yield  but also the still existent possibility of a buyout pop 
GGP is a high end retail real estate operator whose 125 property portfolio across 40 states includes a host of malls  but notably even some property on New York s Fifth Avenue  The REIT s tenants include the likes of Cartier  Prada and Versace  so it s not as if Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is necessarily banging at the door like it is for some of Urstadt s tenants  But GGP  swanky clientele and all  has been struggling nonetheless 
The stock is off nearly 35  from its mid 2016 peak as the company s funds from operations have essentially flat lined  Now  GGP s dividend  at 88 cents per share annually  still is only 56  of its 2017 FFO   1 57 per share   But the simple fact is that while the nominal dividend and its yield have been shooting higher  that hasn t come on any extra ability to actually fund the payout 
GGP s Dividend Isn t in Danger  But Watch This Trend 
There is a wild card  Back in November  Brookfield Property Partners LP  NASDAQ BPY  bid  14 8 billion  or about  23 per share  for the remaining 66  of GGP it didn t already own  That bid represented a roughly 21  premium from the  19 per share GGP was trading around the time Brookfield and GGP reportedly were negotiating  Shares naturally popped 
But GGP rejected the bid in December  Investors initially kept the REIT s shares aloft  believing an increased bid was looming  However  it has been months  and while Brookfield s original bid reportedly still is on the table  every day that goes by hints more strongly to the likelihood that a white knight isn t coming 
That means investors are left holding onto a low growth prospect with a mediocre yield   one that still has a little buyout premium to work off 
EPR Properties  NYSE EPR  Dividend Yield  7 6  52 Week Decline  28 
This next sell call comes as a particular disappointment to me  While I hadn t yet built enough conviction to add EPR Properties  EPR  to my own portfolios  I have previously touted its prospects  
EPR Properties is a multi industry REIT whose portfolio is diversified across entertainment  theaters  family entertainment centers   recreation  ski areas  iFly indoor skydiving and TopGolf driving ranges  and education  public charter and private schools  and early education centers   There are scores of mall REITs  office REITs  residential REITs and healthcare REITs  but no other real estate investment trust has its fingers in so many niche trends in the seemingly right places 
But EPR s story is changing  and not for the better 
The REIT recently reported 2017 numbers that were just fine  with revenue up 17  year over year and adjusted FFO growing 4   However  2018 estimates were shockingly bad  with the company lowering adjusted FFO guidance 10 cents per share to  5 33  5 48  That s in part affected by Children s Learning Adventure  an EPR tenant that has filed for bankruptcy protection 
EPR also hacked away at its investment forecast  which was  700 million  800 million but now stands at  400 million to  700 million  KeyBanc s Craig Mailman downgraded the stock to the hold equivalent  Sector Weight   saying those figures  as well as a higher disposition forecast  implied no net investment for the current yield 
This REIT now trades for about roughly 10 times projected 2018 adjusted FFO  which should cover its expected  4 32 in annual dividends  an increase over 2017  with plenty of room to spare  However  the growth story has been thrown into complete disarray for the time being  and additional upward interest rate pressure could really tighten the screws 
This may be a buy once again in the future  but for now  avoid EPR 
7 Rate Proof   Recession Proof REITs  Averaging 8 5  Yields  with Upside  
Rather than scrape the barrel for distressed moonshots like EPR Properties  seek out quality instead  The seven REITs in my  check both boxes for  dividend growth  and  high current yield    two must have traits for rising rate environments 
As a group  they pay an impressive 8 5  average yield today  That s outstanding in a 3  world 
Combine 5  to 10   dividend growth with these high single digit current yields  and we have a formula for safe 15  to 20   annual gains from REITs  With a significant portion of that coming as cash dividends 
And thanks to the new tax plan  there s never been a better time to buy REITs and live off their dividends 
 REIT investors will benefit from the tax breaks that  pass through  businesses will receive in the new code  Investors will be allowed deduct 20  of their REIT dividend income  which means the 37  tax bill will drop to 29 6   
But it s important to choose your REITs wisely 
Don t buy low yielding static payer  Don t buy a retail REIT  either  with that entire industry is in a death spiral  future rent checks will be dicey for years to come  
Instead  focus on recession proof firms  such as those that rent hospitals  business lodging and warehouses filled with Amazon packages  Landlords that own properties that will be in high demand no matter what happens to interest rates or the economy from here  in other words

94677,316192,SBUX,Starbucks opens first Reserve store  sees retail rents easing,news,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES  Reuters     Starbucks Corp   O SBUX  on Tuesday will open the first of 1 000 planned upscale Starbucks Reserve stores as part of a broad strategy to defend against high end coffee rivals like Intelligentsia Coffee   Tea and Blue Bottle Coffee Co  S NESN  
Starbucks for the first time in 2017 had more U S  outlets than McDonald s Corp  N MCD   The world s biggest coffee chain reached that milestone as competition from high  and low end rivals mounted  and its own cooling traffic trends sparked worries that it was opening too many stores 
The new Reserve store is located in Starbucks  Seattle headquarters building and will expand on the company s showcase Seattle Reserve Roastery drink menu with new items such as nitro draft lattes  It also will serve food from Princi Italian bakery and alcoholic drinks from a  mixology  bar 
Starbucks co founder and Executive Chairman Howard Schultz  who stepped down as chief executive in April to oversee the chain s ultra premium Roastery and Reserve projects  said the new project will help  re define customer connection and continue to serve as a halo to the rest of the business  
In a memo to employees on Sunday  Schultz said he has seen an  abundance of empty store fronts across the country  in prime locations and predicted that rents would begin to fall due to the continued shift from brick and mortar stores to online shopping 
 This is GOOD NEWS for Starbucks and the future of our unit economics   Schultz said in the memo   This is not going to be a cyclical change in our occupancy expenses  but a permanent lowering of the cost of our real estate  
Starbucks has been opening about 700 traditional U S  cafes per year  It has long term plans to open up to 30 Reserve Roastery emporiums  1 000 Reserve stores and to install Reserve bars at 20 percent of its mainstay stores 
It also plans to open stand alone Princi stores in Seattle  Chicago and New York  In 2016  Starbucks made a financial investment in Princi and struck a global licensing deal with the Milan  Italy based artisanal bakery ",2018-02-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/starbucks-opens-first-reserve-store-sees-retail-rents-easing-1313598,1313598
94678,316193,SBUX,Has The  Crypto Bubble  Popped  ,opinion,"On Friday night the price of Bitcoin dipped below  7000  with many proclaiming that   And given all that we have seen in crypto space over the past year  it s a legitimate reaction 
Yet what remains more important is whether or not that reaction is ultimately correct 
Certainly if you paid  20 000 for a Bitcoin  or bought any of the other tokens near their highs  the current prices are significantly lower  Yet keep in mind that only a year ago you were able to buy a Bitcoin for  1 000  and those who did so are still up sevenfold on their investment  So while prices are well off the highs  it s not as if the entire market has gone away 
It s also worth considering that while we certainly feel the impact of the price swings  they re not always entirely reflective of the underlying developments  The crypto space has a market cap that has hovered between  200 and  600 billion  while the approximate value of the world s stock markets is   So keep in mind that we are talking about a relatively small market that can move significantly when money is flowing in and out 
In one of Arcadia s recent  I wrote the following when Bitcoin was around  16 000 

 Perhaps a simple way of looking at it is that if we re only at a 1  adoption rate  and this is the future technology the world is going to need  prices are going up  Keep in mind that view is based on those assumptions playing out  I feel as if they will  and should that occur  even at current prices  having cryptos in your investment portfolio will pay off  Is it possible that Bitcoin drops back down to  10 000   7 000  Even lower  Absolutely  And if nothing else  if you are going to get involved in the cryptos it s essential to be prepared for extreme volatility  

With that said  I mentioned then and continue to feel now that while there is going to be a lot of volatility in the short term  ultimately the long term will be decided by how useful the technology is and how much it is adopted  Because regardless of what today s prices are  if crypto technology is providing the infrastructure for what will replace the dying dollar system  the value of cryptos will necessarily have to rise 
In recent months we ve seen significant stock market selloffs as interest rates have risen  In the past week yields have declined somewhat  but should the Fed continue to raise rates while backing away from its quantitative easing balance sheet  there s significant reason to believe that there could be  
And one way of thinking about it is that with the world stock markets around  76 trillion while the current market cap of the crypto space is around  250 billion  if even 1 76th of the money in the stock market left and went into cryptos  that would result in a quintupling of the market 
So while the price action is relevant  it s also worthwhile to keep an eye on the actual adoption  Because that s what s really going to matter in the long run 
There continue to be rumors of Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and or Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  adopting cryptos as payment  Which in the event either should occur would certainly provide a much more visible presence to those who still know little about cryptos  Such a move would also have the potential to rapidly increase the overall implementation of the technology 
In terms of adoption that s already taking place now  consider the following links 
 BIG 4  BTC  ETH  XRP  LTC  To Gain In  Why This Billionaire Just Made a  JPMorgan Says It May Have to  Adapt  to Counter  Kik App Partners With Unity Technologies To Improve  Regulations Will Enable The Global   Throughout Market Correction
I continue to feel excited about my crypto investments and like buying at the current levels  Which may not be suitable for everyone  Yet keep in mind that cryptos can still represent a valuable part of a portfolio  With  part  being the key word there 
Because you don t have to necessarily take everything you own and load up  A portfolio allocation of even 1 5  can provide an excellent means of diversification  especially should the current system continue to decline 
Can I or anyone else say for sure what will happen in the world  Of course not  But trading is a science of probabilities  and when I think about the potential weighted outcomes  it still makes sense to me for most portfolios to have some crypto exposure 
After all  it s not as if any of the problems with the U S  debt have been addressed  In fact as the debt has crossed  20 trillion  now the budgets are already forecasting it will hit  30 trillion by 2028  All while signs that the current bubbles in the stock  bond  and real estate markets might be teetering continue to emerge 
So let s say there is some probability that cryptos are bubble and stay at current levels or even go substantially lower 
There s also some probability that the paper markets crash and a lot of money is looking for a new home and flows into crypto space  And as I roughly detailed above  if any significant amount comes out of the stock  bond  real estate markets and goes into cryptos  we could easily see exponential gains  Much like what was witnessed in 2017 
But let s use a simple example to make it even more clear 
Let s say that there is a 50  chance that cryptos go to zero  and a 50  chance that the scenario just outlined occurs  To pick a specific coin to use  let s consider Litecoin  which is currently trading around  120 
Some simple calculations might look like this 
50  x  0 Litecoin
50  x  600 Litecoin  using the 5x multiple mentioned above as a reference Resulting in a weighted average price of  300  While it currently trades at  120 
Obviously the 5x multiple is somewhat arbitrary  Although I would say conservative should you have an event like Starbucks or Amazon accepting Litecoin as payment  Especially since at its highs Litecoin has already traded near  400  Of course there are also many who believe that the true value of Litecoin is substantially higher then either of those numbers 
With the point being that there is a skew to the bet  Especially if the technology is implemented and adopted at an increasing rate 
Of course there is risk to any investment  but if you make enough bets with the odds and skew in your favor  that s a good way to come out ahead in the long run  Which given the unusual nature of today s financial markets  is the way I continue to approach this environment 
So if you re holding cryptos and not feeling so good about the price being lower  consider that all of the reasons you likely invested in cryptos in the first place are still largely intact  While all of the reasons that money is flowing out of the fiat debt based system are also intact 
Which means one thing that we can be sure of is that the future price action of the cryptos will be exciting to say the least  And personally I continue to feel that we will see new price highs well before the year is done ",2018-04-02,Chris Marcus,https://www.investing.com/analysis/has-the-crypto-bubble-popped-200302535,200302535

94680,316195,SBUX,U S  economy gains 313 000 jobs in February  wage growth slows,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth surged in February  recording its biggest increase in more than 1 1 2 years  but a slowdown in wage gains pointed to only a gradual increase in inflation this year  Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 313 000 jobs last month  boosted by the largest rise in construction jobs since 2007  the Labor Department said on Friday  The payrolls gain was the biggest since July 2016 and triple the roughly 100 000 jobs the economy needs to create each month to keep up with growth in the working age population  The labor market is benefiting from strong domestic demand  an improvement in global growth as well as robust U S  business sentiment following the Trump administration s  1 5 trillion income tax cut package that come into effect in January  Average hourly earnings edged up four cents  or 0 1 percent  to  26 75 in February  a slowdown from the 0 3 percent rise in January  That lowered the year on year increase in average hourly earnings to 2 6 percent from 2 8 percent in January  The unemployment rate was unchanged at a 17 year low of 4 1 percent in February for a fifth straight month as 806 000 people entered the labor force in a sign of confidence in the job market  The average workweek rebounded to 34 5 hours after falling to 34 4 hours in January  With Federal Reserve officials considering the labor market to be near or a little beyond full employment  the moderation in wage growth last month did little to change the view that the U S  central bank will raise interest rates at its March 20 21 policy meeting  Slow wage growth  however  could temper expectations the Fed will raise its rate forecast to four hikes this year from three  There is optimism that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth this year and pull inflation toward the Fed s 2 percent target   While the employment gains unequivocally suggest underlying strength in the economy  wage gains remain muted enough for the Fed to continue with an only gradual normalization of the policy stance  Stock markets are reacting accordingly   said Harm Bandholz  chief U S  economist at UniCredit Bank in New York  Speculation that the central bank would upgrade its rate projections was stoked by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell when he told lawmakers last week that  my personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December    While Powell said there was no evidence of the economy overheating  he added  the thing we don t want to have happen is to get behind the curve   Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 200 000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate falling to 4 0 percent  Average hourly earnings had been expected to increase 0 2 percent in February  Data for December and January was revised to show the economy adding 54 000 more jobs than previously reported  U S  stock indexes opened higher after the data while prices of U S  Treasuries were trading lower  The dollar  DXY  was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies  CONSTRUCTION SHINES Some companies like  Starbucks Corp   O SBUX  and FedEx Corp  N FDX  have said they would use some of their windfall from a tax cut package to boost workers  salaries  Walmart  N WMT  announced an increase in entry level wages for hourly employees at its U S  stores effective in February  The employment report suggested the economy remained strong despite weak consumer spending  home sales  industrial production and a wider trade deficit in January that prompted economists to lower their first quarter growth estimates  Gross domestic product estimates for the January March quarter are around a 2 percent annualized growth rate  The economy grew at a 2 5 percent pace in the fourth quarter  The full impact of the tax cuts and a planned increase in government spending has yet to be felt  and a robust job market could heighten fears of the economy overheating    The economy is simply too strong   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York   There s no reason whatsoever for the Federal Reserve to have a stimulative monetary policy at this stage of the business cycle    Economists expect the unemployment rate to fall to 3 5 percent this year  A broader measure of unemployment  which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment  was unchanged at 8 2 percent last month   The labor force participation rate  or the proportion of working age Americans who have a job or are looking for one  rose three tenths of a percentage point to a five month high of 63 0 percent in February   An even broader gauge of labor market health  the percentage of working age Americans with a job  increased to 60 4 percent last month from 60 1 percent in January  Employment gains were led by the construction sector  which added 61 000 jobs  the most since March 2007  Hiring at construction sites was likely boosted by unseasonably mild temperatures in February   Manufacturing payrolls increased by 31 000 jobs  rising for a seventh straight month  The sector is being supported by strong domestic and international demand as well as a weaker dollar  Retail payrolls jumped by 50 300  the largest increase since February 2016   The Labor Department said that was because on an unadjusted basis the sector hired fewer workers than usual for the holiday season and did not shed many jobs after the holidays  As a result  retail employment rose after the seasonal adjustment  the department said   Government employment increased by 26 000 jobs last month  with hiring of teachers by local governments accounting for the bulk of the rise  There were also increases in payrolls for professional and business services  leisure and hospitality as well as healthcare and social assistance   
Financial sector payrolls increased by 28 000 last month  the most since October 2005 ",2018-03-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/strong-us-job-growth-forecast-unemployment-rate-seen-at-4-percent-1333509,1333509
94681,316196,SBUX,Smartsheet Files For IPO Amidst Ongoing Tech Storm,opinion,"Silicon Valley may be in the center of a whirling political maelstrom surrounding how today s leading tech companies use their customer s data  but that s not stopping executives at Smartsheet from going public  The Seattle area tech company is aiming to raise  100 million in its market debut  which could make it one of the most highly watched IPOs of a year that s thus far been defined by impressive tech companies going public 
Here are the hidden details of Smartsheet s upcoming IPO  and what tech investors need to be aware of before throwing their financial heft behind the company 
The world isn t happy with Silicon Valley It goes without saying that consumers right now are upset at Silicon Valley executives preaching about changing the world  companies like Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Google are suffering from absolutely brutal headlines and media coverage revolving around the way they secretly leverage their users  data  and it seems like the intense scrutiny surrounding tech companies right now isn t going away anytime soon  Given the ongoing tech furor  many tech investors are shying away from the market  which could be a huge mistake  given the waves Smartsheet is soon to generate when it debuts on the New York Stock Exchange 
Smartsheet  NYSE  SMAR  will likely be flying under the radar when it comes to consumer outrage  the company is a cloud based platform aiming to help businesses optimize their digital operations  not a social media brand  meaning it won t suffer from any embarrassing user data fueled fiascos anytime soon  Indeed  up to this point  Smartsheet has built quite a positive reputation for itself  the company has some 3 6 million happy users around the globe  and has ingratiated itself with Fortune 100 companies  some 90  of which use Smartsheet s services in some form 
Smartsheet may also lure in some investors with its promising revenue growth  the company has seen its revenue swell by sizable figures in recent years  leaping from some  40 8 million in 2016 to a hefty  111 3 million in fiscal year 2018  Still  sizable revenue gains haven t been able to offset the company s consistent losses  Smartsheet has been losing more and more money as of late  having posted losses of  14 3 million in 2016 that swelled to more than  49 million in fiscal year 2018  Such dismal net losses like that will give many tech investors reason to pause before deciding to back Smartsheet 
Financial figures aren t the only thing on investors  minds  either  The company s prospectus   with the SEC  also gives plenty of reasons to worry about its future  Smartsheet will be competing against established tech monsters like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   which can doubtlessly pour untold millions into the development of services that will aim to steal away some of Smartsheet s users  The company has already sparked Amazon s ire by poaching one of its executives  which ignited a legal battle that Smartsheet eventually won 
Clearly  Smartsheet has the zeal needed to compete against established tech monopolies in today s market  but is that enough for the company s future on the market 
Smartsheet s unknown future If Smartsheet hopes to be anything more than a briefly watched IPO on the NYSE  it needs to make some structural changes to how it operates to  more investors  The company has already pledged to use the profits from its IPO  which could reap it in more than  100 million  to optimize its existing staff structure and better invest in its future  Still  investors will want to see concrete results if they re throwing their money behind Smartsheet  and will likely harp its executives until net losses are seriously trimmed down  Competitors like Asana and Workfront  not to mention huge tech names like Alphabet  will soon be breathing down the Smartsheet s neck if the company doesn t get out of the red 
Smartsheet s impressive valuation could instill some confidence in investors that it has the immense financial capital it needs to stay up to date and competitive  after all  the company was  at more than  800 million in the past  and has successfully reaped in tens of millions of dollars before through venture capital funding  If Smartsheet s IPO is a success  there will be little reason to doubt that the company has all the money it needs to continue bringing impressive services to the market  With major Fortune 100 companies like Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  relying on Smartsheet to provide the services they need to effectively manage their businesses in today s digital economy coupled with the massive amount of money Smartsheet is sure to raise from its IPO  it s hard to see the company struggling in the near future  Investors should keep Smartsheet s consistent history of posting net losses in mind before they throw their money behind it  however  as growing revenue figures mean little to those analysts concerned who see them overshadowed by rising costs of doing business ",2018-04-04,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/smartsheet-files-for-ipo-amidst-ongoing-tech-storm-200302929,200302929

94686,316201,SBUX,What Do Quincy Jones  Serena Williams And Blockchain Have In Common ,opinion,"Two big themes last week at Inside ETFs  the Comic Con of exchange traded funds attended by more than 2 300 advisors and investors  were innovation and disruption  Like all other industries  the investing world has seen its fair share of disruption in the past quarter century think indexing  passive investing  the rise of robo allocation and now blockchain and cryptocurrencies  This year marks the 25th anniversary of the first ever ETF  and today total ETF assets top  3 trillion  That s a far cry from the estimated  40 trillion sitting in mutual funds worldwide  but exchange traded funds are rapidly catching up as investors seek cheaper  more innovative and tax efficient instruments 
Consider robo advisors  which emerged only 10 years ago  Who would have thought in the mid 2000s that so many investors would be comfortable enough with the idea of a machine managing their money  And yet here we are  By 2020  Citi analysts predict  assets controlled by robo advisors could reach close to  450 billion globally 
Disruption was definitely top of mind during many of the presentations and interviews at Inside ETFs  including that of producer and composer Quincy Jones  who was at the conference to promote a new stock index that tracks music and entertainment companies   Q  is the very definition of a legend  having been at the center of some of the most influential musicians  actors  and artists over the course of his long career  With a record 79 Grammy Award nominations to his name  he s made an indelible impression on the music  television  and film we all consume and enjoy  whether we re aware of it or not 
When CNBC s Bob Pisani asked Jones if he was ready for the day when robots write and perform music  the 84 year old Jones said   You can t stop the technology   adding that he was among the earliest experimenters of synthesizers   Anyone remember the synthy theme song to the old 1960s 1970s detective show  Ironside  That was composed by Quincy Jones  
 You got to always stay curious  You got to be willing to take a chance   he said 
A similar forward thinking attitude was expressed by Serena Williams  who was also in attendance  The tennis virtuoso and four time Olympic gold medal winner  who bagged her 23rd Grand Slam last year while pregnant  is a savvy businesswoman in her own right  sitting on the board of online survey firm SurveyMonkey and Oath  a subsidiary of Verizon that controls a number of media outlets such as HuffPost  Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  and Tumblr 
When asked why she was drawn to tech firms in particular her husband Alexis Ohanian co founded Reddit Williams said   This is a new time  and I don t want to be left behind  
I couldn t agree more with Jones and Williams 
Embracing Disruption with HIVE Blockchain Technologies
Curiosity and a willingness to embrace change and innovation are what led me to invest in HIVE Blockchain Technologies and agree to become its chairman last year  As many of you know  HIVE is the first publicly traded company engaged in the mining of virgin digital currencies  including bitcoin  Ethereum  Litecoin  Dash  Monero and many more 
I m thrilled to be at the forefront of this new technology that s already disrupting our industry and reshaping how transactions are made and companies raise funds across the globe  The year 2017 was the real catalyst  bringing cryptocurrencies into mainstream conversations as bitcoin hit an all time high of nearly  20 000 apiece in mid December 
Total crypto market cap briefly cracked  830 billion earlier this month yet has since receded to around  540 billion  with strong pressure being exerted by the global equities bull market  A record  33 2 billion flowed into stocks in the week ended January 24  according to investments data provider EPFR Global  U S  stocks alone attracted  7 billion  while emerging markets saw inflows reach  8 1 billion  the second highest amount recorded in a week 
Competition among digital currencies is also heating up  Although bitcoin remains the top dog  it faces tough competition from the likes of Ethereum  Litecoin  Ripple and the other nearly 1 500 coins on the market today  It now accounts for about 40 percent of the entire market  down from almost 100 percent just a few years ago 
What s important to remember is that digital currencies are  at the moment  highly volatile and speculative  Unlike gold and other hard assets  they haven t been tested in all economic backdrops  Bitcoin was created only in 2009  after the worst months of the financial crisis  and it s existed mainly in an environment of rising equity prices and gradually improving economic conditions  How investors might use it in the next recession or major market correction is unknown at this point 
Coinbase Generated  1 Billion in Sales Last Year
Having said that  the crypto space is rapidly maturing in a number of different ways  Every day  more and more businesses accept the currency as a form of payment  Investors can now buy bitcoin futures  Fidelity and USAA both allow account holders to monitor their cryptocurrency holdings  Blockchain ETFs are appearing on the market though a couple of proposed bitcoin ETFs have hit roadblocks getting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC   And I overheard at the Canaccord Genuity Blockchain Conference in Toronto last week that as many as 10 000 millionaires have been created from Ethereum 
Last year  the cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase booked  1 billion in revenue  almost double what company executives had expected for 2017  Founded only six years ago and boasting more than 13 5 million accounts  Coinbase has recently closed the door on any additional venture capital  leaving investors to hope for an initial public offering  IPO  sometime in the near future 
Coinbase is about to face some serious competition  though  as smartphone only trading app Robinhood will begin allowing customers to trade bitcoin and Ethereum next month all commission free 
World Gold Council  Cryptocurrencies Are No Substitute for Gold
Several attendees at Inside ETFs and the blockchain conference raised concerns that cryptocurrencies are on a path to replace gold as a safe haven investment  I ve mentioned multiple times before that I do not see this to be the case for a number of reasons  Unlike bitcoin  gold has thousands of years  worth of history to justify its role as a currency and store of value  Central banks own gold  as do institutional and retail investors  It s widely used not just as money but also as jewelry and in dentistry and electronics  The metal  in fact  can be found in the very computer hardware used to mine bitcoin 
Now  in a new report  the World Gold Council  WGC  takes the position that  while cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are attractive  they simply don t and can t usurp gold s place in investors  portfolios 
What s more   there isn t any quantifiable evidence that gold holdings are directly suffering from competition from cryptocurrencies   the WGC writes 
Need proof  According to the group  bitcoin currently trades around  2 billion a day on average  That s less than 1 percent of the  250 billion in gold bullion that s traded every day  Remember  gold is one of the most liquid currencies in the world  with a highly developed and accepted market structure 
There are several other important differences between the two asset classes  and I highly recommend you read the full report  You can do so by 
Investors Pile into Gold Backed ETFs Ahead of Potential Jump in Inflation
Coming back full circle to ETFs  Bloomberg reported last week that holdings in gold bullion backed funds rose to their highest level since 2013 on a weaker U S  dollar  rising geopolitical risk and growing expectations that inflation could finally heat up in 2018 
Holdings climbed to 2 250 metric tons earlier last week  the highest amount since May 2013  when gold prices were still in the  1 400 to  1 500 an ounce range 
The U S  dollar has plunged in value for the past several weeks  dipping more than 1 percent last Wednesday alone the biggest one day pullback in 10 months following Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s comment at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  that a weaker buck  is good for us as it s related to trade and opportunities   The greenback similarly tanked back in April 2017 when President Donald Trump said the dollar is  getting too strong   Soon after  it fell below its 200 day moving average 
Last Thursday  however  Trump walked back Mnuchin s  and his own  comment   that the dollar  is going to get stronger and stronger  and ultimately I want to see a strong dollar  
In any case  this has all been constructive for the price of gold  which  now sees hitting  1 500 an ounce this year  If you remember   1 500 was approximately my estimate after analyzing gold s performance in the months following the December rate hikes in 2015 and 2016 
According to Thomson Reuters  the price appreciation could be driven by  concerns that the United States may pull out of NAFTA  
Doing so  of course  would be highly inflationary and inflation  as I point out in last week s episode of Frank Talk Live  has historically been a tailwind for gold  The tax overhaul is already helping to boost wages at Walmart  NYSE WMT   Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and elsewhere  and the U S  recently slapped fresh tariffs on imported washing machines and solar cells  In response  South Korea opened two cases against the U S  at the World Trade Organization  WTO  
And let s not discount geopolitical noise  Last week  the  Doomsday Clock  was moved 30 seconds closer to midnight and now stands only two minutes away  That s the closest to midnight the symbolic barometer has come since 1953  when both the U S  and Russia first began testing thermonuclear weapons among the most disruptive advancements of the past 100 years

94687,316202,SBUX,Weighing The Week Ahead  The Return Of Volatility ,opinion,"The economic calendar is light  That leaves plenty of time for the pontificating punditry to opine on a possible turning point in markets  bubbles and overheating  the Fed  geopolitical risks  and continuing Washington turmoil  Many will be asking 
What does the increased volatility mean for financial markets 
Last Week Recap
In the  two weeks ago  I asked whether we might be at an inflection point for stocks and the economy  A month ago  I asked whether we should be   My annual  explained my reasons to be cautiously bullish  These are all quite relevant to the current markets  If you missed the original posts  please take a few minutes to catch up 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  I especially like the  updates and commentary  You can see many important features in a single look  She notes the new records along with other indicators  The entire post is well worth reading for the collection of charts and analytical observations 

The decline for the week also reflected a larger trading range and included intra day moves that exceeded those of recent months  Volatility has returned 
A key question is how long the current decline might last  and how large it could be  As a starting point  this history of drawdowns over the last ten years is quite helpful 

Drawdowns of 5 10  are completely routine  often occurring several times a year  The last two years have been quite unusual 
Personal Note
Our weekend away was enjoyable and successful  While Mrs  OldProf and I did not win the event  our team came in second in a strong field  Thanks to our well wishers 
And a special thanks to Focus Economics for including us in the list of   There is a wide variety of great sources  including some that you probably have not seen 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic news remains very positive  despite the reaction of the markets this week  New Deal Democrat s  should satisfy even the nerdiest observer  I read it every week  Here is his conclusion 

The near term forecast remains extremely positive  The downturn in stocks took them back to where they were 3 weeks ago  and so is not a major concern  The nowcast also remains positive 

The Good
Construction spending was up 0 7  beating expectations of 0 3  
Earnings news remains positive  As usual there have been some blowups in big names and conflicting reaction to comments in conference calls  These draw the attention in financial media  Halfway through this season  the data paint a brighter picture  John Butters    reports that both earnings and sales are beating expectations more often than the five year average  The size of the beats is not as great as the average   takes this an important step further  describing the impact on expected earnings  now 18  for 2018 
ISM manufacturing had a slight decline from December s high  but beat expectations with a reading of 59 1    


Personal income growth increased from 0 3  to 0 4   beating some estimates 
Ford truck sales were  monster  according to   This is a good proxy for small business and construction activity  they argue 

Consumer confidence moved even higher  from 123 1 to 125 4      of 95 7 declined slightly from December s 95 9  but beat expectations 

Factory orders were up 1 7  beating expectations of 1 3  
Employment news was positive 
ADP reported private employment net gains of 234K  much higher than the expected 190K 
Initial jobless claims declined to 230K  a bit better than expectations of 238K 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by a net of 200K jobs  beating expectations of 180K 
Private payroll gains were up 196K  also beating expectations  consistent with ADP 
Unemployment remained at 4 1   but the number of long term unemployed  over 27 weeks  declined from 22 9  to 21 5  
Hourly earnings were up 0 3   in line with consensus  and December s reading was revised from 0 3 to 0 4   The year over year increase is 2 9  
But  Hours worked declined from 34 5 to 34 3  missing expectations  Many translate this into an adjustment to job gains  There was also a 24K downward revision in payroll jobs from the prior two months   excellent monthly employment analysis takes a comprehensive  close look at the data  It is unusual to find a first rate economist who also writes well and knows how to present data effectively  Bob s conclusion was that the story is not quite as good as it appears on the surface  He notes the decline in the rate of growth in net job gains  His analysis is not alarmist because it is placed in the context of his overall business cycle updates 
The Wall Street Journal always has an  on the employment numbers  Here are two of my favorites  each illustrating a key point in the report 








The Bad
Productivity declined 0 1  in Q417  from a gain of 2 7  in Q3  This contributed to a unit labor cost increase of 2 0   Q Q 

DC shenanigans threaten  The posturing is difficult to read as various deadlines impend  I usually expect 11th hour compromises after all sides have demonstrated their commitment  Their backers expect this  It seems like there is more  digging in  than usual 
GDP increased only 2 6  in Q4  This story is a week old  but worth mentioning   notes the result and looks deeper into the data 
Excessive exuberance among the might in Davos  Fortune s excellent  analyzes the sources of excitement  Others wondered whether this was a contrary signal 
The Ugly
This week there is a choice  A Cleveland man    could not get an ambulance since he was over a city boundary  This is simple  factual  and possibly illustrative of intergovernmental problems and issues in the health care system 
The second choice is both more speculative and more significant 
 at a story about bumbling Russian spies  including a famous   The spies were focused on the U S  financial infrastructure 
Possible change in nuclear policy  The most recent  encourages smaller weapons and permits their use even in situations where there has not been a nuclear attack  The stated purpose is deterrence of non nuclear threats  including cyber attacks  This is an important story which we should all follow 
The Doomsday Clock now shows only   This is in no way related to the items cited above  This is tied  with H bomb development in 1953  for the shortest time in history 
As is usually the case with  ugly  news  there is no good way for investors to hedge 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
We have a light economic calendar  The ISM Services report is a good coincident read on the economy  and perhaps some leading qualities on employment  The JOLTs report is helpful for the study of labor market structure and the economic cycle but is rarely used or reported accurately 
In the wake of last week s FOMC meeting  the quiet period has ended and FedSpeak resumes  The most important news will once again be corporate earnings reports  especially discussions of outlook 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
The light economic calendar is insignificant compared to the market reaction and the continuing focus on Washington  In normal times  corporate earnings would take center stage  Instead  the increase in stock  and bond  volatility will have everyone asking 
What does the spike in volatility mean for financial markets 
As usual  here is a typical range of opinion  from bearish to bullish 
The crash is starting   read anything from the usual suspects 
The major correction is upon us   read those who have been forecasting a correction almost weekly for five years   See the solid  witty and entertaining commentary from   
The much needed and healthy selling is upon us   A solid viewpoint  well stated by   
Higher wage gains will move the Fed to raise rates four times instead of three     but please also see my description of   
Caution is indicated     
700 points is a small move in percentage terms   Trivial so far  said one respected observer 
Economic fundamentals and earnings remain strong 
As usual  I ll suggest my own interpretations in today s Final Thought

Insight for Investors
Investors should have a long term horizon  They can often exploit trading volatility  I remind investors of this each week  but now is the time to pay attention 
Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be the advice from Harry Markowitz  the Nobel Prize winning father of modern portfolio theory is 100  invested     Why  He is bullish for the long run  but not the very long run  He has much less diversification than usual  because he expects rebuilding in the hurricane aftermath  Check out the whole story  but if you look for lumber  wallboard  glass  bulldozing  mining  and elevators  you can guess his top mega stock picks 

Markowitz may have the same information as everybody else  but he sees things differently  Even as news articles forecast that the stock market was getting too high and had to have a correction  Markowitz didn t see it as out of line with the economy at all  especially when combined with the benefits of tax cuts and corporations repatriating money they d kept overseas 


 I m just looking at the statistics of the stock market they are not looking one step beyond how the economy is doing or what the economy is likely to do  The economy is likely to rebuild Puerto Rico  We suddenly have a big influx of capital and an incentive to spend it  and we have an increase in supply and an increase in demand  But we are going to have economic activity at least until Puerto Rico is rebuilt  at which time I might be dead  

This is a great lesson on adapting your portfolio to the most important current themes

94689,316204,SBUX,Worried About Inflation  Gold Might Be The Solution,opinion,"In its outlook for 2018  Thomson Reuters GFMS analysts see gold prices rising to  1 500 an ounce sometime this year on inflation fears  This would put gold at a level unseen since April 2013

The Trump administration has already imposed tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber  and more recently it set steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels all of which is inflationary  The same thing goes for the recently passed tax overhaul  which has prompted some companies such as Walmart  NYSE WMT  and Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  to raise their minimum wage 
But if the administration were to withdraw the U S  from NAFTA  as President Donald Trump has hinted at numerous times  prices on consumer goods and services could become destabilized and begin to surge 
In anticipation of this  investors might want to consider adding to their gold exposure  which has a history of performing well in times of rising inflation 
Gold Has Helped Preserve and Grow Capital in Times of Rising Inflation
The chart below  courtesy of the World Gold Council  WGC   shows that annual gold returns were around 15 percent on average in years when inflation was 3 percent or higher year over year  between 1970 and 2017  In real  or inflation adjusted  terms  returns were closer to 8 percent  This is still higher  though  than average returns in years when inflation was lower 

According to the WGC   gold returns have outpaced the U S  consumer price index  CPI  over the long run  due to its many sources of demand  Gold has not just preserved capital  it has helped it grow  
Having a 5 to 10 percent weighting in gold and gold stocks  then  could help investors minimize their losses in other asset classes 
Dollar Weakness Also Driving Gold Prices
Tariffs and higher wages aren t the only Fear Trade factors moving gold prices right now  A weaker U S  dollar  relative to other global currencies  deserves a lot of the credit as well 
For the past several weeks  the greenback has plunged in value  dipping more than 1 percent last Wednesday alone its biggest one day pullback in 10 months  This came following Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s comment at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  that a weaker dollar  is good for us as it s related to trade and opportunities   The greenback similarly tanked back in April 2017 when President Trump said the dollar is  getting too strong   Soon after  it fell below its 200 day moving average 

Last Thursday  however  Trump walked back Mnuchin s  and his own  comment  telling CNBC that the dollar  is going to get stronger and stronger  and ultimately I want to see a strong dollar  
In any case  the year long decline has been a short term tailwind for gold  which is priced in U S  dollars and  therefore  becomes less expensive for foreign buyers when it sinks  We believe the greenback peaked last January and that we could see further depreciation 
How to Play the Rally
One of the best ways to gain exposure to the gold space  we believe  is with the   NYSE GOAU   The fund provides access to companies engaged in the production of precious metals not only through active means mining  for instance but passive means as well  That includes gold and precious metal royalty companies  which provide upfront cash to producers to develop a project  In return  they receive royalties or rights to a  stream   an agreed upon amount of gold  silver or other precious metal at a lower than market price 
We believe this is a superior business model  which is why 30 percent of GOAU is weighted in gold royalty names  These companies have exposure to precious metals but have managed to  Because they re not directly responsible for building and maintaining mines and other costly infrastructure  huge operating expenses can be avoided  They also hold highly diversified portfolios of mines and other assets  which helps mitigate concentration risk in the event that one of the properties stops producing  As a result  royalty companies have enjoyed a much lower breakeven cost than traditional miners 
Compared to many other companies in the mining space  royalty companies have tended to be better allocators of capital  taking on very little debt and deploying cash reserves only at the most opportune times

94690,316205,SBUX,Whenever Rates Rise  These 2 ETFs Profit Handsomely,opinion,"I believe rates will rise this year  If rates rise  these ETFs will profit 
The market can be flat or plunge and these ETFs don t care  They have virtually no correlation to gyrations of the US stock market 
In fact  during this recent interesting and volatile period  each has gone up a bit  not down 
I believe this rise is just the beginning 
There are many investment choices in the marketplace that have nothing to do with the companies traded there  Some of these have a zero or negative correlation with the stock market  which in times of severe volatility and turmoil makes them worth considering solely for that reason  However  when they also offer a profit if something that is far more certain than the short term direction of the markets is their  bread and butter  they are truly worth our attention 
No one knows what the market is going to do tomorrow  or next week  or next month  If you ask me that question  I will answer as J P  Morgan did a century ago   It will fluctuate   We have seen ample evidence of that of late 
However  I have identified a few ETFs that have nothing to do with the market s direction  I have kept my finger near the button for over a year now  waiting until I believed the time was right to pounce 
I think it s time  I have been researching companies and funds that fit the big themes I expect over the next few months  regardless of what the equities markets do  and these fit perfectly 
Everyone has an opinion of what the stock markets are most likely to do in the coming months  But expert opinions and a dollar still won t buy you a cup of coffee at Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   I am instead seeking investments that do not depend upon a rising market    or anyone s opinion    right now 
What I know as fact  not opinion  is that the USA is quickly reaching what economists consider full employment  Full employment means wage increases as companies scramble to attract talent  Wage increases mean inflation  and inflation means the Fed will continue its aggressive net selling of bonds and will raise rates  When they do  bond yields will rise and the bonds themselves will decline   By the way  I use the term  net selling  for a reason   the Fed doesn t have to actually sell bonds from its portfolio  it can simply let each tranche mature and then not replace it with normal rollover buying  The  net  effect is the same  
That s why I am buying two inverse ETFs on US Treasury bonds  These are not like the potentially dangerous inverse equity funds  which reward you if stocks decline but punish you if stocks soar  These ETFs move slowly  but I believe their rise will be slow  steady and certain  The ProShares Short 20  Year Treasury  NYSE TBF  and ProShares UltraShort 20  Year Treasury  NYSE TBT   a 2x leveraged short  are two that I believe are destined to do well 
TBF s approach and portfolio are the pinnacle of simplicity  Instead of holding long dated US Treasury bonds  this ETF has entered into Treasury Index Swaps with investment banks like Societe General  Citibank  Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs  These swaps give them the opportunity to sell back positions to these investment banks at a profit if the bonds fall 
What is in it for the investment banks engaging in the swap  They receive all the interest on the bonds and  effectively  a fee from the counter party to the swap  Their bet is that rates will not rise too far or too fast   This is actually more complicated than a simple  fee  arrangement  One party wants to  in effect  buy the difference between a fixed rate and the rate it changes to over time and the other party wants the certainty of a fixed return  Think of it as a fee or Google  swaps  or  interest rate swaps  and you ll see enough verbiage and graphics to make your head swim  
This allows ProShares  the issuer of this ETF  to benefit if rates rise  or suffer if rates fall    As new debt is created at higher rates  these older Treasury bonds  to remain relevant  must pay the same effective yield  If they can t  and they can t  change the terms of the existing bonds   the price of these older bonds in the portfolio will fall to equal yield available on the newer debt 
I think those who believe rates will rise only slowly are overlooking the massive amount of Treasury and agency bonds that are being disgorged as the US Fed reduces its holdings of older bonds  Even without considering an actual rate increase  this supply is already weighing heavily upon the demand for secure income 
That s why I like choice  2  ProShares UltraShort 20  Year Treasury  TBT   even better  It is riskier  of course  If I am wrong and rates go down  this ETF should decline at twice the rate of its sister fund  If I am correct  of course  it should rise at roughly twice the same rate  The portfolio is also simplicity itself  The fund has simply taken a double helping of Treasury bonds and  in this case  added Bank of America to its list of corresponding friendly bankers 
The investing theme here is the very model of simplicity  If US interest rates decline  these funds will lose value  If US interest rates rise  these ETFs will rise as well 
One other thing  There is always  erosion  to consider when buying inverse ETFs or open or closed end mutual funds  As a result of daily marking to market and the small fees involved when entering a swap  such funds will decline minutely more than they will increase with a corresponding change in bond yields  That is why I have had my finger near the button to buy these for nearly a year now but have not pushed the button until now  I think the erosion factor amounts to decimal dust compared the potential return 
Just what might that return be  I am indebted to my colleague of many years  Gray Emerson Cardiff  the estimable editor of  one of the best performing  and best written  financial newsletters in the business  for having prepared the following analysis  He has recommended these two as well as one other for his subscribers 
Assuming no rapid increase from what the Fed has already indicated  Mr  Cardiff has projected that long term Treasury bonds might reasonably yield 3 96  by the end of 2018 and 4 52  by the end of 2019 
Under this conservative scenario  TBF  the unleveraged inverse fund  would climb from its current  23 43 to  26 86 by December and to  29 28 by December 2019  A 14 6  return over the next 11 months may not sound very impressive to investors spoiled by the returns of the past couple years  However  I don t suggest this investment as a replacement for riskier investing but rather as an adjunct to your portfolio via an ETF I see as a more dependable choice for gains 
As for the 2x leveraged TBT  the numbers look even better  Using the same scenario for interest rates  at the end of 2018 the fund  currently at  38 73  would rise to  50 75 by the end of 2018 and to  60 31 by the end of 2019  For me personally  I believe the extra risk that the leverage entails is well worth the opportunity to make 31  on an investment that does not depend on the stock market advancing  but only upon the likelihood of rates rising 
As always  do your due diligence  And if you have other alternatives with a no or low Beta to US stock markets  please share your thoughts  I am always ready to discuss new ideas 
Disclaimer  Do your due diligence  What s right for me may not be right for you  what s right for you may not be right for me  Past performance is no guarantee of future results  Rather an obvious statement  but too many people look only at past performance instead of seeking the alpha that comes from solid research and due diligence ",2018-02-12,Joseph L.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is SBUX due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts First Quarter Fiscal 2018 ResultsStarbucks reported better than expected earnings but failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in first quarter fiscal 2018 results  The company also lifted its full year profit outlook considering the new U S  corporate tax cut Earnings  Sales   Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share  EPS  of 65 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents by 14  and grew 25  year over year Total sales of  6 07 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 14 billion by a small percentage but increased 6  from the year ago level  Notably  Q1 revenues mark Starbucks  first ever  6 billion quarterly revenues  The year over year performance was driven by higher revenues from the opening of 2 305 net new stores over the past 12 months and higher comps growth Global same store sales increased 2   same as the preceding quarter  Global traffic increased 2  in the quarter  same as the previous quarter  Transactions remain flat during the quarter against 1  growth in the preceding quarter  The company opened 700 net new stores globally  bringing the total store count to 28 039 across 76 markets Margins DownOperating margin decreased 140 basis points  bps  year over year to 18 4  in the quarter due to product mix shift  largely toward food and restructuring cost associated with the company s ongoing efforts of streamlining business operations On a non GAAP basis  operating margin declined 80 bps to 19 2  Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas  Net revenues in this flagship segment were up 7  year over year to  4 3 billion  Comps rise of 2  in the quarter was softer compared with an increase of 3  in the last quarter

Mobile payments represented 31  of U S  transactions  reflecting an increase from 27  a year ago Operating margin in the segment  however  contracted 100 bps to 23  as strong sales leverage was more than offset by the impact of food related mix shift China Asia Pacific  CAP   Net revenues increased 9  to  843 7 million on the back of higher revenues from new store opening and comp store sales growth Comps grew 1   softer than 2  in the previous quarter  China continued to post stellar comps growth  delivering 6  in the quarter  softer than 8  in the preceding quarter   Japan s comp growth continues to be negatively impacted by softness in limited time offerings and Frappuccino limited time offerings  in particular Operating margin at the CAP segment expanded 210 bps year over year to 23 3  in the quarter  buoyed by strong sales leverage and positive currency effect Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA   Net revenues were up 8  year over year at  283 9 million in the segment  as higher revenues from addition of new stores and positive currency effect That said  comps declined 2   against 1  growth in the preceding quarter  Operating margin declined 300 bps to 13 8  due to softer performance in its company owned stores Channel Development  Channel Development s net revenues improved 1  to  560 3 million  The growth was driven by its foodservice  international and packaged coffee channels Operating margin contracted 50 bps to 43 4  All Other  The segment comprises Seattle s Best Coffee  Starbucks Reserve and Roastery businesses  Revenues at the segment decreased 22  to  120 million Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks now expects global comp growth at the lower end of its earlier projected guidance at 3 5   The company still expects to add approximately 2 300 net new stores globally  Consolidated revenue growth is expected in the high single digits  The company expects revenue growth of approximately 9 11  after including approximately 4 points of favorable impact from the East China acquisition and approximately 2 points of unfavorable impact from other streamlining activities Consolidated operating margin is expected to decrease slightly  before additional partner and digital investments related to changes in U S  tax law   Including these investments  operating margin is anticipated to decline moderately from the fiscal 2017 level of 19 7  The company expects its GAAP EPS to be in the range of  3 32  3 36  Starbucks now expects non GAAP EPS in the range of  2 48  2 53 compared with  2 30  2 33 expected earlier with growth in the second half to be a shade higher than the first half  Although the guidance is consistent with the company s earlier projection  the raised view reflects net impact of the new U S  tax law s federal statutory tax rate and related reinvestments 
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
It turns out  fresh estimates flatlined during the past month  There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower Starbucks Corporation Price and Consensus

Baozun   NASDAQ BZUN    a smaller firm that helps Western brands like Nike   NYSE NKE   and Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   adapt their e commerce strategies for China  posted its latest quarterly financial results on Tuesday morning  Total revenues reached  241 million  up about 23  from the year ago period  Non GAAP net income skyrocketed 128  to  24 7 million 
The digital solutions company also noted that services revenues climbed 56  on a year over year basis  Baozun shares surged 20  to touch an all time intraday high of  43 94 in early trading Tuesday 
BZUN helped lift other Chinese internet stocks because of its tight knit relationships with the industry s major players  Alibaba is the company s biggest investor  while JD com is considered a close business partner 
Baozun s health also proves the strength of China s internet marketplace  If its clients including Nike  Starbucks  Coach   AX COH    and Fiat Chrysler   NYSE FCAU   are finding value in developing online sales strategies specifically for the country  it probably spells good news for other businesses in the space 
Chinese internet stocks are also rising on the back of reports that the nation s regulators are working on a plan to allow foreign listed tech giants to trade on domestic exchanges  Companies like Alibaba  Tencent  and Baidu originally listed on foreign exchanges in an attempt to gain international recognition back when Beijing heavily regulated outsiders  exposure to Chinese A shares

94703,316218,SBUX,U S  private payrolls rise strongly  wage growth picking up,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  private sector payrolls rose at a brisk pace in January as hiring increased across the board despite unseasonably cold weather  pointing to sustained labor market strength at the start of the year   The robust jobs market is gradually putting upward pressure on compensation  with other data on Wednesday showing a solid increase in labor costs in the fourth quarter  Tightening labor market conditions and signs of a pickup in wage growth are likely to be welcomed by Federal Reserve officials who have long expressed concern about benign inflation  In a statement at the end of a two day policy meeting on Wednesday  Fed officials said they expected annual inflation to  move up this year and to stabilize  around the U S  central bank s 2 percent target   The Fed left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged  U S  financial markets expect a rate hike in March  The U S  central bank has forecast three rate increases this year after lifting borrowing costs three times in 2017   It s a myth that wages are not going up so the Fed doves can stop thinking there is slack in the labor market   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York   We now expect the Fed can lift rates four times this year and not the three rate hikes they penciled in in December    The ADP national employment report showed private sector employment rose by 234 000 jobs in January  beating economists  expectations for an increase of only 185 000  December s payrolls count was revised down to 242 000 from 250 000   Manufacturing added 12 000 jobs last month and construction payrolls increased 9 000 despite bitterly cold temperatures in many parts of the country  There were also widespread job gains in the private services sector  The ADP report is jointly produced with Moody s Analytics  It  however  has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government  more comprehensive employment report  The Department of Labor will publish January s employment report on Friday  According to a Reuters survey of economists  nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 180 000 jobs in January after increasing 148 000 in December  The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at a 17 year low of 4 1 percent  STRONG START  While we do not take the ADP employment report into our forecasting methodology for payrolls  the report nonetheless suggests job creation got off to a strong start in 2018   said John Ryding  chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York  The dollar rose against a basket of currencies following the Fed s policy statement  while prices for U S  Treasuries pared losses  Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after two days of steep losses  In a separate report the Labor Department said the Employment Cost Index  ECI   the broadest measure of labor costs  increased 0 6 percent in the fourth quarter after an unrevised 0 7 percent rise in the third quarter   That lifted the year on year rate of increase to 2 6 percent  the largest gain since the first quarter of 2015  from 2 5 percent in

2015  and followed a 2 6 percent gain in the third quarter  Wage growth is expected to get a boost from the strong labor market  which is forecast to hit full employment this year  Economists expect the jobless rate to hit 3 5 percent by the end of 2018   A  1 5 trillion tax cut package pushed through by the Trump administration and the Republican controlled U S  Congress in December is also expected to bolster compensation growth  The tax cut has resulted in some companies either paying out one time bonuses or raising wages for employees   Companies like  Starbucks Corp   O SBUX  and FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX  have announced they will use some of the savings from the tax cut to boost wages for workers    Today s report is quite consistent with our view of gradually firming wage growth  which we expect to reach a sustainable pace around 2 5 3 0 percent in 2018   said Gregory Daco  chief U S  economist at Oxford Economics in New York   We expect one time bonuses and minimum wage increases to provide a tailwind to the ECI to start the year   The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack  It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation  Economists say labor costs need to rise by at least 3 percent to push inflation closer to the Fed s 2 percent inflation target   Benefits for all workers increased

94710,316225,SBUX,U S  hiring accelerates  annual wage growth strongest since 2009,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth surged in January and wages increased further  recording their largest annual gain in more than 8 1 2 years  bolstering expectations that inflation will push higher this year as the labor market hits full employment  Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 200 000 jobs last month after rising 160 000 in December  the Labor Department said on Friday  The unemployment rate was unchanged at a 17 year low of 4 1 percent  Average hourly earnings rose 0 3 percent in January to  26 74  building on December s solid 0 4 percent gain  That boosted the year on year increase in average hourly earnings to 2 9 percent  the largest rise since June 2009  from 2 7 percent in December  Workers  however  put in fewer hours last month likely because of bitterly cold weather   The average workweek fell to 34 3 hours  the shortest in four months  from 34 5 hours in December  The robust employment report underscored the strong momentum in the economy  raising the possibility that the Federal Reserve could be a bit more aggressive in raising interest rates this year  The U S  central bank has forecast three rate increases this year after raising borrowing costs three times in 2017   The acceleration in average hourly earnings growth punches a hole in the narrative that wage growth remains lackluster   said Scott Anderson  chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco   The Goldilocks view of inflation is being sorely challenged right now   Fed officials on Wednesday expressed optimism that inflation will rise toward the central bank s target this year  Policymakers  who voted to keep interest rates unchanged  described the labor market as having  continued to strengthen   and economic activity as  rising at a solid rate    U S  financial markets have priced in a rate hike in March  Prices for U S  Treasuries fell  with the yield on the benchmark 10 year note hitting a four year high as investors worried about high inflation  The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on the data while U S  stocks were trading lower  The unemployment rate dropped seven tenths of a percentage point in 2017 and economists expect it to hit 3 5 percent by the end of the year  Economists say job gains are being driven by buoyant domestic and global demand   Some worry that the Trump administration s  1 5 billion tax cut package passed by the Republican controlled U S  Congress in December  in the biggest overhaul of the tax code in 30 years  could cause the economy  already operating near full capacity  to overheat   President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have cast the fiscal stimulus  which includes a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent  as creating jobs and boosting economic growth   If the labor market is this strong and the tax cuts have yet to kick in  what will it look like when households and businesses actually start spending the money   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland Pennsylvania   No good economy goes unpunished and the punishment may already be starting to be meted out    Graphic  Wage growth in the U S  accelerates      JOB GROWTH SEEN SLOWING Economists polled by Reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls rising by 180 000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4 1 percent  January s jobs gains were above the monthly average of 192 000 over the past three months   The economy needs to create 75 000 to 100 000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working age population   January marked the first full year of employment data under the Trump administration  Job growth averaged 176 000 per month under the current government  compared to 208 300 during last year of the Obama administration   Job growth is expected to slow this year as the labor market hits full employment  Companies are already reporting difficulties finding qualified workers  which economists say will force some to significantly raise wages as they compete for scarce labor  Wage growth last month came as increases in the minimum wage came into effect in 18 states in January  Wages probably also got a lift from the tax cut  Companies like  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX  and FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX  have said they will use some of the savings from lower taxes to boost wages for workers   Further gains are expected in February when Walmart  NYSE WMT  raises entry level wages for hourly employees at its U S  stores  Annual wage growth is now close to the 3 percent that economists say is needed to push inflation towards the Fed s 2 percent target   But the road to faster wage growth remains long  The year on year rise in average hourly earnings for production and non supervisory workers was stuck at 2 4 percent in January   A broader measure of unemployment  which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment  rose one tenth of a percentage point to 8 2 percent in January  The unemployment rate for African Americans shot up to 7 7 percent from 6 8 percent and is more than double that of whites   Manufacturing payrolls increased by 15 000 last month after rising 21 000 in December  The sector is being supported by strong domestic and international demand  A weak dollar is also providing a boost to manufacturing by making U S  made goods more competitive on the international market  Hiring at construction sites picked up last month despite unseasonably cold weather  Construction payrolls increased by 36 000 jobs  adding to December s 33 000 gain   Retail employment rebounded and the government added jobs following two straight months of declines   
There were also increases in payrolls for professional and business services  leisure and hospitality as well as healthcare and social assistance ",2018-02-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-employers-likely-boosted-hiring-in-january-1186051,1186051

spa  retail offerings  and food and beverage outlets  Wynn Boston Harbor is expected to open in mid 2019 Coming off a hot 2017 and strong growth in the Macau gaming market  this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock s run might not yet be over What s Going on in Macau In 2017  Macau s overall gaming revenue jumped 19 1  to  33 billion  and has helped lift casino stocks like Wynn In particular  the company was significantly helped from the growth seen in Macau s VIP gaming market  According to the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau  VIP play was up 26 7   while mass market play was only up 9 6  Wynn  of course  is known for catering to high end gamblers when the VIP market took a hit a few years  the company severely felt the impact and this boost is nothing but a good thing for its stock performance It s also important to note that Wynn has benefitted from Wynn Palace  located in the Cotai region of Macau  operating for a full year  Imax Corporationis an entertainment

which also beat our consensus estimate Global box office during the quarter was Imax s highest grossing Q3 ever  growing 17  to  219 million Additionally  its domestic box office increased 18  year over year compared to the overall industry box office decline of 14  Imax also installed 51 theaters  49 of which were for new locations and two were upgrades Bearish OutlookDespite this strong quarter  analysts have become very bearish on the company  and its earnings growth trajectory is on the erratic side For the current quarter  Zacks expects IMAX s earnings to grow about 63   but five analysts have cut their estimates in the last 30 days  The consensus has fallen four cents  from  0 40 to  0 36 per share Earnings are expected to fall nearly 14  for fiscal 2017  and five analysts have revised their estimates downward in the last 30 days as well Even though fiscal 2018 could be a turnaround moment for Imax  as the company is anticipating over 56  earnings growth  the current consensus has dipped from  1 07 to  0 98 in the last 30 days  Here again  five analysts have slashed their estimates during this time period Additional content Upcoming Consumer Earnings Reports to

94753,316268,SBUX,Starbucks wins dismissal in U S  of underfilled latte lawsuit,news,"By Jonathan Stempel  Reuters     Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX  has won the dismissal of a U S  lawsuit accusing the coffee chain of overcharging customers by underfilling lattes and mochas to reduce milk costs  U S  District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Friday found a lack of evidence that Starbucks cheats customers by making its cups too small  using  fill to  lines on baristas  pitchers that are too low  and instructing baristas to skimp on ingredients  such as by leaving a quarter inch of space atop drinks  The Oakland  California based judge also rejected a claim that milk foam added to lattes and mochas should not count toward advertised volumes  She said reasonable customers expect foam to take up some volume  and the plaintiffs conceded that foam is an essential ingredient in their drinks   Accordingly  plaintiffs fail to show that lattes contain less than the promised beverage volume represented on Starbucks  menu boards   Rogers wrote  Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Sunday to requests for comment  Starbucks did not immediately respond to similar requests  Lattes contain espresso  steamed milk and foam  Mochas are similar but also contain a chocolate sauce  Siera Strumlauf and Benjamin Robles  both of California  and Brittany Crittenden of New York had accused Starbucks in their proposed nationwide class action of fraud and false advertising by underfilling 12   16  and 20 ounce lattes by about 25 percent  causing unspecified damages  Starbucks countered that its cups hold more than the advertised number of ounces  and that the  fill to  lines provide guidance to baristas as to how much cold milk  which expands when steamed  to pour into pitchers  In 2016  two federal judges dismissed separate lawsuits accusing the Seattle based company of cheating customers who bought iced beverages  finding that reasonable customers would understand that ice counts toward their drinks  contents

94766,316281,SBUX,Bitcoin Crash  Plunges 45  In 5 Days  How Low Will It Go   ,opinion,"The Bitcoin Crash has finally taken place as the king of cryptocurrencies plunged a staggering 45  from its record high in just five days  On December 17th  Bitcoin reached a peak of  19 800 but fell to a low of 10 887 in early market trading today  However  the Bitcoin price has recovered from its lows and is now trading at  13 500 
So  the big question to all the Bitcoin investors and crypto traders    Will the market recover or will the crash continue  Well  if we go by charts that show assets moving up in a straight line  I believe we are going to see much lower prices  I don t know if it will take days  weeks or months  but lower it will go 
The warning signs that Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies were in a huge bubble were all over the place  I started to point this out in my November 1st article 
So  the big question on the minds of many investors is  which asset is more of a bubble  Bitcoin or Gold  If we use the cost of production as a guide  my answer is Bitcoin 

Currently  Bitcoin is fetching an estimated  4 700 profit per coin versus  136 for gold 
According to the research done by Marc Bevand  discussed in the article linked above   he calculated the cost to produce Bitcoin in August was approximately  1 500  I adjusted that cost up to  1 800 for the beginning of November  At the time  the price of Bitcoin was trading at  6 500  Thus  the profit per Bitcoin was  4 700  Now  compare that to cost to produce gold from the top two primary gold miners at  1 115  Thus  Barrick and Newmont primary gold miners were enjoying an 11  profit margin while the Bitcoin miners were enjoying a 72  profit 
And  that is when Bitcoin was trading less than half of what it is currently  Furthermore  I presented this chart on Bitcoin s cost of production 

Here we can see how the different estimated costs of Bitcoin production and the price movements  A few weeks back I emailed Marc Bevand and asked what he calculated as the new cost of Bitcoin production  He stated that it was between  3 000  4 000  I didn t make a new chart  but with the price of Bitcoin heading towards  20 000  the Bitcoin miners were making upwards of  16  17 000 a pop  No wonder the price of Bitcoin finally POPPED 
In my next article about the cryptos on Nov 21st  I stated the following 
There is a new trend by individuals in the alternative media community who are now selling out of precious metals and buying into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies  While this may seem like a good idea  especially when Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies reach new all time highs  it is likely a big mistake  Now  I am not saying that individuals shouldn t invest in cryptocurrencies  Rather  it s a lousy idea to sell all of one s precious metals holdings and put it all into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies 
Recently  Sean at SGTReport published a short video in which part of the headlined was titled as     In the video  Sean explains how past frequent guest and precious metal analyst  Andy Hoffman  has sold out of all his silver and is now only in Bitcoin and gold  Andy explains in his interview on Crush The Street that he sold all of his silver this summer as he really has no interest in it  He goes on to say   Because  in a digital age  I just don t believe people are going to store thousands of pounds of silver hoping that the gold silver ratio is going to come down  
I have to tell you  not only do I find this sort of thinking  utterly preposterous  I also find it quite troubling that analysts who have been promoting precious metals for the past decade are now implying that gold and silver are no longer high quality stores of value  I disagree entirely with this faulty and superficial analysis 
Unfortunately  those analysts that moved away precious metals and into Bitcoin and Cryptos fail to understand the DIRE ENERGY predicament we are facing  They believe we are heading into a BRAND NEW HIGH TECH world with lots of neat new gadgets and billions of Dollars in cryptocurrency profits to live life PHAT on the HOG 
Well  as my favorite expression goes  GOD HATH A SENSE OF HUMOR 
It doesn t take long for digital profits to turn into digital losses in the crypto markets  However  nothing goes down in a straight line  If we look at Bitcoin s huge spike up to  1 150 at the end of 2013  it took a while for it to fall 75  

As we can see in the chart  Bitcoin dropped from a high of  1 150 to  600 quite quickly  It then bounced back up to almost  1 000  before selling off even lower to  500  Although  this time around  Bitcoin s plunge below 75  can occur much quicker   even in days  But  I am not going to make that call  I stopped giving price targets for any asset classes years ago  It s a fool s game 
Regardless  if we assume the latest Bitcoin s mining cost is  3 000  4 000  then we still have a long way to go  Furthermore  here is a chart showing that   Thus  the higher Bitcoin goes in price  the more unusable it is for payment of goods and services  Who wants to buy a  5 cup of coffee at Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  with Bitcoin if it cost you  55 for the transaction 
Moreover  how valuable is a cryptocurrency when it falls 45  in five days  Again  Bitcoin reached a high of  19 880 on Dec 17th  and fell to a low of  10 887 today 

According to the current market price of Bitcoin  it is now trading down  7 000 or 35  lower from its high 

I have to tell you  that chart looks very UGLY  Right now a lot of new Bitcoin investors are wondering if they should hold on or to sell before it goes down any further  While some analysts have stated that Bitcoin will reach  50 000 and then  100 000  this sort of trading activity can drive a person crazy 
I don t know if Bitcoin will ever reach  100 000  but I wouldn t bet on it  Mike Maloney put out his new Hidden Secrets Of Money Ep 8  From Bitcoin To Hashgraph  The Crypto Revolution 

Mike explains in the video that HashGraph will make a lot of the cryptocurrencies obsolete  It takes a massive amount of energy just to do one Bitcoin transaction that it is not really useful as a currency or payment system  The Hashgraph technology does the same sort of thing as Bitcoin and the other cryptos  but it takes very little energy 
As I mentioned in my previous article  the skyrocketing Bitcoin price is what has SUCKED IN most of the demand  Only a small percentage of techie Geeks were interested in what Bitcoin had to offer  It wasn t until Bitcoin s price went into the stratosphere that investors starting buying like crazy  Now  we see Bitcoin mentioned on the major financial networks 
Again  nothing goes down in a straight line  I wouldn t be surprised to see Bitcoin rally here for a while  It could actually go back up significantly before selling off again  But  if Hashgraph can do with Bitcoin does at a fraction of the energy  then it is likely that Bitcoin will go down as the biggest Bubble in history ",2017-12-24,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoin-crash-plunges-45-in-5-days-how-low-will-it-go-200275547,200275547

94768,316283,SBUX,Will Strategic Efforts Fuel Consumer Staples Growth In 2018 ,opinion,"The Consumer Staples sector seems well placed for 2018 with rising consumer confidence  healthy consumer spending  increased business investments and an improved labor market helping stocks in this space  Stocks in the sector lagged the broader market last year  but the sector s stock market performance wasn t too bad   11 6  in 2017  roughly half of the  20 2  gain for the S P 500 index 
Companies in the Consumer Staples sector stand to benefit from the recent tax reforms  which should help these stocks  That said  many of these companies are multinational and earn substantial proportions of their revenues beyond the U S  shores  which means they already pay significantly lower taxes already related to previous statutory rates  Sectors that substantially operate domestically stand to benefit from the tax law changes 
Companies in this sector remain focused on undertaking efforts to resonate with consumers  changing demands in order to fuel growth 
So let s take a look at the strategies that position the consumer staples stocks for growth in 2018 as well 
Factors Ruling the Consumer Staples Space
Focus on Innovations
Innovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal and capture market share across all regions and categories  Thus  companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions  Notably  constant innovations supported by efficient marketing and commercialisation are likely to keep benefiting consumer staples companies 
Novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter   Gamble Co   PG  and Colgate Palmolive  CL  and cosmetic big wigs like Estee Lauder  EL   These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends  to tap demand and boost revenues  Also  major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup  CPB   and even alcohol stocks like Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  have been adding new products to gain competitive advantage and augment market share 
Transition to Health and Wellness Products
As consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples  companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry  Currently  consumer staples companies are shifting focus to natural and organic products  given rising demand for health and wellness offerings 
This is the case with almost all industries in the sector  In the food industry  consumers are opting for healthier and nutritious rather than packaged food products  in view of increasing health consciousness and rising obesity concerns  Thus  companies like Campbell Soup and United Natural Foods  UNFI   among others  have taken to rolling out healthy and fresh products to expand in the booming organic food space 
Moving to the beverages  healthy and energy boosting drinks are gaining prominence for a better lifestyle  Given the accelerated shift toward low  and no alcohol products  AB InBev  BUD  had struck a deal with Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   in 2016  to provide Teavana  a ready to drink tea  Dr Pepper Snapple s alliance with Bai Brands  low calorie  coffee fruit drinks maker  and Pepsico s buyout of KeVita Inc   producer of fermented probiotic and kombucha beverages  are other evidences of beverage players expanding into the fast growing healthy and wellness categories  Notably  AB InBev expects the low  and no alcohol beer category to account for about 20  of its global beer volumes by 2025 
Apart from this  tobacco companies like Altria Group  NYSE MO   MO  and Reynolds American  NYSE RAI  are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes  e cigarettes   To cater to changing consumer preference  Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS  a smokeless cigarette in November 2014  aiming to lead the tobacco industry s push into reduced risk products that may eventually replace traditional smokes  IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term 
Additionally  rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products  too  Consequently  players like Unilever  LON ULVR   UL  are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category  This is evident from its recently announced deal to buy Schmidt s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants  toothpaste and bar soaps  Clearly  these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies  top line in the future 
Adopting E Commerce
With technology having advanced by leaps and bounds  online shopping has become the order of the day  Thanks to various mobile apps and dot com business lines  shopping for anything is literally on consumers  finger tips  Consumers  rapid shift to e marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e commerce mantra  Companies like United Naturals  Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others  are striving to enhance e commerce space  through investments in technology and infrastructure 
Driven by these efforts  United Natural Foods  e commerce sales jumped more than 30  in the first quarter  with food service e commerce sales recording its highest quarter of year over year growth in a while  Also  Campbell s shift to advertising via mobile and digital devices highlights its focus on the development of digital and e commerce capacities  Estee Lauder  which witnessed online sales growth of 33  in the last reported quarter  expects the online channel to be a major growth engine for the upcoming few years 
Growth via Buyouts and Strategic Alliances
Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their existing customer base and product lines into new markets  Some of these are also forming partnerships  mostly with larger and better known companies  to strengthen their network  diversify portfolio  expand reach and enhance market position  Notably  leveraging each other s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M A activities 
Mergers of Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  with packaged meat producer  The Hillshire Brands  in August 2014   tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard  in June 2015   food giants   Kraft Foods Group  NASDAQ KHC   Inc  and H J  Heinz Company  in July 2015  and consumer goods companies Newell Brands and Jarden  in 2016  were the most talked about deals of the past  Belgium based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev s buyout of SABMiller  LON SAB  in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry  Apart from this  Molson Coors acquired SABMiller plc s 58  stake in MillerCoors  which made the former the third largest brewer in the world  after Anheuser Busch InBev and Heineken 
Other companies have also grown through acquisitions in the space  Treehouse Foods  acquisition of Private Brands business in February 2016 from ConAgra generated significant revenues for the company  Also  United Natural has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to grow its distribution network  customer base and boost long term growth  In 2016  United Natural acquired Gourmet Guru  August   Haddon House Food Products  May  and Nor Cal Produce  Inc   April  
Moreover  Smucker s agreement with Keurig Green Mountain  Inc  and Dunkin  Brands Group to manufacture and sell the K Cup category of products has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016  Cosmetics giant Estee Lauder has also made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio  The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced  during the first quarter fiscal 2017  have strengthened Estee Lauder s fastest growing prestige portfolio 
Divesting Underperforming Units to Improve Operations
Apart from growing their businesses through buyouts  companies are also focusing on improving their product portfolio through divestitures  Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas 
Evidently  as part of a strategic business review following its merger with Jarden  Newell Brands had revealed intentions to sell nearly 10  of its current portfolio  including a major chunk of its Tools segment  This highlights the company s focus on simplifying its operating structure  alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential  Also  Unilever recently announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR  in a bid to move ahead with its portfolio restructuring strategy for long term growth 
Iconix Brand Group is also focusing on managing its portfolio and spending resources on businesses that generate significant volume through both direct to retail relationships and global networks  In line with this view  the company sold the rights for the Sharper Image brand and related intellectual property assets to ThreeSixty Group in 2016  while it sold the rights for Badgley Mischka IP to Titan Industries 
More evidence in this regard is SUPERVALU Inc  s divestment of its Save A Lot business to Onex  The sale of the business segment will allow SUPERVALU to concentrate more on its core segments that are profitable  Likewise  Procter   Gamble had announced portfolio strengthening and simplification plans in August 2014 to streamline its business and focus more on Billion Dollar Brands like Tide  Pampers and Oral B

94795,316310,SBUX,Cyber Assets  Digital Currencies And Money ,opinion,"It does seem that we are in an era where language has been debased  Friends on Facebook  are not friends in the way the word traditionally meant  Grande at Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  Starbucks does not mean large any more  It is their second smallest serving 
In 2013 and 2014  the desire for an alternatives to fiat  central bank controlled currencies were called Alt Coins  Now  as interest has grown  they are often referred to as cryptocurrencies  However  crypto and currencies are names that do not have their traditional meaning  Crypto refers to secret allegiance to a political creed  This is an unnecessary obfuscation and gives an aura of a cult  Currencies refer to money  and yet rarely are the cryptocurrencies used to purchase goods or services or retire financial obligations 
Economists mean something specific about money  It is a means of exchange  It is a store of value  It is a unit of account  Cryptocurrencies do not provide any of these functions  This could  of course  change in the future  but there is a contradiction at the core  If cryptocurrencies are to be a preferred alternative to central bank money  then it makes sense that they are hoarded  However  the more they are hoarded  the less they are used as a means of exchange and do not reach that critical networking mass 
Some places do accept Bitcoin  the most popular and largest among the cryptocurrencies  But this seems to be more a novelty and marketing ploy  A company that accepts the cryptocurrencies faces exchange rate risk as it was just paid in a  foreign currency   This may seem acceptable provided the crypto currency is appreciating  but corporate treasury offices  for the most part  do not seek to be profit centers of the business 
Given what appears to be the historical link between money and taxes  we thought that a test for the viability of this cryptocurrencies is if a sovereign accepts them for payment  A small town in Switzerland  Chiasso   near the Italian border  says it will accept Bitcoin for taxes but caps it at CHF250  which also makes it a bit of a novelty  It also begs the question what will the town do with the Bitcoins  as there is not much that town can buy with them 
In the US  before the Federal Reserve  the banks in different states would issue bills that would trade at discounts in other locales  It was as if there were as many different monies as states  This seemed to be hinder interstate commerce and the development of a national economy 
Imagine that each state has its own currency  It would be terribly inefficient  This was the case in Europe before the advent of the euro  A shopkeeper now willing to accept cryptocurrencies for payment might need a huge price matrix as there are over 100 presently Given the high fixed costs and practical considerations  perhaps there is a tendency for a natural monopoly of currency issuers 
In the polemic zeal and in the face of surging prices  the inefficiencies and limits on the ability to scale have been brushed over  Consider  for example  that now there may be 300k Bitcoin transactions a day  VisaNet  just to pick one of the main credit card companies  can process 56k transactions messages a second  For the Bitcoin  do not need to simply double or triple is speed to compete with an alternative  Visa net can handle more than 150 mln transactions in a single day  and at a fraction of the cost 
The price to pay for a decentralized payment system is high  Consider that the mining  solving extremely difficult mathematical problems and the confirmation of each transaction requires a great deal of electricity  which is why the miners  who are also verification services  are increasingly located in areas that have cheap electricity  Estimates suggest that each Bitcoin transaction uses roughly the same amount of electricity as a US household may use in a week  The Bitcoin runs counter to conservation and concerns about the environment 
The cost of producing a Bitcoin is a function of the price of computing power needed for the mining and the validation process  More computing power is needed to solve the mathematical challenges and this  in turn  requires more electricity  One estimate suggests that the Bitcoin ecosystem was using around the same amount of electricity as 2 26 mln homes  Bitcoin currently accounts for around half of the daily turnover of cryptocurrencies 
Many argue that cryptocurrencies are anonymous  but this is not as true as it is supposed  Reports suggest that there are currently people in jail who used Bitcoins to procure contraband  The US tax authorities are also working with a company called Chainanalysis  which monitors the cryptocurrencies for high frequency and large trading  The state has at least two legitimate interests  Illegal activity  including money laundering and financing for terrorism and the avoidance of taxes  Despite the talk among many participants about how much money they have made  only 802 people reportedly paid taxes on their Bitcoin profits in 2015  according to press reports 
Some proponents assert that the cryptocurrencies are unseizable  immutable  inflation resistant  non correlated to other assets and are a store of value  Yet these claims have not been proven  They simply have not been around long enough to know if they are indeed immutable  inflation resistant and non correlated to other assets  The price of many cryptocurrencies appears too volatile to be a store of value yet  They are experiencing amazing price appreciation for sure  but that is not evidence of a store of value 
Are cryptocurrencies not correlated with other asset prices   The ample liquidity and the high levels of capital sitting on corporate balance sheets and intermediated by the financial system are driving all asset prices higher  All risk assets are having a banner year  like the corporate bonds  emerging markets  and high yield bonds  Consider that MSCI Frontier Markets  equities  Index is up more than a third this year and its Emerging Markets benchmark is up nearly 24   Isn t it possible that the cryptocurrencies are correlated to risk assets  and when the broad risk appetite changes and the lower quality assets are marked down  then the cryptocurrencies also will fall 
While cryptocurrencies may be disruptive  they have not negated the economic principle of trade offs  There is no free lunch  Building a functioning  trustworthy  decentralized payment system is extremely expensive  It leaves a large environmental footprint and has low transaction capacity  Do most transactions really need to bypass a central third party  like a bank or credit card company 
Owing to the anonymous and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies  it is difficult to speak to the market structure  However  two things appear likely  First  Bitcoin ownership appears highly concentrated  Also  many miners also have had to pool their computing power as the math problems become more difficult  Second  the value of the daily turnover appears to be around 5 10  of the market cap  outstanding dollar value of all Bitcoins   It seems that most Bitcoins are not traded or used as a means of exchange to buy goods or services 
Still  the stellar appreciation of many of the cryptocurrencies has fostered a sense of FOMO  fear of missing out   The CME is in the process of launching a futures contract on Bitcoins  which will be among the first ways one can short the Bitcoin in real time if one was so inclined  Others are looking for ways to participate  Some banks are looking at whether they can accept a client s cryptocurrencies like they would other assets  To be sure the ecosystem is still evolving  The underlying problems with them as a form of currency or a store of value  the non correlated characteristic claims  the environment footprint  and the difficulty in scaling is not addressed by the availability of futures contract  an ETF  or the like 
Stocks and bonds are assets  There are agreed upon models of valuation  There is an income stream or earnings stream associated with them  There is a debate in the literature whether currencies are an asset class  Central banks may issue their own digital currencies  These would likely be digital forms of their current currencies and not new instruments 
The future of cryptocurrencies may not lie as an alternative to fiat money issued by sovereigns  It may not be in crypto anything  It may be a new asset class  a cyber asset that enables decentralized applications  These applications are related to cyber assets as emails are related to the internet  It s still early days for the development of such assets  and just like when the internet was commercially launched  investors  as opposed to speculators  need to be careful of being sold vapor ware by well meaning zealots as well as some that may be less well meaning ",2017-11-23,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cyber-assets-digital-currencies-and-money-200267773,200267773

94819,316334,SBUX,Starbucks Inc Shares Buckle After Earnings Miss,opinion,"Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ  NASDAQ SBUX 

Starbucks  the ubiquitous coffee shop in many urban and suburban American cities  where customers can get anything from coffee to tea to snacks and protein lattes  reported their fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Thursday November 2  2017 after the market closed 
However  the company s share price did not act like it had an infusion of caffeine and rip higher  In fact  it did the opposite and dropped like a rock when the company announced poor earnings  poor guidance  and the sale of a division that they had hoped would bring in extra revenue from the tea section of their business 
The company announced it will be selling the tea division called Tazo  This is the area that focuses on tea and tea products  Starbucks bought it for about 8 million dollars back in 1999 
Earning Numbers
While Starbucks  numbers weren t horrendous  they didn t meet analyst expectations  Earnings came in at  0 54 a share but analysts had been expecting  0 55 on sales of 5 8 billion dollars  The current quarter only saw  5 7 billion dollars in sales  The company received approximately  384 million dollars for the sale of the Tazo Tea division 
Shares closed down in the regular training session only   0 26 however  they closed down an additional   2 72 after the market closed  Shares closed at  53 15 as of 8 p m  Eastern Daylight time which is down  3 13  
One attraction to the shares for longer term investors on Friday may be that the stock does have a dividend attached to ownership of it  The dividend is about 1 82  per year which is not bad given what you can currently with your cash sitting in the bank earnings interest 
Company Comments
Kevin Johnson  ceo and president  after the earnings were released 
 Today  Starbucks reported another quarter   and year   of strong performance  with each of our business segments around the world contributing to record results  Food  beverage and digital innovation are bringing customers into our stores at the same time as ongoing operational improvements are enabling us to drive increased throughput   particularly in our busiest stores at peak   and deliver a further elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers  
Scott Maw  CFO  
 Starbucks delivered solid top and bottom line growth   and our strongest quarterly traffic number in the U S  since mid 2016   despite a difficult operating environment in both the quarter and year  Continued strong growth and performance from CAP demonstrates that Starbucks now has two significant profit engines driving our global returns  our North America business and the broader CAP market

Last Week Recap
In the last edition of WTWA I mused on the confluence of records in the data and in stock market indexes  I suggested that some of the punditry would start worrying that things were  as good as it gets   This was a topic for some  including  with a qualified  no   but suggested the need to look beyond the mega cap stocks  Check out his reasoning and persuasive charts 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500  via Jill Mislinski  She notes the loss of 0 21  on the week  Once again  it was a week of very low volatility  the intra week range was only a touch more than 1   Historically 1  moves are commonplace   each day 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read the entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic news has been mostly positive  as summarized by New Deal Democrat s  of long  short  and coincident indicators  His conclusion is neutral on the long term and positive in shorter time frames 
The Good
Leading index for commercial real estate improves   that the Dodge Momentum Index rose 13 2  in October versus September  According to Dodge  this indicator leads non residential construction spending by one year 

Household stock ownership is at the lowest level in almost twenty years  Chris Ciovacco uses Gallup data to refute the notion of a current  euphoric bubble 


Job openings increased  and other good news from the JOLTS report  No one does a good job of analyzing this report  Many try to interpret it as a sign of employment growth  a purpose for which it was not designed  With fewer indicators to summarize this week  let me suggest the key things we should watch for Ratio of unemployed to job openings 


Beveridge curve   indicator of labor market structure 

Reason for job separations  layoffs or voluntary  Layoffs get a lot of news  A high quit rate shows confidence on the part of employees 

The Bad
Jobless claims were 239K  10K higher than last week  and worse than expectations 
Response to earnings was weak   that despite solid earnings  there is a divergence between the overall S P and the average member stock 

Michigan sentiment dipped to 97 8 from last month s 100 7 and expectations of 101

Hotel occupancy rate declined 0 9  last week  The rate remains ahead of the record setting pace of 2015    


The Ugly
Each week seems to bring another case of outlandish violence  While there are some common themes among the perpetrators  there is no consensus about solutions   or even whether to act  Opinions about the best policy reaction seem to depend more upon beliefs rather than facts  That is always a tough situation for public policy proposals 
Millennial Notes
My research always leads me to a few items that are interesting  but not necessarily relevant to the week ahead  One such item was a list of terms and expressions that Millennials would use  but older people would not  I had the inspiration to write a paragraph or two using these terms  in the  tradition  Mentioning this to Mrs  OldProf  she informed me that this was one of my dumber ideas  She was right  of course  A quick look at  showed that many terms from the first source are now  already   retired 
Millennials are far more likely to  

And this is despite their low ownership  only 4  have ever owned bitcoin 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
We have a normal calendar  The inflation data is edging up to a level where it will attract more interest  Retail sales is always an important report  as is industrial production 
That said  I see the Friday reports on housing as the most significant news  Building permits are an important leading indicator  That data series and new housing starts are volatile series  That makes them a challenge to interpret  but no less important 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
The calendar is a busy one  but not one to suggest important surprises  If inflation picks up  that will attract more analysis of the business cycle and the Fed  With several housing reports on tap  that may well be the focus of attention  So far  the recovery has been led by consumer spending  with little help from business investment or housing  If the rebound is to continue  more sources of growth are needed  The answer may come from the changing U S  demographics  leading people to ask 
Can Millennials provide the push for an extended housing rally 
Here are some perspectives  in my customary bearish to bullish range

The BLS  Most observers engage in plenty of discussion about the initial release of employment data  Why  It is an important topic  so people grab on anything  ignoring the problems in short term measurement  Each quarter the BLS releases a new installment of the   Because this uses state employment data  reviewed and aggregated for this purpose  it is much more accurate than the monthly estimates  In fact  it makes sense to review the various estimates using this result as the  right answer  
For Q1 2017 the net increase in private jobs was 654K  The sum of the initial monthly reports on employment Friday was 553K  The actual difference would have been a major source of debate if known at the time 
Also worth noting is the massive change   much more important than the net result  7 3 million jobs were created  And of course  6 7 million were lost  Opening establishments accounted for 1 3 million new jobs  something that the birth death adjustment truthers should study 
It also demonstrates that many more people are touched by unemployment than the official rate indicates  No wonder economic perceptions are often worse than the data seem to show

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be   part of his trading psychology series  While I most frequently cite Dr  Brett when we specifically deal with a trading theme  there is often an overlap with investor decision making  This is such a case  Investors with a sound overall approach can become frustrated at a stretch of losses or concern about reaching their goals 

 frustration is a great example of the principle that strengths  taken to an extreme  can become vulnerabilities  When we are achievement oriented and demanding of ourselves  having something get in our way breeds a natural frustration  That frustration  in turn  triggers a fight flight state and suddenly we are no longer nicely grounded in our brain s prefrontal cortex  Instead  we activate motor areas to cope with the situation and act in ways that we would never entertain if we were calm and focused at the start of the trading day 

This often describes the behavior of individual investors  especially those who constantly chase what worked last month or last year  Polling from  shows that many share this sentiment

This is a great example of Gil s series expanding horizons for many advisors 
Alan Steel    shares his customary wisdom with a discussion of current exaggerated pessimism  something that many seem to ignore  Here is his analysis 

Some folks are calling it a secular bull that is both old and decrepit  and busily sunning itself through its golden years from the light of a few big stocks as it has done since about March 2009 


Others consider the market crashes within that eight year  plus  period  like the 21 6  S P 500 drop from May to October 2011  and the recession level peak to trough numbers in the US  Japan  China  and emerging markets  amongst others  from mid 2015 to early 2016     put the age of this bull at somewhere around 4 5 years  or perhaps just a year and a half 


Then there are the gloomier folks who  despite the long term upward trend  positive corporate earnings  basement level inflation  low unemployment  respectable jobs growth  and historically low interest rates  habitually pick at the scabs of negative investor sentiment and draw dotted lines between now and the ghosts of recessions past 


These apostles of Joe Granville have helped position that latter category as the people s choice 


As such  independent investor sentiment levels about the stock market are about as euphoric right now as a stomach ulcer 

He goes on to cite the Gallup data I noted above  before concluding 

For me  I think the majority of investors are doing what they always do   waiting around for some kind of wonderfully perfect moment that will finally have built up enough financially fibrous scar tissue to replace the skin torn away by events like 2008 09  2000 02  and even  for the oldies  way back to 1987 and its less memorable ilk 


Unfortunately  market nirvana is almost always either a day away or the day we missed 


So  when it comes to investing  perfect is always the enemy of good

Strength in housing ripples through many other parts of the economy  including materials  employment  construction  and transportation      I have recommended home building stocks many times over the last year  and it has worked out well 
The  bubble  skeptics seem to reason that if sales or prices reach a former peak  that should be a warning  This simplistic approach would never recognize an overall positive trend in anything 
Here is a look at the 2018 Housing forecasts    

What worries me  
The debt limit is now on our radar  It is time to see some progress on this issue 
Trade issues  While there were no accidents on the Asian trip  there are also no indications of policy progress  The I wish the President had more willingness to use expert advice  The advantage of free trade is probably the most widely shared conclusion of economic experts 
 and what doesn t
Stalled tax reform  The current plans are very unlikely to get enough votes within the Republican party alone  Taking more time and gaining some bipartisan support will not happen until next year  but the result will be stronger 
The economy  Our indicators show little risk and there is plenty of upside

94824,316339,SBUX,Here s Why I Like Starbucks,opinion,"Starbucks Corporation s  NASDAQ SBUX  growth rate might be slowing  but it s making up for it by shifting its focus toward sending money back to shareholders 
With a price to earnings ratio of about 29  this stock is on the high end of valuation compared to other stocks I tend to buy  but in my opinion the numbers justify the current stock price  and options can help improve cost basis even further 
A Greater Focus On Dividends And Buybacks
Earlier this month  Starbucks released fiscal fourth quarter and 2017 year results  and the investor response has been mixed 
The company used to forecast 15 20  long term EPS growth per year  but has reduced that to at least 12  annual EPS growth or higher  Here s their full long term guidance 

Annual comparable store sales growth  3 5 
Annual revenue growth  high single digits
Annual EPS growth  12  or higher
Annual ROIC  25  or higher

For a company that already has over 27 000 stores globally  maintaining high single digit revenue growth and a whopping 25  return on invested capital is incredible  Over the last 12 months  their return on invested capital has been about 30   and their return on equity has touched 50   without using much leverage 
Their revenue has nearly doubled over the last six years  If the company maintains 7  annual revenue growth going forward  the bottom end of  high single digits    it ll mean a 50  increase in revenue over the next 6 years  To put that into perspective  McDonald s  MCD  has seen flat revenue and income over the same time period  yet their stock trades at nearly as high of a valuation with a price to earnings of about 24 
To offset this reduction in expected growth rates  Starbucks boosted its quarterly dividend 20  from  0 25 per quarter to  0 30 per quarter  up to roughly a 60  payout ratio from earnings per share   and announced plans to spend  15 billion in total on dividends and share buybacks over the next 3 years  To put that into perspective  the company paid about  8 billion in dividends and buybacks over the past 3 years  The dividend yield going forward will be a little over 2  
According to the Q4 earnings conference call that came with the earnings release  most of this will be funded by operational cash flows  but they will also be increasing their leverage a bit while interest rates are still low  Starbucks currently has a long term debt to equity ratio of about 55   and an interest coverage ratio of 50  which makes their balance sheet absolutely rock solid  and if anything  actually under leveraged  I don t mean to use McDonald s as a punching bag again  but they re extremely leveraged at this point  with debt that far exceeds their equity and an interest coverage ratio of about 10 
Going forward as a dividend growth investor  I d like to see Starbucks maintain a very strong balance sheet  but it certainly makes sense to issue some bonds right now while interest rates are low but rising  I think management is running a good balance here between stability and taking advantage of unusually low interest rates 
Dividend growth stocks are one of the best ways to build wealth  and Starbucks has now firmly shifted from being a grow at all costs company to a blue chip dividend payer 
Growth In China
Starbucks is doubling down on China  and expects to eventually have more locations in China than the United States  according the New York Times  They already have more locations in Shanghai than in New York City 
Earlier this year  Starbucks announced plans to acquire the remaining stake in its East China joint venture for  1 3 billion  which makes it the largest acquisition in company history according to Reuters  And according to this past earnings release  Starbucks opened 1 036 new locations in East Asia over the past 12 months  with the bulk of those being in China 
China is now the largest consumer of luxury goods in the world  and by 2018 McKinsey   Company expects China to have the largest number of millionaires in the world  This trend seems to include Starbucks  China has an extremely low per capita coffee consumption compared to its Asian neighbors  and with a growing middle class and a strong appetite for premium brands  the potential market for Starbucks is massive 
Normally a company that pays virtually all of its cashflows to shareholders as dividends and buybacks would have trouble growing quickly  but as long as Starbucks retains its 25  or higher ROIC  it can invest a relatively small amount of capital each year and get strong revenue and income growth from it 
Tea Consolidation  Good For Shareholders
Starbucks has made a number of tea acquisitions and is now reversing and consolidating much of this 
In 1999  the Starbucks bought Tazo Tea  which it sells through retail channels including Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   In 2012  Starbucks bought Teavana  which has 379 branded retail locations that serve hot tea and sell tea and teaware 
Earlier this year  the company announced that it will close all 379 of its Teavana locations  because they re not making money  Teavana has a heavy presence in malls  and malls these days are closing and facing lower foot traffic  And earlier this month  as mentioned in the earnings release  Starbucks is selling Tazo Tea to Unilever  LON ULVR  for  384 million 
But Teavana is far from out of the picture  Starbucks may be closing all of its locations  but the brand itself is strong  The company will continue to sell Teavana branded products in its Starbucks locations  and recently partnered with Anheuser Busch Inbev  NYSE BUD  to sell ready to drink Teavana branded premium iced teas  The brand should grow and provide profits to Starbucks over time 
This is a smart move  and focuses on the company s core competencies  It didn t make sense to maintain two separate tea brands  especially Tazo  By concentrating on just one tea brand  and incorporating the products more heavily into its namesake coffee locations and partnering with others for broader retail sales  it should be a better use of capital  Selling both coffee and tea in its locations broadens its appeal  especially in Asia 
Starbucks Stock Valuation
Starbucks  stock price has been flat for over two years now as the rest of the market has rallied  and at about  57 share it s trading well under its 52 week high of over  64 share 
Two years ago I considered Starbucks overvalued  but as the stock price remained flat and the company continued to grow its top and bottom lines  it now trades at a reasonable valuation once again  With a price to earnings ratio of 29  it s certainly not cheap  but let s do a quick breakdown of what this could mean 


Using a 7 1  revenue growth rate  the low end of the company s high single digit expectations   and using an estimated EPS growth rate of just 10 4   well below the company s 12  expectations   and assuming that as the company continues to mature its earnings multiple will decrease from 29 to 20  the stock is still poised to give shareholders at least high single digit returns over the next decade 
This isn t a screaming buy by any means  but considering that the S P 500 is at extremely high valuations  buying and holding Starbucks is a good risk adjusted use of capital in my opinion  It s a reasonably priced premium stock in a sea of overvalued stock prices  and in a bullish case could provide 10  average annual returns going forward  I m a buyer under  60 
If you want to wait for a lower cost basis  you can sell April 20  2018 cash secured put options at a strike price of  55 for about  2 share  which means if the stock dips in price you ll buy the shares for a cost basis of about  53 share

94840,316355,SBUX,U S  employers make big push for telehealth,news,By Beth Pinsker NEW YORK  Reuters    As Hurricane Irma lashed Orlando  Florida  last month  Amanda Leite needed a doctor for her 4 year old daughter  who had a fever  Finding a pediatrician s office with both electricity and a doctor on call was not an option  Neither was breaking curfew to get to an emergency room  Until then  Leite had never thought about telehealth  which is seeing a doctor via video chat  The service is now offered through most major health insurance systems with a copay equal to that of a traditional doctor s office visit  It can also be obtained independently for per use costs that vary by provider and locale  Teladoc Inc  the largest provider in the United States  says it sees about 5 000 patients a day  for an out of pocket fee of  45 or less   Leite then remembered a notice she had seen on Facebook  NASDAQ FB  from Nemours Children s Hospital that its telehealth app  which is serviced through American Well  would be free for those affected by the storm   Within minutes  she had a doctor on her phone screen who had access to her daughter s electronic health record  They did a basic exam  with Leite pressing on her daughter s stomach  weighing her and holding her phone to the child s mouth so the doctor could see her throat   The doctor determined that rushing to the hospital was not necessary  and that the girl could wait to see her regular doctor when the storm cleared   It made me feel a lot better that I didn t need to rush her to ER   said Leite  37   She is now sold on using a doctor online for future occasions when she is unable to travel or when the illness requires no immediate hands on exam   OPEN ENROLLMENT PUSH  Employers hope this concept of gaining remote access to doctors catches on quickly  because it promises cost savings  As companies start the annual process of open enrollment for healthcare benefits for the coming year  expect a big push by Corporate America to promote the availability of telehealth  U S  companies are facing a 4 3 percent increase in health benefit costs for 2018  the highest since 2011  according to benefit consultant Mercer  and are looking for options beyond raising deductibles or copays  which shifts the burden to employees   Five years ago  only 7 percent of companies covered telehealth visits through health insurance plans  but today  96 percent of companies treat them like regular doctor s visits  according to a survey released in August by the National Business Group on Health  a nonpartisan research group  Usage rates are low  however  with only 2 5 percent of employees at companies surveyed actually using the service  because the availability is so new    It s becoming a more accepted practice now   said Steve Wojcik  vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health  Getting more people on board is a matter of effective communication   companies that are the most proactive about publicizing telehealth to their employees tend to obtain the best response rates  Craft retailer Michaels Companies Inc  which uses the Teladoc system for its employees  has a usage rate of about 4 percent among its full time employees  Sharon Brown  director of benefits  is encouraging workers to use it because she thinks it saves money compared with going to an emergency room or urgent care facility    We have shift workers  and they can t always get to the doctor when it is open   said Brown   They are saving time  so there s a productivity cost  It s less money out of their pockets for travel or lost time at work   To reach employees this year  Brown is sending out postcards and magnets  But her most effective messaging is something she calls the Porcelain Post   messages from human resources that get taped up in bathroom stalls across their 1 300 stores  distribution centers and manufacturing plants   Staffing company  Adecco   SIX ADEN  Group AG uses the American Well system for telehealth  and the head of human resources walks around the North American headquarters in Jacksonville  Florida  handing out Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  gift cards to employees who have downloaded the telehealth app  It had 28 percent of U S  employees sign up  and 55 percent used the service in its first year  for a cost savings to the employer of  130 000  said Michelle Gile  a senior vice president for American Well   Some independent research is a little less rosy  A March 2017 study in Health Affairs found that the costs of treating bronchitis and similar conditions increased by  45 per user when telehealth was involved   mostly because the availability of telehealth encouraged more doctor care  not less   Some of those seeking care did not have a regular doctor  Some were using telehealth as a precursor to an office visit  like triage  said Scott Ashwood  an associate policy researcher at the nonpartisan Rand Corporation  who led the study   The American Medical Association backs telehealth as  an ongoing evolution of new models for the delivery of care and patient physician interactions   But the organization also cautions that providers recognize the  limitations of the relevant technologies and take appropriate steps to overcome those limitations   said AMA board member Jack Resneck in a 2016 statement    It s not for everything   said NBGH s Wojcik   There are some times when you need to go see a physician in person  But for a lot of primary care situations  you can probably talk through telehealth  And I think financially  everyone wins  ,2017-10-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-employers-make-big-push-for-telehealth-536853,536853

94845,316360,SBUX,Peace gives Colombian coffee an extra shot,news,By Marcy Nicholson SAN CARLOS  Colombia  Reuters    Farmers who fled war in the Colombian Andes are returning to revive their abandoned land  cultivating coffee trees that are boosting global supplies of the highest quality beans  Colombia s five decade civil war  the longest in the Americas  displaced millions and disrupted farming for decades in areas that produce coffee for the most exacting consumer  The revival of coffee farming in the former conflict zones could help boost Colombia s coffee output by 40 percent  according to government estimates  That would raise global supplies of mild arabica beans by about 13 percent  The additional supply could reduce the cost of the raw material for the world s top roasters  many of whom are seeking to secure increased supply from Colombia  About 950 coffee growing families have returned to the San Carlos area  representing about 60 percent of the 1 600 families who left during the war  according to data from the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation  FNC   The supply from this region  about 330 kilometers  205 miles  north west of the Colombian capital of Bogota  could expand further as farmers plant more of their land and more people return to the region to provide the needed labor  The area now has about 800 hectares of coffee farms  double the low of 400 hectares during the war  That s still only about half of the 1 500 hectares prior to the conflict  according to FNC data  Among those who returned was Libardo Garcia  who lost two brothers in the conflict   one was shot and the other killed by a landmine  He and his family moved back to their 12 hectare  30 acres  farm in 2015 after fleeing in 2001    All the coffee trees were dead when we came back   said Garcia  who has since planted 8 000 trees on two hectares of steeply sloped land  Arabica is the highest quality coffee bean  and Colombia is the world s top producer of mild arabica  To make that variety  beans are separated from the cherry then dried to increase quality  Arabica makes up about 60 percent of global coffee supplies  with lower quality robusta beans accounting for the rest  While some coffee roasters add robusta to their highly secretive blends  premium brands are typically 100 percent mild arabica  A peace deal between the government and the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  FARC  in late 2016 paved the way for many to return to their homes and farms  including thousands of coffee growers  About 220 000 people died and millions were displaced in decades of fighting among leftist guerillas  paramilitary groups  criminal organizations and government forces  The conflict impacted large areas of the country  and the government struggled to exert control over highlands and remote jungle areas in the west and south of the country  Some farmers who stayed through the violence have also switched to coffee from growing coca and other illegal crops that they cultivated during the conflict  Coca is used for cocaine production  and the cash from growing it helped finance armed groups during the war  The combination of farmers returning to their abandoned land and others switching to coffee could help boost the country s total output to a record 20 million 60 kg bags by 2020  the government estimates  up from 14 2 million bags in 2016  GOING HOME In the Andean region of San Carlos  the revival in coffee production has advanced quickly since conflict in the region abated around 2014  when the peace deal was still being negotiated  The country s conflict with rebels began in 1964 and peaked in this region around 2000  After fleeing his farm  Garcia spent time in the city of Medellin and then in the town of San Carlos   We came back because we love the land   he said  leaning against the fence outside his home  a brick house adorned with baskets of flowers  Wearing a wide brimmed hat  Garcia pointed out a former FARC stronghold in the distance  in tree covered mountains about an hour s walk from his farm  Most of his neighbors have yet to return  he said  either because they are skeptical the peace will last or because they have made lives elsewhere  Before moving his family back  Garcia traveled the 13 kilometers from nearby San Carlos every weekend for three years to plant new coffee trees and remove the dead ones  Garcia has plenty of land to expand his farm further but cannot yet find the labor because too few people have returned to surrounding communities  New high yielding trees have helped boost harvests  but the region is still far from reaching its potential because of the labor shortage  said Rosa Velasques  manager of the local cooperative where about 1 000 local farmers sell their beans   A LOT OF WORK  International roasters have jumped at the opportunity to buy more beans from Colombia  the world s third largest coffee producer and the source of a third of the world s mild arabica supplies  Italian roaster illycaffe has expanded its buying to parts of the country that were unreachable during the violence   Now they ve opened up   said illycaffe Chairman Andrea Illy  The firm had increased purchases from the region by double digit percentages for the last two to three years  Illy said  and it expects growth to continue at similar rates  In 2016  Nestle Nespresso bought its first coffee from a post conflict region of Colombia and launched it this year as a limited edition   A lot of these regions  nobody had even been in and tasted the coffee until recently   said Katherine Graham  Nestle Nespresso s corporate communications manager    There are some areas with strong potential   Graham said   But it needs a lot of development  a lot of work   Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  Co expanded its partnership with the United States Agency for International Development to give 1 000 farmers in post conflict zones agricultural training  It also partnered with the Inter American Development Bank to support 2 000 farmers in Colombia   mainly women   with a loan initiative  Colombian entrepreneur Gonzalo Navarro launched a roasting company called Piccolo Piacere in Medellin earlier this year  focusing on sourcing from small coffee growers  many in former conflict zones   We have access to farmers who in the past were growing other things  such as coca   he said  Back near San Carlos  farmer Rubiela Cuervo works a remote farm with her family  She fled to Medellin to escape the violence in 2005 but struggled to make a living and returned a year later despite the ongoing violence  She has expanded the farm as peace returned to the area in recent years   We hope that peace will bring us more employment  more income for our work   she said   I m hoping not to be displaced again  ,2017-10-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/peace-gives-colombian-coffee-an-extra-shot-543937,543937

94851,316366,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  Reports In Line Q4 Earnings  Lowers Targets,opinion,Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   reported in line earnings but failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate

of 10  or greater  Second  the premium coffee giant has entered into an agreement to sell Tazo tea to Unilever  LON ULVR  for  384 million  The deal includes the Tazo brand  signature recipes  intellectual property and inventory and allows Starbucks to focus its tea strategy on Teavana Starbucks shares dipped more than 3  following the news release on Nov 2  possibly in response to the lowered long term targets and weak fourth quarter results Earnings  Sales   Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share  EPS  of 55 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  but grew 10  year over year Total fourth quarter sales of  5 7 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 73 billion by 0 6  and remained unchanged from the year ago level  The underperformance was due to the impact of hurricanes Irma and Harvey  which affected the company s overall top line as well as U S  comp growth by 1   This was because more than 1 000 stores had to be temporarily closed due to storm related reasons Global same store sales increased 2   lower than 4  growth in the preceding quarter  Global traffic increased 2  in the quarter compared with 4  in the previous quarter  Transactions increased 1  Margin DownOperating margin decreased 360 basis points  bps  year over year to 17 9  in the quarter due to higher partner investments  primarily in the Americas segment  and

woes On a non GAAP basis  operating margin declined 90 bps to 20  Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas  Net revenues in this flagship segment were down 0 5  year over year to  3 9 billion Comps rise of 3

performance in the quarter  Again  South Korea marks its fifth largest global market  with system sales exceeding  1 billion in fiscal 2017  with double digit comp growth in the year  underscoring the broad success Starbucks is having across the region Operating margin at the CAP segment expanded 60 bps year over year to 23 5  in the quarter buoyed by strong sales leverage and higher JV income  These are partly offset by an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA   Net revenues were down 0 1  year over year at  269 9 million in the segment as higher revenues from addition of new stores were offset by an extra week in the year ago period That said  comps grew 1   against 2  growth in the preceding quarter  Operating margin declined 330 bps

94873,316388,SBUX,Coffee rivals square off in Italy ahead of Starbucks invasion,news,"By Francesca Landini MILAN  Reuters    Two of Italy s biggest coffee houses are reinforcing their brands with flagship cafes in Milan near the spot where U S  rival Starbucks  O SBUX  is set to begin an invasion next year  Lavazza opens its first flagship cafe in the coffee obsessed city on Tuesday  not far from the renovated 19th century palazzo where Starbucks will open its first Italian store  a  Reserve Roasteries  outlet offering speciality blends and fine food  Another top Italian brand  illycaffe  opened its own luxury cafe close to the Starbucks site in May  in a cosy courtyard in Milan s most fashionable street  Lavazza  which is opening near the city s famous La Scala opera house  and illycaffe both deny their moves are a response to a global rival s impending arrival  a first step in what may become a 200 store expansion  Industry experts suspect it is no coincidence   Lavazza and illycaffe are the purists of coffee  they want to show they are there when Starbucks arrives   says Jean Paul Gaillard  who ran Nespresso for 10 years before founding the Ethical Coffee Company  a Swiss firm selling coffee pods  Milan s battle of the coffee palaces reflects global competition among major brands to capture a growing market for people who are prepared to pay a premium for quality espresso coffees in upmarket boutique cafes  Nestle  S NESN  last week bought California based Blue Bottle Coffee  one of the top boutique U S  chains whose single origin and cold brewed coffees have proven popular with hipsters and have made inroads into the Starbucks franchise  JAB Holdings  the investment vehicle of Germany s Reimann family  has also been buying up independent start ups selling premium brews around the world  from Europe to the Americas  Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz hopes his company s arrival in Milan  which he calls the home of the  perfect espresso   and the inspiration for his Starbucks vision  will show discerning Italian coffee lovers that  we got it right    We are happy to hear about Lavazza s growth   said a Starbucks spokesman when asked to comment on Lavazza s opening  The U S  chain will open its 2 400 square metre cafe in late 2018  seeking to attract tourists  young Italians and the business crowd  If the Milan experiment succeeds  Starbucks and its local partner  Antonio Percassi  could open more than 200 stores in Italy over six years  according to Percassi  Some analysts are skeptical that Starbucks can crack a market where espresso typically sells for just one euro   1 20   a fraction of the price of a Starbucks coffee  But the local brands are also gambling Italians will spend much more than one euro for a restaurant style experience  illycaffe charges around three times that for coffee brought to the table  Nestle  JAB Holdings and Starbucks are the three largest players in the global coffee market  followed by several mid tier players including Lavazza and illycaffe   As the biggest get bigger  mid tier companies are in a position where they must either expand or risk being left behind or swallowed up by their massive rivals   said Matthew Barry  an analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International  Lavazza s chief executive and some of its family owners will cut a ribbon to launch their cafe  where customers can sip a blend of coffee specifically crafted for the store  taste gourmet food and buy single origin coffees   The opening of the new flagship store has nothing to do with Starbucks   a Lavazza spokeswoman said  adding that it was solely aimed at giving people an exclusive Lavazza experience  The group is primarily a roaster and supplier to independent cafes and restaurants rather than a retailer and its new store is a way of boosting brand visibility on the high street  Lavazza went on an acquisition spree three years ago  buying up three coffee suppliers in Europe and Canada  boosting sales to nearly 2 billion euros last year  It has overtaken Starbucks in supermarket sales  Euromonitor International says  Illycaffe sells its coffee both through independent cafes and 230 mono brand stores  some of them directly owned  in 43 countries  and says it wants to develop the network further  though not via major acquisitions   The new store wants to be a landmark for the global nomad in search for the real Italian lifestyle experience   illycaffe said  without commenting on the arrival of Starbucks  Milanese coffee society is divided on whether Starbucks can make its name at the high end of Italian market  the world s fourth largest coffee consumer   I am curious about Starbucks  I will give it a try when it arrives in Milan   office worker Giuseppe Gaggiano  55  said at a small  upmarket independent cafe close to the Starbucks site  However  another customer there  Alberto Paparusso  31  said he wouldn t abandon his usual cafe   I don t like Starbucks coffee  It s not worth going there

the Zacks Defense Equipment industry  which has increased  22 9  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Raytheon is one of the best positioned large cap defense players due to its non platform centric focus Thanks to its wide range of combat proven defense products  the company continues to receive scrumptious orders from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the nation  In particular  its Patriot missile defense systems have been seeing increased number of buyers  lately Moreover  the company is a strong cash generator  which allows it to pay attractive dividend per share to its

94886,316401,SBUX,Will Higher Costs Impact Starbucks   SBUX  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 2  after the closing bell Starbucks  operating fundamentals remain strong with a solid global retail footprint  successful innovations  best in class loyalty program and digital offerings  Particularly  Starbucks is on track to strengthen its portfolio with significant innovation in beverages and core food offerings We expect Starbucks  revenues to rise on the back of an addition of new restaurants and positive global comparable store sales or simply comps growth  Starbucks also projected global comps at 3 4  growth for the quarter  Comps in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to be driven by significant menu innovations like new and improved Bistro Boxes  Seared Steak and Egg Wrap In beverages  the launch of the Iced Cascara Coconut Milk Latte  the Iced Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato  Nitro Freddo and the Whiskey Barrel Aged Sulawesi cold brew are also likely to boost the company s revenue  In its Channel Development segment  Starbucks  introduction of Teavana Infusions  a platform of flavored food made from real fruits and botanicals is also a positive factor Starbucks  digital offering  Mobile Order and Pay  is also witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to be reported quarter as well as in 2017  Addition of new restaurants  along with growth in Starbucks reward members  is expected to contribute to Starbucks  revenue growth in the to be reported quarter The company had earlier revealed that it expects stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year  driven by mid single digit comps including accelerating comps in the United States  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s total stores of 16 510 reflects 5 8  year over year growth Segment wise  Starbucks  Americas segment  inclusive of the United States  Canada and Latin America  comprising 70 5  of its total revenue  is expected to witness 0 6  growth in revenues  per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  China Asia Pacific and Channel Development segments are likely to witness 4 4  and 3 1  growth in revenues  respectively  Additionally  the consensus estimate for Europe  Middle East and Africa or EMEA segment revenues of  253 million indicates a decrease of 6 3  from the prior quarter Starbucks has been shifting certain EMEA markets toward a licensed model  Hence  the portfolio shifts and FX headwind are likely to leave an adverse impact on its EMEA revenues  That said  this effort has contributed to EMEA  delivering solid mid single digit system sales growth and double digit non GAAP operating margins for 12 consecutive quarters Overall  for the fiscal fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  5 73 billion  implying 0 4  year over year growth With respect to the company s bottom line  Starbucks  EPS will likely witness a decline in the third quarter due to a rise in cost of sales and higher goodwill and other asset impairment expenses for the closing of 379 Teavana stores  Hence  despite a revenue growth expectation  the coffee giant s margins are likely to fall due to higher cost of sales as a result of commodity inflation  However  these headwinds are likely to be offset by lower general and administrative  G A  expenses The company remains focused on growing total G A below the rate of revenue growth and core G A at half the rate of revenue growth in the long run  This trend is expected to follow in the fiscal fourth quarter as well However  a challenging environment in the United States restaurant space might be a cause for concern for investors in the near term For the fiscal fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents a share  reflecting a decrease of 2 5  year over year Here is what our quantitative model predicts Starbucks does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   to increase the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  Starbucks has an Earnings ESP of  0 08  Zacks Rank  Starbucks carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a

94916,316431,SBUX,Simon  SPG  Charges Starbucks For Teavana Store Closures,opinion,Simon Property Group Inc    NYSE SPG   recently sued Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   to refrain the latter from going in for its plan to close the Teavana stores in Simon s malls  The move comes amid a wave of store closure announcements in recent times which have served a severe blow to the retail real estate market The AllegationsSimon s lawsuit alleged that Starbucks  78 Teavana store closures in its malls would result in a breach of its lease obligations  Further  the company claimed that this store closure announcement by Starbucks has led to an adverse impact on the value of Simon s properties  However  there were no specifications in the lawsuit about the amount of financial relief or damage sought by Simon  per the Indianapolis Business Journal  Notably  the Starbucks  July announcement of store closures involves a shutter down of all 379 of its Teavana stores in the next year  with majority occurring by spring 2018  However  only two of the Teavana stores in Simon malls have leases slated for expiry before the spring of 2018  but the leases for the rest 76 stores run through January 2027 Starbucks cited lackluster traffic in malls for the decision to close the stores  However  Simon alleged that this is just a lame excuse by Starbucks to refract the blame from itself  In fact  the mall landlord pointed out that the decision of store closures from several retailers like Sports Authority  Gap Inc    NYSE GPS    Macy s Inc    NYSE M   among others was an outcome of either bankruptcy or financial ruin But this is not the case with Starbucks  which has earned its reputation for being  one of the largest and most recognized companies in the world   Rather  the Teavana store closure move came as the business failed to expand at Starbucks  anticipated pace  according to Simon s allegations Impact of Store ClosuresAs a matter of fact  mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers  shopping preferences and patterns  with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds  These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times Further  retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies  This comes as a pressing concern for retail REITs  as this trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space In fact  year to date  the  has underperformed the broader market  This industry has declined 6 5  over this time frame  as against a 9 9  gain of the S P 500 Amid these  mall landlords have already decided to go to the mattresses  These companies are continuing to make concerted efforts to turn their boring retail hubs into swanky entertainment zones  digitizing their malls and turning into distribution hubs However  the choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions  which the mall landlords are finding it unjustified  Moreover  significant store closures in the middle of the lease term not only hurt the mall landlord  but also the tenants occupying space in that mall because their shop visits also depend on the mix of specific type of retailers Currently  Simon Property carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars This proven stock picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing  You can apply it to your portfolio starting today ,2017-08-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/simon-spg-charges-starbucks-for-teavana-store-closures-200210826,200210826

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Raytheon  RTN   Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   SPG   and Anthem  ANTM   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy rated Raytheon shares have risen around  28 4  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Defense Equipment industry  which has increased  22 9  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Raytheon is one of the best positioned large cap defense players due to its non platform centric focus 
Thanks to its wide range of combat proven defense products  the company continues to receive scrumptious orders from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the nation  In particular  its Patriot missile defense systems have been seeing increased number of buyers  lately 
Moreover  the company is a strong cash generator  which allows it to pay attractive dividend per share to its shareholders  On the flip side  factors like tough competition  budget deficits and political uncertainty continue to be major headwinds for Raytheon

Shares of Simon Property Group have been under pressure recently and have underperformed the Zacks Retail REIT industry in the year to date period   6 6  vs   2 3    Simon Property recently announced that Flying Tiger Copenhagen   the Danish brand   will open outlets in four of its shopping centers  The company also sued Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  refraining it from closing 78 of its Teavana stores in Simon s malls 
The Zacks analyst likes Simon s efforts to support omni channel retailing as well as its portfolio restructuring initiatives and healthy balance sheet  However  mall traffic has been facing challenges due to a shift in shopping patterns  with online shopping taking precedence over in store purchase 
Though the company is making efforts to counter the pressure through various initiatives  implementation of such measures is anticipated to limit any robust growth in its profit margin in the near term  Also  the Fed s rate hike has added to its woes

94968,316483,SBUX,Will McDonald s customers wait for the new Quarter Pounder ,news,By Lisa Baertlein and Liz Hampton LOS ANGELES DALLAS  Reuters    Tracy Moore grew impatient as she waited for a Quarter Pounder recently in the parking lot of a McDonald s restaurant in central Dallas   The burger  made with fresh beef and billed as hotter and juicer than the original made from a frozen patty  is part of the company s effort to serve tastier food   But after about four minutes  it was Moore who was steamed  Like other customers who d ordered the new Quarter Pounder at the restaurant s drive through  she was asked to pull into a parking space and wait   If it s going to be that long every time  I won t order it  I d go  elsewhere  said Moore  who hits the drive through every morning for a Coke and dines frequently at the chain  The tradeoff between time and taste looms large for McDonald s Corp as it works to win back business lost to rivals  The introduction of cooked to order  quarter pound burgers made with fresh beef is part of the chain s attempt to improve food quality  Announced in March  the new sandwiches are already in selected test markets and are expected to be served in all U S  stores by mid 2018  But the success of the initiative may well hinge on satisfying important customers like Moore  speed minded drive through patrons who account for 70 percent of the firm s U S  revenue  An on demand Quarter Pounder takes about a minute longer to land in a customer s hands than does the original sandwich  according to restaurant managers and analysts  even though fresh beef fries up faster than frozen patties  That s because grilling begins only after a patron orders  Traditional Quarter Pounders were often cooked up in batches ahead of time  Every second counts in the fast food business  McDonald s drive through speeds already lag those of some major competitors  according to one widely watched survey  McDonald s does not share such data  but company representatives told Reuters earlier this year that service times have slowed  Still  company executives are bullish on prospects for the popular Quarter Pounder  which accounts for about one fourth of McDonald s U S  burger sales  At an investor conference last month  Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said the changeover has created fewer complications than expected and that restaurant operators are on board   Some industry veterans  however  are skeptical  Richard Adams  a former Southern California McDonald s franchisee turned consultant  says convenience is paramount for the chain s patrons  who may go elsewhere if speed deteriorates    Any time the cooking process begins after the customer orders  the service time will be slower   Adams said   The fresh beef initiative comes as pressure builds on McDonald s kitchens   Adams says restaurant crews already are juggling trickier menu items thanks to the recent national launch of McDonald s new  Signature Crafted  sandwich line  which allows customers to pick their own meat  buns and toppings   Signature Crafted  quarter pound burgers also will use fresh beef as it becomes available nationwide  McDonald s cooks could be further strained by the chain s embrace of self service kiosks and mobile ordering  The technology shaves ordering times  but can create new bottlenecks by swamping kitchens at peak hours  as companies such as  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX  have learned  FRESH VS  FAST The revamped Quarter Pounder is the latest move by Easterbrook to modernize the 60 year old chain and reverse four straight years of traffic declines   It s also a direct shot at Wendy s Co  Whataburger and In N Out  Those fresh burger chains are among the fast food rivals that McDonald s says have siphoned 500 million U S  transactions from its stores since 2012   Easterbrook s introduction of all day breakfast in October 2015 was a big hit and has helped lift sales  The company s stock price is up more than 25 percent so far this year   Analysts expect the fresh beef push  along with moves to ditch artificial ingredients in popular items such as chicken nuggets  to bolster sales by addressing consumer demand for simpler   cleaner  and fresher ingredients  The Quarter Pounder makeover has won early support from analysts and McDonald s franchisees in the heart of cattle country  where the product has been tested for almost two years in about 400 stores in Oklahoma and Texas  Three Dallas area McDonald s managers who spoke with Reuters estimated the switch has improved their Quarter Pounder sales from 20 percent to 50 percent  albeit aided by advertising and coupons    We ve been stealing customers from a Whataburger down the street   said Edgar Meza  a manager at a McDonald s restaurant in an upscale neighborhood in north Dallas  Officials at Texas based Whataburger  a regional chain  declined to comment  Some burger lovers are taking notice too   They re a little juicier   said Bob Riley  who was polishing off a Quarter Pounder at an outlet near Dallas  Deep Ellum neighborhood  his third McDonald s meal of the week    I think Wendy s woke them up   he said  Joe Jasper  a former McDonald s executive who owns 20 restaurants in the Dallas Fort Worth area  has been deeply involved in the effort  He described the new Quarter Pounder as  the best burger in our industry  but more importantly   one delivered  at the speed of McDonald s    Trouble is  the  speed of McDonald s  isn t as fast as that of many of its competitors  The average service time at a McDonald s drive through last year was 208 2 seconds  according to a study published by QSR magazine  an industry publication  using data from SeeLevel HX  an Atlanta based business intelligence firm  That s well behind industry leader Wendy s at 169 1 seconds  according to the survey  Burger King  Dunkin  Donuts and KFC all beat McDonald s too  McDonald s narrowed the gap with Wendy s by one third from 2012 to 2016 by adding more drive through lanes at some stores and by scrapping products such as  snack wraps   tortilla wrapped sandwiches that proved time consuming to prepare  Still  its average drive through service time last year was almost 20 seconds slower than it was in 2012  according to SeeLevel HX data    For a look at drive through speeds  see    Claudia Barcenas  assistant manager at a McDonald s off Dallas  Central Expressway  says her counter and drive through staff inform patrons that fresh beef Quarter Pounders can be delayed  particularly if the sandwiches are ordered well done    We have to explain that it takes a bit longer  Perhaps a minute   Barcenas said  Whether that s worth it for McDonald s customers remains to be seen as the experiment goes nationwide  Juan Rodriguez waited on his lunch break for a fresh beef Quarter Pounder at the drive through of another Dallas McDonald s outlet about nine miles from Barcenas  store  At the three minute mark  the 20 year old was getting restless   If it s better  I don t mind waiting   Rodriguez said   But if it tastes the same  then no

94969,316484,SBUX,U S  fund managers seek consumer stocks that Amazon can t conquer,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    Amazon com Inc s  O AMZN  game changing move to upend the grocery business with a surprise deal to buy Whole Foods Market Inc  O WFM  compounds a problem already vexing fund managers  how to play U S  consumer spending when the Seattle based e commerce giant is threatening to take over retail  Amazon s relentless growth and destruction of value among traditional retail rivals is forcing active fund managers to look for bets in areas they think Amazon can t or won t reach   Emerging options include theme restaurant chains  recreational vehicle makers and sellers of stuff that s just too heavy to ship via Amazon s network  Meanwhile  some fund managers are increasingly convinced the only way to play consumer spending is to move away from brands and retailers and into logistics and supply chain companies  essentially betting e commerce will render most consumer companies obsolete   The challenge of investing in consumer companies comes a time when the category would typically shine   Low unemployment and a solid housing market boost consumer stocks  yet companies in the category   excluding Amazon   are up just 5 2 percent for the year  or about 3 percentage points below the broad S P 500 as a whole  according to Thomson Reuters data   Amazon shares  by comparison  are up about 30 percent    For graphic on Amazon overshadows its competition  click   BIGGER DISRUPTION THAN WAL MART S  Amazon now accounts for about 34 percent of all U S  online sales and should see that number grow to about 50 percent by 2021  according to a Needham research note  Amazon s growing dominance is in some ways akin to the rise of Wal Mart Stores Inc  N WMT  in the early 2000s  when its rapid growth and move to branch out into groceries raised concerns it would put other retailers out of business  Yet Amazon s greater online reach and purchase of a top shelf grocery store chain makes it far more formidable  said Barbara Miller  a portfolio manager at Federated Kaufmann funds   I ve been in this industry for twenty five years and this is the biggest transformation we ve seen in the consumer space   she said   While Wal Mart put many small mom and pop stores out of business  Amazon is dragging down national competitors like  Target  and Macy s with its combination of low prices  broad range of inventory  and speed  she said   At the same time  Amazon is expanding its e commerce dominance when more shoppers are online  suggesting more pain ahead for competitors  E commerce sales grew 14 7 percent in 2016  nearly triple the 5 1 percent growth rate of traditional retailers  according to U S  Census Bureau data   BUGS AND COFFEE  THE HUNT FOR SURVIVORS Fund managers say Amazon s growing dominance is forcing them to shift long held strategies  by either putting less money into consumer stocks overall or by focusing on companies that can compete alongside Amazon or may be attractive buyout targets   The company s outsized 15 4 percent weighting  more than double the next largest stock in the S P 500 Consumer Discretionary index  is problematic for fund managers who typically will not hold any positions greater than 5 percent of their portfolio in order to manage risk   Josh Cummings  a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson funds  is avoiding shares of direct competitors of Amazon  such as Target Corp  N TGT    Kroger Co   N KR   and Wal Mart  and instead focusing on companies with  idiosyncratic  attributes  he said   Starbucks Corp   O SBUX   for instance  offers an experience that Amazon would find hard to match  he said  while Servicemaster Global Holdings  N SERV   parent company of pest control company Terminix  is largely immune from e commerce competition    Could Amazon decide they want to be in the business of spraying for bugs  It doesn t seem likely   he said  Miller  the portfolio manager at the Federated Kaufmann funds  said she is moving away from stores that could be found in a mall  focusing instead on companies like Dave   Busters Entertainment Inc  O PLAY  and  Wingstop Inc   O WING  that offer food based experiences  She also owns shares of  Camping World Holdings Inc   N CWH   which sells a mix of goods and services ranging from roadside assistance to accessories to the growing recreational vehicle market    This is a company with a strong membership base that has the sort of scale in its niche to rival Amazon   she said  Jeff Rottinghaus  portfolio manager of the T  Rowe Price U S  Large Cap Core Equity fund  said he owns  Home Depot  Inc  N HD  shares because its stores essentially function as warehouses and much of its merchandise is too heavy or bulky to profitably ship quickly online   Gary Bradshaw  a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital in Dallas  said he expects that portfolio holding Wal Mart will become more aggressive in acquiring small  private companies to broaden its online reach   The company announced a deal to buy men s wear company Bonobos for  310 million in mid June  following purchases of outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw and online shoe store ShoeBuy  Wal Mart acquired online retailer Jet com in a  3 3 billion deal last August    They re going to do whatever it takes to compete with Amazon  They may be losing the battle at the moment but that doesn t mean that they will back down   he said  Other investors are getting their consumer exposure by focusing on behind the scenes companies that power the growth of e commerce   Laird Bieger  a portfolio manager of the Baron Discovery Fund   the top performing small cap growth fund year to date   said he is focusing on companies like CommerceHub Inc  O CHUBA   which works with companies such as  J C Penney Co   N JCP  and  Best Buy  Inc  N BBY  to allow them to sell more products online and ship directly from manufacturers   Craig Richard  a co portfolio manager of the Buffalo Emerging Opportunities fund  said he has been buying  Kornit Digital Ltd   O KRNT   which makes textile printers that can produce t shirt and other apparel designs on demand  helping save inventory costs  
Amazon is Kornit s largest customer and has warrants to buy up to 2 9 million Kornit shares  about 8 percent of the company  at  13 03 a share over the next five years  Shares of Kornit  up 57 percent this year  traded at  19 95 on Friday ",2017-06-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-fund-managers-seek-consumer-stocks-that-amazon-can't-conquer-501087,501087

CEO Kevin Johnson cited declining foot traffic in malls as the reason for the closure  which are the main location for Teavana stores   We felt it was an appropriate time to take the decision and begin shutting down those stores   he said 
The coffee giant acquired the U S  tea chain in 2012 for  620 million  when then CEO Howard Schultz cited the expanding tea market as an appealing place for growth  However  Starbucks  disappointing revenue and comparable sales growth on Thursday in its third quarter earnings report with the Teavana chain partially to blame 
 Following a strategic review of the Teavana store business  the company concluded that despite efforts to reverse the trend through creative merchandising and new store designs  the underperformance was likely to continue   Starbucks said in a press release 
The popular tea retailer DavidsTea   NASDAQ DTEA   is up 9  in morning trading following Teavana closures  The Canadian company has come out strong since its IPO two years ago  with a total of 232 stores in the U S  and Canada 
While DavidsTea does have mall based locations  the company doesn t restrict itself like Teavana does  This versatile strategy may have helped the company increase its sales by 9 4  during its first quarter of 2017 
Teavana has also had little success competing with Argo Tea for the last few years  Since 2003  when the company opened its first store in Chicago  Argo Tea has operated dozens of tea cafes across the U S  When Starbucks bought Teavana  the company planned to open similar tea bars across the country 
While Argo Tea initially worried  Starbucks  experiment failed  It opened its first of five Teavana tea bars in 2013  However  by early 2016  Starbucks gave up on developing its smaller brand stores  deciding to focus its tea products into its existing Starbucks locations 
The Teavana store closures follow news that Starbucks  the remaining 50  stake in its East China joint venture for about  1 3 billion  The company is committed to operating 5 000 Starbucks stores in Mainland China by 2021  cementing Starbucks  future as a mainly coffee based business

Starbucks Comments

In a previous investor discussion  Scott Maw  Starbucks CFO stated 


 Over the last several years many mall based retailers have been adversely impacted by reduced foot traffic  resulting from the accelerating shift of consumer behavior away from brick and mortar retail and changes in consumer retail activity overall   and just today added   Our Teavana mall stores have not been immune  with many reporting negative comps and operating losses for some time  




 As reported on the Q2 call  many of the company s principally mall based Teavana retail stores have been persistently underperforming   Starbucks said in a statement   As a result  Starbucks will close all 379 Teavana stores over the coming year  with the majority closing by Spring 2018 


Meanwhile   said in the company s earnings release that 

  the combination of trends in the quarter and ongoing macro pressures impacting the retail and restaurant sectors has us a bit more cautious going into Q4  



Analyst Comments

95008,316523,SBUX,Late night Ramadan shopping shows Indonesia s economic spirits brightening,news,By Gayatri Suroyo JAKARTA  Reuters    Indonesia s economic spirits are rising judging by the line of women outside a packed Furla bag shop for a traditional midnight Ramadan sale at a Jakarta mall  The Muslim holy month  due to end in late June  is half over  and how much shopping Indonesians do during Ramadan is regarded as a reliable sign of the mood in an economy where private consumption accounts for 57 percent of gross domestic product   I will be shopping more this year because I ve just got a job   said 24 year old Dwi Kurnia Putri  before entering the shop at the Gandaria City Mall  in the south of the capital    In the future  it looks like everything will turn out better     but it will depend on how well I manage my money   joked Putri  who now works for an electricity company  The central bank will hope that her optimism is infectious  as policymakers think consumer spending could lift economic growth closer to 5 3 percent this year  having dawdled at 5 percent or below in recent years   We are confident     the next leg of economic growth will come from consumption   Dody Budi Waluyo  head of the economic and monetary policy department at Bank Indonesia  told Reuters  LOOKING UP There are several signs that the outlook is brightening for Asia s third largest consumer market and the world s largest Muslim population  A survey by Bank Indonesia showed consumer confidence in May was at its highest since 2000   Prices for commodities vital to the Indonesian economy  have stabilized  as has the rupiah currency    Loan growth  has topped 9 percent  and unemployment has fallen steadily  Export growth  is expected to surpass 15 percent in May  boding well for the large workforce employed by that sector   Central bank surveys also show companies have begun hiring more  and increasing their marketing budgets  while a sovereign credit rating upgrade awarded by Standard   Poor s last month has encouraged firms to raise more debt  The political mood in the capital  which accounts for a fifth of the archipelago nation s economy  has also recovered  after a religiously charged election campaign for the Jakarta governorship that saw a hardline Islamist movement lead mass protests against an incumbent Christian governor who went on to lose the vote   The feel good factor is evident in places far beyond the capital as well  with the BI survey showing the outlook among consumers has improved particularly in commodity reliant regions such as Sumatra and Sulawesi  probably reflecting a recovery in prices for palm oil and coal   The commodity crisis is kind of done     and the economy is showing a smart recovery  so I would expect that the growth rate in consumption to rise in the second half   said Ali Potia  international consulting firm McKinsey s Singapore based leader for consumer practices in Southeast Asia   The expectation in the retail sector is that this  Ramadan  is going to be busier than they ve seen in a very long time   Buying new clothes during Ramadan  and eating out to break fast with friends and family are part of Indonesian culture  Workers in the big cities look forward to returning to their kampungs  or villages  laden with bags full of gifts for the family  If they go home with few presents for the Eid festival at the end of the fasting month  it would be a sign of hard times   VAT REVENUES IMPROVING Jakarta s malls organize their sales on different weekends from each other  recognizing that the city s notoriously awful traffic makes it difficult for shoppers to get around  And  Stefanus Ridwan  the president director of PT Pakuwon Jati Tbk  a property company that operates Gandaria City mall  said the results of last Saturday s midnight sale were  good  and the shopping center was  more crowded   compared to last year   Private consumption growth on a year on year basis has been 5 percent or less for every quarter during the past two years  lagging economic growth  and was only 4 9 percent in the first quarter of this year   But  motorbike sales in May were up 15 percent  the highest growth since 2014  while April car sales showed growth running at 6 percent   Certainly  revenues from value added tax have improved  Suahasil Nazara  head of the finance ministry s fiscal policy office  told Reuters    The other day I talked to retailers     and they feel that they started to sense the pick up began in May   he said   Without getting carried away  retailers reckon a recovery has begun   Fetty Kwartati  corporate secretary of PT Mitra Adiperkasa  JK MAPI   which oversees brands such as Zara and Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   expects the company

fundamentals remain strong with solid global retail footprint  successful innovations  best in class loyalty program and digital offerings  Particularly  Starbucks is strengthening its portfolio with significant innovation in beverages and core food offerings We expect Starbucks  global comparable store sales or simply comps in the fiscal third quarter to be driven by significant menu innovations like introduction of a new fresh food concept  Mercato  in Chicago in April  The launch of the Midnight Mint Mocha Frappuccino  Emerald City Mule  Unicorn Frappuccino  and Cascara Lemon Sour is also likely to boost its revenue Starbucks  digital offering  Mobile Order and Pay  is also witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to be reported quarter as well as in 2017  Again  Starbucks introduced a new digital order manager or DOM in order to reduce traffic congestion during peak time  Addition of new restaurants  along with growth in Starbucks reward members  is expected to contribute to Starbucks s revenue growth in the to be reported quarter  The company had earlier revealed that it expects stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year  driven by mid single digit comps including accelerating comps in the U S The company remains focused on growing total G A below the rate of revenue growth and core G A at half the rate of revenue growth in the long run  In the last reported quarter  Starbucks had already achieved both targets  The trend is expected to follow in the fiscal third quarter as well However  a challenging environment in the U S  restaurant space might be a cause of worry for investors in the near term That said  sales leverage from positive comps growth  with lower selling  general  and administrative  SG A  and depreciation and amortization  D A  expenses  is expected to boost Starbucks s operating margins  thereby driving EPS growth For the third quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings

4  Starbucks Bought the Rights to the  Frappuccino  Beverage in 1994 Starbucks bought The Coffee Connection  a coffee chain prominent in the Boston area  in 1994  This allowed Starbucks to use  make  market  and sell the  Frappuccino  beverage that The Coffee Connection sold previously  As of 2012  Starbucks had an average Frappuccino sale of over  2 billion 
5  More than 20  of Starbucks  Orders in the U S  are Made Using Mobile Devices

As of June 2nd  2017  Starbucks has 25 981 stores operating worldwide on every continent except Antarctica  The first store outside of North America was in Tokyo  which opened in 1996  and it appears that the company will continue to expand internationally

Broadly speaking  I am seeing three different kinds of situations with these international indexes  Some of them had bullish breakouts which have since failed  Others are at extremely high prices relative to their broad histories  And others  like the Straits Times Index below  are getting repelled by overhead supply 

The Jakarta Index is  to my eyes  a jumping up and down  screaming short  Indeed  I dug up a few Indonesian ETFs  i was so excited about this chart  I mean    just LOOK at it 

Britain is no different  we can see the mid caps of the FTSE rolling over here 

With a similar situation in Germany 

Let s drink in the bigger picture of the very important DAX for a moment  The shorter term graph  already shown above  illustrates the rollover  Looking at the big picture  you can see why our bull friends should be feeling disappointed  because until recently  the German market had been sporting a powerful breakout  No longer  The breakout dangles now like a spent member  exhausted from attempts to plant the seeds of endlessly ascending prices into his lady fair 

Little different are things across the channel  as the French market breaks down 

  from what  too  had been a recent bold breakout for bulls  The ascent has turned to merde 

Throw a shrimp on the barbie  because your time is better spent enjoying a beach grill than waiting for the Australian market to rise   

  since it  like all the others  has turned around  not even managing to achieve a breakout in the first place

95078,316593,SBUX,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Starbucks  Domino s Pizza  McDonald s  BJ s Restaurants And Papa John s International,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 01  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Restaurants  Part 3  including Starbucks  NASDAQ        Domino s Pizza  Inc   NYSE         McDonald s Corp   NYSE         BJ s Restaurants  Inc   NASDAQ        and Papa John s International Inc   NASDAQ        

	Industry  Restaurants  Part 3

	Link  

	The restaurant industry s sales trends in recent quarters have been very challenging  as the Thursday report from Starbucks  NASDAQ       shows  This makes it prudent for investors to take a closer look at the dampeners threatening growth in the restaurant industry  Particularly  negative comps growth  given sluggish traffic trends along with rising costs  are taking the sheen out of restaurateurs 

	Below we discuss some of the downsides plaguing the restaurant industry 

High Expenses   Costs related to various sales and comps boosting initiatives along with restaurant re imaging expenses are hurting margins for companies likeDomino s Pizza  Inc   NYSE         Though these initiatives offer long term advantages  the costs related to them are expected to continue to dampen margins in the near term 

	Also  there has been considerable debate in the recent past over restaurant workers  wages  Workers at quick service restaurants claim that their employers  profits have not trickled down to them proportionately  which is leading to strikes for wage hikes  These incidents significantly hurt the reputation of restaurants  As a result  the companies are compelled to make minimum wage increases  which again lead to narrower margins  Moreover  higher labor costs due to a competitive labor market are expected to continue to keep profits under pressure 

	Restaurant management turnover is another critical headwind for operators as turnover rates are now at the highest level since the recession  according to a report by Black Box Intelligence  This is further compelling restaurants to either hike wages or provide benefits  again at the cost of margins  to retain or attract employees  Industry giants likeMcDonald s Corp   NYSE        and Domino s are working on these lines 

Soft Comps   Traffic Trends   Over the past few quarters  consumer behavior has been volatile and their willingness to spend on most goods  especially eating out  is showing signs of decline  Most of the restaurateurs are thus bearing the brunt of soft comps and traffic trends  In fact  the first quarter of 2017 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of negative comparable sales for the restaurant industry as a whole  per a report by TDn2K s Black Box Intelligence  Given the negative same store sales  there has been a lot of buzz about the restaurant industry hitting recession 

	But it is to be noted that the chief reason for the drop in same store sales is an increased number of new restaurants amid limited growth in eating out budgets  Moreover  per market analysts  diners are spending more per visit instead of visiting chain restaurants more often  which is hurting traffic  Also  increase in menu prices is at times preventing them from dining out  This unwillingness of Americans to dine out is thus pulling down restaurateurs  sales 

Slowdown in New Restaurant Openings   As the operating environment has become increasingly challenging  the decline in sales volumes have begun to impact the returns on new restaurant openings  As a result  some of the restaurants are slowing down their development plan significantly for 2017 

	Red Robin is one such company that has slowed down its unit growth plan and expects the first half of 2017 to be challenging BJ s Restaurants  Inc   NASDAQ        has also reduced the number of planned restaurant openings to 10 in 2017 compared with 17 restaurant openings in 2016  The reduction is due to the company s continued belief that the sales headwinds in the industry call for greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives 

	Such slowdown in their development plan in 2017 is likely to dent sales growth in the year 

Macro   Political Issues Company Specific Challenges   The restaurant industry is grappling with difficulties like intense competition in the U S   decelerating growth in Asia along with weakness in some parts of Europe  where economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc  Naturally  restaurateurs like McDonald s andPapa John s International Inc   NASDAQ

95083,316598,SBUX,Do Higher Prices Make Crypto Assets Crypto Currencies ,opinion,"There has been a surge of interest and activity in the what have been dubbed crypto currencies  According to the Economist  the market cap for this space is around  60 bln  and a founder of the one of the crypto to crypto exchange estimates daily turnover is as much as  2 bln 
Some of the price action is breath taking  The most well known is bitcoin  The price surged 140  last year and is up nearly as much already this year  Bitcoin accounts for around half of the market cap for crypto currencies and acts as the numeraire for others that are linked to it 
Bitcoin s appreciation has percolated into the mainstream media  but it is not the only one that appreciated dramatically  Ripple  for example  began the month with a market cap of around  2 bln  It was recently at  13 bln  Ethereum was worth about  700 mln in January and recently was valued at more than  8 5 bln 
There are several factors that may have spurred renewed interest in this space  Geopolitical uncertainty is running high  The seemingly unpredictable US President  who antagonized friends and foes  is escalating the long simmering confrontation with North Korea  has dropped the largest non nuclear bomb in Afghanistan  and launched a missile strike on Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons  European politics were perceived to be a grave risk  Chinese capital controls may have encouraged some interest in crypto currencies as a means to circumvent the restrictions  The recent cyber attacked demanded bitcoins as payment  and some reports suggested at least  80k of bitcoins were paid   Also  recently demand from Japan followed the inclusion of bitcoin under the country s regulatory framework 
Despite the increased activity and surging prices  the crypto currencies are currencies in name only  There remains a fundamental contradiction at the heart of crypto currencies  If they are an alternative to fiat currencies  though they are also typically not backed by gold or silver either   then they should be hoarded as a store of value  However  if they are hoarded  they cannot develop the critical mass of networking to fulfill the other functions of money  means of exchange  
The volatility also does not lend itself to being a store of value  another agreed upon the function of money   Consider that it is not unusual in recent days for the price of bitcoin to change by 2  3  a day  The US dollar  in contrast  rarely moves one percent day  and while bitcoin has appreciated by nearly 50  over the past month  the Dollar Index has fallen 2 3  
Crypto currencies appear ease to buy  but are more difficult to liquidate  Reports suggest that even modest amounts take days to complete  It appears that a small part of the float actually trades  and the supply is limited  There are around 16 3 mln bitcoins and 1800 new ones a day 
The rising price for crypto currencies and new interest does not alter our assessment  These are not currencies in any meaningful sense  To the extent that some retailers accept them is a bit of a novelty and marketing fluke  Some of the larger businesses  like Virgin  who previously indicated a willingness to accept bitcoins as payment  reportedly convert such payments into hard currencies  It is a gimmick  not confirmation of its currency status 
Leaving aside the questions of the origin of money  money  under conditions of modernity facilitates exchange  and is used to pay taxes and settle debts  When crypto currencies can be used to pay taxes  and or are generally accepted to retire debt  then their money status needs to be reviewed  Under the present condition  none of the functions of money are met by crypto currencies  They are hardly used as a means of payment  They are poor stores of value  They are not units of account 
People can still make and lose money trading them  They are part of the universe of paper assets  with their own niche rules governing supply  One can use some crypto currencies to conceal transactions  but do not expect the taxman  the landlord or grocer to accept them anytime soon  They are currencies to the extent that contacts on Facebook  NASDAQ FB  are friends and the  grande  means medium size at Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  ",2017-05-24,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/do-higher-prices-make-crypto-assets-crypto-currencies-200190988,200190988
95084,316599,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  Hits New 52 Week High  Should You Buy  ,opinion,"Shares of Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   gained more than 1 1  in morning trading Thursday  hitting a new 52 week high in the process  The coffee giant s stock has been a steady gainer for most of the year  but is Starbucks set to break into a new range  or should investors expect a pullback soon 
After closing at  61 89 on Wednesday afternoon  Starbucks shares gained as much 1 4  to a new 52 week high of  62 75 on Thursday morning  The stock has seemingly overcome what was a lackluster earnings report and a weak earnings season throughout the restaurant industry to push even higher 
Late last month  Starbuck reported adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share  which were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Quarterly sales of  5 29 billion were up 6  year over year  but nonetheless  these results missed our consensus estimate of  5 42 billion 
The company did report some positive trends  however  Membership in its My Starbucks Rewards program was up 11   while mobile payments represented 29  of U S  transactions up from 24  in the year ago quarter 
Global comps were up just 3   which was a slight slowdown from the 5  comps growth it reported in the previous quarter  Starbucks said that food sales contributed 2 points to comps growth in the quarter  and it appears that its new breakfast sandwich options are seeing some popularity 
But perhaps the weakest piece of the company s latest report was its full year guidance  Starbucks cut its non GAAP earnings target to a range of  2 08  2 12 from the  2 12  2 14 per share range that was previously announced 
As we consider whether Starbucks can break into a new range  we must consider a few key items here  First of all  SBUX has been trading in a relatively tight range over the past year  The stock hit its 52 week high of  62 75 this morning  but its 52 week low is just  50 84  In what has been a rocky retail restaurant landscape  we have certainly seen greater swings than that 
Furthermore  the ability of Starbucks to break higher will depend on the strength of consumer spending  The latest news from the Fed points to another rate hike this summer  which means the central bank is still confident about the state of the economy  Starbucks likely won t be affected by another small rate increase  but it does stand to benefit from a continuously healthy economy 
And finally  if Starbucks wants to establish a new range  it will need to prove that its new business initiatives are paying off   The company has doubled down on its loyalty and mobile payment platforms  and while its most recent report indicates that this is working  we still have a few other lingering questions 
Will Starbucks expand the delivery service that it s testing out  Will customers respond well to its replacement of all artificial flavors and colors with natural alternatives  Will the new Roastery concept  which could see customers paying  10 for a premium cup of coffee  take off   Also read   
For now  Starbucks may meet some resistance at the top of its 52 week range  but it does have several opportunities to break higher soon  This bull market has shown a reluctance to pull back on any healthy stocks  Nevertheless  SBUX remains a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

95113,316628,SBUX,Unilever  Kate Spade And Starbucks Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 28  2017   highlights Unilever  LON ULVR  PLC  NYSE        as the Bull of the Day  Kate Spade   Company  NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ        

	Here is a synopsis of all three stocks 

   

	After many years of underperformance  emerging markets are shining in 2017  We can see signs of improving economic growth in many parts of the developing world  This rebound has benefitted multinational giants that derive a significant portion of their sales from emerging markets 

About the Company

	Headquartered in London  UK  Unilever PLC  NYSE        is a multinational consumer goods company  They employ  169 000 people 

	The company has a huge portfolio of more than 400 well known brands including Dove  Lipton  Knorr and Ben   Jerry s  Emerging markets account for about 60  of their sales  Seven out of every ten households around the world contain at least one Unilever product 

Better than expected Results 

	The company reported better than expected results  thanks mainly to strong growth in emerging markets  except Brazil 

	Turnover increased 6 1  with a positive currency impact of 2 4   Underlying sales growth was 2 9  with price up 3 0  but volume down 0 1   Weaker than expected growth in North America and Europe was mainly responsible for decline in volume 

	The company saw strong pricing power in emerging markets  where sales growth was 6 1   with price up 5 3  and volume up 0 8   Price growth was particular impressive in Asia 

	 The first quarter shows growth once more ahead of our markets  This reflects our continued investment in both innovations and brand support  and reconfirms the strength of our long term sustainable compounding growth model   said the CEO 

	The management said they are on track to achieve 3 5  sales growth and at least 80 bps operating margin growth in 2017 

Rising Estimates 

	Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next year have increased to  2 44 and  2 78 respectively  from  2 26 and  2 44  before the results 

Returning Capital to Shareholders

	The company has been returning a lot of cash to shareholders  The dividend yield is 2 65  as of now  They raised their dividend by 12  earlier this month 

Kraft Heinz Bid

	Earlier this year  Unilever spurned a  143 billion unsolicited takeover offer from Kraft Heinz  Per Unilever  the deal did not make sense due to difference in their business models  Their spokesman   it was best to step away early so both companies can focus on their own independent plans to generate value  

The Bottom Line

95135,316650,SBUX,Austrian software firm raises  165 million to take on HPE and IBM in testing,news,"By Eric Auchard
FRANKFURT  Reuters    A little known Austrian software company is looking to snatch business from established players HP Enterprise  HPE  and  IBM   NYSE IBM  in the market for software testing tools  after raising  165 million from a U S  private equity firm 
Tricentis  founded in Vienna in 2009 and now headquartered in the Silicon Valley town of Los Altos  has emerged as a leader in automating how big businesses test and deploy software  despite having raised little outside funding previously 
On Monday  the company said it will receive  165 million in financing from Insight Venture Partners  a software focused private equity firm based in New York 
Previously  Tricentis relied on  bootstrap  funding from its own operations and had taken only one outside financing round  a  9 million early stage investment from Frankfurt based venture firm Viewpoint  now part of Kennet Partners  in 2012 
As part its investment  Insight bought out Kennet s stake in Tricentis and is now its sole outside shareholder  Pacific Crest Securities acted as financial advisor to Tricentis  it said 
The company  which counts 120 employees in Vienna  25 in the United States and roughly another 120 employees around the world  is looking to use its new financial backing to dramatically boost its sales efforts in the U S  market  where it employed just five sales people  CEO Sandeep Johri said 
 We can take Tricentis into becoming a global company   Johri told Reuters   We have all the ingredients to really scale it  
The company currently counts more than 400 corporate and government customers concentrated in Central Europe  the United States  Australia and India  They include Allianz  DE ALVG   BMW  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX    Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn   Orange  Toyota and UBS 
Tricentis ranks as the leader in software test automation by research firms Gartner and Forrester  a market where it has made in roads against established players HPE  IBM  and a variety of start ups by taking a highly automated approach to testing in contrast to older script based approaches of rivals  Johri said 
Demand for Tricentis tools is being propelled by the wider shift to  agile  programing techniques where software developers at big companies rely on small  informal teams and rapid development cycles to deliver software more efficiently 
Broadly speaking  the global software testing market is estimated to generate  34 billion in 2017  according to market research firm Nelson Hall  Companies such as HPE and IBM hold big chunks of this market with software testing lines that boast broad product offerings  but also date back up to 20 years 
By focusing on automating up to 90 percent of the work of software testing  Johri said Tricentis can take market share from more manual testing approaches of rivals  in what he says is a multi billion dollar slice of the software testing market ",2017-01-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/austrian-software-firm-raises-$165-million-to-take-on-hpe-and-ibm-in-testing-455020,455020

95138,316653,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  To Report Q2 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   is set to report second quarter fiscal 2017 results on Apr 27  after the closing bell The coffee chain giant s earnings were in line with the analysts  expectations in the last reported quarter  In fact  Starbucks met expectation in three of the last four quarters and delivered a positive earnings surprise in the quarter ending Sep 2016  resulting in an average positive earnings surprise of 0 46  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderStarbucks s operating fundamentals remain strong with solid global retail footprint  successful innovations  best in class loyalty program and digital offerings  Particularly  Starbucks is strengthening its portfolio with significant innovation around beverages and core food offerings Again  a revamped customer loyalty program  one of the most popular programs for any retailer now  is expected to boost customer engagement and thereby  accelerate comps beyond fiscal 2017 Starbucks  latest digital offering  Mobile Order and Pay  is also witnessing increasing usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to be reported quarter as well as in 2017 Now for the second quarter  though the company refrained from providing guidance  Starbucks anticipates global comp growth in full year 2017 in the mid single digit range  The first half of the year is likely to witness comps at the lower end of the range  with some improvement expected in the second half We expect global comps to be driven by significant menu innovations with the introduction of Sous Vide Egg Bites and the launch of its Macchiato products  The launch of ready to drink premium Teavana Craft Iced Teas is also likely to boost Channel Development division s revenue Again  addition of new restaurants is expected to contribute to Starbucks s revenue growth in the to be reported quarter With fiscal second quarter earnings around the corner  a major decision that Starbucks is dealing in recent times is the stepping down of Howard Schultz  Kevin Johnson  who served as a board member of the company for several years before joining its executive team two years ago  took over as CEO  Many analysts remain apprehensive about the decision and believe that this may hit the coffee chain in the near future  Despite the management shakeup  the company is forging ahead with its expansion plans  with focus on China While the company has been performing well  one dampening factor last quarter was the meager 3  growth in its comparable store sales or simply comps  The reported comps fell below the company s mid single digit guidance A challenging environment in the U S  restaurant space  along with Starbucks  recent sales performance  might be a cause of worry for investors in the near term  Again  stiff competition from companies like McDonald s Corporation   NYSE MCD   may also exert pressure on Starbucks  performance Meanwhile  for the second quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 52 cents a share  reflecting an increase of 13  year over year  while the consensus for revenues is at  5 82 billion  implying 8 4  year over year growth Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Starbucks is likely to beat

Customers will not only be able to experience an interactive tour  multiple brewing methods and tastings  but the Roastery will also feature  fresh baking on site courtesy of Italian baker Rocco Princi  
The massive Roastery is not the only thing that Chicago is getting from Starbucks  The company is also looking to open and incorporate Reserve brand shops in Chicago  The Reserve stores serve a traditional Starbucks menu in addition to a Roastery style coffee car and a number of specialty drinks

95167,316682,SBUX,5 Financial Myths You Should Ignore,opinion,"The financial terrain is strewn with robust fables cleverly disguised as facts 
The setbacks to financial security due to stock market returns never realized  the precious time and human capital necessary to make up for market losses  the ingenious data mining undertaken by populist gurus that want you to believe that stocks are a panacea  talking heads at big box brokerage firms disguised as fiduciaries who make fortunes convincing investors to feel silly for being cautious 
The deck is stacked against the retail investor 
Now more than ever 
As the majority  this marketing force cranks out stories and grinds down the painful past of market events into the mist of averages  They so want investors to forget the past 
And like the destruction of so many pebbles on this road  your retirement and other financial life benchmarks are left as rubble 
The tenacious nature of outdated financial tenets is never questioned 
These rules of thumb  words that should weigh a thousand pounds each  roll off the tongues of financial pros and layman alike as lightly today as they did generations ago 
Rancid bits of wisdom preached as gospel 
Thank goodness this isn t medicine 
Sickness would still be drained by leeches 
Let s bust open the stories and myths that place your efforts to build wealth in danger 
Myth  1   Compound interest will make you rich
Compound interest is the coolest story ever  but that s about it  
You so want to believe it 
And there was a time you could 
But not so much today 
Albert Einstein is credited with saying  compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world    Well  that s not the entire quote 
Here s the rest   He who understands it  earns it  he who doesn t pays it  
I m not going to argue the brilliance of Einstein although I think when it comes down to today s interest rate environment he would be quite skeptical  and he was known for his skepticism  of the real world application of this  wonder  
First  Mr  Einstein must have been considering an interest rate with enough  fire power  to make a dent in your account balance 
Over the last eight years  short term interest rates have remained at close to zero  long term rates are deep below historical averages and are expected to remain that way for some time 
Indeed  compounding can occur as long as the rate of reinvestment is greater than zero  but there s nothing magical about the  snowballing  effect of compounding in today s rate environment 
Most important  Compounding only works when there is NO CHANCE of principal loss  It s a linear wealth building perspective that no longer has the same effectiveness considering two devastating stock market collapses which have inflicted long term damage on household wealth 

What good is compounding when the foundation of what I invested in is crumbling 
Perhaps you should focus on the  he who understands it  earns it  he who doesn t pays it  
What does that adage mean to you 
Empowerment comes from living simply  avoiding credit card debt  and searching out deals on big ticket items like automobiles and appliances 
Don t give compound interest another precious thought 
If it comes along  consider it a great gift  A bounty 
Fine tune what you can control and that primarily has to do with outflow or household expenses 
I believe the eighth wonder of the world is human resolve in the face of economic reality post Great Recession 
Not compound interest 
Myth  2   Ditch that latte and energize your wealth
This advice is as bitter as the gas station brew that languishes in stained pots poised hot burners way too long 
Mega money celebs like Suze Orman and Dave Ramsey fall all over themselves with wisdom that attempts to make you feel guilty for waiting in the coffee line at Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   Listeners and readers of these two customarily are served swill like this on a regular basis 
A sweet topping on the sentiment is the tempting promise of consistent  annual investment returns of 10 to 11  in the market which is as far from reality as a broker without a sales quota 
Re directing  2 50 from simple  daily enjoyment into risk assets is not going to move your wealth needle but you may wind up with a heck of a headache from caffeine withdrawals 
Sorry 

In the book   Pound Foolish  author and financial blogger Helaine Olen investigates and busts open the myths of personal finance in an entertaining yet thorough tell all  Helaine discovered the latte factor surfaced as far back as 1994 in a Money Magazine article 
Touted by Suze Orman in her 1999 bestseller  The Courage To Be Rich  the perky  blonde top advocate for savvy personal financial choices was downright polemic about the subject  perhaps from overloading on caffeinated beverages whilst writing  
There s no doubt your uptown caffeine addiction is under siege by pundits who take themselves so seriously they believe they can peddle trivial watered down financial Pablum and you ll take it in  bask in epiphany  see a white light  Frankly  the only thing high octane about this wisdom is the egos it took to deliver it 
With close to three decades of financial services industry experience under my belt  I have yet to witness anyone pump an arm in victory over the wealth they ve accumulated by reducing coffee intake 
To place it in perspective   2 50 a day  invested for 30 years at 4  will provide a whopping  1 691  windfall  not adjusted for inflation  investment fees and charges 
What s your return on satisfaction for  2 50 a day  I think it s a bargain if a small purchase provides a big breather  peace of mind  and a recharge to carry on with important tasks 
Purchase the coffee  Buy a cup for me while you re at it 
Deprivation of simple pleasures is not a path to financial fulfillment  While you re partaking  place the time aside with pen and paper  put the smartphone away   and in a sentence  describe your ongoing relationship with money 
In simple sentence number two  identify a single financial action that achieves three digit success each month  In other words  if you re going to make a change  do it with gusto  Consider how can you cut  100 a month in expenses and direct the funds into an emergency savings account first  investments after you ve accumulated three to six months of living expenses in financial cushion 
Last  create a rule for the big stuff  This could be tough  and ostensibly may require that brain boost from that make or break your finances latte  
A tenet I created is featured in a new book titled  WORTH IT   by Amanda Steinberg a friend and fintech thought leader with a passion to help girls and women begin  improve and prosper in their relationships with money and debt 

 Never take on a mortgage that exceeds twice your gross income  
Or 
 House Mortgage   2X Gross Salary  

It s simple  To the point  If you earn  50 000 a year  the mortgage you obtain cannot exceed  100 000  This is not house price  It s the mortgage  For most it s going to mean a much greater down payment or smaller dwelling 
Obey and respect your personal formula  You re going to hate the boundaries and that means they ll be uncomfortable and successful if consistently followed 
Avoiding house poor will super charge your ability to build wealth  Now  that end result I have indeed witnessed from people I ve been grateful to counsel over the last three decades 
Myth  3   The Rule of 72
Where do I begin with this rule after I m done hemorrhaging from disappointment 
Recently  a well known financial showman was lamenting  stretching the meaning  again  and hitting sound effect buzzers over this pearl 
As a reminder  the Rule of 72 is a method to determine how long an investment will take to double given a fixed annual rate of interest  Just divide 72 by an annual rate of return 
When working with low rates of return  interestingly  the rule is precise  As returns increase  the rule gets less precise per Investopedia 
Yet  this rule is bandied about when it comes to stock investing where rates of return are anything but fixed 
As of the morning of this writing I had met with two couples who still maintain carryforward losses from the tech bubble that popped in 2000 
Perhaps  the Rule of 72 should be reworked to consider how long it may take to recover from investment setbacks 
Could it be plausible that it may take 72 years to fully utilize losses incurred during the tech bubble and the financial crisis 
Hey  that s nowhere near as farfetched as applying the Rule of 72 to volatile investments 
When you come across this rule again  and if you haven t yet  you will   I need you to remember that it only holds water for fixed  low rates of return which clearly rules out stocks 

Myth  4   I read somewhere that I should use the formula 100 minus my age to determine how much of my money needs to be invested in stocks
I abhor this creation 
What does age have to do with how much of a portfolio is allocated to riskier investments like stocks 
I m not willing to believe those who are younger should be more exposed or increasingly vulnerable to market risk than anybody else  when the reward from stocks is less for every investor going forward 
This rule is a clear disadvantage for all including beginners 
An investment allocation must be customized for your life  needs  and your sheer will to withstand volatility  Most important  it should be based on the valuation conditions that exist at the time you re looking to place dollars into the market 
I witness cookie cutter dogma blindly followed and money invested immediately regardless of where stocks are valued  Ultimately  the forward returns are anemic or wealth destroyed altogether 
Financial consultants and brokers have needles deep stuck in thought grooves  It s not just this rule per se  It s the belief that younger people must  MUST be more aggressive because they have time to weather through disaster 
Risk couldn t care less about how old you are  When the environment is favorable to take on greater risk for higher returns  then why be so focused on age 
How would you perceive my advice if I explained that you should fasten your seatbelt before driving however  your 18 year old child doesn t need to be concerned about doing the same 
I mean  after all  if there s an accident and injuries suffered  common sense tells me you may require a longer convalescence period  correct 
Not to be flippant  but I can make a formidable case that based on savings accumulated  earning power  and driver  investment  experience  that the older  wiser navigator may forgo the seat belt but the novice cannot  Never 
Think about it 
Myth  5   Stocks always outperform bonds
They do 
I heard this gem from an industry pro on CNBC the early morning of 3 17 
Hey if a financial guru proclaims it  and a powerhouse backs it up  it must be truth 

Over the long term  stocks do better  Since 1926  large stocks have returned an average of 10   per year  long term government bonds have returned between 5  and 6   according to investment researcher Morningstar 

Don t ask me why 1926 is so magical a launching pad for the formation of those colorful charts every broker whips out at every meeting  You ve seen them 
Perhaps  it s because there s limited data set and deciding to preach from an arbitrary point in time just feels right 
Seems plausible 
The gatekeepers of finance who make rules for investors and professionals to follow like lemmings  create pretty pictures that we re never to question 
Frankly  I don t care why 1926 is so special  Neither should you 
It s irrelevant to your situation and the cycle you re either accumulating or distributing wealth through 
The coolest tidbits of 1926 involve increased gangster warfare and bloodshed employed to establish territory for illegal alcohol distribution 
Depending on how I slice and dice the data  I can show a magnificent run for bonds when compared to stocks 

The chart above outlines the performance of the PIMCO Total Return Bond fund  an intermediate duration bond fund offering  and one of the most popular   compared to S P 500 beginning in 1999 
Why 1999 
Because I wanted to  that s why 
Appears to me that stocks don t always outperform bonds 
What do you see 
Silly myths  misused snippets of information  creative data mining 
They re all not so silly when your wealth is on the line 
Are they 
Things get serious 
And so many myths and stories need to die away

95169,316684,SBUX,Is JAB Holdings  Panera Buy A Win Win ,opinion,"JAB Holdings is buying fast casual restaurant chain Panera Breads   NASDAQ PNRA   for  7 5 billion including  340 million in debt  This is a 20 3  premium to Panera s share price on Mar 31  after which the news became public 

Who Is JAB 
JAB  owned by the billionaire Reimann family of Germany  has been growing its investments in the casual dining space  with a particular focus on U S  coffee and restaurant chains  Following its investment in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and Keurig Green Mountain and the merger of its D E  Master Blenders 1753 business with Modelez International s coffee business to form a company called Jacobs Douwe Egberts  in Europe   JAB became the world s largest coffee maker  Its other purchases in the space include Caribou Coffee  Peet s Coffee   Tea and bagel chain Einstein Brothers  it has been combining with Caribou with Einstein in some markets  
So JAB is a company that holds investments in other companies that largely operate independently 
What JAB Gets 
Despite the high price tag  it s worth noting that Panera operates in the very attractive fast casual segment of the restaurant industry  which has allowed it to grow revenue in each of the last 10 years  In recent years  the company has increased leverage to invest in a digital platform that allows customers to minimize waiting time by placing their orders in advance from their mobile devices 
They can also place a mobile order from their table  Catering  delivery and selling branded products are other recent initiatives that it has invested in  While there was a temporary hit to its results  earnings before non recurring items bounced back nicely in 2016 and the benefits of the investments will likely continue 
Panera has around 2 000 outlets throughout the U S  where it sells coffee  salads and sandwiches  as well as new items for the health conscious  JAB inherits all this plus the technology platform that it can extend to other businesses under its umbrella 
JAB partner and CEO Olivier Goudet issued a statement  in which he said   We strongly support Panera s vision for the future  strategic initiatives  culture of innovation  and balanced company versus franchise store mix  and  We are excited to invest in and work together with the company s management team and franchisees to continue to lead the industry  
What Panera Gets 
Expansion can be an expensive business and it can be funded with debt or equity  But Panera ended 2016 with close to a 60  debt cap ratio  which means raising further debt would increase risk  On the other hand  the company has steadily reduced its share count  with a corresponding positive impact on its EPS  so issuing shares to dilute earnings is probably not the way management does things 
Selling the company at a nice premium allows investors a nice profit on their holdings  Selling to a privately held company increases flexibility in operations since it can keep a lot of operational details private  That JAB has made such a good offer is validation of management s investment and expansion strategy  Moreover  Panera CEO Ron Shaich has said   Nothing will change  The management team and I will remain   And he does command around 15  of the voting power 
He also said   Our success for shareholders is the byproduct of our commitment to long term decision making and operating in the interest of all stakeholders  including guests  associates  and franchisees 
 We believe this transaction with JAB offers the best way to continue to operate with this approach  We are pleased to join with JAB  a private investor with an equally long term perspective  as well as a deep commitment to our strategic plan  
Industry Background
The rise of fast casual restaurants may be attributed to Americans growing more health conscious and favoring food items that cut the sugar  salt  fats and so forth  They are also willing to pay a little bit more for a little better quality than typical quick service places  but they don t want to spend quite as much as full service  particularly because grocery prices remain low  making eating at home the cheapest and healthiest option 
Full service  fast food and fast casual comprise around a 48   44  and 8  share of the overall market 
NPD expects full service restaurants to see revenue decline 2  this year  offset by a 1  increase in quick service for a flattish year overall 
According to The National Restaurant Association  fast casual revenue has grown 13 5  in 2014 and 10 4  in 2015  The restaurant industry as a whole  in comparison  grew only 5 7  in 2015 up slightly from 5 3  in 2014 
Last Words
JAB is obviously targeting the coffee market to shake Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   and Nestl  s dominance  The company has reportedly spent  40 billion dollars on acquisitions to build its position  so there s a good chance it will make a mark  As far as investors are concerned  the acquisition reduces investment options in what is an attractive area 
But you can still go for Bravo Brio Restaurant Group   NASDAQ BBRG    Diversified Restaurant Holdings   NASDAQ SAUC    or Papa Murphy s Holdings   NASDAQ FRSH    since they all have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  rating  see

	JAB partner and CEO Olivier Goudet issued a statement  in which he said   We strongly support Panera s vision for the future  strategic initiatives  culture of innovation  and balanced company versus franchise store mix  and  We are excited to invest in and work together with the company s management team and franchisees to continue to lead the industry  

What Panera Gets 

	Expansion can be an expensive business and it can be funded with debt or equity  But Panera ended 2016 with close to a 60  debt cap ratio  which means raising further debt would increase risk  On the other hand  the company has steadily reduced its share count  with a corresponding positive impact on its EPS  so issuing shares to dilute earnings is probably not the way management does things 

	Selling the company at a nice premium allows investors a nice profit on their holdings  Selling to a privately held company increases flexibility in operations since it can keep a lot of operational details private  That JAB has made such a good offer is validation of management s investment and expansion strategy  Moreover  Panera CEO Ron Shaich has said   Nothing will change  The management team and I will remain   And he does command around 15  of the voting power 

	He also said   Our success for shareholders is the byproduct of our commitment to long term decision making and operating in the interest of all stakeholders  including guests  associates  and franchisees 

	 We believe this transaction with JAB offers the best way to continue to operate with this approach  We are pleased to join with JAB  a private investor with an equally long term perspective  as well as a deep commitment to our strategic plan  

Industry Background

	The rise of fast casual restaurants may be attributed to Americans growing more health conscious and favoring food items that cut the sugar  salt  fats and so forth  They are also willing to pay a little bit more for a little better quality than typical quick service places  but they don t want to spend quite as much as full service  particularly because grocery prices remain low  making eating at home the cheapest and healthiest option 

	Full service  fast food and fast casual comprise around a 48   44  and 8  share of the overall market 

	NPD expects full service restaurants to see revenue decline 2  this year  offset by a 1  increase in quick service for a flattish year overall 

	According to The National Restaurant Association  fast casual revenue has grown 13 5  in 2014 and 10 4  in 2015  The restaurant industry as a whole  in comparison  grew only 5 7  in 2015 up slightly from 5 3  in 2014 

Last Words

	JAB is obviously targeting the coffee market to shake Starbucks  NASDAQ          and Nestl  s dominance  The company has reportedly spent  40 billion dollars on acquisitions to build its position  so there s a good chance it will make a mark  As far as investors are concerned  the acquisition reduces investment options in what is an attractive area 

	But you can still go for Bravo Brio Restaurant Group  NASDAQ           Diversified Restaurant Holdings  NASDAQ           or Papa Murphy s Holdings  NASDAQ           since they all have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  rating  see

95172,316687,SBUX,Here s Why McDonald s  MCD  Stock Just Hit An All Time High,opinion,"Who doesn t like the idea of ordering Egg McMuffins and chicken nuggets with a few taps on their phone  Not only do consumers like the sound of that  but it also seemed to appeal greatly to analysts and investors 
Shares of fast food restaurant chain McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD   have reached an all time high of  132 67  up 0 33   in midday trading Wednesday  The surge came from the back to back upgrades from Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   and Bernstein 
Earlier this week  both firms upgraded the fast food restaurant s stock to  outperform  from  market perform  on the company s decision of launching full mobile ordering at every U S  location   To read more about McDonald s mobile ordering and what analysts said  check out this Zacks article   
 More menu innovation and  over time  the experience of the future  mobile and kiosk digital ordering  will prove beneficial  as it has in other markets   Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore wrote 
McDonald s has been experiencing steady growth since the beginning of 2017  The value of the company s stock has grown over 9  year to date  Through a series of successful modifications to its menu  such as switching to fresh beef for its Quarter Pounder burgers in some stores and offering multiple sizes of its signature Big Macs  McDonald s has tried to appeal to the more health conscious customer 
The Invisible Line of Mobile Ordering 
While the reason for McDonald s digital approach is evident  it can be a double edged sword as the Seattle based coffee chain  Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX    has experienced 
Mobile ordering may lead consumers to believe they are skipping the long line of waiting  however  in reality  mobile ordering may have a longer wait time   
Both physical and online orders fall to the same in store employees to ensure food and drinks make it to customers  During prime times  stores are already filled with physical orders  Mobile orders don t automatically become the priority  Instead of skipping the line in stores  mobile consumers find themselves in another invisible line 
While Starbucks has rolled out new changes and training to fix the issue  McDonald s would have to put in a greater effort to avoid creating the invisible line  Mobile ordering becomes one more task that employees would have to juggle among in store orders  drive thru  and food handling processes on the fresh beef of the Quarter Pounders

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 53 cents on  5 85 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  15 million on the top
The combination of mobile pay  new menu items and an improved customer loyalty program boosted comps in 2016
McDonald s plan to expand the McCafe brand with  1 2 coffee poses a legitimate threat to Starbuck s core business that relies on high margin sales
Starbucks prepares to report fourth quarter earnings after Thursday s closing bell  This marks the first reports since Howard Schultz ceded the position of CEO to Kevin Johnson in early December  Despite the shakeup  the focus remains on expanding in international markets  namely China  increasing operational efficiency and releasing new menu items on a frequent basis  Thursday s conference call will ideally highlight many of these ongoing initiatives but also address the future under new management  The report itself must still meet analyst targets for revenue  earnings and same store sales to be deemed successful 
The Estimize community forecast earnings of 53 cents per share  16  higher than the same period last year  That estimate dropped 4  since Howard Schultz stepped down from the position of CEO  Analysts expect a 9  jump in revenue to  5 85 billion  reflecting a slight slowdown compared to third quarter comparisons 
Investor sentiment started to improve at the end of the year despite the drastic change at the helm  In the past 3 months  the stock increased in value by about 8   With that in mind  shares tend to stay flat in the 1 to 5 days following an earnings report
Popular initiatives such as mobile pay and a revamped customer loyalty program have proven to be the most popular programs for the retailers  The addition of a robust lunch menu in all of its stores along with popular seasonal items such as pumpkin spiced anything bode well  These moves help drive traffic and thereby boost comps for first quarter and beyond 
In the long run  Starbuck s expects China to outpace U S  operations in terms of size and sales  The chain opened 1 000 new stores in the region over the past year  bringing the total to 2 500  In total management hopes to open about 5000 stores by 2021 
Meanwhile  McDonald s  NYSE MCD  recent initiative to expand its McCafe brand puts pressure on Starbuck s near term outlook  The golden arches said it will start selling coffee anywhere between  1 and  2  roughly half the price of any Starbuck s beverage  Additional pressure from Dunkin Donuts and questions surrounding the new CEO Kevin Johnson create another layer of uncertainty

95203,316718,SBUX,Little Comfort In Uneasy Trade,opinion,"Trump still doing it his way
Headlines from Washington and a general unease in the US dollar are causes of the current strange  doldrum like malaise in currency markets so far this week  News that President Trump had fired his acting Attorney General after she said she wouldn t allow the Justice Department to defend Trump s order banning immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries could easily have driven some of this negativity but she was always going to be out of a job soon  she was an Obama appointee 
Pivot to stimulus should help USD
The transition into power is proving a little rockier for the 45th President than it has for most and hence the dollar s recent ambivalence  The travel ban  whatever you personally may think of it  is unlikely to damage the US economically with much significance in the short term  should it indeed stay as a 90 day program  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  have committed to employing 10 000 more people as a result of the ban  jobs are being created and the economic shot in the arm that a Trump administration could and will likely deliver is set to be felt in the coming quarters 
As we have said a number of times  the exuberance of the Trump election has now melted away and the dollar s future gains now depend on action from the Oval Office  Talk is cheap in politics and reality TV and therefore it is action that will drive additional gains in the greenback 
Fed could bolster the greenback
Tomorrow s Fed decision is unlikely to bring a rate hike but there is a decent chance that the policy statement that is released alongside any decision to hold rates will continue the recent hawkish tones from the central bank and we think that could easily be enough to engineer a rebound in the USD 
Brexit to be debated again

Once again it could be a case of additional clarity bolstering the pound as has been the case in the past few weeks 
This morning s Times newspaper is suggesting that the Government wants to invoke Article 50 on March 9th  Options markets will be pricing in additional volatility for that date  with little reason to in our opinion

Starbucks Daily Chart Technical Analysis
The stock did 5 waves from November low  50 84 and currently ended a 3 waves correction after it reached equal legs area  54 47    53 41   so now the stock will either resume the move higher from current levels or just bounce in 3 waves against the previous peak   12 13 2016   before doing a double correction lower  
Let s zoom out of the daily chart to have a better perspective   SBUX ended Double Three correction  7 swings structure  from 2015 peak so consequently the stock should either resume the main trend which is bullish or just do a 3 waves bounce which already started with the first leg from November low   The target area for Starbucks if it rallies from current levels to do a similar move to previous cycle would take it toward equal legs area  62 51    64 57 to end a Zigzag structure  abc    However the move can extend toward the 161 8 Fibonacci extension area and become the 3rd wave of a larger 5 waves impulsive move which means the stock will break above 2015 peak and make new all time highs  Recap
The technical analysis for Starbucks using Elliott Wave Theory is supporting a bullish move to the upside and we need further data to determine if it s going to break to new highs or just retest the previous peak and fail lower   Either way a short term 3 waves bounce is expected as long as last week low stays intact and the pivot at  50 84 low remain in place  ",2017-02-14,Elliott Wave Forecast,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-ending-correction-and-turning-bullish-200175654,200175654
95205,316720,SBUX,Hot Stocks  Under Armour Time To Buy ,opinion,"Under Armour Inc C  NYSE UA  is from Baltimore and so am I  They re hometown heroes and I like when they do well  Everybody in town has an opinion about our local sportswear giant  and the internet is wrapped up in the buzz as well  But not many people have good things to say 
If you re invested in  UA  the past year has been a nauseating slide into oblivion  This time last year  UA stock was selling for  83 share  The same share has  since then 
The problems are myriad and investors are fleeing  but new investors are wondering if these prices indicate that now could be a good time to invest in  UA for the very first time 
The question is  Will Under Armour rally and grow into the international giant their investors dream of  or is this the beginning of the end 
A Deeper Look at Under Armour
Kevin Plank founded Under Armour 21 years ago  The company introduced its first footwear line ten years later  The company bounded into household name status on the basis of their workout clothes  magical    materials  shoes  and home grown underdog status 
UA s star was on the rise  but many problems have arisen in the past year which have severely damaged its forward momentum  In recent months  we ve seen the CFO resign  for personal reasons   We ve seen Plank learn that kissing the Trump ring results in significant boycotts  We ve seen domestic retail sales become increasingly tenuous  We ve seen a flood of excess UA stock in discount bins around the country  Even the Steph Curry shoe was a dud 
Under Armour needs a drastic change of course 
So what s going well for Under Armour  Despite the signs that Americans are souring to the brand  a potential death knell for apparel and other commodities   UA is dramatically expanding sales overseas  International revenue increased 55  and footwear increased 36  last year 
But these revenue numbers don t overcome the fact that UA has operated with  two years in a row  The company currently has a 43 85 P E ratio  which does nothing to console current shareholders  Consumer tastes are fickle  and they re currently trending away from UA 
Is Now the Time to Buy  UA 
Not for me 
Under Armour s domestic business is a mess  Trying to recover from the effects of excess stock flooding the market  UA wants to refocus as a high end apparel brand  But if the brand just isn t cool anymore  why would the consumer pay more a premium for their clothes 
So it is with apparel and commodities  With multiple businesses selling essentially the same product  cool means everything  UA doesn t have the long history to view boycotts as simply a bump in the road  not like a Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  anyway  This latest foible may be recoverable  but I m not sure we ve seen the bottom of this stock drop yet  If we hit single digits  I might bite  but what kind of a future would Under Armour have at that point ",2017-02-22,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hot-stocks-–-under-armour-(ua)-time-to-buy-200176462,200176462
95228,316743,SBUX,Fever spreads  China s property speculators descend on inland cities,news,"By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo CHANGSHA  China BEIJING  Reuters    Property speculators in China are looking for the next big thing beyond the country s major cities  And they may have found it in the inland city of Changsha  Shanghai  Beijing and Shenzhen have been the hottest property markets for most of the year  although smaller places such as the coastal city of Xiamen have been heating up too  Now there are signs the wave is reaching further inland  Until now  Changsha s home prices have been one of the lowest among central provincial capitals due to ample land supply  a more leisurely economy compared with its bustling coastal cousins and subdued local demand  But prices have jumped in recent months  catching many local property agents by surprise   Prices have risen 2 000 yuan   299 84  per square meter on average in the past two months  That s almost a 30 percent rise from July   said Hu Yi  marketing manager at Central Courtyard  a residential project in Changsha targeting mid  to high end buyers  The sharp price rises in many cities are raising some uncomfortable memories of the last big run up in home values  which resulted in a property bust earlier this decade  China s southern boomtown of Shenzhen  with tight land supply and a fast growing tech industry  has led the rally for most of the year  But it lost its top slot in August to the second tier city of Xiamen where prices were up more than 40 percent from a year earlier  Prices rose in 64 of 70 major cities from the previous month  the highest in two years  government data shows  There are even flickers of life in Zhengdong  a district of the inland city of Zhengzhou that became a symbol of China s property excesses because of rows of empty housing developments  China property investment is also rising  Shortly after the August home price data was released  a parcel of land sold for a record price in southern China  the Shanghai Securities News reported  Mortgage demand is driving loan growth in July and August  Indeed  the value of new mortgage loans is almost 70 percent of the value of total property sales in 2016 so far  the highest since mid 2009  UBS analysts said  citing figures from data provider CEIC  The government wants to keep the property sector as a driver of economic growth as other areas splutter  so has an incentive to allow healthy price rises  Still  some are concerned  The central bank s chief economist  Ma Jun  was quoted earlier this month calling for steps to  curb excessive bubbles  in the property sector  UBS Chief China Economist Wang Tao said it was time the government tightened credit conditions for homebuyers  The price gains are a  self fulfilling prophecy   she said   You buy when everyone is buying  that s the mantra  But at one point  prices are too high to find anyone to buy from you  and returns from rent are too low   The government s  primary concern  should be to  limit the liquidity  in the property market  Rosealea Yao  an economist at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing said after the price data was released  When China s property market saw similar price gains a few years ago  47 cities imposed restrictions on home prices  This time around only half a dozen have done so  she said  One factor driving speculators into the property market is moribund stocks  Benchmark indexes   have fallen 13 15 percent this year  although some of China s commodities markets are rallying strongly  CHANGSHA S SPECULATORS After Xiamen  the inland city of Hefei saw the second biggest price gains in August  as out of town investors from Shanghai swooped in   Now property speculators complain that even Hefei is too expensive  so they are searching for the next opportunity and have found Changsha  agents and buyers said  Chen Xiaochuan  marketing manager with local residential property project Xiang Shore Park said speculators make up about a third of homebuyers in Changsha  They are mainly from first tier cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen  property agents said  but are also from Hefei  where home prices have doubled since the start of the year   They saw what happened in Hefei and thought to themselves  maybe Changsha will be the next Hefei   Chen said  Despite claims by some property agents that the inventory of empty homes is dropping to record lows in Changsha  empty looking apartment buildings are still a common sight  China Index Academy data shows there are 126 945 homes  or 13 46 million square meters  sitting empty in Changsha   I came here alone  but met many fellow Hefei property buyers along the way   40 year old Hefei businessman Zhou  who only gave his surname  said as he listened to a sales pitch for a new development  Zhou said he already owns three properties in Hefei and some in Nanjing and Hangzhou  two cities near the east coast  GHOSTLY NO MORE  In Zhengzhou  the first Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  cafe in the Zhengdong district opened this month  surrounded by empty  shiny office towers and residential blocks  The shop manager said business would pick up in coming months  thanks partly to the cafe s proximity to three residential property projects  One of them is The Park  a high end project developed by a subsidiary of Haima Automobile Group    We have already bought an apartment here  and we are looking to buy a second one   a woman who goes by her last name Wang told Reuters just outside of project s sales office  Home prices in Zhengdong district have risen two thirds this year to 25 000 yuan   3 747 56  per square meter on average  sales manager Xu Zhou said  That is still less than half of Shenzhen s average price of  8 104   We see a flux of buyers from people outside of Zhengzhou  especially those from smaller cities in the same province   Xu said  who apologized for his raspy voice  which he said was due to one too many sales pitches  And for Zhang Liyang  a sales manager at Greenland Group s  600606 HK  Zhengzhou office  the price surge in the past few months came as a surprise  which meant missed opportunities as she was entitled to employee discount rates  
 Even we didn t expect the prices to go up this much   she said    1 6 67 yuan ",2016-09-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/fever-spreads:-china's-property-speculators-descend-on-inland-cities-429514,429514

95233,316748,SBUX,Would You Pay  10 For A Cup Of Coffee  Starbucks Thinks You Will,opinion,"Over the years  customers have watched Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   transform from a standard corner coffee chain to a sprawling multinational empire with a diverse range of concept stores  Loyal drinkers can now head to Starbucks for everything from a cup of black coffee to a glass of wine and a sandwich 
Starbucks recently announced that it is doubling down on some of its more upscale store experiences  For one  the company will be expanding its  Roastery  concept  which debuted as a larger store in the company s hometown of Seattle that offers small batches of premium drinks in a tasting room style atmosphere 
Starbucks said that it plans to open 20 to 30 Roasteries around the world  with Shanghai and New York options coming first 
The company also revealed plans to transform its  Reserve  brand of premium coffees into a new caf  concept  The Reserve shops will be about twice as large as a standard Starbucks store and will offer pricier caffeinated beverages as high as  10 a cup for certain coffee drink and alcoholic drinks 
One of the running jokes that surrounds Starbucks is the idea that a crazed coffee drinker can easily drop  6 to  7 on a single beverage by upgrading everything  Most people spend less than that when they head in for their daily cup  but it s not out of the realm of possibility 
Starbucks isn t joking around here though  These  10 beverages are meant to be more than just a drink  they re meant to be an experience  These new concept stores aren t about getting your necessary caffeine  they re about doing something  Think of it as the difference between grabbing a Bud Light at your local pub and going into a local craft brewery for a tour and samples 
You really want to know how serious Starbucks is about these new concepts  Long time CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down from his role in order to focus solely on the expansion of the Roastery and Reserve stores 
The company also has some cool stuff planned with Italian bakery and pizzeria chain Princi  which it invested in earlier this year  Starbucks detailed more of its plans at its bi annual investor presentation in New York City recently  Also read     
For now  investors will continue to look at total revenues  earnings  and comps when trading SBUX  and it s unlikely that these premium concepts will add much value for shareholders immediately  However  Starbucks is clearly looking to establish several new long term brands that could become part of the overall company experience eventually

95234,316749,SBUX,5 Stocks With The Largest Downside Risk This Week,opinion,"Each week Forcerank runs a variety of games covering different industries  What we have found  is that the largest change in average user rank is indicative of swings in price action for the week  This week the biggest declines featured popular names like Nvidia and Amazon 
Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN    Hardware  It s difficult to imagine Amazon    on a list of losers regardless of what the situation might be  but this week Forcerank users dropped the retailers average ranking from 1 7 to 4 1  Amazon still ranks highly in the hardware contest but such a large drop in average ranking signals near term volatility 
At  760 per share some investors have grown concerned that Amazon can t sustain trading at 175 times TTM earnings  The stock also took a beating recently following Trump s shocking election victory  Amazon s CEO  Jeff Bezos  and President Elect Trump haven t seen eye to eye but the main concern is how Trump approaches trade policy 
Any restrictive tariffs or embargoes will put pressure on Amazon s operations around the world  From a technical standpoint the recent losing streak spurred a bearish crossover in the MACD along with the 50 day moving average eclipsing the short term 20 day average 
NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA    Semiconductors  Nvidia    posted one of the largest beats  percent wise  this earnings season amongst all the companies in the S P 500  so it seems odd to find it on a list of downward trending companies 
But as the saying goes   what goes up  must come down   and that s where Forcerank users stand with Nvidia  Its run at the top came to an end this week after NXP Semiconductors NV  NASDAQ NXPI  took the top spot in the Semiconductors space  The average user rank also dropped to 4 3 after idling in the mid 2s for the past couple weeks  After its most recent run the stock is trading at about 50 times TTM earnings and about 32 times forward earnings 
Its up for debate whether that could be considered overvalued given the multiple of some technology companies  Regardless  key technical indicators support additional downside on the horizon  A bearish crossover in the MACD along with two unfilled gaps below insist the chipmaker must retrace some of its gains from the past 30 days 
Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX    Restaurants  Starbucks    was dealt a massive blow this past week after its renowned CEO Howard Schultz decided to step aside from his position for a smaller role in the company  Many believe this will turn out to bite the coffee chain as it did nearly 10 years ago  which is why we are seeing a drop in average user rank this week 
Forcerank users gave Starbucks an average rank of 4 7 this week compared to 4 the previous week  Meanwhile McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  recent initiative to expand its McCafe brand will put pressure on the near term outlook of Starbucks  The golden arches is claiming it will sell coffee anywhere between  1 and  2  roughly half the price of any Starbuck s beverage 
Salesforce com Inc  NYSE CRM    Enterprise Software  Salesforce    dropped from the second to fifth this week despite any specific news events driving price movement  Its likely a cyclical movement after the company reported strong third quarter results in November 
Shares have since dropped to  70 after eclipsing  80 per share  This movement started with a bearish crossover in the MACD  which now sits in negative territory  and steadily declining on balance volume  All this caused the stock to break below multiple levels of support as it looks to close a gap in the mid  60 range 
Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI    Restaurants  Darden Restaurants     like many other restaurant stocks  received a massive bump following Donald Trump s shocking victory  but fundamental weakness and a technical breakdown looks as if this run is coming to an end  The stock is currently trading in the upper Bollinger Band and is slowly approaching a relative strength index of 80  the threshold indicating overbought conditions 
Meanwhile a MACD on the verge of a bearish crossover could send the stock tumbling in the coming days  Darden s volume profile for the past 6 months is consistent with a  60 share price suggesting a 25  downside ",2016-12-09,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-with-the-largest-downside-risk-this-week-200169059,200169059

Starbucks already counts some 23 000 locations around the world and plans to add another 12 000  alone  A new chain called Cofix  TA CFX   run by wealthy entrepreneur Avi Katz  is tiny by comparison but that might not be the case for long

Although both sell essentially the same items   coffee  cappuccino and baked goods   Cofix s business model couldn t be more different from Starbucks  Cofix eschews all the pomp and circumstance of modern coffee houses and instead focuses on a single important variable  price 
At around  1 per cup  or less  depending on the country   its gourmet coffee undercuts competitors like SBUX by 75  or more  The trade off is that there s no seating  no table service and no room   most of Cofix s locations look like streetcars parked in busy areas  So while its no frills approach won t appeal to everyone  the company has made huge progress in targeting cost conscious consumers 
According to Bloomberg    Traditional  coffeehouses charge six to nine times more for a medium cappuccino than the  0 40 the ingredients cost consumers  according to data from Allegra   Cofix is willing to settle for much lower margins but much higher volume   like McDonald s  NYSE MCD  did when it revolutionized the fast food industry 
So the next time you take a sip of that  5 latte  imagine a future where a nearly identical product costs 80  less  It might be coming sooner than you think

95258,316773,SBUX,How To Find Stocks Poised To Grow Dividends Now,opinion,"Dividend investing is always one of the most popular areas in the stock market world  But the term  dividend investing  covers a pretty wide range of topics  and it can mean a lot of different things to various investors 
In an effort to find the best dividend stocks though  many investors zero in on high dividend payers for exposure  However  for many investors  this might not be the best approach  as a look to dividend growth could be optimal instead  That is because companies in this market segment are often more disciplined than their high yield peers and can offer outperformance as well 
To help investors navigate this market segment  I spoke with Eric Ervin  the CEO of Reality Shares to get some insights in the latest edition of the Dutram Report  Ervin s company has a series of funds that utilize their  DIVCON  system which seeks to find S P 500 companies that are most likely to increase their dividends within the next year 
This technique is the basis for several of the company s funds including LEAD  DFND  and GARD and it focuses on a number of quantitative factors to find the stocks most likely to increase dividends  This includes free cash flows  buybacks  recent dividend actions  as well as other fundamental factors  Some key examples of recent companies that meet these criteria include Nike  NYSE NKE   Tyson  TSN   and Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   to name a few 
This approach is in contrast to the world of  dividend aristocrat  ETFs which includes funds such as SDY  VIG and NOBL  These funds just focus on companies that have consistently raised dividends in the past  while the DIVCON approach offers up more of a forward looking take  a twist that could be of interest to some investors out there 
Lastly  we also discuss the company s DIVS ETF  DIVY   This unique product seeks  exposure to the growth rate of expected dividends  and can be thought of as a play on the dividend swap market  This is a pretty novel approach  and we detail in the podcast why this technique might make for an excellent dividend play for some investors 
This was certainly an informative podcast  and a must listen for investors focused on the dividend market  so make sure to listen to this edition of the Dutram Report for a guide to this underappreciated market segment  And for more news and insights into the world of ETFs  make sure to be on the lookout for the next edition of the Dutram Report  and check out the

95262,316777,SBUX,Starbucks News   10 Coffee  Its Next Five Years  Princi Is A Go,opinion,"As Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   co founder Howard Schultz steps down from his role as chief executive officer  he will shift his focus to building up the company s  Reserve  brand stores  The goal is to have as many as 30  in big cities all over the world  in addition to the flagship Reserve in Seattle 
Starbucks has added Reserve bars to some locations already in New York City  According to   one such caf  in Manhattan s Upper East Side offers a  10 cup of coffee brewed in glass siphons   10  flights  of Reserve brews  and nitro cold brew  which is coffee that has been infused with nitrogen gas  making it creamier and richer than regular iced coffee 
These Reserve rooms are an answer to the growing competition of boutique  upscale coffee chains like Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle  where prices are set slightly higher than a normal Starbucks menu  For instance  a 12oz latte at an Intelligentsia CoffeeBar goes for around  4 50  whereas Starbucks charges  3 25  Thus  Reserve Roasteries have some room to play round with higher prices 
Starbucks  Reserve stores and any  10 coffee menu item will probably be a success  The company was the first to introduce the world to high quality coffee  and many people will likely continue to spend a lot of money on coffee going forward 
Its Next Five Years
Speaking at the company s bi annual investor presentation in New York City  Schultz announced financial targets for Starbucks for the next five years  The plan includes revenue growth expectations of 10   earnings growth in the range of 15  20   and mid single digit comparable sales growth at existing store locations for each year 
 If Starbucks were a 20 chapter book  I still think we are in chapter four or five Our industry leading pipeline of innovation is more robust than ever   commented Schultz 
New store openings will help this growth projection  Starbucks currently has around 25 000 stores today  and sees expansion by another 12 000 by 2021  Stronger new store performance in the U S   brand awareness  and mobile driving traffic should all contribute to this aggressive and robust five year plan 
Princi is a Go
Earlier this summer  Starbucks announced its investment in high end Italian bakery and pizzeria chain Princi  and on Wednesday  Schultz confirmed it  The deal allows Starbucks to develop and operate all new Princi locations outside of Italy and in the U S  Rocco Princi founded the bakery and caf  in 1986  and today  it operates just five locations in Milan and London 
The first Princi locations will be in Seattle  Chicago  and New York City  and by next year  Starbucks Reserve stores will begin serving Princi baked goods  There will be ovens used to bake breads on sight  as well as bakers who will work solely with food and baristas who will remain solely focused on coffee  The company is even developing a special coffee designed to pair specifically with Princi foods 
This partnership with Princi will help Starbucks boost its food sales  a quickly growing facet of its business that has yet to fully blossom  In the past  Starbucks  food had drawn complaints about taste and consistency  and its acquisition of the La Boulange brand in 2012 helped the company turn around its food business  The Princi deal should enhance it even more

years  Additionally  the company revealed its intention to drive earnings by 15 20  as well as mid single digit comps growth each year  To achieve this  Starbucks plans to open roughly 12 000 new stores around the world by 2021  taking the total tally to nearly 37 000 stores  This apart  the company will continue to boost the Starbucks Experience globally We note that only last week  the company announced that Chief Executive Officer  CEO   Howard Schultz  will step down from his post   effective Apr 3  2017   and assume the role of executive chairman  Thereafter  Schultz will shift his focus to innovation  design and expansion of the high end Starbucks Reserve Roastery concept globally  Kevin Johnson   the current President and Chief Operating Officer   will then take over as CEO Inside the HeadlinesChanging the Premium Coffee Experience  The company will be focusing on its high end coffee stores  such as the Starbucks Reserve Roastery  which offers premium coffee roasted in store  Starbucks opened the first such shop in Seattle in Dec 14  and the massive sales performance of the store has encouraged it in believing that the new concept can fuel the next wave of revolution and accelerate growth Starbucks now plans to open 20 to 30 more of the high end stores in prominent cities around the world  In fact  the company intends to open the next Roastery in Shanghai in 2017  one each in Tokyo and New York City in 2018  The company is also looking to open a fifth store in Europe  which will be announced early next year Furthermore  the company plans to build up to 1 000 smaller stores reminiscent of the Roastery  under the  Starbucks Reserve  brand  barring the on site roasting  which will include items from Starbucks  new Italian food partner  Princi  The first of these new Reserve stores will open in Seattle and Chicago during the second half of fiscal 2017  Additionally  the company expects to open separate Princi stores in Seattle  New York and Chicago in late 2017 and in early on 2018 Starbucks is also remodeling several of its over 24 000 stores with Reserve branded coffee bars  where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and range of brewing methods as at the Reserve stores Premiumization of Offerings  The company is focusing on premiumization strategy via new product breakthroughs to drive pioneering customer experiences  Per Starbucks  the  premiumization  of its offerings has already begun with beverages like the Nitro Cold Brew  Flat White  and the limited time Smoked Butterscotch Latte  The Cascara Latte  made with the fruit of the coffee cherry  is impending in Jan 2017 Starbucks is concurrently innovating and expanding its food menu to latch onto the lunch daypart sales and build on existing breakfast daypart momentum  In fact  Starbucks intends to double food growth over the next five years China  Starbucks is particularly banking on sales in China  where it plans to open 5 000 of the 12 000 new stores by 2021  adding to the 2 500 stores it already operates in the nation  In fact  the company also expects its fast growing China business to eventually outpace its U S  market In order to further extend customer involvement and loyalty in China  the company entered into a partnership with Tencent Holdings Limited to bring social gifting and digital payment experience on WeChat  China s leading mobile social communications service  in early 2017 Technological Innovation  Starbucks holds a leading position in digital  card  loyalty and mobile capabilities  The company boasts 12 million Starbucks Rewards members and 8 million customers who use mobile pay  with one out of three using Mobile Order   Pay  Moreover  in the last year  over  6 billion loaded onto prepaid Starbucks Cards in North America We note that a new ordering system  My Starbucks Barista  which makes use of artificial intelligence and lets customers place orders via voice command or messaging  is set to be another growth driver for the company  The new feature  available on the Starbucks app  will be beta launched on iOS in early 2017 Expansion of Leadership  Starbucks is the industry leader in premium single serve  premium packaged roast and ground coffee  and Ready to Drink products  The company is well placed to grow its share of these markets  both in the U S  and globally The company expects its channel development segment to bring in an incremental  1 billion in revenues  boost operating income by 75  and double its ready to drink business outside the U S   over the next five years  Starbucks is in fact expanding its ready to drink options  The company plans to launch bottled Starbucks Cold Brew Cocoa and Honey with Cream in select markets across U S  in spring 2017 What s Up at Starbucks Starbucks concluded fiscal 2016 on a solid note  Last month  the company reported better than expected results in the fiscal fourth quarter with earnings and revenues increasing 30 2  and 16   respectively on a year over year basis  The improvement was buoyed by strong sales and margin expansion  up 180 bps   partially offset by increased partner investments Industry leading innovation is driving the company s core business and providing an edge over competitors  Meanwhile  higher sales in the U S  and China Asia Pacific division have counterbalanced a slowdown in the Europe  Middle East  and Africa   EMEA   segment We note that Starbuck s shares have been outperforming the broader Zacks categorized Retail Food   Restaurant industry over the past six months  While the stock has gained nearly 6   the broader market had witnessed a dip of around 1  in the same time period Our TakeThough Starbucks continues to outperform the broader market  its growth has slowed down recently and traffic trends have remained soft of late Thus  a challenging environment in the U S  restaurant space  along with Starbucks  recent sales performance  might be a cause of worry for investors in the near term  However  the company s five year growth plan could be helpful in the long run and aid in stimulating the brand Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderStarbucks currently has a Zacks Rank  3   Hold   Some better ranked stocks in this sector include Papa John s International Inc    NASDAQ PZZA    McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD   and The Wendy s Company   NASDAQ WEN    All these

95285,316800,SBUX,What s Driving Starbucks  Success ,opinion,"I joined  Thursday evening to chat about Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX  s fourth quarter earnings 
Overall  this was a very solid quarter for   and the most profitable in the company s history  SBUX beat analyst estimates on both top line sales and earnings per share  Guidance for next year was a little weaker than expected  but not enough to offset investor enthusiasm for what was a very solid quarter 
Starbucks is still expanding its empire   it opened a location in its 75th country this past quarter and expanded its total store count by about 3    but what is more important is that same store sales rebounded 
Two quarters ago  Starbucks disappointed on same store sales  calling them an  anomaly   So investors were certainly happy to see that this was true  Store traffic was flattish  but the average ticket size was up 4   far outpacing inflation  A shaky economy hasn t stopped coffee drinkers from getting their Starbux fix 
Perhaps the most interesting development is the success of Starbucks  loyalty program  which runs on iPhone and Android and allows custormers to pre order and skip the line  About 1 in 20 U S  transactions is now made using the Starbucks smartphone app  That is a major development because it allows Starbucks to make far more efficient use of their staff  More efficient use means less overall demand for labor 
This is the future of food service in general  with minimum wages rising in much of the U S  The app basically makes the cashier redundant  Today  you re skipping the Starbucks cashier  Tomorrow  it will be McDonald s    
So  even if the trend towards higher minimum wages continues  food service companies will defend their margins by making more efficient use of labor  and ultimately hiring a lot fewer people

95286,316801,SBUX,Mild Morning Gains Fade By Friday Afternoon,opinion,"U S  stocks finished lower  though a steady October nonfarm payroll report that was highlighted by stronger than expected wage growth stirred a modest early advance  The morning gains for stocks faded as December Fed rate hike expectations remain elevated and political uncertainty continues to linger ahead of next week s Presidential election  Treasuries advanced  crude oil prices and the U S  dollar were lower and gold was mildly higher 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  declined 42 points  0 2   to 17 888  the S P 500 Index decreased 3 points  0 2   to 2 085 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 12 points  0 2   to 5 046  In moderately heavy volume  899 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 2 0 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq  WTI crude oil declined by  0 59 to  44 07 per barrel  wholesale gasoline lost  0 04 to  1 38 per gallon and the Bloomberg gold spot price moved  2 31 higher to  1 305 12 per ounce  Elsewhere  the Dollar Index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was 0 2  lower at 96 95  Markets were lower for the week  as the DJIA lost 1 5   the S P 500 Index decreased 1 9  and the Nasdaq Composite was 2 8  lower 
Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX  53  reported fiscal 4Q earnings per share  EPS  of  0 56  one penny above the FactSet estimate  as revenues grew 16 0  year over year  y y  to  5 7 billion  roughly in line with forecasts  4Q same store sales rose 4 0  y y  below the expected 4 9  increase  SBUX issued full year EPS guidance that came in below estimates  Separately  the coffee chain raised its quarterly dividend by 25 0  to  0 25 per share  Shares finished solidly higher 
Activision Blizzard Inc   NASDAQ ATVI  42  posted 3Q EPS ex items of  0 52  north of the expected  0 42  with revenues rising 58 4  y y to  1 6 billion  matching expectations  ATVI issued 4Q guidance that missed forecasts  while raising its full year outlook  Shares were solidly lower 
Kraft Heinz Co  NASDAQ KHC    KHC  84  announced 3Q earnings ex items of  0 83 per share  versus the expected  0 74  as revenues rose 2 4  y y to  6 3 billion  due to the merger of Kraft and Heinz  roughly in line with forecasts  KHC traded lower

Shares of Whole Foods Market Inc   NASDAQ WFM  29  reversed solidly to the upside following a Bloomberg report  citing people familiar with the matter  that the company s largest shareholder has met with potential activist investors to discuss making sweeping changes to the upscale grocer  including replacing management and exploring a sale of the company  Per the report  a Whole Foods spokeswoman responded that it values the strong and open relationships it has with its shareholders  and as discussed on yesterday s earnings call   we are focused on pursuing the right strategies to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term  
October job growth steady and wage gains top estimates 
Nonfarm payrolls    rose by 161 000 jobs month over month  m m  in October  versus the Bloomberg forecast of a 173 000 increase  September s gain was upwardly revised to 191 000 jobs  The total upward revision to job gains in August and September was 44 000  Private sector payrolls increased by 142 000  versus the forecasted 170 000 rise  after increasing by an upwardly revised 188 000 in September  The Labor Department noted that employment continued to trend up in healthcare  professional and business services  and financial activities  while adding that Hurricane Matthew affected parts of the East Coast during the month 
The unemployment rate dipped to 4 9  from 5 0   in line with estimates  while average hourly earnings grew by 0 4  m m  topping projections of a 0 3  increase  and September s upwardly adjusted 0 3  gain  Wages are up 2 8  y y   the largest gain since June 2009  The labor force participation rate dipped to 62 8  from 62 9   but was up from the 62 5  rate a year ago  Finally  average weekly hours remained at September s unrevised 34 4 hours level  matching forecasts 
The report preserved elevated December Fed rate hike expectations  while the stronger than expected wage growth figures are likely fostering optimism that the consumer  which makes up the lion s share of U S  economic output  could be poised to support the impact of a rate increase from an abnormally low level  As noted in the recent Schwab Market Perspective  Looking Past the Election  economic data continues to support a sluggish growth narrative  although there are glimmers of hope that we could see at least a modest acceleration in 2017  The U S  consumer appears to be gaining some confidence and wage growth has already shown signs of picking up as the economy approaches full employment  We believe  after several false starts  the Fed will actually follow through on a rate hike this time around  Perhaps equally as important will be the message the Fed sends regarding what it may be looking to do into 2017 
The trade balance    showed that the deficit came in at  36 4 billion in September  compared to the  38 0 billion estimate  August s deficit was revised to  40 5 billion from the  40 7 billion posted earlier  Exports rose 0 6  m m to  189 2 billion  while imports fell 1 3  to  225 6 billion 
Treasuries were higher  with the yield on the 2 Year note declining 2 basis points  bps  to 0 78   while the yields on the 10 Year note and the 30 Year bond fell 4 bps to 1 77  and 2 56   respectively  Bond yields remain choppy in the wake of a recent rally that has come courtesy of some upbeat economic data that has bolstered the case for a December rate hike  which was also preserved with Wednesday s unchanged monetary policy decision from the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC

95290,316805,SBUX,Romanticizing The  Gig  Economy,opinion,"Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  insists that we call its medium serving  grande   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  tells us that many who we know just casually are  friends   People don t have a couple of part time jobs  where they don t qualify for benefits or protections for job related injury or vacation  they have  gigs   
Our species has an uncanny ability to turn a necessity into a virtue   Labor law is replete with efforts by business to deprive people of protections and benefits that are required for employees but not independent contractors  Businesses are always looking to reduce input costs  especially now in this challenging economic environment  The technological advances increase the span of employers  command  control  and communication  The weakness of organizations that seek to protect employees  including office workers  leaves this group particularly vulnerable  
Our changing consumption patterns  including on demand services  products and collaborative platforms can lend itself to a different relationship between the human labor necessary and the owners  or controllers  of the other factors of production  including capital  proprietary software and distribution  clients   However  the magnitude of the change may not be as great as some the utopians suggest  It does not end of capitalism  as some like the British journalist Paul Mason suggests  Post Capitalism  A Guide to Our Future   
Capital is strong enough to further squeeze labor  but it is out of weakness that it feels compelled to do so   The  gig economy  is largely about increasing the size of the contingent workforce  Just like businesses shifted the burden of managing retirement savings from defined benefits to defined contributions  they are now exploring how far they can shift from long term to short term contracts to secure labor inputs   
Far from being the end of capitalism  the shared economy and gigs reinforce and extend it  Consumers have capital equipment  automobiles  that can be put to use in the market economy  e g  Uber   Hotels offer hospitality services  Airbnb  for example  facilitates households competing in this space  In fact  early studies suggest that online freelance marketplaces may be gaining workers that previously were in similar brick and mortar businesses 
The widely cited McKinsey Global Institute report recently found that less than a third of those with  gig  jobs embraced it as a lifestyle  McKinsey called them  free agents   Just as many take gigs reluctantly or see no alternative  The study found 40  participate casually  This could include selling things on eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  or Craigslist  It used to be doing your neighbors taxes  babysitting and dog walking 
 McKinsey offers a broad definition of these independent workers   It only excludes those workers that were formerly employees  but whose function has been outsourced to external companies that now employ the workers  dubbed  fissured workers   self employed people with many employees  and perma temps on long term or continuously renewed contracts  which are more common in Europe  Under its definition  there are 54 68 mln independent workers in the United States  out of a nearly 160 mln civilian labor force 
It seems like nearly every generation has a segment that does not want to be tied to the factory or office life   In the 1950s  this was the beatniks  In the 1960s  the counter culture told young people to  tune in  turn on and drop out   Getting a gig is hardly radical or transformative 
In a period when there is a skills shortage after a large decline in the labor force participation rate  the flexibility of gigs may bring people back into the workforce as independent workers   Don t think of gigs  though  as solely for the Millenials  Gigs are well suited for seniors  stay at home caregivers along with young people  Indeed  some preliminary research finds the older generation cohort participating in the  gig economy  as much as the younger generation  
Sometimes to make ends meet  a parent might have  moonlighted   which was an extra job on top of their day job  Now it is called having a gig  A single parent with a young child may work for a catalog order company a few hours a week from home  A person who lost their full time employment in the past may drive a taxi while looking for a job  Now they are a driver for one of the companies that directly competes with the taxi services 
In September and October  there were 5 9 mln American workers that have part time jobs for what the bean counters call  economic reasons   which means they would prefer full time positions  They were working part time because their hours had been reduced or because they could not find full time work  The difference between these people and those with gigs is a fine line and one that appears to be evolving  Lawsuits against some new companies in the gig economy  like Uber  will spur new rules that will stake out a clear definition of gigs and the rights and responsibilities of the labor provider and the owner or controller of the other factors 
The US Labor Department has yet to include so called gig workers into the monthly employment survey  This is going to change  By the middle of next year   gigs  will be included  
The growing use of independent workers could bring economic benefits   It can incorporate resources that were taken out of the market economy  This applies not only to durable consumer goods  cars  apartments  computers  but also to people themselves  It may boost labor force participation  It may provide new opportunities for the unemployed  As consumers  timely services can more easily be procured  It may also improve efficiency  transparency and productivity   
On the other hand  how the costs will be distributed is also important and cannot simply be reduced to an economic calculus   The asymmetries of power between the social class will generate an asymmetrical distribution of the costs  
The gig economy will likely be an important front in the struggle between businesses  workers and government   Rather than being the cutting edge of a new period of enhanced freedom and decentralization  contingent workers must be partly engaged  The issues may revolve around benefits and income security  There are social costs that are borne by companies that purchase their labor inputs at prices that allow  and require  the employees to seek government  taxpayers  assistance 
In the short run  the expanding use of contingent workers speaks to the flexibility of labor and institutional arrangements   That flexibility may enhance the US economic resilience and fascilitate that divergence with other major economies that have more rigid institutions and stronger worker protections  UK Prime Minister May  for example  has hired Tony Blair s former policy chief to make  certain that employment regulation and practices are keeping pace with the changing world of work   The review includes the growth of part time work and the growing use self employed staff  
In the long run  the risk is that the rise of the contingent workforce may contribute to the disparities of income and wealth that rot the system from within as sure and as quietly as termites undermine a house  The older social contract gave people property in their jobs  That social contract is broken and the property rights one had in employment has been confiscated  In 1944  Hayek warned that the increasing role for government and planning was the sure Road to Serfdom  However  here at the start of the 21st century  it is not the State  but the capital offensive to lower labor costs  that are turning our brothers  sisters and parents into serfs    contingent anytime anywhere workers with no benefits or modern protections from the ruthless and unforgiving market ",2016-11-08,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/romanticizing-the-‘gig’-economy-200163473,200163473

95306,316821,SBUX,Week Ahead  Central Banks Meetings  U S  NFP  More Earnings,opinion,"After the U S  and U K  economies showed better than expected growth in the third quarter  investors turn their attention to monetary policy actions  Four major central banks will meet the coming week  Fed  BoE  BoJ  and RBA   and while most of them remaining accommodative or planning to ease further  only the Federal Reserve is set to swim against the tide  Here s what to watch the week ahead 
The Fed to send a clear message
With 9 days remaining to the U S  presidential election  the Fed is expected to keep markets calm and stand pat on rates when they announce policy on Wednesday  The two day meeting will most likely set the tone for December where markets are pricing more than 70  chance for a hike 
Latest round of economic releases supports the idea of tightening policy with growth bouncing back from a weak first half in 2016  jobs added to the economy averaging at 191 000 in the last three months  and more Americans buying new homes  The improvement in data will likely keep the dissenters from October s decision in favor of hiking  but I think it s very unlikely for other members to join 
I believe the statement that follows the meeting will clearly indicate that a rate hike in December is coming  similarly to what we saw in October 2015 when the Fed stated 

In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting  the Committee will assess progress both realized and expected toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation

95307,316822,SBUX,Opening Bell  Focus On U S  Election  Economic Calendar This Week,opinion,"by Eli Wright
The upcoming U S  election and important economic reports will drive this week s FX  commodity  and stock markets  Here s what to watch in the week ahead 
US Presidential Election
At the close of US markets last week  news broke that the FBI had discovered new emails that might be relevant to its completed investigation of Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server  Friday s thinly traded markets fell on the news with the S P 500 falling  31  and volatility jumped by 2 29  to reach a two week high 
Since markets have largely already priced in a Hillary Clinton win  any signs she s losing ground to Donald Trump could significantly increase volatility in the currency markets as well since Wall Street hates the uncertainty that a Trump presidency represents  Indeed  on Friday  the US Dollar Index  which earlier in the day had risen as high as 98 92  fell 0 62  to 98 31  If Trump s chances of victory should rise in the polls over the course of the week  it could potentially boost the Russian ruble  while further depressing the Mexican peso which dropped by 1 1  after the news broke 
This morning  Asian and Pacific markets began the week with increased volatility and mirroring US markets on Friday closed lower  The Nikkei 225  Hang Seng  and Shanghai Composite each closed down around 0 1 percent  European markets saw a shaky openi  with the Stoxx Europe 600 starting the day down 0 4 percent  The FTSE 100  CAC 40  and DAX were all down 0 1 percent in early trading 
 Economic Calendar
Though the election seems to be dominating the news as the week begins  a number of key economic announcements in both the US and UK will likely drive the markets as the week progresses  both the Fed and the Bank of England have interest rate announcements coming up  In addition we ll get a look at important economic metrics for the US including 

On Tuesday  ISM Manufacturing PMI  forecast at 50 3  slightly higher than the previous 49 4 
On Thursday  ISM Non Manufacturing PMI  forecast at 53 0  compared to the previous 51 4 
On Friday  November 4  the always anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls report  forecast at  175K

Any unexpected negative surprises from these reports could potentially reduce the chances of a rate hike in December  and might send the dollar plummeting 
Commodities
The OPEC fueled will they won t they freeze production saga continues as major oil producers  including Iraq Iran and Russia  insist that they should be exempt from any deal  insuring that no production freeze agreement will emerge any time soon  Oil and gas prices are reacting accordingly  Crude oil and Brent are down as of this writing  We believe oil prices will continue to hover around the  50 barrel mark for the near future  or drop slightly 
Gold is up to  1 275  having risen to an almost 4 week high on Friday  As a safe haven asset  any increased chances of a Trump victory could move the precious metal higher 
Equities
As mentioned above stocks took a hit on Friday  The Dow  NASDAQ   and S P 500 were all down  0 05   0 50   and 0 31  percent  respectively

95308,316823,SBUX,5 Stocks To Watch  COH  GILD  EA  FB  SBUX,opinion,"Coach  NYSE COH 
Consumer Discretionary   Textile  Apparel and Luxury Goods   Reports November 1  before the open 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  0 45  one cent above the sell side consensus and 11  higher than the same period a year earlier  That estimate has decreased 6  since Coach s last quarterly report  Revenue is anticipated to increase 4  to  1 066 million  in line with Wall Street  The stock is up 9  since the beginning of the year 

What to Watch  For the last two quarters  Coach has been able to produce double digit growth on both the top and bottom line as it undergoes a major brand revitalization  While revenue growth is expected to slow this season  there are still some bright spots as the luxury goods maker heads into its best quarter of the year  the holiday season  The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman in 2015 has been very positive as the Coach strives to expand its portfolio of brands  New campaigns featuring  it girl  Gigi Hadid have played well with younger millennial consumers  a demographic that Coach has struggled to attract in the last few years  Headwinds for the quarter still include a stronger US dollar as the company expands globally  and a value conscious consumer that isn t necessarily spending on high end items right now 
Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD 
Health Care   Biotechnology   Reports November 1  after the close 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  2 88  7 cents higher than Wall Street and down 9  from the same period last year  That estimate has decreased 9  since Gilead s most recent report  Revenue is anticipated to decrease 9  YoY to  7 48 billion  as compared to the sell side s consensus of  7 39 billion 

What to Watch  Gilead Sciences has turned a fruitful 2015 into a troublesome 2016 after a string of weaker than expected earnings reports  Shares are down 27  year to date as investors jump ship to better performing companies  A large portion of this draw down has been driven by weaker sales of its flagship Hep C products  Harvoni  Sovaldi and the recently launched Epculsa  These treatments were primarily credited with the company s double digit gains in 2014 15 and are now being blamed for negative growth in fiscal 2016  In the second quarter  the group of drugs recorded a 18 5  decline primarily due to lower sales of Harvoni  Harvoni sales were down a resounding 29  as new competition  mainly from Merck  NYSE MRK   seize its market share  Weak performance from the Hep C franchise was not only disappointing in the U S  but Europe as well 
This sharp downturn caused management to cuts its outlook for the year in the range of  29 5 to  30 5 billion from  30 31 billion  Nevertheless some of these losses should be somewhat offset by its growing HIV business which includes a handful of already established treatments  Also  a robust pipeline positions Gilead for an easy bounce back in the near future  Setbacks from HCV will nonetheless be the primary talking point from this quarterly report 
Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA 
Information Technology   Software   Reports November 1  after the close 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 43  in line with Wall Street s consensus  Meanwhile  revenue expectations of  1 085 billion are  6M below the sell side consensus  Expectations have fallen 30  since last quarter  putting YoY growth expectations at  31  for EPS and  5  for sales  Despite negative expectations for Q3  shares are up over 16  for the year 

What to watch  Electronic Arts started the year on a hot streak thanks to the overwhelming success of Star Wars  Battlefront  That has since cooled off and Electronic Arts is coming off a weaker than expected FQ1 2017 printing a 53  decline on the bottom line and 2  on the top  The second quarter unfortunately doesn t fully cover the annual release of FIFA and Madden video games  These games are often two of highest grossing games year after year and typically carry quarterly results  but investors will have to wait until the third quarter
Meanwhile  smartphone owners can expect to see new versions of FIFA  Madden and even a Star Wars based game  This is a new facet that Electronic Arts had previously never recognized but is now a huge source of revenue  The biggest factor  however  is growth in digital sales and in game purchases  This new wave of digital offerings are not only convenient they also generate the highest margins  If Electronic Arts can continue to see strong growth in digital offerings then expect to see more favorable price movement 
Facebook  NASDAQ FB 
Information Technology   Internet Software   Services   Reports November 2  after the close 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings of  1 03 per share on  7 01 billion in revenue  5 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  91 million above on the top  Compared to a year earlier  earnings are expected to increase 78  with revenue jumping 55   EPS estimates have been pushed up by 7  since the last quarterly report  and revenue estimates have come down 4   The stock has risen 25  YTD 

What to Watch  Facebook continues to top earnings and revenue expectations driven by strength in its mobile platform and strategic acquisitions  The upcoming quarter will be the first to feature sales figures from the highly anticipated Oculus Rift  Virtual reality is expected to be one of the fastest growing sectors  providing a new source of revenue moving forward  This should help offset the blow Facebook is about to take after years of over inflating its video metrics  This type of mistake will certainly have a short term impact on advertising revenue 
Additionally  SnapChat is on pace to become a legitimate threat to Facebook s core business  sooner rather than later  The Evan Spiegel run company currently boasts 60 million daily users in the U S  and Canada  about a third of what Facebook has in these markets  Even so  FB still recorded 1 71 billion monthly active users  MAUs  last quarter  an impressive 15  YoY increase despite a maturing business here in the US  Daily active users  DAUs   an even better measure of user engagement  came in at 1 03 billion  or a 22  increase 
Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX 
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports November 3  after the close 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  0 56 on  5 69 billion in revenue  above Wall Street by 1 cents on the bottom line and in line on the top  Compared to a year earlier  this reflects a 29  increase in earnings and a 16  increase on sales  Earnings estimates have increased by 2  since the last quarter  while revenues have fallen by 1   The stock is down 11  since the beginning of the year 

What to Watch  Comments around Starbucks global expansion are expected to take center stage during Thursday s report  The company currently has 24 000 stores in 70 countries worldwide  with increasing store counts in China being the main focus  Last quarter featured a 4  gain in comparable store sales  and an even higher 7  in China  A revamped customer loyalty program earlier this year is proving to be the most successful initiative  In April  Starbucks updated its reward program which now rewards customers for every dollar spent instead of the number of visits  making it one of the most popular loyalty programs of any retailer  The coffee chain also has introduced wildly popular mobile initiative  such as mobile order and pay which reached 5  of US transactions last quarter ",2016-10-31,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch:-coh,-gild,-ea,-fb,-sbux-200161745",200161745

95312,316827,SBUX,5 Stocks To Watch After The Market Closes Today,opinion,"GoPro Inc  NASDAQ GPRO   GoPro is heading into its latest report with low expectations of making a pronounced turnaround  The action camera maker has had its shares of ups and downs  mostly downs  since its 2014 IPO  most of which has been driven by mounting losses and decelerating revenue growth  Its product lineup was largely to blame for its woes but investors were recently given reasons to be hopeful heading into the holiday season  At a September event  GoPro announced the next iteration of its Hero line and its very first drone  the Karma drone  The Hero 5 hit shelves soon after the event while consumers are still waiting for the Karma drone s highly anticipated debut  Regardless  both products have been well received and even attracted a slew of stock upgrades  Shares are virtually flat in the past 6 months after suffering significant losses earlier in the year

Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   Activision has been the most promising of the three video game publishers  The company is firing on all cylinders and should have no problem topping expectations this quarter  Strong revenue growth is expected to be driven by a number of new and old sources  They include past successes such as Overwatch  Call of Duty  COD  and Candy Crush with more recent ones  including expansions for World of Warcraft and Destiny  Activision is much more than a video game publisher though  The company has made efforts to develop a more broad based media portfolio which features e sports  The Call of Duty World Championships in early September was the most viewed COD event in history  surpassing more than 20 million views  With so much working in Activision s favor  the bar might be set too high this quarter

FOMC policy statement should produce the  big  headline  But there will be serious competition arriving from other sources To mid week  trader s focus should be on any language in the FOMC statement    and at Yellen s press conference on Wednesday    which telegraphs a 25 basis point hike at the Dec  14th meeting Markets price over 70  odds of a December hike  and under 20  odds of a NOV one this week   Bloomberg says 59 out of 76 forecasters expect the Fed to hike before yearend After the FOMC statement and Chair Janet Yellen s press conference on Wednesday  traders then hear from Vice Chair Stanley Fischer  He speaks just after markets close on Friday  A huge number of lesser Fed speeches are also planned during the workday on Friday Second  a heavy line up of macro data can be shortened to these big hitters   Tuesday  U S  ISM manufacturing hits  Expect an unchanged reading  Wednesday  ADP s private nonfarm payroll report hits  Also  Eurozone manufacturing PMIs hit  Thursday  The U S  ISM services PMI hits  Friday  Federal nonfarm payrolls and the Labor Dept  s household survey hits traders with the latest on U S  job growth  the unemployment rate and wages Indeed  a large negative U S  jobs surprise would cast doubt upon a December Fed hike  I assign that possibility very low odds   given strong  2 9  GDP growth out last week Third  don t overlook U S  earnings season  It enters its 2nd most active week  132 firms on the S P 500 are set to report  after 176 firms reported last week  Activity swiftly falls off  with 31  20  15  and 9 reports due on further out weeks

utterly sure of this  No need to bookmark  The week is going to be a noisy and nasty political week heading into the November 8th U S  Presidential election A widely followed polling consensus website assigns 79  odds to a Clinton Presidency  even after the latest email snafu  The site s forecast is for Clinton to win Florida s 29electoral college votes  However  Trump polled four points ahead of

95342,316857,SBUX,As China s consumers tighten belts  retailers cut jobs  offer discounts ,news,By Adam Jourdan and Donny Kwok SHANGHAI HONG KONG  Reuters    Retailers in China are shedding staff  slowing expansion plans and seeing stocks pile up in warehouses as shoppers tighten their belts   a major headache for a country that has pinned its hopes on consumers to drive economic growth  With that growth running at its slowest in a quarter of a century  China s consumption patterns are changing  with wealthy middle class households trading down from up market to more affordable brands  and poorer families paring back on even basic purchases  China s top 50 retailers saw sales fall 6 percent at the start of the year  and sales of basic goods from noodles to detergent grew just 1 8 percent at the end of last year  down from over 9 percent just three years ago  according to Kantar Worldpanel data  The weak sales of even cheap household goods underlines the challenge for China  desperate to get its 1 4 billion people to spend and give some fresh impetus to the economy   Maybe before  if I wanted something I d just go and buy it  Now I only buy things I really need   said Yang Shunjie  28  a Shanghai based client manager at a state owned firm  who earns between 10 000 15 000 yuan   1 500  2 300  a month  He said he also shops more online where prices are cheaper and will wait for end of season discounts to buy new clothes  This is a problem for sectors from retail to luxury and even fast food  where many international names have banked on continued growth  Procter   Gamble  N PG   whose China products include Pampers diapers and Tide laundry detergent  said in January its sales were  significantly down  compared with 2014  Infant formula maker  Mead Johnson Nutrition  Co  N MJN  said price competition and a shift to smaller shops and online hit sales   We are seeing shifts within retail  High end luxury goods have had a very good few years  but that s coming to an end  Tastes are changing   said Mark Williams  chief Asia economist at Capital Economics in London  Westpac s most recent consumer survey showed sentiment at its lowest since

some 3 000 new stores in China by end 2020  But retail executives and consumer goods makers said China s slow growth is punishing the sector and forcing many to cut back  focus on smaller  faster growing cities and offer more discounts   We are struggling to adapt as sales move online or to small mom and pop stores   said a senior sales executive at a major Western consumer goods firm   At the moment  it s carnage   He said inventory levels at some clients had jumped to as much as nine months  from a normal average of around two weeks  For retailers and consumer goods brands alike  that

95343,316858,SBUX,Long term thinking could become focus for a new index fund,news,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK  Reuters    S P Dow Jones Indices is negotiating with asset managers to license its new index  which it says represents companies that focus on the long term rather than the current quarter 
The Long Term Value Creation Global Index could be the basis for one or more mutual funds  exchange traded funds or structured products  Vinit Srivastava  S P s senior director of equity strategy  said in an interview last week 
S P created the index over the past year in response to concerns that company executives  under pressure from hard charging board overseers and the earnings calendar  have put short term wins ahead of building businesses that thrive over time 
Designed with the help of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board  the index consists of companies with what S P considers strong corporate governance plans and solid financial numbers 
 We have to do things to stop that short term focus   said Poul Winslow  managing director at Toronto based CPPIB  He said the index relied on a scoring system that draws out important details about how companies are governed 
The CPPIB and other institutional investors have committed  2 billion to private funds tracking the index 
S P  a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc and the largest provider of indexes tracked by U S  listed ETFs  has not decided whether such a license would be exclusive to one asset manager 
Srivastava declined to name any bidders or comment further on the discussions  Bringing such a product to market could take several months of planning and regulatory approvals 
Asset managers have already had something of a hand in the effort  Focusing Capital on the Long Term  a group that advocated for the index and was founded by CPPIB and management consultant McKinsey   Co in 2013  counts senior management from fund managing companies BlackRock Inc  NYSE BLK  and  State Street  Corp  NYSE STT  among its members and advisers 
DEFINING LONG TERM
To come up with its index  S P starts with the largest public companies and allocates money to those that produce a hefty return on equity and seem to develop strong policies on legal compliance  environmental reporting and philanthropy  Such practices  advocates like Winslow said  can predict performance better than balance sheets 
Among the top companies in the index are health insurer  Cigna Corp   NYSE CI   coffee chain  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX  and industrial conglomerate 3M Co 
However  the index does not screen out companies that spend cash buying back their own shares  even though such repurchases have been criticized by investors who would rather see the money go to long term ventures like capital expenditures or workforce development 
One of the long term index s top holdings  retailer O Reilly Automotive Inc  is also one of the largest components of the S P 500 Buyback Index 
Srivastava said companies with good governance rules tend to do buybacks  for the right reasons  
The index s focus on corporate governance does not necessarily mean a focus on social issues  even though pension funds often consider such criteria 
Two of the index s top 10 holdings are tobacco companies Reynolds American Inc  NYSE RAI  and  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc  which socially conscious investors often screen out ",2016-03-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/long-term-thinking-could-become-focus-for-a-new-index-fund-391388,391388

95391,316906,SBUX,Mixed Outlook For Lululemon Stock,opinion,"lululemon athletica inc  NASDAQ LULU  started out in 1998 as a simple clothing store in Vancouver  Canada that sold yoga wear  In 2008 it hired the former co president of Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  International  Christine Day  to be its CEO  Since then Lululemon has grown to be a ten billion dollar business selling athletic clothing  The brand has become a household name  In 2016 Lululemon Athletica has many segments including company operated stores as well as direct to consumer service  It has a line of apparel and accessories for women  men  and female youth  Its line of products includes pants  shorts  tops and jackets designed for healthy lifestyle activities and athletic pursuits such as yoga and running  Lululemon has approximately 360 company operated stores in the United States and Canada 
A few years ago its customers complained that the pants  was selling was too transparent  It appeared that the pants passed quality control when they shouldn t have  This raises concerns over how much the company values quality in its products  The clothing lines that Lululemon offers is meant to represent high end material and look stylish  Since customers are paying  70 or  80 for each pair of pants they expect it to be non see through  The transparency scandal resulted in about 17 percent of the yoga pants being recalled by Lululemon  which is a large amount for a clothing company 
In terms of market sentiment it appears that investors are split on the outlook of lululemon Its last quarterly financials revealed it made  0 30 of earnings per share  which was more or less in line with the Wall St  consensus  It earned  495 5 million for that quarter  which slightly beat the consensus estimate of  487 7 million  Comparable store sales  including its online business  grew 6  to start off the company s fiscal 2016 after spiking by 11  in the previous 3 month period  Its CEO Laurent Potdevin and his executive team have projected similar results for the following year ahead  According to its own forecast the company should continue to grow its revenues in the mid single digits range 
Lately the company has sacrificed some profitability in exchange to drive more traffic to its stores and online shopping portal  Its gross margin slipped from 48  a year ago to 47  now  Its operating margin is still considered high for a clothing company but the question is how much longer can they keep this up  By comparison  in 2011 its margin was 57  of sales  As costs for the business increases due to wage inflation Lululemon will have to find new ways to add more value and charge higher prices for their products to maintain a competitive margin 
Over the next several years some analysts are project Lululemon to reach  4 6 billion in revenue and  600 million in profit  This is a possibility but one factor that could thwart its business growth is the challenging competition against other high level athletic clothing brands such as Nike  NYSE NKE  or Under Armour Inc  NYSE UA   According to a recent Reuters stock report  there are 33 analysts covering LULU at the moment  The consensus among them is a  buy  rating  however 14 out of the 33 have a  hold  rating or less  Based on the current earnings projection I would consider LULU to be slightly overvalued by 15  or so  LULU does have strong earnings  but not enough to justify its current Price to Earnings ratio of 40x  But on Tuesday this week one investment analyst at KeyCorp  NYSE KEY  boosted LULU s target from  80 00 to  85 00 per share  The new price target puts a 10  premium over the stock s current price  KeyCorp currently has an  overweight  rating on the apparel retailer s stock  Some people believe LULU still have room to expand  while others would rather stay away from the yoga apparel company ",2016-08-05,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mixed-outlook-for-lululemon-(lulu)-stock-200146250,200146250
95392,316907,SBUX,Growth Stocks   Cheaper By The Day,opinion,"Are you a value investor  If you said  yes   how would you feel about buying an  18 stock with a P E  Price Earnings  ratio of greater than 100x and a Price Sales ratio of 14x for a company that three years earlier was started in a garage  This may not sound like a value stock  but had you bought this stock at the initial public offering  IPO   it would have been a screaming bargain   priced at less than 1x P E ratio  based on this year s earnings estimates 
You may be surprised to know  this company with a meager  18 IPO share price is now worth  9 192 per share today  if you adjust for three stock splits   Yes  that s correct  a  50 900  return  If you are wondering to which stock I m referring  I am talking about Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  
Incredibly  ever since Amazon went public in 1997  the CEO Jeff Bezos has managed to command the start up e commerce company from  31 million in revenues to  121 billion  with a  b   on an annual basis in 2016  a  389 000  increase  
Discovering the next IPO that turns into a  363 billion behemoth is easier said than done  and unfortunately these types of companies are a rare breed  Even if you are lucky enough to identify these diamonds in the rough early in their growth cycle  very few investors have the fortitude and discipline to continually own the stocks through the perpetual volatility  i e   peaks and valleys  
The good news is  although you may be unable to find every unicorn out there  you can still apply the same principles and characteristics to any growth stock you invest in  In order to prudently achieve outsized returns  one must identify innovative market leaders that have gained some type of sustainable competitive advantage  which will serve as the profit and cash flow growth engine for the stock over the long term 
If a company does not have a unique advantage over industry competitors  they will likely be unable to compound earnings growth   the key to becoming a big winner  Albert Einstein  Nobel Prize winner is credited with identifying compounding as the  eighth wonder of the world   and without compounding there will be no gigantic results 
Amazon may be a rare breed  but there are plenty of other examples of so called  expensive  stocks that get dismissed or fall through the cracks as they explode in value to the stratosphere  Consider Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   which at the time of its IPO in 1992 was priced at a very rich P E of 52x  Sound expensive  Actually  this was a greatest offer in a generation 
Adjusted for stock splits  the    in the most recent trading session Starbucks shares closed at  55 90  a  20 600  increase  Similar to Amazon  had you purchased Starbucks shares at the IPO price  you would have been paying less than a measly  eye popping 1x P E ratio based on 2016 earnings 
Alphabet Inc   NASDAQ GOOGL   formerly Google  is another case of growth stock appearing pricey on the outside  but really a value of a lifetime on the inside  The hype surrounding the Google IPO was so palpable in 2004  the stock priced at a relatively nose bleed level of 60x P E level  approximately 
The unconventional auction bidding method to buy the initial shares made investors even more skeptical  Suffice it to say  the greater than  1 600  gain has once again shown that investors can reap handsome rewards  if they do thorough enough due diligence and ignore the illusory big ticket IPO prices 
What most investors fail to realize is that P E ratios are temporary  By purchasing a growth stock  the numerator of the P E ratio  price  becomes static or fixed  As earnings of a growth company expand  the stock becomes cheaper by the day  More specifically  the numerator of the P E  price  is flat  while the denominator  earnings  grows  thereby making the P E ratio smaller  cheaper  
And as you can see from the few previous examples I have provided  if you are able to identify winners  and hold them long enough  you will eventually realize the initial hefty price tag at purchase will be considered almost free after all the earnings compounding 
Legendary growth investor Peter Lynch summed it up concisely when he noted   People concentrate too much on the P  but the E really makes the difference   Lynch goes on to highlight the importance of patience in growth investing because stocks often go down or move sideways for long periods of time before dramatic increases occur 
 My best stocks performed in the 3rd year  4th year  5th year  not in the 3rd week or 4th week  
I ve illustrated a few successful examples of meteoric growth stocks  but more importantly the misconception many investors place on the current P E ratio  There still is no substitute for hard nosed  detailed fundamental research for finding big growth winners  because true growth stocks bought and held for a long enough period  will become cheaper by the day 
If you don t have the time  discipline  or patience to execute this winning strategy  find and hire an experienced investment manager who understands these concepts

95393,316908,SBUX,Lyft Partnering With Starbucks  Will Offer Gift Cards In Coffee Shops Starting This Week,opinion,"Ride sharing app Lyft is partnering with Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   to do something no other U S  ride hailing company has done  It will sell gift cards  The company announced Tuesday that it will begin selling  20 gift cards in Starbucks locations this week 
To entice riders and Starbucks customers to by the cards  the companies are offering customers a  5 Starbucks gift card with the purchase of a Lyft card  and 125 free stars  or the equivalent of a free coffee  to those customers who sign up for Lyft and link their Starbucks account in the app  Riders can also earn five stars towards free food and coffee at Starbucks if they hitch a ride between 5 a m  and 10 a m  Monday through Friday for the next few months  as the offer is only for a limited time 
 The partnership  we think  can help us not only reach new people  which is a huge goal of ours  but also get more people to take Lyft more frequently   said Oliver Hsiang  Lyft s VP of partnerships  He also added that the goal of the partnership is to  cross pollinate  Lyft riders and Starbucks customers to drive foot traffic for both companies 
 There are lots and lots of Starbucks stores in the cities that Lyft operates  and we know that people are taking Lyft rides to and from these locations  In fact  Starbucks was the number one most visited coffee shop for us last year   Hsiang also said 
The promotion comes at a time when Lyft continues to try and boost its growth and gain market share from its faster growing rival in Uber  Lyft has been enjoying solid success lately though  telling investors that July was a record month for several metrics  including the number of new passengers and drivers  and active passengers and drivers 
This most recent partnership isn t the first between the two companies  as last year Lyft provided ride services to Starbucks baristas and offered perks to Lyft drivers and Starbucks rewards members 
In regards to why Lyft is offering the gift cards  Hsiang stated   The gift cards allows us to get in front of a lot of people who may not be familiar with Lyft  or they can get in front of people who want to gift Lyft to other people   adding   What we have learned is that there are lots of people who still prefer to transact through the physical card  
Bottom Line
Lyft continues to try and expand to compete with its much larger  and faster growing rival in Uber  and has looked to partnerships like this one with Starbucks  or its deal with General Motors   NYSE GM   to do so  It is still too early to tell how much these partnerships are or will help the company  but based off of its recent comments on an extremely successful July  Lyft seems to be headed in the right direction ",2016-08-09,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/lyft-partnering-with-starbucks,-will-offer-gift-cards-in-coffee-shops-starting-this-week-200146940",200146940
95394,316909,SBUX,Michael Kors  Problem Is That It s Basic,opinion,"On Wednesday  fashion brand Michael Kors Holdings Ltd    NYSE KORS   reported decent   maintaining its earnings streak for the fifth consecutive quarter  Adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents  Total revenue came in at  987 9 million  also topping our consensus estimate of  952 4 million thanks to an increase in retail sales in Asia and Europe 
Despite these positive beats  KORS stock fell over 5  in pre market trading it s recovered a bit  and is down just under 2  in afternoon trading due to a weak outlook for its fiscal second quarter and a 7  decline in its wholesale business 
CEO John D  Idol said that  this progress was muted by the continued decline in mall traffic trends as well as a decrease in tourism in certain major cities which negatively impacted our comparable sales performance during the quarter  Looking ahead  we remain focused on executing against our long term growth strategies across both product categories and regions  
The solution  The brand will no longer be a part of department stores  sales  discounts  and coupons on its products  It will also limit the amount of product available in these stores 
Talking to analysts  Mr  Idol said that consumers  have forgotten the true value of the product  since the brand is always on sale  This is certainly true  but I think the real problem is not that simple 
The Most Basic of the Basics
Michael Kors is basic  Specifically  its Michael Michael Kors sub brand is basic  like the way Starbucks    NASDAQ SBUX   Pumpkin Spice Latte is  The brand is literally everywhere  oversaturating the retail market to the point where it has become a joke  both inside and outside of the fashion industry 
If you walk down  say  Michigan Avenue in Chicago  you d be hard pressed not to spot at least 10 Michael Kors handbags  noticeable from their shiny metal hardware and tacky  MK logo  Not even the designs can help the brand  as most are a direct rip off from other luxury handbag makers  and more often than not  a year or two behind in terms of on point trends 
For example  its   Like Louis Vuitton did with its LV emblazoned handbags  Michael Kors too created a product collection that prominently featured its initials  But unlike Louis Vuitton  the world s most valuable luxury brand  Michael Kors  products did not see the same success 
What makes a handbag top quality  and the opposite of basic  differs from person to person  but   high quality leather  minimalist design  small logo  classic shapes  Michael Michael Kors handbags and even its shoes  apparel and other accessories have strayed from these characteristics  disappearing beneath the distracting MK logo 
 ThanksRapidExpansion
Michael Kors burst onto the scene in 1981  established by its namesake designer Michael Kors  he now serves as honorary chairman and chief creative officer   but its popularity skyrocketed after Mr  Kors landed as a judge on the hit reality show Project Runway in 2004  Just a year later  Kors formed a partnership with Mr  Idol  and the rest is history 
Right from the start  expansion was a key priority  Lawrence Stroll and Silas Chou  two investors who helped make Tommy Hilfiger a household name  were added to the team  and from there  mid price point items were added to the brand s portfolio   400 handbags   300 watches  and  200 shoes were sold as a complement to Michael Kors Collection  the company s high priced haute couture collection  under the Michael Michael Kors brand 
As of last year  Michael Kors has over 550 stores  as well as more than 1 500 in store boutiques all over the world  Mr  Idol had once described Michael Kors as the  Hermes of Staten Island   something probably meant to mean that luxury products don t need to be unaffordable  but is really just insulting towards Hermes 
The company swiftly took over market share from Coach Inc    NYSE COH    a top competitor and a forerunner in affordable luxury  Like Michael Kors is experiencing now  Coach suffered the image and profit sales problems just a few years ago  having rapidly expanded both nationally and internationally  particularly into outlet stores 
And also like Michael Kors  Coach s product line experienced misfire after misfire until last year or so  when the brand began emulating its original designs  hired a new creative director  and produced marketing campaigns that its audience connected with 
There May Be Hope Yet
Michael Michael Kors has done some serious damage to the brand s reputation  It has reached the point of overexposure  something no fashion brand wishes to do and actively tries to avoid  The product line has the stigma of being basic  and it will take years for it to distance itself from that descriptor 
Mr  Idol is making a good start  limiting Michael Kors  presence in shops like Macy s   NYSE M   and Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    Going forward  the company plans to sell fewer items at a higher price point  a strategy that should balance out on its top line  according to Mr  Idol 
Coach should be a clear lesson for Michael Kors  Because if that brand can make a comeback  Michael Kors surely can  Its Collection items are stunning  and are a true testament to the fashion design abilities of the brand and of the company ",2016-08-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/michael-kors'-problem-is-that-it's-basic-200147258,200147258
95395,316910,SBUX,Cash  NIRP And Bonds Part 2,opinion,"On July 29 we published a long piece entitled  Cash  NIRP   Bonds  
Now we see a German bank succumbing to pressure and starting to charge its customers a pass through of the negative interest rate that the commercial bank is paying to the central bank  In the eurozone  the lowest negative rate is minus 40 basis points  Under this scheme  a million euro deposit now pays 4000 euros a year to store cash in the bank  Some economic tests can be applied to estimate what the charge will do by way of changing behaviors  A depositor with 10 000 euros in the bank could be charged only 4 euros a year  and many banks would not charge smaller and retail customers  The typical cutoff is at 100 000 euros  Thus our guess is that smaller depositors will not change their behavior by very much 
On the other end of the spectrum  we are seeing very large institutions developing cash storage and cash hoarding systems  An institution with cash reserves of 100 million euros might well spend less than 400 000 euros a year for a storage facility and thus be better off with cash than with a bank deposit  Readers may wish to develop their own estimates of behaviors and the break points that will trigger changes in those behaviors 
By looking at the physical cash  currency  in circulation in the various currencies where there is some type of negative rate structure  we can watch the aggregate actions of all agents affected by negative rates  In all 6 currencies and in all 24 countries involved  we see increases in physical cash in circulation  Nowhere is cash shrinking  In addition  we can examine other currencies where the central bank rate is positive but the acceptance of the currency is widespread and reaches beyond the border of the country  America and the US dollar is the global leader in that category  We see US physical cash in circulation rising at about a 7  annual rate  and the rate seems to be accelerating  Various estimates place as much as two thirds of that US dollar denominated cash outside of the United States 
One would expect cash used for transactional purposes to rise in aggregate in a way that resembles the growth rate of nominal GDP  That is the traditional test  Furthermore  the proliferation of electronic payment systems would suggest that the use of physical cash should be diminishing   One can easily observe this trend by standing in any Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  line and noting how many customers use an electronic payment instead of cash   So if electronic payments are growing but actual physical cash use is also growing  something else is going on 
Some say it is the underground economy or illegal uses of cash that have caused the demand for physical cash to rise  There is some truth in that  as anyone can discern based on anecdotal evidence  But those uses of cash have been around for a long time and estimates of their use are relatively stable  An exception may be the rising use of cash for the marijuana business as federal law inhibits traditional banking for that use  In Colorado  there is a lot of cash in circulation for this reason 
We think there is a second reason for rising worldwide physical cash demand  and that is negative rate regimes  Negative rates change behavior  They are counterintuitive  They are using a form of central bank policy that penalizes economic players in order to try to achieve lending  borrowing  investing  and economic growth  But negative rates are damaging financial institutions that are dependent on a positive interest rate for their operations  And the world is now realizing the dangers that accompany negative rates 
As cash use rises  the monetary creation of additional money in electronic form morphs into physical cash  Electronic money ends up in a repo or as an excess reserve deposit at the central bank  Cash is held outside the system of banking  Thus rising cash in circulation impacts the money policy maker two ways  It reduces the reserves that are in the banking system and that itself may be a reduction of ways to be stimulative  And Cash is neutral or sterile  It is a permanent liability of the central bank or government and it has no credit multiplier in the traditional sense 
Thus rising use of cash in circulation is a tightening of monetary policy by definition  In the US it has been underway since the Fed stopped QE  In other jurisdictions rising cash use is dampening the central bank s attempt to be stimulative  In our view  a static balance sheet size at a central bank like our Fed is an automated tightening structure  all else being equal  For policy makers this is something to think about  For investors  it means that the Fed may be tighter than many believe ",2016-08-15,David Kotok,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/cash,-nirp-and-bonds—part-2-200148024",200148024

	After yesterday s close  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   and AT T  NYSE T   met earnings expectations but came in light on revenues  Chipotle  missed on both top and bottom lines  and Visa  beat on both sales and earnings estimates  but the Dow finally finished in negative territory for the first time in more than a week 
	This morning  we re seeing more mixed results from Q2 earnings season  with Stanley Back   Decker  beating on both top and bottom lines  while Skechers  is down 15  in the pre market following a miss on both earnings and revenues  The company blamed higher taxes in Brazil and a fire in Malaysia for its quarterly difficulties 
	American Airlines  was able to lower costs more than 3  on the way to a quarterly earnings beat  The airline major also beat on quarterly sales figures  though both top and bottom lines are down from a year ago 
	Next week we shall see earnings results from many big tech firms in what will amount to the busiest week of quarterly numbers of the entire calendar Q2  And with the market  at least on the Dow  taking a breather  perhaps this is a good time to take stock of stocks in our portfolios  For some assistance  check out Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian s latest  ",2016-07-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dow-finally-closed-lower-at-the-bell-200143518,200143518
95419,316934,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  Q3 Earnings In Line  U S  Comps Weak,opinion,Shares of Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   fell almost 3  in after hours trading as its third quarter fiscal 2016 sales growth disappointed investors  Sales were primarily hurt by slow down of comps and traffic trends in the flagship U S  market  in the quarter The disruption brought on from the changes in the rewards program and its negative impact on one of the most popular yearly promotion  Frappuccino Happy Hour  affected sales in the U S The Seattle based coffee giant also curtailed its full year issued sales and comps outlook Earnings In LineAdjusted EPS of 49 cents were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as management s expected range of 48 49 cents  Earnings grew 17  year over year as strong margins and lower than expected taxes offset slow sales growth  Traffic trends slowed down globally Earnings have been adjusted to exclude certain costs related to the purchase of Starbucks Japan in 2014  gain on sale of Germany retail operations to an existing licensed partner in the quarter and some other tax related items Sales   Comps Slow DownTotal third quarter sales of  5 24 billion increased 7  year over year  Revenues  however  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 35 billion by 2 1   Higher sales in China and the Channel Development segment counterbalanced a slowdown in sales growth in the U S  and Europe Same store sales  comps  grew 4   less than 6  the previous quarter  due to cooling global traffic trends  Global traffic was flat in the quarter  less than the 2  increase in the previous quarter  Average ticket growth remained unchanged at 4  in the reported quarter Margins IncreaseAdjusted operating margin rose 30 basis points  bps  year over year to 19 8  as improved sales leverage and lower commodity costs  mainly coffee  offset higher employee and digital investments  mainly in the Americas segment Segment DetailsAmericas  Net revenue in this flagship segment rose 7  year over year to  3 65 billion Comps rose 4  in the quarter  less than 7  last quarter due to softer traffic trends  which in turn  were flat in the quarter  less than 3  in the previous quarter  In the U S   comps increased 4   less than 7  in the previous quarter due to soft traffic trends  Sales grew 8  in the U S Importantly  the comps growth in the U S  went below 5   thus ending its impressive streak of 25 straight quarters of comparable store sales growth of 5  or greater As warned at the second quarter conference call  Starbucks  U S  comps in the third quarter were hurt by the April overhaul of its Starbucks Rewards program from a frequency based model to a spend based one  According to this update  customers now receive rewards for every dollar spent at its stores rather than the number of visits The shift to the new rewards program also disrupted the normal cadence of the summer marketing campaign  Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion  which had generated higher revenues last year At the call  management also stated that the political uncertainty and the   profound weakening in consumer confidence   has hurt overall restaurant traffic trends in the country  Also food sales in the company s stores slowed down in the quarter Food sales grew 10  year on year and contributed 1  to comps growth which slowed from 2  in the previous quarter  Breakfast sandwiches  however  continued to do well with sales rising 20  year over year Core beverages platform  excluding blended  contributed only 2  of comp growth due to lower than expected sales of Frappuccino in the quarter  The cold beverage platform  however  did well in the quarter  Iced beverage revenues  excluding blended  grew 25  in the quarter Tea contributed 1 point to comps growth fueled by higher sales of Teavana handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks stores Notably  despite the change to the rewards program Starbucks added approximately 2 million new members in the My Starbucks Rewards  MSR  program in the quarter  up 18  year over year  In the U S  and Canada  the company now has 12 3 million MSR members Adjusted operating margin declined 40 bps to 24 6  as strong sales leverage and lower costs of sales were offset by higher employee and digital investments Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA   Net revenue declined 7  year over year to  273 4 million due to currency headwinds and portfolio shift to licensed stores including sale of the Germany store  Excluding currency headwinds and portfolio shift  sales grew 5  Comps declined 1   comparing unfavorably to an increase of 1  last quarter due to a slowing economy  Brexit related political uncertainty and recent terror attacks in the region Adjusted operating margin  excluding cost incurred on sale of Germany operations  declined 20 bps to 12 0  due to weak sales China Asia Pacific  CAP   Net revenue rose 18  to  768 million on strong sales growth in China Comps grew 3   same as in the previous quarter as strength in China was offset by softer comps in Japan  Though comps were positive in Japan  they were upset by recent earthquakes and economic slowdown in the country China comps rose 7  in the country driven almost entirely by increased traffic trends Adjusted operating margin at the CAP segment rose 90 bps year over year to 25 6  as strong sales leverage and higher JV income counteracted currency headwinds  Excluding Fx  CAP margins expanded by 210 bps Channel Development  CPG   This segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees  premium Tazo teas  a variety of ready to drink beverages  like Frappuccino and Starbucks Refreshers  and Starbucks and Tazo branded K Cup packs sold through channels such as grocery  specialty retailers  and foodservice to name a few Channel Development had a very strong third quarter  Net revenue grew 9  year over year to  441 million  on the back of higher sales of Starbucks branded K Cup offerings and increased foodservice and packaged coffee sales  The international CPG business also did well Adjusted operating margin increased 710 bps to 43  driven by higher profits from the North American Coffee Partnership  NCAP  with PepsiCo  Inc    NYSE PEP    lower coffee costs  improved cost of goods sold efficiency and decreased marketing spend Starbucks formed the NCAP joint venture with Pepsi in 2014 for marketing  sale and distribution of Starbucks ready to drink coffee and energy beverages  The joint venture has grown into a more than  1 5 billion retail business offering 40 ready to drinkStarbucks beverages at present All Other  The segment comprises emerging brands including Teavana  acquired in Dec 2012   Seattle s Best Coffee  Evolution Fresh and Digital Ventures Revenues in the segment dipped 5  to  110 1 million Fiscal 2016 OutlookWhile the company lowered its sales expectations  the profit expectation remained intact  The guidance includes an extra 53rd week in fiscal 2016 Excluding the extra week  Starbucks expects revenues to grow approximately 10  in the fiscal year compared with more than 10  expected earlier The extra week is projected to add roughly 2  to sales  Currency impact is likely to hurt revenues by 1   previously 1  to 2   Comps are expected to grow in a mid single digit range  comparing unfavorably with the previous guidance of somewhat above the mid single digit range  The company expects to open 1 900 stores in the year  up from 1 800 expected previously Starbucks earlier maintained its previously issued fiscal 2016 guidance  For fiscal 2016  the company now expects adjusted earnings  including the 53rd week  in the range of  1 88  1 89 per share  The guidance includes contribution from the extra week  which is expected to add 6

95446,316961,SBUX,Starbucks Creates New Upscale Stores With Italian Bakery Princi,opinion,"On Thursday  popular coffee chain Starbucks Corp    NASDAQ SBUX   announced that it will be creating a new  high end brand of stores  dubbed Starbucks Reserve only  The new stores are set to offer premium  small lot reserve coffee in a space twice the size of a typical Starbucks 
In a press call  CEO Howard Schultz said  We recognize our customers expect and desire a higher level of product and we want to give it to them   Schultz also said the Starbucks Reserve Only stores are the  next evolution of the Starbucks Roastery experience   Located in Seattle  the  provides customers with an immersive  visual coffee bar experience  offering five different methods of coffee preparation 
Starbucks plans to open new Roastery stores in Shanghai next year  with one in New York slated for 2018  As for Reserve only stores  the company did not provide a number of planned locations  though Schultz said there were  hundreds of opportunities  for  Reserve stores in the U S  alone  
In addition to the elevated coffee experience  Starbucks announced its investment in high end Italian bakery and pizzeria chain Princi  The deal allows Starbucks to develop and operate all new Princi locations outside of Italy and in the U S  By 2017  Starbucks Reserve only stores will begin serving Princi baked goods  and a new Princi location is set to open next year in Seattle 
 Given the response we ve had to the Roastery and Reserve coffee  we believe that there s an opportunity to build a coffee forward store   said Schultz   This is an opportunity for us to elevate food in a way we never have before  
This partnership with Princi will help Starbucks boost its food sales  a quickly growing facet of its business that has surpassed even its coffee sales  In the past  Starbucks  food had drawn complaints about taste and consistency  but its acquisition of the La Boulange brand in 2012 helped the company turn around its food business  The Princi deal should enhance it even more

95448,316963,SBUX,Starbucks  SBUX  To Report Q3 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   is set to report third quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jul 21  after the closing bell  Last quarter  the company delivered in line earnings 
Starbucks has delivered positive earnings surprise in two of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 0 60 
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement STARBUCKS CORP Price and EPS Surprise
   Factors to Consider
Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of 48 49 cents in the fiscal third quarter  The earnings guidance represents a growth rate of 14 17  
However  management anticipates comps growth in the fiscal third quarter to be affected by the transition to the new Rewards program  In April  Starbucks updated its rewards program  According to which customers will now receive rewards for every dollar spent at its stores instead of the number of visits 
Starbucks  second quarter fiscal 2016 results were below expectations  Its sales growth disappointed the investors due to slow down of the global traffic trends  Higher sales in China and U S  offset a relatively softer performance in Europe 
We expect robust sales growth in the Americas to continue  The upside is expected to be driven by higher food sales and food beverage innovation along with continued benefits from the digital initiatives  Starbucks  latest digital offering  Mobile Order and Pay  is witnessing increasing usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to be reported quarter as well as in 2016 as its adoption increases  This initiative allows the customers to order beforehand and pick up the items at their preferred Starbucks outlet  saving time in the process 
Also  sales leverage and improved operational efficiency should support the profits in Americas which will be partially offset by accelerated global employee and digital investments 
Sales and profits should remain strong in China as well  However  we do not expect any improvement of sales trends prevailing in Europe  The strong performance witnessed in the past few quarters in the CPG segment due to higher sales of Starbucks branded K Cup offerings and increased foodservice and packaged coffee sales are likely to continue in the to be reported quarter 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Starbucks is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   Starbucks  Earnings ESP is 0 0  as the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 49 cents 
Zacks Rank  Starbucks  Zacks Rank  3  Buy  increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a positive earnings surprise 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider                                          
Here are some companies in the restaurant sector that investors may consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Jack in the Box Inc    NASDAQ JACK    with an Earnings ESP of  1 15  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Papa John s International Inc    NASDAQ PZZA    with an Earnings ESP of  3 70  and a Zacks Rank  2

Key Takeaways
The Estimize community is calling for earnings per share of 50 cents on  5 36 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line
Starbuck s is seeing upside in its relatively new food segment  mobile platform and rewards program
The coffee chain has large exposure to European markets which are expected to take a hit given the current volatility in the region
What are you expecting for  
A cup of coffee is a necessary part of many people s daily routine  Starbucks hopes those day to day habits involve visiting 1 of its 24 000 stores found in 70 countries worldwide  The company has been largely successful in as attracting customers as earnings continue to make double digit gains 
In the past 2 fiscal years  Starbucks has posted double digit gains on both the top and bottom line with no sign of slowing down 
The Estimize consensus is high on Starbucks to repeat its past performances  The community is calling for earnings per share of 50 cents on  5 36 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line 
Compared to a year earlier this represents a 17  increase on in earnings and 10  in sales  Shares of the coffee giant typically do well leading up to earnings  rising 2  in the 30 days ahead of a report 
The company s constant efforts to expand and improve have been key to driving robust traffic trends  Starbuck s is seeing upside in its relatively new food segment  increased usage of its mobile platform and general improvements in operational efficiency  Last quarter the coffee chain featured a 6  gain in comparable store sales on the 350 new stores worldwide 
However its customer loyalty program is proving to be the most successful initiative  In April  Starbucks updated its reward program which will now reward customers for every dollar spent instead of the number of visits  Chipotle has taken a page from the coffee chain and recently introduced its own loyalty program to spur traffic 
Starbuck s large global footprint has made it susceptible to macroeconomic risks  The last few quarters have seen sales growth disappoint shareholders due to a slowdown in global traffic trends  The Brexit hasn t helped to alleviate the issue 
In fact currency headwinds have only become worse with the euro and pound plunging following the vote  Fortunately  sales and profits in China and the U S  should remain strong enough to offset the volatility in Europe  Relatively softer performance in Europe should be a theme we see from Starbucks for multiple quarters

95470,316985,SBUX,Changing India Favors Cafe Coffee Day IPO,news,"By   

BANGALORE  India    The Taylors had just settled down around a table  set in a semi outdoor enclosure at a Cafe Coffee Day  located at the junction of two of the busiest roads in Bangalore s Frazer Town area  Three generations of the family were waiting for their cold coffees and chocolate cake to arrive 
 It s a nice place to hangout  to talk to people over a cup of coffee  lot of things happen over coffee   said Sam Taylor  in his late sixties and the eldest in the group  He was also recalling the tag line of the cafe chain s advertisements   A lot can happen over coffee  
Such scenes are commonplace across Indian cities and towns these days  and have played an important role in encouraging Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd   which operates the Cafe Coffee Day chain  to take the company public next week in Mumbai  and raise as much as 11 5 billion rupees  about  176 million  
That money will help the company pay off debt and consolidate the commanding lead its 1 500 or so outlets have across India over foreign rivals including Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   and McDonald s  NYSE MCD   whose local franchisees are adding coffee outlets within McDonald s restaurants  even as Cafe Coffee Day adds more eating options  including spicy Indian snacks 

The Indian coffee chain market is forecast to grow 20 percent each year from 18 2 billion rupees   290 million  in 2014 to 54 3 billion rupees by 2020  according to retail markets research firm Technopak  The total number of organized cafe chain stores is predicted to increase from about 3 500 today to 6 200 by 2020 
However  in order to grow at this pace  cafes in India will have to contend with the tastes of a nation of tea drinkers 
Dawn  Sam s wife  said   I love my chai  but their tea isn t good  Their cold coffee is really good   Her comments are an indication that Cafe Coffee Day is succeeding with selling coffee in many avatars  from plain coffee with milk to double shot espressos to cold coffee shakes with strawberry flavor 
The company  which was started in 1996 by its entrepreneur chairman V G  Siddhartha  and has interests in businesses including holiday resorts to software services  and counts private equity company KKR  venture capital firms New Silk Route and Sequoia Capital as investors 
 I ve been going to Coffee Day since they had the first one on Brigade Road  in Bangalore      all the young people used to go there because it was also a cyber cafe   recalled Sam s son Mark 
Around the table were Mark s wife  their two children  sister and a cousin   I used to walk over almost every evening  drink a frappe     the taste is still the same even after 15 years  
Cafe Coffee Day is also a preferred choice during rest stops on road trips for a growing number of car owners in India  who are increasingly at ease driving from one city to another for business as well as family occasions like marriages or just a holiday get together  One of the reasons for the preference is the attention to details like clean toilets and running water  often missing at other local outlets  The Taylors themselves have moved to the neighboring town of Hosur  And a stop at a Cafe Coffee Day outlet on a drive to or from Bangalore  is often a natural choice 
Coffee Day Enterprises    which could be valued at as much as 67 5 billion rupees or  1 billion following the share sale that will open Oct  14 and end Oct  16    will rely on these changing tastes and spending habits  The company will sell shares in the price range of 316 rupees to 328 rupees  offering 17 55 percent of itself to investors on a post issue basis  Reuters reported Wednesday  citing a presentation made by the company in Mumbai ",2015-10-09,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/changing-india-favors-cafe-coffee-day-ipo-365365,365365

95473,316988,SBUX,California considers adding meat to cancer alert list,news,By Tom Polansek and P J  Huffstutter  Reuters    California is examining new World Health Organization findings to determine whether to add red meat and foods like hot dogs  sausages and bacon to a cancer alert list  setting the stage for a potential battle with the meat industry over warning labels  The inclusion of meat and processed meat on the list could reduce consumer demand  hurting major producers and processors like  Hormel Foods Corp   N HRL  and JBS USA  It could also open the door wider for litigation against meat companies from consumers diagnosed with certain types of cancer  California has often been at the forefront of consumer oriented initiatives  particularly regarding agriculture  It rolled out laws for larger chicken cages and restrictions on antibiotic use for livestock ahead of much of the rest of the country  Now the meat industry is focused on what the state will do after a unit of the WHO on Monday said processed meat can cause colorectal cancer in humans  It said the risk of developing cancer is small  but increases with the amount of meat consumed  The meat industry maintains that its products are safe to eat as part of a balanced diet  California s Proposition 65  an initiative approved in 1986  requires that the state keep a list of all chemicals and substances known to increase cancer risks  Producers of such products are required to provide  clear and reasonable  warnings for consumers  Some Proposition 65 experts expect California to add processed meats to the list  Typically  once an item is added  it is up to the maker to prove to the state that its product is not dangerous enough to warrant a warning label  experts say   Starbucks Corp   O SBUX  is embroiled in a lawsuit filed by a non profit group in California over whether its coffee contains enough of the carcinogen acrylamide to pose a cancer risk  and should be labeled accordingly under Proposition 65  The meat industry is adamant it will escape having to put warning labels on packages of bacon or hot dogs  It says a 2009 California appellate court ruling confirmed federal authority over labels for meat from plants inspected by the U S  Department of Agriculture   Meats will never have to be labeled in the state of California   said Jim Coughlin  a consultant hired by the National Cattlemen s Beef Association  Still  he thinks processed meats will make it onto the Proposition 65 list  The situation on labeling processed meats is not known  according to the state agency assessing the WHO findings  the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment  Federal law pre empts warnings on fresh meat  but  our understanding of how federal law governs processed meats is less clear   Allan Hirsch  chief deputy director of the California office  told Reuters   We can t tell you if Proposition 65 warnings would be pre empted if processed meats were added to the Proposition 65 list   Labeling would be a bigger blow to meat companies than inclusion on the Proposition 65 list because labels could confront consumers front and center at stores and restaurants  say industry analysts  It is not known exactly what warnings might say  The WHO s International Agency for Research on Cancer put processed meats in its  group one  category  along with tobacco and asbestos  products for which the agency says there is  sufficient evidence  of cancer links  Any move to add red or processed meat to the Proposition 65 list would be challenged by the industry  said Mark Dopp  senior vice president of regulatory affairs and general counsel of the North American Meat Institute  NAMI   The institute represents companies including Cargill Inc   Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN  and Kraft Heinz Co   The state can t force a label on federally inspected product   said Janet Riley  president of the National Hot Dog   Sausage Council and a NAMI senior vice president  But a legal fight could follow  Private lawyers  or even the state of California  could file lawsuits in an attempt to overturn the 2009 ruling and force meat companies to apply labels  Coughlin said  If that happens  NAMI  would wave the court of appeals decision  It d be a stupid suit to even try to initiate because it s already been decided   he said  Red meat is less likely to be added to California s list because it was classified as  probably carcinogenic   Coughlin said  That put it in the WHO unit s  group 2A  category  joining glyphosate  the active ingredient in many weedkillers  made by  Monsanto   N MON  Co  Since the WHO s classification of glyphosate in March  Monsanto has faced a slew of lawsuits from personal injury law firms around the United States that claim the company s Roundup herbicide has caused cancer in farm workers and others exposed to the chemical  In September  the California environmental office gave notice that it intended to list glyphosate under Proposition 65   Monsanto has asked state officials to withdraw the plan  arguing that California s actions could be considered illegal because they are not considering valid scientific evidence

95474,316989,SBUX,Top 5 Things to Know This Morning,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know this morning  Thursday  October 29 
1  Fed leaves the door wide open for December rate hike
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged following a two day policy meeting on Wednesday  as widely expected  but surprised the market with a hawkish statement  which included a direct reference to its next policy meeting in December 
 In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting  the committee will assess progress   both realized and expected   toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2  inflation   it said 
The central bank s statement did not repeat that global risks would have a likely impact on the U S  economy  as it warned at its prior meeting in September 
The hawkish statement boosted the probability that the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting in December for the first time since 2006 
2  U S  third quarter GDP due before the opening bell
The Commerce Department will release its preliminary estimate of U S  economic growth for the third quarter at 8 30AM ET  at the same time as the weekly jobless claims report 
The report was expected to show that the economy expanded 1 6  in the three months ended September 30  slowing from growth of 3 9  in the second quarter  as a weaker global economy took its toll 
3  Global markets mostly lower after hawkish Fed
Asian equities were mostly lower in choppy trade Thursday  as a positive handover from Wall Street did little to help sentiment 
In Europe  equity markets declined as investors digested a raft of quarterly earnings reports and after signals that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as December 
Meanwhile  U S  stock futures pointed to losses at the open  as investors looked ahead to key U S  third quarter growth data due at 8 30AM ET for further clues on the strength of the economy 
4  U S  earnings season continues
Ahead of the market open  Time Warner Cable  N TWC   ConocoPhillips  N COP   Mastercard  N MA  and  Altria Group   N MO  will report earnings  After the market closes  Starbucks  O SBUX   LinkedIn  N LNKD    Expedia   O EXPE   Electronic Arts  O EA  and  Western Union   N WU  are on the earnings docket 
5  Gold  oil take a hit from stronger dollar
Gold and oil prices pushed lower on Thursday  as the U S  dollar surged to a two month high against a basket of major currencies after the Federal Reserve hinted at a possible rate hike in December 
Gold was last down  16 50  or 1 4   to trade at  1 159 60 an ounce  while U S  crude dropped 35 cents  or 0 76   to  45 59 a barrel and Brent shed 52 cents  or 1 05   to  48 53 a barrel

95476,316991,SBUX,Your Morning Cup of Coffee Could Be Hurting Your Retirement Nest Egg,opinion,"Americans love their coffee  me included  
But let me ask you   
Is getting that morning buzz more important than building up your retirement nest egg 
New research suggests that  for many of us  the answer is a resounding YES 
And that s scary 
If there s ever been a sign that our nation s obsession with Starbucks  Nasdaq  NASDAQ SBUX  is getting out of hand  this is it   
According to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  the company is sitting on  1 2 billion in unspent customer funds  We re talking about money that s been loaded onto prepaid gift cards   or added via the Starbucks mobile app 
That s more than the total annual deposits accepted by some banks 
What s even crazier is that it s up from  621 million reported near the end of 2014   
A 93 2  jump 
It s that number that we want to focus on today 
Well  that number as it compares to this one    4 1  
That s how much the average 401 k  contribution increased between Q4 2014 and Q4 2015 according to Fidelity  Which suggests that we Americans consider White Chocolate Mocha Frappuccinos a better investment than our own futures 
We re boosting our deposits on a  coffee card  faster than our deposits to our retirement accounts 
That s scary 
Okay  okay    put down the pitchfork  I know I m making a bit of a leap here  but hear me out 
In response to a recent Bankrate   53  of people said they don t invest because they  don t have the money  
Fair enough  But at the same time    roughly 60 million people visit Starbucks each week 
Many of those individuals are repeat customers  They re the driving force behind the company s wildly successful loyalty rewards program  For our purposes  let s assume you re one of them and that you visit Starbucks twice a week  And let s also say that  each time  you order a tall iced coffee 
Over the course of a month  you d spend  18  minus tax   Over the course of a year  you d drop well over  200 
Maybe that seems like a lot of money to you  Maybe not  But I can tell you this  For that same amount  you could buy four shares of Starbucks stock at recent prices 
 Over the past year  Starbucks shareholders have earned a 3 5  return  plus a 1 43  dividend yield  Since May 2008   when the company first introduced its loyalty rewards program   the stock has risen more than 600   
I don t point this out to shame you into investing every spare dollar   or to suggest that you don t deserve the occasional caffeinated confection 
But these numbers are proof of a concerning issue   
That too many of us are ignoring the first and most important step in investing  saving  And in the vast majority of cases  it s not because we  don t have the money    
It s because we d prefer to spend it on a  5 coffee that s covered in whipped cream and a caramel drizzle 
Alexander Green  this concept well 

As I pointed out in a column a few weeks ago  anyone who invested  190 a month for 40 years   and earned nothing more than the stock market s average annual return for the past 200 years  10     would have accumulated a sum of more than  1 million   

Yet the majority of us did nothing of the sort 
Some were too poor    Others believed the government or their employer would take care of their retirement    Still others were simply uninformed about the power of equity ownership and compounding   
However  many of us were not indigent  ignorant or wishful thinkers  We couldn t invest because we didn t save  And we didn t save because we chose immediate consumption over delayed gratification 
Clearly Starbucks has tapped into a major profit stream with its gift cards and loyalty rewards program  But it s sad that more people are fanatical about overpriced coffee than they are about padding their retirement account ",2016-07-03,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/your-morning-cup-of-coffee-could-be-hurting-your-retirement-nest-egg-200139668,200139668

Chicago  IL   July 07  2016   Zacks Market Edge is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec  Every week  Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life  To listen to the podcast  click here      

How to Invest in Colombia and Mexico

Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 

In this episode  Tracey is joined by John Blank  Zacks Chief Equity Strategist and Editor of the   which specializes in buying international stocks 

Both Tracey and John are big fans of Mexico and Colombia  but with the chaos in the emerging market stocks  especially those impacted by the plunge in crude  should you be investing there 

Tracey and John discuss 3 ways to get into the game in both of these countries 

1  Buy Mexican and Colombian company stocks

The problem with this strategy is that there are only so many companies that trade on the US exchanges  Mexico has more options  including FEMSA     which owns the largest Coca Cola bottler in Latin America and the OXXO convenience store chain  and American Movil      Carlos Slim s telecom giant 

For a companies a little outside the box  but which are cashing in on the growing Mexican middle class as well as the international traveler  consider Grupo Aeroporturio del Sureste  aka ASUR  which operates a bunch of airports including the rapidly expanding Cancun and Cozumel airports  Another option for airports is Grupo Aeroporturio del Pacifico  akaGAP  which operates Los Cabos  which saw a record load factor of 87 5  in May  Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara  which saw domestic traffic soar 19 4  in May  among other airports 

In Colombia  investors options are more limited  Bancolombia     is the country s largest bank 

It is expected to grow earnings by 3 4  this year and another 14 5  next year but some analysts are worried about bad loans associated with the commodities sector 

2  Buy country ETFs

The easiest way to get Mexican and Colombian exposure is by simply buying their ETFs 

iShares Mexico ETF    will get you a bunch of consumer names including America Movil and FEMSA  along with Walmart Mexico and Grupo Bimbo  the world s largest baking company 

Global MSCI Colombia ETF    is weighted more heavily towards typical emerging market industries such as energy  power generation and banks  Its largest holding is Bancolombia at 15  

3  Buy American companies doing business in Mexico and Colombia

John and Tracey discuss ways in which investors can tap into the growth in Mexico and Colombia by buying US companies doing business there 

Home Depot  NYSE HD   Williams Sonoma and Old Navy  which is owned by Gap  are just a few that have been growing their retail presence in Mexico 

Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  entered into the Colombian market in 2014 and already has 6 cafes in Bogota 

But what else should you know about Mexico and Colombia before investing in their future  Tune into this week s podcast to find out

95480,316995,SBUX,Who Will Benefit From China s Huge Middle Class ,opinion,"China s explosive middle class is spicing things up 
Despite some worries as of late  the burgeoning middle class in China is now a force to be reckoned with on the global stage  In just three decades since Deng Xiaoping s economic reforms in the mid 80s  China now finds itself home to the largest middle class on Earth  This includes over 225 million households which now find themselves in this category 
These 225 million households represent an astronomic shift from the 5M households of just 16 years ago  According to the Economist  the current criterion for those within the middle class involves earning between  11 500 and  43 000 a year in current U S  dollars  Chinese people are seeing prosperity  the likes of which many have not seen before 
Because of its growth  China is now the second largest economy in the world  Chinese people are experiencing increased quality of life  as well as becoming a bigger target for foreign companies 
But what is the recipe for this success 
A Pinch of History
In the 1990s  China barely had a middle class  Much of the population was poor and agrarian  and the population had been largely isolated from the rest of the world since the Communist revolution of 1949 
China of 1990 had a lot of work ahead of it  but was ready for the taking  In 1992  Deng Xiaoping accelerated market reforms to establish a  socialist market economy   revolutionizing the economic platform at that point  In 1994  China established permanent connection to the internet  instituted a 9 year compulsory education system in 1995  and gave greater autonomy to universities in 1999 
Of course  the 90s was not simply a period of eternal happiness  but things in China were largely on a fast track to catching up to the developed world  According to  presented at an international conference on sustainable development from 2005  China managed to reduce the proportion of the population in severe poverty from 250M to 26M between 1978 and 2004 
China traversed a difficult point to reach where they are today  but they appear to be making it count 
A Dash of Increased Consumer Spending
From the opening of the first McDonald s   NYSE MCD   in Beijing back in 1991 to now  the rise of consumerism in China has dramatically altered the way people are spending their money  According to  by Global X  the issuers of the China Consumer ETF   Chinese GDP growth is expected to be propelled largely by consumption 
According to the annual average  per capita income of households grew 9 4  in 2014 alone  Smaller cities in China are becoming more urbanized  with the Urbanization Plan targeting 60  national urbanization by 2020 
Newer generations in China that have lived under better economic standards are more confident about personal income growth  are more loyal to brand names  and often are less hesitant to try new products and services  Retail sales have grown every year since 2005  and current trends show no indications of that changing 
Essentially  the Chinese have shifted towards having more money to spend and less apprehension about spending it 
A Taste of Companies Cashing In 
With a market like China that is now realizing its purchasing power  there are many companies that can put themselves in a position to capitalize  Here are a few that have already made their presence in the region count  and plan on continuing to do so moving forward 
General Motors   NYSE GM  
On Thursday   that General Motor s China sales rose 5 3  in the first half of 2016  The improved performance was driven by solid sales of the Cadillac and Buick brands along with increased demand for the Baojun brand 
GM accounted for 14 9  of China s vehicle market last year  and is believed to either remain either at or above that proportion by the time sales in the overall market reach 30 million in 2020 
Although analysts have revised earnings estimates downward for Q2 from  1 51 to  1 48 per share and from  5 62 to  5 56 for this fiscal year  China could prove to be a promising cushion moving forward

Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX  
For the past few years  Starbucks has had a clean run in China  It already runs 2 000 stores in 100 different cities in China  and   plans on doubling its presence in the China and Asian Pacific region to 10 000 stores by 2019  One fourth of that 10 000 will come from China alone 
By establishing themselves as a cultural symbol in China  SBUX has attracted much of the middle class to try their comparatively expensive beverages  Consumers want to be seen at Starbucks stores drinking lattes while holding their gadgets 
Although SBUX faces increased competition from such international caf  chains as U K  based Costa Coffee and Maan Coffee from South Korea  SBUX is on track to continue their success in the region 
Starbucks currently sits at a Zacks Rank   3  Hold  
China Eastern Airlines   NYSE CEA  
China Eastern Airlines is one of the largest airliners in the country  It is the primary air carrier serving Shanghai  the economic heart of China as well as the company s headquarters 
According to  from the World Bank  the number of tourists in China has continually risen  Tier 1 cities such as Shanghai and Beijing draw the bulk of these tourists  so a company like CEA is in prime position to benefit from increased international tourism 
Domestic tourism is also a key factor here  because as mentioned the growing middle class also has more discretionary income which will be used for domestic tourism  All in all  CEA will likely be seeing more customers in modern day China 
China Eastern Airlines currently sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
China Telecom Corporation   NYSE CHA  
China Telecom Corporation is a state owned company  and currently the largest fixed line and third largest mobile telecommunication provider in China  Along with this  CHA provides internet access to over 38 million subscribers and about 62  of China s overall internet bandwidth 
As per   China currently has over 721M people connected to the internet  in the lead by 260M users against second place India  As the previously mentioned ETF research states  current urbanization plans target 60  of China being urbanized by as soon as 2020  More urban centers mean more people who now can connect to the internet  and companies like CHA will have to meet that higher demand 
As such  it is worth investors  time to keep an eye out for CHA moving forward 
China Consumer ETF 
The Global X China Consumer ETF designed to reflect the performance of the consumer sector in China  It has exposure to companies whose main business operations are in the consumer sector and are either based in or run their main business operations in China 
With all signs pointing towards a more consumerist China  this ETF will be worth watching as well  Although currently sitting at a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   investors should realize that the Zacks ETF Rank involves next year  and it doesn t take into account long term prospects 
Bottom Line
China is no longer the same country that it was thirty years ago  and may not be the same country thirty years from now either  A rapidly growing economy and resurgent middle class has dramatically altered the social and political landscape in China as well 
Although there are questions about China s recent economic slowdown and potential political unrest  investors can rest assured that China is  and will continue to be  a very active global player  Foreign companies will invest more in hopes that they can tap into the 1 4B people market  however  whether or not they will succeed is something we all should keep our eyes on ",2016-07-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/who-will-benefit-from-china's-huge-middle-class-200140840,200140840
95481,316996,SBUX,Starbucks Announces 5  Base Pay Raise And Other Employee Benefits,opinion,"Today  Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   CEO Howard Schultz  to all US employees  announcing that there will be a few more perks that come with working for the coffee giant   Starting October 3rd  the company will increase the base pay of its US store managers and workers by at least 5    The magnitude of the raise will vary depending on store location and market factors  
Starbucks is known for being competitive with regards to how well it treats its talent   This new move may put additional pressure on fellow peers within the food and coffee space to offer better pay and benefits for employees 
Howard Schultz s letter also mentions a future upgrade to its stock awards program for workers   The program  known as Bean Stock  is expected to double stock awards for workers who have been with the company for at least two years   It is worth noting that the company attempts to make annual upgrades to Bean Stock  and that the level of compensation through the program increases depending on Starbucks  financial performance  
Starbucks has done very well for itself over the years  and since 2005  the corporation has gone from being in the top 400 of the Fortune 500 to being within the top 200   If Starbucks continues to churn out high levels of income  its employees stand to reap more benefits in the form of better pay and benefits 
Mr  Schultz s letter indicates that there will be some new options open to employees within the company s health program   Now  employees will have more flexibility to choose a health plan which fits their needs   Starbucks has an interactive tool that helps employees with finding an insurer and health plan that meets their financial and healthcare needs   The corporation believes that the customization of health benefits will allow its workers to save up to  800 per year   Employees using family coverage could save even more  and Starbucks estimates that workers under this plan could see potential savings of up to  2600 per year

95483,316998,SBUX,Americans Prefer Coffee To Stocks,opinion,"A little and a little  collected together  becomes a great deal  the heap in the barn consists of single grains  and drop and drop make the inundation 

   Saadi
Toward the end of last year we published an article titled Americans favour coffee to stock market investing where we demonstrated that an overwhelming majority drink coffee as opposed to investing in the stock market  61  of Americans drink coffee on a daily basis as opposed to the 48  that invest in the market  On an annual basis  Americans spend about  1200 on coffee  If they put this money into the market and allowed compound interest to do its magic  it could grow into a nice tidy sum over a period of 20 years 
The latest data provides even more attention grabbing information  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  is one of the most popular places to get a cup of Java  even though  in our opinion  it does not come close to ranking as the best  The picture below illustrates just how much people love their daily coffee 

Individuals are more interested in loading their prepaid Starbucks cards with money than contributing to their 401K plans  This is a clear illustration of how people today are more concerned with how they look or what image they portray as opposed to building a sustainable nest egg  S P Global Market Intelligence states that Starbucks has  1 2 billion in unspent funds    unspent funds that customers have on their prepaid cards  In 2014  the same customers added  614 billion  so the jump to  1 2 billion is truly stunning  This is more than the total deposits some banks take in for the year  In the same period  the average contribution to a 401K increased by a measly 4 1  
From a psychological perspective  it reveals that the majority have still not embraced the markets  According to bankrate com  a large portion of the population states that they don t have enough money to invest in stocks  Based on the chart below  53  don t have enough money to purchase stocks and 21  don t know enough about stocks  this does not bode well for the current generation  However  these chaps seem to have no qualms about purchasing an overpriced cup of coffee that they could easily make at home

Negative Rates
We have spoken at length on this topic and as we have noted previously  the tiny rate hike the Fed initiated is not the beginning of a new trend but a desperate effort on its part to convince the masses that this economic recovery is real  Any person with a grain of common sense understands that the only thing driving this economic recovery is hot money  if the supply of hot money is cut  the recovery will end instantly  This is why nation after nation continues to jump onto the negative rate band wagon and it is just a matter of time before the Fed is forced to join the party  When negative rates hit the US  it will propel corporations into taking even more risk  We suspect share buybacks will surge to levels that might make the current purchases seem sane in comparison 
Conclusion
The Fed s strategy has been to foster an environment that favors speculators and punishes savers and they have succeeded in achieving their objective  The next stage will be to force these savers to speculate  and that is when we can expect this market to enter into the bubble phase  The Fed s sole purpose since it began interfering with free market forces has been to facilitate boom and bust cycles  This bull market will only end when the masses finally give into it  thereby setting the stage for a bubble  History is replete with examples of how bull markets end  No bull market has ended without mass participation  the crowd has to turn euphoric before the bull kicks the bucket 

Play not with paradoxes  That caustic which you handle in order to scorch others may happen to sear your own fingers and make them dead to the quality of things

95504,317019,SBUX,Tax exemption may be key to move of Keurig s coffee buying to Switzerland,news,By Luc Cohen NEW YORK  Reuters    When Keurig Green Mountain Inc  NASDAQ GMCR  said last December it was shifting its coffee buying operation to Lausanne in Switzerland from its headquarters in Waterbury  Vermont  it said the move would establish the company as a  global beverage player    The seller of brewing machines and single serve coffee pods said nothing about a little known exemption in the U S  tax code that for many years has benefited  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX  and other U S  companies who trade in some commodities  In internal presentations  Keurig said the move was aimed at expanding into the European market and gaining access to Switzerland s talent pool of coffee traders  one source familiar with the transition told Reuters  But as the move took shape it became clear that tax savings were a key part of the plan  this person said  Accountants and professors specializing in taxation told Reuters that Keurig is positioned to benefit from the 1970s era exemption for commodities trading  By moving coffee buying  Keurig can also shift some income to Lausanne  where the tax rate is less than 10 percent  In Vermont  it faces a U S  federal corporate income tax rate of up to 35 percent  and a state tax rate of up to 8 5 percent  Keurig s new Swiss operation will be able to record profits by purchasing green coffee beans at one price  and selling them at a markup to the North American businesses that roast the coffee and sell it to consumers  the source said  This effectively shifts profits from the U S  parent company to the Swiss entity in an entirely legal maneuver   The fact that Keurig is doing this is pretty clearly due to a loophole in the law that doesn t make a whole lot of sense   said Matt Gardner  executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy  a nonpartisan Washington  D C  think tank   A Keurig spokeswoman declined to comment in response to a list of questions emailed by Reuters  When Reuters first reported the shift to Switzerland last December  the company declined to predict how its tax bill would be affected  Its overall effective tax rate in the fiscal year to September 2014 was 35 4 percent  The U S  tax code normally prohibits this type of activity  requiring foreign subsidiaries that act as buying agents for U S  based parents to send profits back to the United States to be taxed   But in 1975  Congress added an exemption  allowing offshore subsidiaries to keep profits abroad if they came from the trade of four commodities  black pepper  cocoa  coconut and tea  Coffee  bananas and crude rubber were added in 1978   Clearly  there are benefits to operating in Switzerland besides tax savings  At least half the 90 million bags of coffee traded each year goes through Switzerland based companies  according to the Swiss Trading and Shipping Association  and the country is a center for commodity finance and logistics  Still  the tax exemption provides an incentive for Keurig  the tax experts said  Starbucks made a similar move in 2001  establishing Starbucks Coffee Trading Company in Lausanne  A source familiar with that move said the agricultural commodities exemption was a key factor  In a written statement in response to questions from Reuters about its arrangement  Starbucks said  we comply with all relevant tax rules  laws  OECD  Organization for Economic Co operation and Development  guidelines and pay a global effective tax rate of 34 percent    There is a downside to the tax strategy that can be associated with the shift  The profits will need to be kept offshore  as once they are brought back to the U S  they can be taxed  That is fine if a company needs the money for a big expansion overseas   which was the case with Starbucks in the past 14 years   Keurig  which did 87 percent of its business in the United States last year  and almost all the rest in Canada  has said overseas growth is a  key element  of its business strategy and last year began introducing its brewers in the United Kingdom  South Korea  Australia and Sweden  according to a corporate filing  Keurig has previously said a small group of staff would move from the U S  to Switzerland but it has declined to be specific about how many positions will be eliminated in Vermont  telling local media it will be fewer than 100  Keurig Trading has been hiring several buyers in Switzerland from Swiss commodities traders  While Keurig Trading will be arranging the shipment of beans from places like Brazil or Colombia to where they are roasted and sold  the coffee s trajectory will not change and there are unlikely to be any beans physically passing through Switzerland  That has largely been the case for Starbucks  according to several sources with knowledge of the arrangement  It is unclear how much tax Keurig  whose shares have been sinking for much of this year because of a drop in sales  will save in the move  The tax specialists interviewed said it was difficult to estimate Keurig s total tax savings without knowing the internal transfer price at which the Swiss arm sells coffee to the U S  parent  which Keurig has declined to disclose  In its last fiscal year  Keurig committed to buying  407 7 million worth of coffee  During a 2012 investigation into Starbucks  United Kingdom tax payments  Member of Parliament Margaret Hodge accused the world s largest coffee chain of  exporting your profits to minimize your tax    Starbucks  then chief financial officer Troy Alstead testified that its Swiss operation charges other Starbucks entities a 20 percent markup on beans  which coffee traders say is well above industry norms of more like 1 2 percent  When the exemption was introduced in the 1970s  industry lobbyists argued it was necessary because the commodities included were not grown in the United States in  commercially marketable quantities    That logic might make sense if the companies set up subsidiaries in countries where the agricultural commodities are grown and paid local taxes there  the experts said  But in reality  buying subsidiaries are normally set up in places like Switzerland  which have  no connection to where the commodity is grown or where it is destined   said Bret Wells  associate law professor at the University of Houston   In addition to Starbucks and Keurig  companies with Swiss trading subsidiaries that could benefit from the exemption include spice seller McCormick  NYSE MKC    Co  the largest U S  importer of black pepper  and Chiquita Brands International  the largest U S  importer of bananas  which is owned by Brazilian juice company Cutrale Group and investment firm Safra Group  McCormick and Chiquita did not respond to requests for comment    It doesn t make sense  I don t know why it s there   said Larry Pollack  tax partner at KPMG in New York  who said he once advised a client to take advantage of the exemption   Someone must have had a strong lobby back then

95505,317020,SBUX,Obama chips away at Cuba embargo  discusses efforts with Raul Castro,news,By Matt Spetalnick  Patricia Zengerle and Daniel Trotta WASHINGTON HAVANA  Reuters    The United States announced new rules on Friday to further ease trade  travel and investment restrictions with Cuba  but Cuban President Raul Castro told President Barack Obama that Washington should go even further and lift its economic embargo on the Communist ruled island  The rare phone call between the two leaders followed the unveiling of changes that will allow certain U S  companies to establish offices in Cuba  expand banking and Internet activities and eliminate limits on the amount of money that can be taken there  U S  officials said  Despite Castro s appeal  the broader 53 year old U S  embargo will remain in place  and only Congress can remove it   something majority Republicans are considered highly unlikely to do anytime soon  Aides to Obama touted the latest steps  which he implemented with his executive powers in defiance of critics in Congress  as a way to boost business and promote economic and political reform in Cuba  They also mark Obama s continuing effort to chip away at the embargo since a thaw  Critics of Obama s detente slammed the move as another reward to Cuba with no corresponding concessions from Havana  especially on the human rights front  The changes  while significant  stop short of allowing across the board investment by U S  companies or general U S  tourism  activities banned under the embargo itself   They come as Washington and Havana inch toward normal relations after more than half a century of hostility that followed Cuba s 1959 revolution  The two countries restored diplomatic ties and reopened embassies earlier this summer  Speaking for the first time since their historic meeting in Panama in April  Obama and Castro discussed ways to advance the normalization process  including steps they  can take together and individually   the White House said in a statement  In a separate statement released almost simultaneously in Havana  the Cuban government said   President Raul Castro stressed the need to deepen the reach  of the new regulations  and to eliminate definitively the blockade policy  for the benefit of both countries    Both governments lauded Pope Francis for his role in facilitating rapprochement late last year between the two former Cold War foes  The pope will visit Cuba this weekend before heading to the United States next week   Set to take effect on Monday  the new U S  regulations build on others Obama announced in January to begin lowering economic barriers with Cuba    A stronger  more open U S  Cuba relationship has the potential to create economic opportunities for both Americans and Cubans alike   U S  Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said  Obama s term ends at the start of 2017 and his unilateral steps to loosen the embargo also appear aimed at advancing normalization with Cuba far enough that any future Republican president would be unable to reverse it  BALL IN CUBA S COURT U S  officials said the full impact of the eased restrictions will depend on whether Cuba makes economic reforms of its own  Some White House aides have privately accused Havana of dragging its feet on such changes for fear of losing its grip on the state run economy and Cuban society  Castro s government  while working to improve ties  has repeatedly made clear that full normalization will require complete lifting of the embargo and the return of the U S  naval base at Guantanamo Bay on the eastern tip of the island  The initial reaction from the American business community was cautious  U S  companies have shown interest in exploring opportunities in Cuba  but many executives remain wary of the risks  The two countries  outstanding legal claims against each other remain a key source of uncertainty  Bacardi  the world s largest privately held spirits maker  was among the most successful companies in Cuba before its Cuban assets were seized by the government and its founders exiled in the 1960s  The company said on Friday it was  way too early  to talk about any possible return to the island   We will need to wait and see what the impacts are   Bacardi said in a statement   American Express   N AXP  said it was  planning on initiating business activities in Cuba  but said it did not have a timeline  Seth Eisen  a spokesman for MasterCard  N MA   said   People  are  starting to think about the market  and it will take time for the infrastructure to develop  from phone lines to Internet access to the terminals themselves   Sprint Corp  N S  said it would expand mobile phone roaming service to Cuba  But  Starbucks Corp   O SBUX  said it had no plans to enter Cuba  Critics accused Obama of making concessions to a country that was not reciprocating   U S  Senator Marco Rubio  a Cuban American lawmaker and a Republican candidate for next year s presidential election  said  President Obama s eagerness to please the Castro regime knows no bounds   But Senator Jeff Flake  one of several Republicans who have publicly backed the opening to Cuba  told Reuters   Anything that makes it easier to do business in Cuba and to assist Cubans who are trying to work outside the state structure is a good thing    Under the rules released by the U S  Treasury and Commerce Departments  certain companies can establish subsidiaries or joint ventures as well as open offices  stores and warehouses in Cuba  They also allow for telecommunications and Internet services between the nations   Although the regulations do not change who can travel to Cuba  the rules do ease movement of authorized travelers by licensing transportation providers  The regulations also abolish the cap on remittances and allow the travelers to open and maintain bank accounts there  But it keeps in place prohibitions on any of those funds going to the Cuban government or Communist Party officials ,2015-09-18,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/u.s.-moves-to-open-up-business-with-cuba,-ease-embargo-362326",362326

95511,317026,SBUX,US Economy Adds 223 000 Jobs In June,news,"By   

U S  employment rose by 223 000 jobs in June and the unemployment rate fell to 5 3 percent  the Labor Department said Thursday  The report was forecast to show employers adding 230 000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate was expected to tick down to 5 4 percent  according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters 
The report comes after U S  job growth rebounded sharply in April and May following a sharp hiring downturn in March 
Economists are seeing a favorable trend this year  high end jobs in business and professional services continue to show growth  increasing by 64 000 in June  in line with the average monthly gain of 57 000 over the prior 12 months 
 We all know of the stories of people finishing college and ended up working for Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  after the financial crisis  Now we re finally seeing jobs for architects  engineers and computer scientists going up in the numbers   said William Spriggs  chief economist at AFL CIO 
This will help boost average wages because its means the economy is tipping towards adding jobs that are higher wage jobs  Spriggs said 
The U S  had previously added at least 200 000 jobs per month for 12 consecutive months following February s strong jobs report  a feat not seen in 20 years 
 One does presume that this is not an all you can eat jobs buffet   said Mark Hamrick  Washington bureau chief at Bankrate com   At some point the economy essentially becomes satiated but we don t think we re there just yet simply because of lack of wage gains  
The number of Americans who have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer was essentially unchanged last month  at 2 1 million  constituting 25 8 percent of the unemployed  The average hourly earnings for private sector workers fell by 1 cent to  24 95  For most workers  however  real wages have fallen or remained flat for more than three decades 
Meanwhile  many Americans who work part time jobs want to work full time  and nearly two thirds who are able to work have dropped out of the labor force  the highest proportion opting out of the workforce since the 1970s  The labor force participation rate was little changed at 62 6 percent  according to the report released Friday 
The participation rate still hovers near a 30 year low because improvements in the labor market are being offset by structural headwinds coming from demographics  baby boomers are retiring and young professionals are going back to school 
The precipitous drop in oil prices over the last 12 months  economists expect to continue to see job losses related to energy  such as the oil and mining sector because as investment in those areas declines  employment in those areas will decrease too 
Employment in mining fell for the sixth month in a row  Since a recent high in December 2014  employment in mining has declined by 71 000  with losses concentrated in support activities for mining 
However  information technology continues to see strong growth across the retail  insurance and enterprise space as companies upgrade their mobile infrastructure and software applications  said Sal DiFranco  executive vice president at recruiting firm DHR International  Experts are also seeing strong growth in the device and wearable market space  as well as engineering and sales positions 
 Some of the hottest regions right now for jobs are in Texas  Boston and obviously San Francisco with the technology hubs that are located there  but also surprisingly a lot of growth in Chicago and Washington D C    DiFranco said 
A robust nonfarm payrolls report could provide further evidence the U S  economy is on strong enough footing to absorb the impact of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike in September  The looming question now is how the economy further reduces an unemployment rate stuck at roughly 5 5 percent since earlier in the year 
 All the signs point to more strong jobs growth   said Dan North  chief economist at Euler Hermes   The unemployment rate may remain unchanged or even slightly tick up because there are more people coming back into the labor force  and that s a strong sign  
Most economists pushed back expectations the U S  Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in June as a result of March s disappointing jobs data  coupled with a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter 
 The general view is there will be a serious discussion about raising rates in September  unless a jobs report comes in way off base from what people are expecting to see   said Tara Sinclair  chief economist at Indeed com 
The increases  which would be the first in nearly a decade  have not yet come and interest rates remain at historic lows since the financial crisis in 2008

Johnson and Johnson   NYSE JNJ   is elbow deep in legislation right now  In February  JNJ had to shell out  72 million to the family of an Alabama woman who died of ovarian cancer claiming their baby powder and talcum products were to blame  Yesterday  a jury ordered the company to pay  55 million to another plaintiff alleging the products caused her to develop ovarian cancer  The case is one of about 1 200 lawsuits the company is being slapped with because of baby powder 
Say it ain t so  Baby powder causing cancer  Are you telling me that the tingling sensation I m getting with Sanofy s   NYSE SNY   Gold Bond is actually a bad thing  Should I be reconsidering the Bayer   OTC BAYRY   Dr  Sholls I ve been using on my feet for years  I can t keep my closet full of Jordan s fresh without a little help from Church and Dwight s   NYSE CHD   Arm and Hammer  Maybe there s a trend here  Easy on the white powder people  Baby powder  cancer  Sugar  diabetes  Tylenol  liver failure  Excedrin  ulcers  And I haven t even mentioned the obvious white powders you should be avoiding 
To put the ruling in perspective   72 million pales in comparison to the  17 9 billion in sales for JNJ last quarter  Analysts really aren t worried about the lawsuits though  Eleven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the next year  The bullish attitude has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate from  6 85 to  6 99  The current year consensus has also jumped  moving from  6 50 to  6 59 as ten analysts have increased their earnings estimates  Both of these are big reasons why it s a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  right now

95518,317033,SBUX,Starbucks Long Term Prospects Bright Despite Lackluster Q2,opinion,"We issued an updated research report on Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   on Apr 21 
On Jan 21  Starbucks reported second quarter fiscal 2016 results  Adjusted second quarter earnings of 39 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  sales fell short of expectations  On a year over year basis  earnings surged 18   while sales rose 9  
Higher sales in China and the U S  offset a relatively softer performance in Europe  Comps grew 6   less than 8  the previous quarter  due to declining global traffic trends  Global traffic rose 2  in the quarter  less than 4  increase in the previous quarter 
Though the second quarter results were lackluster  Starbucks s operating fundamentals remain strong and the company is poised for solid growth  going forward 
We believe that digital efforts like Mobile Order and Pay  delivery services and third party loyalty partnerships  food and beverage innovation  lunch and evening programs  Starbucks Reserve premium coffees and Teavana teas should fuel stronger comps growth in the Americas in fiscal 2016 
The coffee giant s latest digital initiative  Mobile Order and Pay  is witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in 2016 as adoption increases  This initiative allows customers to order before arriving at a Starbucks caf  and pick up the items at their preferred Starbucks outlet  thus saving time  The company currently processes over 8 million transactions every month  Mobile Order and Pay transactions represented approximately 4  of total transactions in the quarter  up 40  sequentially 
Starbucks started food and beverage delivery through its employees at New York s Empire State building last October  The company also began testing food and beverage delivery in collaboration with on demand delivery service  Postmates  in a few areas of Seattle last December  These initiatives are expected to quicken service  increase convenience and enhance customer loyalty  thereby driving mobile payment transactions and in turn  traffic 
Further  CPG growth across the world as well as international expansion will enhance value creation  Starbucks has entered into a new partnership agreement with Keurig  The agreement will make way for improved economics along with providing more flexibility to sell directly to several key alternative channels such as offices and hospitals 
Starbucks also plans to sell Starbucks branded Nespresso compatible pods in Europe later this year  This should help the company in expanding its single serve offering globally  The joint ventures in China with partner Tingyi and in Latin America with PepsiCo  Inc    NYSE PEP   remain on track to launch ready to drink beverages later this year 
In terms of international expansion  Starbucks plans to enter new markets like Luxembourg and Italy in the EMEA  Europe  Middle East and Africa  region in 2016  In the CAP  China  Asia Pacific  region  Starbucks plans a twofold increase in the CAP store count to roughly 10 000 and threefold increase in the CAP revenues to over  3 billion by 2019 
However  accelerated global employee and digital investments can keep fiscal 2016 profits under pressure  Over the past couple of quarters  higher employee expenses  mainly in the U S   as well as digital investments put pressure on profits 
Starbucks  employee investments in fiscal 2015 included higher pay rates for barista and shift supervisors  additional performance based recognition programs  new food benefit policies and online college education program in collaboration with Arizona State University  In fiscal 2016  employee investments will include wage and benefit increases and even housing benefits in some countries  Moreover  the company will increase digital investments  both in the U S  and its largest international markets 
In fiscal 2016  management expects employee and digital investments between  275 million and  300 million as against roughly  145 million a year ago  These investments are likely to erode fiscal 2016 earnings growth

95523,317038,SBUX,How Strong Is The Economy Really ,opinion,"In the six years since the recovery began  there has been endless debate over the strength of the U S  economy  There are basically two sides of the debate  Those taking the positive side maintain the economy has almost returned to its pre crisis levels and is on a firm footing  The opposing camp maintains that while the upper classes are in fine shape  the middle class is still hurting from the residual damage inflicted by the housing bubble implosion and credit crash  Is one side entirely mistaken or is there truth to both assertions 
And what about the U S  retail picture  The following graph shows our New Economy Index  NEI   which is a real time measure of the overall strength or weakness in the U S  retail economy  As the chart shows  NEI is testing its previous all time high and may well make a token new high by the end of this week  The index is reflecting strong retail sales from online firms like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   as well as healthy shipping volumes from Fed Ex  NYSE FDX   The NEI is telling us that the overall U S  retail sales climate is quite firm as we head closer to summer 

Although many business owners remain worried over growth prospects  mainly because of overseas woes  consumers don t seem to share this concern  They just keep spending as the NEI chart suggests  Even discretionary consumer stock components in the NEI like Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX  are seeing healthy demand  a sign that the retail economy is anything but weak 
Is it possible  however  that the bulk of retail spending is being done by upper middle and upper class shoppers without widespread participation among the  middle  middle class  Neal Gabler  writing in the May issue of Atlantic magazine  made the startling discovery that fully 47 percent of Americans would have a hard time coming up with  400 for an emergency expense and would have to borrow or sell something to raise the cash 
Commenting on this trend  Carolyn O Hara of The Week wrote 

 Opportunities are eroding  and nearly all the wealth created in recent years has gone to the top 10 percent of wage earners  a middle income American family actually makes 7 percent less  in inflation adjusted terms  than it did 15 years ago  

Indeed  for many Americans the recovery has hardly been felt  Although the unemployment rate is now 5 percent with jobless claims at their lowest level since 1973  those numbers are misleading according to Sarah Kendzior  Writing in Qz com  Kendzior stated that those numbers hide a

 devastating story of underemployment  wage loss  and precariousness that defines life for millions of Americans  

Since 2008  for instance  the labor participation rate has fallen from a high of 67 3 percent in 2000 to 62 6 percent today  which is a 38 year low   The jobless number is low because millions of people have given up looking for work  even though they might still very much like a job   Kendzior said 
Kendzior also pointed out the growing number of workers involved in the  1099 economy   which involves freelance and contract workers  The share of such workers has grown from 10 1 percent in 2005 to 15 8 percent in 2015  These workers are counted as  employed  by government statisticians despite the tenuous  often temporary nature of their work  Moreover  44 percent of the new jobs created between 2008 and 2012 were in the low paid service sector 
On a related note  direct participation in the stock market by the middle class is on the wane  Only 52 percent of Americans now say they own stock  according to a Gallup poll  matching a record low set in 2013  Stock ownership peaked just prior to the onset of the 2008 financial crisis  when nearly two thirds of Americans were invested in equities 
Clearly  then  the fortunes of the U S  middle class have been drastically reduced  The surging popularity of Donald Trump as a presidential candidate is certainly a huge cultural indicator of the level of discontent within the middle class  Whether the decline is terminal is a matter for debate  There are some factors  however  which if realized could serve as a temporary palliative for the middle class malaise 
One such factor would be a significant weakening of the U S  dollar  Dollar weakness isn t something that most middle class consumers look forward to  especially since it entails higher prices for food and fuel  But the dollar strength of the last couple of years has actually held back the economy from growing at a more rapid pace  A stronger dollar encourages cash hoarding and is a symptom of global deflation  which in its turn engenders fear among investors  This has kept the trillions in QE money from flowing out of savings and into the economy where it is needed  In other words  it has helped to suppress the velocity of money 

A weaker dollar would also kick start the global economy again by allowing commodity dependent countries to rebound  which in turn would help the U S  economy recover  Most importantly  it would remove the single biggest fear which has held back commitments from global investors  namely China s slowdown  A weaker dollar would almost certainly help China recover and remove the obstacle which has caused more trouble for the U S  stock market and economy in the last year 
Additional dollar weakness would also help stimulate the commencement of a new inflationary cycle after several years of near deflation  Normally this would be something to be avoided  but given the global undercurrent of deflation a healthy dose of inflation would be most welcome  Most importantly  it would serve to loosen up the massive amounts of sidelined cash and could give the middle class a desperately needed break  if only a temporary one 
Global warming  Where s Waldo 
According to The New York Times  2016 is already on track to a  record breaking start for shattering global temperatures   The Times said this year has already been  the hottest year to date  with January  February and March higher than the year ago temperatures  It was widely trumpeted that each of the two previous years were also  hottest years on record   according to data kept by NOAA and NASA 
The old saying   Follow the money trail   definitely applies to the climate change agenda due to governments  attempts to impose taxes and restrictions on businesses that allegedly contribute to it  Global warming theory is more than just a scientific curiosity  it s an economic issue of monolithic proportions  It has also attracted its fair share of data fabrication and outright lies 
Listening to climatologists  one would think that temperatures everywhere are unbearably hot  particularly in southern climates  For most of us living in the U S  and other Western Hemisphere countries  however  everyday experience doesn t always bear this out 
When it comes to the phenomenon known as global warming  a cursory examination of the daily temperature record  which hasn t been massaged by politically biased researchers  leads us to ask the following question   Where s Waldo  
The reference of course is to the well known children s book character made famous for his uncanny ability to conceal his presence in any situation  The reader is exhorted to find Waldo hiding somewhere in the crowd  The same task could easily be asked of individuals seeking the truth about supposedly rising global temperatures and its consequences  Where exactly is the everyday proof that temperatures are universally rising 
For the better part of the last decade I ve recorded daytime high temperatures at my residence in coastal North Carolina  Here s what the trend actually looks like  FYI  it was generated in Excel as a simple daily line graph 

Again I would ask  where s Waldo  Clearly there is no discernible temperature trend in my corner of the Southeastern U S  The yearly fluctuation of temperatures adheres to a fairly predictable seasonal cyclicality  At no point in the last nine years has there been a significant deviation from the annual mean  The data in the above graph from the last three years also contradicts the assertion that  global temperatures   however that is defined  hit record highs in each of those years 
It stands to reason  moreover  that what is true for Topsail Island  NC is also likely true for a large section of the Southeastern U S  Atlantic coastal region  If we re not experiencing rising temperatures there undoubtedly are other parts of the country that aren t  either  It further begs the question as to how exactly  global temperatures  are calculated by the climatologists who insist upon the veracity of the global warming theory 
When I first learned of the global warming theory in 1987  we were told by climatologists that within 20 years temperatures would universally be rising and likely on a yearly basis   so much so that we would all feel it  They were very wrong  The above temperature graph amply demonstrates that in a 10 year period there has been no rising trend in at least one portion of the globe  If rising temperatures aren t truly universal  then  global warming  is a misnomer ",2016-05-11,Clif Droke,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-strong-is-the-economy-really-200129231,200129231

95538,317053,SBUX,Dividends  True Contribution to Total Return May Surprise You,opinion,"Introduction
In recent years  dividends  contribution to total return has been one of the most heavily studied topics in the investment world  Several conclusions about the contribution that dividends make to total return have been claimed  However  these conclusions vary greatly  I have seen studies claiming that 90  of returns are attributed to dividends  several claiming 50  or more  and others arguing for a 30  contribution  Ironically  they all seem to be correct depending on the data sets and or timeframes being measured 
Nevertheless  I am on record of not being a fan of the typical academic study applied to finance  I have several problems with conclusions drawn from studies  but my major issue is with what I consider the over generalized nature of how they are conducted  Consequently  I believe that although their conclusions may be valid based on the data as presented  I also believe they can be very misleading 
Here are but a few examples of conclusions that I contend can mislead investors  On December 6  2010 the heads of Black Rock s global equity team suggested that 90  of US equity returns over the last century have been delivered by dividends and dividend growth  A prominent money management firm reported that according to Standard   Poor s  the portion of total return attributable to dividends has ranged from a high of 53  during the 1940s  to a low of 14  during the 1990s  Standard   Poor s themselves suggest that more than a third of the long term total return of the S P 500 can be attributed to dividends  And I have read other studies that conclude that dividend paying stocks dramatically outperform stocks that pay no dividends 
Now remember  the above are just a few samplings  In truth  there are numerous other studies that have presented varying conclusions about dividends  contribution to total returns  As a result  I commonly come across investors quoting conclusions about dividends from studies or holding what I consider misguided opinions about dividends  dividend paying stocks and non dividend paying stocks  Therefore  my objective with this article is to provide a more rational examination of the contributions  or their lack thereof  that dividends actually generate 
My primary position is that the contributions that dividends make vary greatly from one company to the next  This is aligned with my general position that it is a market of stocks and not a stock market  Therefore  rather than basing decisions on overly generalized conclusions about the merits of dividend paying stocks over non dividend paying stocks  I prefer a more individualized approach 
In other words  there are certain stocks where dividends matter a great deal  and there are certain stocks where dividends are completely irrelevant  My point being  that trying to associate dividends with returns is  in my opinion and experience  a flawed approach  Instead  I favor analyzing and evaluating the contributions that dividends have made to total return on a specific case by case basis 
At this point  I want it to be clear that I am not either for or against dividends in the general sense  If income is your primary investment objective  then obviously dividend paying stocks make a great deal of sense  Moreover  if highest total return is your objective  then growth stocks might be your best choice  But most importantly  I intend to demonstrate that total return is not a function of whether a company pays a dividend or not  There are many factors that drive total return  and dividends are only one of them 
Debunking the Dividend Paying Stocks Produces Higher Total Returns Myth and Vice Versa
As I suggested in the introduction  dividends  contribution to total return has been one of the most widely studied topics in finance  When conducting research for this article  I reviewed several studies on dividends  However  for the purposes of this article  I am going to utilize a study  white paper  titled  produced by Dr  Ian Mortimer and Matthew Page  CFA fund co managers of Guinness Atkinson Funds 
Like most studies and white papers I ve reviewed  I felt this presentation was very well done and I thought it made some excellent and important points about investing in dividend stocks  Moreover  I believe that their data as presented was accurate  and therefore  the conclusions drawn also accurate as presented  However  I believe the results  although accurate  are too general in nature to support absolute conclusions regarding dividend paying stocks versus non dividend paying stocks 
Nevertheless  for those investors that favor or follow investing in dividend paying stocks  this white paper will support their investment philosophy and beliefs  Personally  I felt this work covers many of the important salient points supporting investing in dividend paying stocks in the general sense  Therefore  I would wholeheartedly support much of what is written in this white paper 
My only problem is with the over generalized insinuation that dividend paying stocks are superior to non dividend paying stocks  In truth  with certain individual stocks that can be true  but I argue that it cannot  and should not be considered a universal principle  The truth is that some dividend paying stocks are superior to non dividend paying stocks and some non dividend paying stocks are superior to dividend paying stocks  The only true conclusion that I believe can be drawn is that it depends on the business characteristics of each individual company 
To illustrate my point  I will provide excerpts from the above document followed by examples of some companies via  that support and some that refute the conclusions drawn  My first excerpt includes the introduction to the article  followed by some general conclusions and a supporting graphic of dividends  contribution to the S P 500  It is this kind of evidence that erroneously leads many investors into believing that dividend paying stocks perform better and account for higher total returns  And frankly  on the surface  the arguments appear compelling 

 Why Dividends Matter
Introduction Investors seem to be rediscovering the power of dividends as an important element in the pursuit of long term total returns  Following the financial crisis of 2008 9 and the resultant fall out  traditional sources of income such as government and corporate bonds and cash  lost their luster  In this paper we aim to show that  for the long term investor  the power of dividends from equity investing has never been diminished and has in fact been slowly and surely working away  behind the scenes  adding not just appreciation in the form of total returns but can mitigate the effects of both market falls and inflation  PROFITS ARE A MATTER OF OPINION  DIVIDENDS ARE A MATTER OF FACT Dividends are paid from real earnings and in  hard  dollars   they cannot be manipulated by creative accounting  A dollar paid out to the investor is just that 
 Figure 3 below shows how the importance of dividends to total returns increases with time horizon  For an average holding period of 1 year  dividends accounted for 27  of total returns for the S P500 since 1940  If we increase the holding period to 3 years  dividends account for 38   5 years it increases to 42   over a 10 year period it rises to 48   and with a 20 year holding period dividends account for some 60  of total returns  It is important to note  too  that here we are just looking at the S P500 as a whole and not focusing purely on companies that actually pay a dividend  If we did  we think these results would likely be even more striking  


Dividend Aristocrats
This next excerpt argues in favor of companies like those found in the Dividend Aristocrats universe  I am personally invested in many Dividend Aristocrats precisely for the reasons stated below  However  I rarely invest in Dividend Aristocrats in order to achieve the highest possible total return  Instead  I invest in Dividend Aristocrats because they typically produce an above average and consistently growing income stream 

 If a company has a long history of paying a dividend and is very likely to continue to do so in the future  then it is highly likely that management will begin each new year by first deciding the dividend payout and then thinking about how best to use the rest of the free cash flow  This leaves no room for vanity projects or frivolous uses of shareholders capital  A focused management team that uses the cash available to them efficiently is central to creating a well run   and profitable   company that is able to grow and thrive in the future  Steady and constantly growing dividends can give us a good indication that these elements are in place   

The Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  Procter   Gamble is an extremely high quality company  and as the performance results below illustrate  it has moderately outperformed the S P 500 on both a total cumulative income and capital appreciation basis since fiscal year end June 1996  
On the other hand  since fiscal year end June 2010  Procter   Gamble has dramatically underperformed the S P 500 on a capital appreciation basis  but did moderately outperform on a total cumulative dividend income paid basis  Nevertheless  Procter   Gamble s total return was significantly lower than the total return of the S P 500 over this timeframe  Just because a company pays a dividend  it does not automatically follow that it will be an outperformer  
Low Yield Above Average Growth
 Not all dividend paying stocks are the same  Some have high yields and pay out a significant portion of earnings  while others offer lower yields with lower payout ratios  Lower yields and lower payout ratios can often be associated with faster growing businesses that require cash to fund their growth  This next excerpt from the paper cited above addresses these needs or requirements  But most importantly  if you read it closely  it also indicates the diversity that exists among dividend payers 

 Dividend payments can act as a useful barometer to identify companies that are disciplined and efficient in their capital allocation and cash flow management  There exists an argument  however  that companies who pay a dividend are just struggling to find new growth opportunities and uses for their cash 
We think quite the opposite  In the early stages of a company s life it is quite right that cash is used to establish the business  It is often right that the company continues to re deploy cash into the business as it moves through the early growth phase and into the maturity phase  Once at maturity  however  when competition has entered the market place and the opportunities for such high growth have diminished  we think it entirely sensible that the company takes stock  and carefully decides to allocate cash to only those projects where it can achieve high returns   and gives the rest back to shareholders  Why would we want management to plough back all the company s cash regardless of the returns available  

CR Bard Inc  NYSE BCR  
Multinational developer and marketer of medical technologies  CR Bard  is also a Dividend Aristocrat  however  it possesses growth and dividend payment characteristics that are significantly different from what we saw with Procter   Gamble  CR Bard offers investors a very low yield and a low payout ratio  This is an example of a company that is growing at above average rates and continues to need capital to fund that growth   Even with its low yield and low dividend payout ratio  fast growing CR Bard has significantly outperformed the S P 500 on both capital appreciation and total cumulative dividends paid  But importantly as it relates to the thesis of this article  the majority of total return has come through capital appreciation  In other words  earnings growth  not dividends are what created such a high return  High Yield Moderate Growth
To further illustrate how different various dividend paying stocks can be  I offer two additional Dividend Aristocrats offering high yield but moderate growth  The first is a healthcare REIT and the other a utility stock  Both of these dividend paying stocks represent examples of investments where a significant portion of total return comes from dividends  However  with both examples  capital appreciation lagged the S P 500 
HCP Inc  NYSE HCP  
Consolidated Edison Inc  NYSE ED  

Growth Morphing to Dividend Growth
My next two examples represent well known growth stocks that have only recently morphed into dividend paying stocks  When you analyze the past performance of these two examples  there are two interesting things to note  Both of these companies have outperformed the S P 500 on a total cumulative dividends paid basis since their 1997 fiscal year ends  This is in spite of the fact that they ve only paid dividends in recent years  However  the majority of their total returns have been generated through capital appreciation and both have soundly outperformed the S P 500 

Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX 
 
Note  the timeframe for this performance calculation is slightly different than my other examples because of the company s September fiscal year end  Therefore  the S P 500 performance calculation is also calculated over a slightly different timeframe  
Amgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN 
 
Performance  S P 500 Non dividend Payers
These next excerpts from the paper cited above claims that dividend paying stocks outperform non payers  The language in the second excerpt is especially strong indicating that dividends have been the main contributors to total return in equity investments  However  I have already presented several examples that prove that this conclusion is not universally valid 

 There are always exceptions to any rule  and there will always be examples of companies that have such a unique product or service that they can continue to grow for much longer than the average company  Simple mathematics  however  dictates that even these companies cannot grow forever  Indeed  if we look at the historical evidence for the benefits of company management focusing on dividends we can see a strong relation between total return performance and the company s approach to dividend policy  
 The evidence for this can be seen in Figure 1 not shown here   If we split all the companies in the S P500 into separate buckets depending on their approach to dividends  we can see that dividend payers have outperformed the broad market  and dividend nonpayers significantly underperformed  HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Over the long term  dividends have been the main contributors to total return in equity investments  

Monster Beverage Corporation  NASDAQ MNST 
Since December 31  1997  the non dividend payer Monster Beverage Corporation has been the best performing stock in the S P 500  No dividend paying member of the S P 500 did better  Consequently  the broad statement  dividend payers have outperformed the broad market  and dividend nonpayers significantly underperformed  is categorically false with this example  The performance generated by Monster Beverage is solely attributed to its extremely high earnings growth achievement T
Tenet Healthcare Corp  NYSE THC 
On the other hand  Tenet Healthcare Corp is one of the worst performing stocks of the S P 500 and is also a non dividend payer  The reason this particular S P 500 constituent underperformed is because its business underperformed  The lack of paying a dividend was really not a significant factor 
Summary and Conclusions
 I believe that investors should have realistic understandings and beliefs about their investments  Therefore  even though the notions that dividend paying stocks outperform non dividend paying stocks or that the majority of returns come from dividends are widely studied and promoted  they are not true in the purest sense  There are many non dividend paying stocks that are superior performers  and there are many dividend paying stocks that are also superior performers  To over generalize and state that dividend paying stocks outperform is an erroneous belief  even though there are studies that suggest it to be true 
The best reasons for choosing a stock is when you believe and understand that it is capable of meeting your specific investment objectives  Retired investors might logically choose dividend paying stocks for the income they produce  However  they should not delude themselves into believing that this will lead to outperformance or the highest possible total returns  There are many benefits to investing in dividend stocks  and many do in fact produce attractive capital appreciation 
However  I believe it is illogical to assume that the majority of your return will automatically come from dividends  or that dividends produce higher returns  In some cases they do  but in many cases they do not  Rather than make investment decisions based on generalities  I believe it makes more sense to conduct a deep analysis of the individual companies you are interested in investing in  Moreover  when you do that  you can determine how much of your return might come from dividends  and how much from potential capital appreciation  And  you are likely to discover that every company is unique and different in its own right 
I believe it is a market of stocks and not a stock market  More importantly  I believe that portfolios should be built one company at a time  and only include companies that meet your unique investment objectives  Investment returns come from numerous factors  and dividends are only one contributor  Disclosure  Long PG ED AMGN

95565,317080,SBUX,The Coming Era Of Financial Triage,opinion,"Virtually every major program of every major nation state is financially unsustainable going forward 
Though triage is typically used in a medical setting  we are entering an era when financial triage will increasingly be necessary on a household  enterprise and national level 
 may have originated during the Napoleonic Wars from the work of Dominique Jean Larrey  The term was used further during World War I by French doctors treating the battlefield wounded at the aid stations behind the front  Those responsible for the removal of the wounded from a battlefield or their care afterwards would divide the victims into three categories 
Those who are likely to live  regardless of what care they receive
Those who are likely to die  regardless of what care they receive
Those for whom immediate care might make a positive difference in outcome 
Financial triage is the process of sorting financial expenses  programs that are unsustainable and cannot be  reformed   those that cannot be saved except with systemic reforms  and those that will survive if simply scaled back 
On the household level  financial triage becomes necessary when one of the primary wage earners lose their jobs and cannot find a replacement position 
First to go are non essentials such as cable TV subscriptions  eating out at restaurants  costly coffees from Starbucks  O SBUX   etc 
But scaling back these modest expenses may not restore the household s income to expenses balance  The major expenses of transportation  housing and healthcare may have to be sorted into what can be cut and what must be allowed to expire in order to save the household from insolvency and bankruptcy 
A mortgage that exceeds the remaining wage earner s income is an example of an expense that cannot be  reformed  away  Refinancing to a lower rate of interest may trim the monthly cost a bit  but the history of mortgage  reforms  suggests many if not most households that attempt to lower fundamentally unaffordable mortgage payments end up defaulting anyway 
Slashing major expenses is not cost free  Trying to reduce healthcare insurance costs boils down to accepting high deductible plans that end up costing as much as gold plated plans once the full deductible is paid in cash 
Financial triage is intrinsically painful and wrenching  Corporations have much more practice in financial triage  as divisions or departments that aren t generating profits are sold  closed or slashed to save what can still be salvaged 
Nation states typically have near zero experience with financial triage Programs are rarely ever shut down or slashed to the bone to save core functions  cuts are modest and as soon as the crisis passes  expenses soar as everyone who suffered minor cuts demands pay raises and benefits that restore whatever was trimmed 
Virtually every major program of every major nation state is financially unsustainable going forward  Every major program is funded by wages and profits  both of which will be eviscerated in the global recession that is just starting 
Longer term  the demographics of a shrinking work force and the profit destroying forces of automation render immensely costly social and military programs unsustainable  The idea that these trillion dollar programs can be reformed saved with minor cuts and policy tweaks is delusional  to save these programs  cuts must be deep and permanent  precisely what the status quo cannot accomplish because it is politically impossible to over ride vested  entrenched interests 
Unfortunately  this inability to save what could be saved with deep cuts  reforms means programs that could have been saved will collapse  and politically acceptable half measures of  reform  will end up dragging other programs that could have been saved to the financial morgue ",2016-01-19,Charles Hugh Smith,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-coming-era-of-financial-triage-380588,380588

Starbucks biggest source of growth has come from expansion in China and Pacific Asia
The coffee retailer has focused on building out its digital and market initiatives

Today  January 21  Starbucks is scheduled to report their FQ1 2016 earnings after the market closes  Starbuck s first fiscal quarter  which saw the introduction of the controversial religious neutral red cup  is expected to be strong despite a weaker than expected FQ4 2015  Share prices rose a resounding 47  over the course of 2015 and the coffee retailer continues to be viewed favorably in the eyes of investors  For FQ1 2016  the Estimize community calls for EPS of  0 46  a penny higher than Wall Street and corporate guidance  Revenue expectations are just slightly higher at  5 39B vs  the Street s  5 38B  Compared to FQ1 2015  this represents a projected YoY increase for EPS and revenue of 14  and 12   respectively  The biggest contributor of Starbuck s success is their rapid growth in Asia Pacific  specifically China  Furthermore  strong same sales growth  improving average ticket transactions  lower coffee costs  and new offerings present the coffee retailer additional upside potential coming into 2016 

After a stronger than expected fiscal 2015  Starbuck s has the pieces in place to continue its growth into fiscal 2016  Driving this trend is a burgeoning international expansion in Asia Pacific  Currently  Starbucks has 21 000 stores in over 65 countries and plans to open over 500 new stores in China alone over 2016  Despite the fact that fourth quarter growth was at its slowest pace in 25 years for the Chinese economy  Starbucks manages to remain relevant in that market by continually reinventing themselves through new products and offerings  Compared to their multinational competitors   N MCD  and  N YUM   Starbucks is viewed as more sophisticated and on par with a higher end brand  While the Chinese economy has certainly seen better days  coffee is typically considered recession proof  Starbucks hit a rough patch during the US recession  but has likely learned from that experience  Coffee is a part of many consumers  daily routines and is an everyday luxury that people still allow themselves  Consequently  both Asian and American Starbucks locations performed well in 2015  posting strong same store sales growth  improving average ticket orders and increasing traffic  
Best known for their coffee  the Seattle based company is focusing in on higher margin food offerings such as baked goods and ready made lunches  hoping to fill in the non peak hours  That being said  coffee is still Starbuck s primary source of business and as of late  prices of the commodity have begun to fall  Financially  this has helped lower the company s cost of goods sold and improve margins  Outside of their in store offerings  Starbucks has made strides to expand its digital and marketing initiatives  The coffee retailer now offers mobile ordering and delivery services  a loyalty program  and Starbucks Reserve coffee subscription in hopes to drive business  Starbucks  like many other multinationals  faces the risks posed by a relatively strong U S  dollar  This however should not factor into what should be a strong 2016 for the coffee retailer  domestically and abroad ",2016-01-21,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-watch:-coffee-retailer-after-the-close-381120,381120

95584,317099,SBUX,Could The Unthinkable Happen In 2016 ,opinion,"The most important question investors should be asking at this point isn t whether the secular bull market which began in 2009 is over  but whether continued equity market weakness in 2016 will lead to the unthinkable  namely an economic recession  A recession in 2016 has been deemed virtually impossible by most mainstream economists  so much so that all discussion of this possibility has evaporated  And while most U S  economic data categories are still admittedly strong  the persistent weakness under the surface of the equity market over the last several months demands that the topic be reexamined 
One of the tenants of Charles Dow s conception of the stock market is that the market s primary trend is a precursor of U S  business conditions in the aggregate  Dow maintained that a steady decline of the major indices typically precedes trouble in the business economy by at least 6 9 months  And while there are a few instances when the economy was able to withstand a bear market without entering recession  such cases are the exception instead of the rule 
The stock market s problems can be traced primarily to weakness in commodities  particularly crude oil  Commodity weakness has been a result of diminished industrial demand in Asia and Europe as the leading industrial countries are still suffering the effects of the misguided tight money and austerity policies pursued by central banks and foreign governments in recent years  As predicted  those austerity chickens have come home to roost and they aren t in any hurry to leave the chicken house  If our own experience in 2008 is any guide  it will likely take the better part of 2016 for the stimulus measures enacted by the People s Bank and the ECB to have any measurable impact  and that s assuming both entities remain committed to an aggressively loose money policy 
So the bigger question is whether the U S  economy has enough forward momentum to withstand the impact of the global slowdown  The effects of this slowdown are clearly being felt by equity investors  and that should be a warning sign to economists that a consumer spending slowdown is a real possibility in 2016  Most economists consistently downplay Dow s theory that the stock market is a leading indicator  however  so any slowdown in business this year will likely take most of them by surprise  Moreover  most economic statistics that most economists rely on for making forecasts are lagging indicators  This means these numbers won t reveal a weakening domestic economy until it s too late to take preventive measures 
The key  statistic  for measuring the condition of the U S  consumer should be the stock prices of the leading consumer retail  consumer discretionary and business service and transportation stocks  Examples would include FedEx  N FDX   United Parcel Service  N UPS   Amazon  O AMZN   WalMart  N WMT   and Starbucks  O SBUX   These and other stocks are included in the New Economy Index  NEI   which I devised in 2007 to measure the underlying strength or weakness in the U S  consumer economy  Here s what the NEI looks like as of Jan  8 

Remarkably  NEI has managed to stay above its intermediate term uptrend line for months on end despite the continual erosion in the global economy  This can be attributed to the increasing willingness of consumers to make discretionary purchases  as well as their blithe unconcern at the possible domestic impact of the global slowdown  NEI is finally showing signs of weakening  however  and may be on the verge of finally breaking its intermediate term uptrend  If this happens it will be the first indication in several years that the U S  consumer is beginning to lose confidence  I should mention that the only consumer confidence that really counts is whether the consumer is actually spending money  not the opinions he expresses to some pollster on the state of the economy 
Behind the weakness is a drop in the dollar value of commodity prices  which reflects the deflationary undercurrent still present in several European and Asian nations  While deflation is no longer a major threat to the U S   the residual effects of the weak global economy are beginning to erode corporate profits  This is one reason for the internal weakness in the NYSE broad market in the last few months  A critical precursor to an improvement in the equity market then will be a reversal of the overseas economic weakness 
To that end  the European Central Bank  ECB  announced a year ago its first round of quantitative easing  QE  with monthly purchases of EUR 60 billion worth of public bonds  The European QE is expected to last until September 2016  with any extension dependent on the exigencies of the euro zone economy  The goal of this stimulus measure on the part off the ECB is to reverse the deflationary trend and hopefully replace it with some inflation 
In the March 2015 issue of Business Credit  economists for the euro zone economics team Euler Hermes S A  forecast a  positive but limited impact  for Europe s QE of 0 5 percentage points of GDP growth and 0 3 percentage points on inflation through July 2016  That forecast  which many economists shared  looks to have been a tad optimistic in light of recent developments  Although the ECB stepped up its stimulus program in December  the latest data show consumer prices have remained unchanged at an annual 0 2 percent  below consensus expectations 
Euler Hermes rightly observed that the ECB lags far behind the U S  Federal Reserve and the Bank of England when it comes to rapidly responding to deflationary threats  The Euler Hermes team also pointed out that the  transmission mechanism of QE is less clear in the euro zone because the private sector is less intertwined with financial markets than the United States or the United Kingdom   Moreover  non financial corporations in Europe tend to finance between only 10 20 percent of their debt in the market  Euro zone households have less equity market holdings  preferring savings deposits or bonds  real estate holdings also have less impact on consumption than in the U S  With these fundamental differences between the euro zone and the U S   it s easy to see that the success of Europe s QE program faces many obstacles 
The biggest hope or success of euro zone QE is  as Euler Hermes observed  the  policy signaling effect   which would theoretically help to increase business confidence and therefore raise inflation expectations and loan demand  Unfortunately  however  the ECB was late  coming to the QE party  which will make it more difficult to reverse the effects of deflation  In Euler Hermes  words   If the ECB was a credible deflation fighter  it would not need to print humongous amounts of money  the mere announcement of a credible target would trigger a virtuous circle leading to that target  
Perhaps the old saying  better late than never  applies to the ECB s attempts at staving off deflation  But given the central bank s poor track record  investors shouldn t get their hopes up too high that success will be met anytime soon 
So if European QE won t be a major factor in reversing the global economic malaise in 2016  what could possibly bring about an improvement  Confidence is the keystone of a thriving economy  as any economist will testify  When consumers  investors and business owners are confident in the strength and stability of business conditions they express this confidence by spending money  either to consume or to invest and expand business  The lack of confidence in the long term strength of the recovery is what has held back U S  economic growth in recent years  Every time it looked as if the economy was ready to take off it was hindered from doing so by some foreign threat or another  In 2015  uncertainty over the global outlook led to cost cutting and a complete lack of capital expenditures among S P 500 companies  Revenue growth and net income were also down for the year due to the strong dollar and hard hit oil sector  Thus confidence in the long term outlook has been sorely lacking 
Without confidence  the next best thing is outright fear  The type of profound fear that was common in the years immediately after the credit crisis hasn t been seen since the recovery gained traction in 2013 and beyond  While confidence is far preferable to fear  at least fear can generate the kind of action needed to stimulate the economy   much as was the case with the Fed s QE program after the crisis  So without a return of confidence in 2016  perhaps it will come down to how much fear is needed to generate concerted and aggressive action by governments and central banks in the coming months 
The U S  Congress abdicated much of its authority to the Fed in the wake of the credit crisis  Congress must reassert its authority in the nation s fiscal affairs  however  Businesses and investors would find renewed confidence in the economic outlook if taxes were lowered and regulatory burdens were lifted  The current administration has done much damage to the economy by way of increasing both  which has added to the uncertainty among investors and has hindered capital investment 
Of the two major factors   confidence and fear   it would appear the safer bet that fear  rather than confidence  will be the dominant force behind efforts at reversing the damage caused by the global economic slowdown in 2016

95595,317110,SBUX,Amid coffee rivalry  McDonald s Canada to sell java in grocery stores ,news,"By Solarina Ho TORONTO  Reuters    McDonald s Corp  N MCD  is making its McCafe ground coffee available in Canadian grocery stores this month  the fast food giant said on Tuesday  part of its broader campaign to win market share in a country long dominated by rivals like Tim Hortons Inc  TO THI  and Starbucks Corp  O SBUX  
The competition to woo Canadian coffee drinkers has intensified in recent years  while rivals have pushed into McDonald s territory by expanding their own breakfast and lunch menus in order to attract new customers and drive up spending per visit 
 Everybody s trying to scramble for customers   the chief executive of McDonald s Canada  John Betts  told Reuters 
Tim Hortons  which claims to brew nearly eight out of every 10 cups of coffee sold in Canada  last month announced a new coffee blend  marking its introduction of a second blend after 50 years in business 
Betts says that since taking over operations in Canada in 2008  his focus has helped McDonald s double its market share in coffee and triple its coffee sales  McDonald s launched the McCafe brand in Canada in 2011 
 You might say it s the thing that turned our business around here  in Canada   said Betts 
 We ve had double digit growth on a compounded basis over the last five years at breakfast time  in terms of traffic and sales  That s a significant category growth for us  
Betts  who started as a part time worker at McDonald s 44 years ago  said in his six years in Canada  McDonald s has grown its share of the coffee market while opening only a handful more restaurants  compared with the hundreds opened by competitors 
But with 78 percent of coffee drinking done at home  according to the Canadian Coffee Association  there s a bigger market that McDonald s wants to tap into 
McDonald s Canada is partnering with Kraft Canada  O KRFT  to sell its bagged medium roast ground coffee  as well the single serve formats for Tassimo and Keurig  O GMCR  in grocery stores 
The world s largest fast food chain began testing McCafe grocery sales in the United States last year and will launch nationwide in the United States in early 2015 
The push into grocery stores comes as sales at established restaurants at McDonald s globally have declined  The company has been grappling with internal missteps  brutal competition and shifting consumer preferences 
But Betts said Canada is one of McDonald s top performing markets  and it is still seeing  significant positive momentum  in growth  though he declined to provide data 
In Canada  McDonald s restaurants have had to address tougher government restrictions on bringing in temporary foreign workers following an outcry over perceived abuses of the system 

Betts said McDonald s was working with franchisees to adapt to changes  though he said that there were labor challenges in parts of the country

95604,317119,SBUX,Starbucks buying full control of Japan unit for  914 million,news,"By Lisa Baertlein  Reuters    Starbucks Corp  O SBUX  on Tuesday said it plans to buy the remaining 60 5 percent share of Starbucks Coffee Japan Ltd  T 2712  that it does not already own in a two step deal valued at about  913 5 million 
Starbucks Japan has operated as a joint venture between Starbucks and its partner Sazaby League since 1995  Over the summer  Sazaby approached the world s biggest coffee chain about selling its ownership stake in Starbucks Japan  Starbucks said in a statement 
There are roughly 1 050 Starbucks cafes in Japan  which Starbucks said will be its second largest market in terms of revenue from its coffee shops 
Despite Japan s economic difficulties  those shops have profit margins that are among the highest in the world  Starbucks executives said on a conference call with analysts 
Starbucks also has opportunities to add more shops  expand product sales through grocery and food service channels and to boost the company s relatively small share of canned coffee and other ready to drink products that are popular in Japan  they added 
Sazaby will begin tendering shares beginning on Sept  26  The purchase price for Sazaby s 39 5 percent stake is 965 yen per share  for a total of 55 billion yen  about  505 million   When that transaction is completed  Starbucks will have a controlling 79 percent interest in Starbucks Japan 
Shortly afterward  Starbucks will begin to buy the remaining 21 percent ownership interest held by public shareholders and option holders of Starbucks Japan s common stock for a purchase price of 1 465 yen per share  for a total of 44 5 billion yen  about  408 5 million  
The public price per share of 1 465 yen represents a premium of 11 6 percent to the 30 day average price of Starbucks Japan s stock  a 4 7 percent premium to the closing price on Sept  22  and a 51 8 percent premium to the price Starbucks is paying Sazaby for its shares  the company said 
All steps in the tender offer process have been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of Starbucks  Sazaby and Starbucks Japan  and the transactions are expected to be fully completed during the first half of calendar 2015  Starbucks said 
Starbucks expects the deal to be immediately accretive to earnings  excluding items

95605,317120,SBUX,Wal Mart raises healthcare costs  cuts benefits for some part timers,news,"By Nathan Layne and Siddharth Cavale  Reuters    Wal Mart Stores Inc  the biggest U S  private sector employer  said on Tuesday that its 1 3 million workers would have to pay more for healthcare and it would end benefits for some part time staff in a move that could prompt other companies to follow suit 
The world s largest retailer said it would raise health insurance premiums for its entire U S  workforce beginning in January  In addition  Wal Mart will end coverage for employees who work fewer than 30 hours a week  a change that will impact 2 percent of U S  workers  or about 30 000 people 
The move comes as U S  companies brace for a January 2015 deadline under the Affordable Care Act  Starting then  companies with 50 or more employees will have to offer health insurance to those working at least 30 hours a week  a mandate that has drawn criticism from some companies worried about higher costs 
Wal Mart  which announced the change in a blogpost on Tuesday  had cited health care expenses as a problem in August  when it cut its 2014 profit forecast  It said more people than expected had enrolled in its plans and its annual forecast for health care costs had risen by 50 percent 
 Like every company  Wal Mart continues to face rising health care costs   Sally Welborn  senior vice president of global benefits  wrote in the blogpost on the company s website   This year  the expenses were significant and led us to make some tough decisions as we begin our annual enrollment  
Wal Mart said the bi weekly premiums for its most popular and lowest cost employee only plans will rise by  3 50 to  21 90  which represents a 19 percent increase  Wal Mart workers earn on average  12 92 an hour 
The decision to reduce coverage came a week before the company s chief executive  Doug McMillion  is due to face fund managers and analysts at an annual meeting for the investment community  Wal Mart has been struggling to boost profits  with U S  same store sales flat or declining for the last six quarters 
Wal Mart said the move would bring it in line with many of its competitors  Target Corp  N TGT  and Home Depot Inc  N HD  recently announced cuts to benefits in light of the Affordable Care Act 
According to consulting firm Mercer  62 percent of large retailers did not offer health care benefits to part time workers as of 2013  a comparatively high rate that reflects low wages and high turnover in the industry  That figure drops to 37 percent for companies overall 
Brian Yarbrough  an analyst at Edward Jones  said the decision by Wal Mart could force other retailers to rethink what benefits they provide 
All retailers are  trying to cut expenses  to keep things lean   Yarbrough said   At some point you start looking across the board  and this is probably the next place to start looking at cuts  
SILVER LINING 
Some big retailers  such as coffee chain Starbucks Corp  O SBUX  and Costco  O COST  offer health coverage to part time employees 
Critics of Wal Mart s decision said it would primarily hurt lower income workers  many of whom are being left behind in the economic recovery 
The jobless rate fell to a six year low of 5 9 percent in September  according to the U S  Labor Department  But that number would be much higher if it included the 7 1 million Americans who are working part time but say they need full time jobs 
 Taking away access to healthcare  even though many of my co workers couldn t afford it anyway  is just another example of Walmart manipulating the system to keep workers like me in a state of financial crisis   Nancy Reynolds  a cashier at a Wal Mart in Florida and member of Our Walmart  a group pushing for better wages and benefits  said in an email from the group 
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was not unusual to hear reports of large companies reducing or eliminating health care benefits  Speaking to reporters on Air Force One  he said the difference now is that workers  have a legitimate alternative where they can acquire high quality  affordable health care  and that is through the marketplaces that were constructed by the Affordable Care Act  
Others also noted a potential silver lining for some employees who could now apply for government subsidies on the public exchanges for which they would not have been eligible if covered by a corporate plan 
 There is another way employees can get coverage and for some employees it will actually may be a good thing because they ll get a subsidy   said Beth Umland  research director for health and benefits at Mercer 
Wal Mart s Welborn said on a conference call that the company had not yet figured out how much it would save by cutting benefits  The company said in August it expected to spend  500 million on U S  healthcare this year  up from its estimate of  330 million just a few months earlier 
Of Wal Mart s 1 3 million U S  employees  the company said 1 2 million currently elect to be covered under the company s health insurance plans 
The company said it was changing some eligibility terms for part time employees working more than 30 hours a week  but did not provide details

95608,317123,SBUX,5 Stocks To Watch  SBUX  LNKD  EXPE  EA  XOM,opinion,"Starbucks  O SBUX 
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports October 29  after the close 
Cult favorite stock  Starbucks  has an Estimize EPS consensus of  0 45  one penny higher than Wall Street and 22  higher than the year ago result  Revenues of  4 915B are also ahead of the Street s estimate for  4 888B 

What to watch  Starbucks is leading the restaurant industry in mobile and is reshaping the way people order and pay  Close to 20  of all transactions are now mobile and customers using the app tend to spend more  Starbucks mobile order   pay app launched this spring in the US and was recently released in Canada and the UK as well  The app allows customers to order and pay ahead of time and is already gaining a lot of traction  To fill in non peak hours such as lunch  the coffee company is focusing on higher margin offerings  aka food  Late last year Starbucks said it plans to double its annual revenue from food in the U S  to more than  4 billion in the next five years  The company acknowledged that the quality of its food didn t always match the quality of its coffee  so it acquired Bay Bread LLC and its line of La Boulange baked goods in 2012  Starbucks also keeps customers loyal with its very popular rewards program which is important for retaining customers and attracting new ones  Starbucks has 10 million customers signed up for its rewards program 
LinkedIn Corporation  N LNKD 
Information Technology   Internet Software   Services   Reports October 29  after the close 
The Estimize community looking for EPS of  0 49 as compared to Wall Street s  0 47 and company guidance of  0 43  Revenues are also slightly higher  expected to come in at  758 0M vs  Wall Street s  756 7M and guidance of  747 5M 

What to watch  To LinkedIn s dismay  it often gets lumped together with social media companies like Facebook  O FB  and Twitter  N TWTR   which are criticized for not making enough money despite having massive user bases  Unlike FB and TWTR which generate nearly all of their revenue from advertisers  LNKD makes money off of its subscriptions  Less than 25  of its revenue comes from its advertising segment  Marketing Solutions  LinkedIn s main source of cash  close to 60   is its recruiting platform  Talent Solutions  but even that segment may be suffering  After last quarter s report  the company said display ad sales have fallen 30  and premium subscriptions are shrinking as a percentage of total revenue  A recent survey from the American Customer Satisfaction Index may shed some light on this  finding that LinkedIn ranks as the least favorite of all social media names  Users find the platform clunky and difficult to use  and the biggest complaint was regarding unwanted connection requests and spam messages  Carrying a P E value of 55  the company will have to at least meet Thursday s expectations to prevent the stock from dropping 
Expedia  O EXPE 
Consumer Discretionary   Internet   Catalog Retail   Reports October 29  after the close 
Fresh off its acquisition of Orbitz  travel booking site Expedia will report its third quarter results on Thursday  Estimize is expecting EPS of  2 03  in line with Wall Street  and making it the first time in 3 quarters that the company is expected to post YoY profit growth  Revenues are also in line at  1 954B 

What to watch  Bookings is always the number to watch with Expedia and its peers  Many analysts believe the acquisition of Orbitz during the final two weeks of the third fiscal quarter will help that number grow  along with the long awaited platform upgrade  Bookings increased 19  in both the first and second quarter  Also helping this metric will be the shedding of Expedia s 62  stake in eLong  a flailing Chinese booking site  Revenues are also expected to benefit from this move  EXPE is the first of its group to report  with TripAdvisor and Priceline releasing results next week  all will likely cite the stronger dollar as having a negative impact on the top and bottom line again this quarter  The biggest challenge for the travel booking sites will no doubt be the increasing popularity of alternative accommodation providers such as privately held Airbnb and HomeAway  AWAY   While the US consumer mostly remains healthy and willing to spend at this point  they are being very choosy with how they allocate their discretionary income  leading to a case of the haves and the have nots in the leisure space 
Electronic Arts  O EA 
Information Technology   Software   Reports October 29  after the close 
The Estimize consensus for EA stands at  0 49  a nickel higher than the Wall Street consensus  and 9 cents higher than company guidance  Revenues are expected to come in at  1 111B vs  the Street s  1 092B 

What to watch  Despite reporting YoY decline on EPS for the last 3 quarters  the company has been blowing away analyst expectations for the last 8 quarters  Revenues have beaten in 6 of those 8 quarters  Helping the video gaming company this quarter is the popularity of its recently released  Madden NFL  16  game  which ranked as the top selling game in August even though the it only debuted on August 25  In September the game fell to  2 behind NBA 2K16  Generally  positive trends in the videogame industry dictate that is will generate over  115B in revenues in the U S  this year  a nearly 50  increase in 3 years  Titles for videogame consoles are the strongest segment  making up half of those revenues  EA chalks its success up to a push into digital and mobile  as downloadable content  add ons to purchased titles  have been increasing in popularity  Unlike other forms of media  video game players are engaging longer and spending more money  Next up is the release of EA s most anticipated game of the year  Star Wars  Battlefront Shooter game due out next month  causing EA to raise guidance for fiscal 2016 
Exxon Mobil  N XOM 
Energy   Oil  Gas   Consumable Fuels   Reports October 30  before the open 
Estimize is looking for EPS of  0 91  two cents higher than what Wall Street is expecting  This would denote a profit decline of 52  YoY  the fourth consecutive quarter of negative numbers  Revenues are expected to come in at  69 23B vs  the Street s  68 0B  also a decline of 36  

What to watch  It s no surprise that Energy companies are the biggest losers this season  Falling oil prices have caused the S P 500 Energy sector to post the largest YoY decline of 65  for earnings and 28  on revenues  It was initially thought that Q3 would be the first quarter of even year over year comparisons  Oil prices first dropped during the third quarter of 2014 in response to the stronger dollar  therefore making Q3 2015 the first quarter with level comparisons  However  oil prices dropped even further in the third quarter  prolonging the difficult YoY comparisons  Brent Crude Oil fell 22  in the third quarter  and 50  YoY  Similarly  West Texas Intermediate ended Q2 at  59 83  down 24   Exxon is not only the largest US oil company  but the second largest company in the S P 500 index  At that size  XOM s results have a big impact on the overall index  While the oil giant missed EPS expectations by  0 07 in Q2  revenues beat by nearly  10B ",2015-10-30,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-thursday---friday---sbux,-lnkd,-expe,-ea,-xom-269749",269749
95609,317124,SBUX,Coffee Is One Hot Commodity,opinion,"Across the board  commodities are getting absolutely clobbered right now 
From  to coal and platinum to corn  prices are tumbling as global gross domestic product  GDP  expectations for 2015 have dropped from  82 billion to  72 billion 
As an investor  there are two ways you can look at this situation 
 When the sea is this turbulent  sit on the sand and watch  
 Buy when there s blood in the streets  
With most commodities  I d choose to sit on the sand  However  there s one exception   coffee 
Coffee Demand Heating Up
Coffee continues to be a popular beverage not just in America  but around the world   especially in Asia 
Japan s per capita coffee consumption is 75  of America s and is still trending upwards  China is just beginning to follow this trend 
Now  my recommendation to invest in coffee isn t based solely on seeing a nice upward trajectory of rising demand  but also the sharp pullback in coffee prices and pessimism about a potential bounce back 
With Starbucks Corp  O SBUX  jacking up the price of your daily coffee to the clever after tax level of  1 99  you might not realize that coffee prices have plummeted over 40  in the last year 
And despite this sharp pullback  the vast majority of future traders are betting cash that it ll drop even further  Brett Eversole points out that when this has happened in the past  coffee prices normally soared in the following four months 
Over the last decade  the average jump in coffee after pessimism reigned was 25   Between April and August of 2013  however  coffee prices leapt an incredible 71  
The most popular investment option to play fluctuations in the volatile coffee market is the iPath Bloomberg Coffee Subindex Total Return Exp 24 June 2038  N JO   which holds front month coffee futures for exposure to the commodity  The note charges investors 75 basis points a year in fees and tracks the Dow Jones UBS Coffee Index 
The product usually sees volumes of about 160 000 shares a day and has about  50 million in assets 
Keep in mind that the price of coffee largely depends on weather related issues  especially in Brazil  which supplies about one third of the world s coffee 
Wet weather normally means ample supply  and that s been the major reason for the oversupply and resulting price drop off  If recent trends of dryer weather persist  coffee could really take off 
This is a speculative trade  so don t go overboard  More conservative investors should probably wait for an uptrend to develop and use a trailing stop loss  For the daring  JO offers options out to March of next year 
No question  coffee prices will snap back  making some investors more than enough money to continue their Starbucks habit  The tricky part is getting the timing right 
May the coffee gods be with you

95610,317125,SBUX,Company Notes Digest 11 6 15,opinion,"Each week we read dozens of transcripts from earnings calls and presentations as part of our investment process  Below is a weekly post which contains some of the most important quotes about the economy and industry trends from those transcripts  
The Macro Outlook 
We are in a global industrial recession
 It s been a very challenging year  And as we know  we are in a global industry recession for our businesses right now  We just incurred our third negative underlying sales growth and we will have two more     Diversified Industrial 
But just because we re in a recession doesn t mean that the economy has to fall apart
 we don t see this very slow grinding recession that doesn t have a monetary crisis attached to it  we don t see a reason why that goes dramatically negative  But it is a difficult  frustrating  grinding environment  and that s why we say again  our strategy has to be built upon on this point      Diversified Industrial 
In fact  there may already be some signs of stabilization
 As I look at the effort and the performance the last several months  we re starting to see the stabilization of some of the markets      Diversified Industrial 
Usually inventory recessions last 5 6 quarters
 it s not unusual to see historically a company like Emerson  who s globally well established with installed base quite significant  to have a little bit of recovery coming in that sixth type of quarter      Diversified Industrial 
And we may be nearing the end of that inventory correction
 we began this inventory correction earlier than most companies and believe that we are nearing the end of it      Semiconductors 
 My inventories in Europe are   I look at our channel and it s pretty good I look at my channel in North America  I would say it s in decent shape right now     Diversified Industrial 
There may be a little more work to do before inventories are optimally sized
 Our feedback is they ve got little bit more to do before they re going to really feel they re going to optimally sized      Diversified Industrial 
But by spring summer of  16 companies should be ready to re stock
 just like we see the effects of the industry events earlier and began this correction earlier  we can also see that we are ending this correction earlier  and we are now poised to resume growth in the March quarter      Semiconductors 
 I anticipate as we get into the spring and early summer of 2016  some of the companies that have been cutting back on capital and cutting back on necessary investments are going to have to let the money go      Diversified Industrial 
This is all assuming that the broader environment doesn t get worse  but no one expects that it will
 the risk would be if we truly went into a global broad recession  then you clearly say okay  the industrial space will be a little bit weaker than I m thinking  But I don t see any indication we re going to go to a global broad recession at this point in time      Diversified Industrial 
Banks have been well behaved this cycle  There haven t been significant bubbles created
 We don t see significant bubbles having been created out of this very long  low grinding growth rates  The banks are in awfully good shape and a lot of the regulations are ensuring very fulsome capital ratios in that regard  We have not yet seen any form of inflation and the prospect that we could get a couple of quarter point interest rate increases doesn t feel like the thing that will derail an economic growth at this point      Diversified Industrial 
But capital markets do feel like they ve entered a late cycle phase
 In terms of quality  late in the cycle it tends to be low  I mean  my own personal view I am sure if you looked around our investment table  people might disagree a little bit  I perceived the quality would be pretty low today      Business Development Corp 
Skyscraper construction is a classic late cycle indicator
 the construction market in New York is inflating aggressively and cost are rising  And even more important than that is there is there are enormous number of cranes in the sky  There is which are exceeding the capacity of the construction industry to deliver services  So there are handful of contractors who are expert in each traits and they those guys are running out of capacity  So there is a bidding premium to get timely delivery of products and services      Commercial REIT 
Is there another shoe to drop 
 does it get any worse than that  Is there another shoe to drop or driven by anything  That we don t know  That kind of view we don t have  This is based on what we are able to see today      Semiconductors 
For what it s worth  Stan Druckenmiller thinks the dollar will start strengthening again
 I m shorting the euro again I have never seen a currency move of this intensity last 11 months  the nice thing about currency moves is that they tend to last 2 3 years  But they usually take a timeout somewhere in the middle  If you remember the yen went from 80 to 105 and then took a timeout for 8 or 9 months  I have thought we re in a timeout like that for the Euro and now look at what s happening      Broke the Bank of England 
And the strong dollar is what started all this in the first place
 let me just say that exchange rates wreaked havoc on our 2015 results  Currency driven price erosion had a huge impact on our imaging components business      Medical Capital Equipment 
International 
The worst may be behind us in China
 We are planning for a down 2016 in China I fundamentally believe there has been a destocking going on  Basically what we can tell I think the worst of that is behind us  I do believe we will have a challenging first quarter But I personally don t think it s getting worse  I think that they are trying to reposition      Diversified Industrial 
The consumer side of China is doing very well
 the reported numbers that what we see on both fuels and chemicals tells us that the consumer side of China is doing very well      Chemicals 
As China attempts to move from a  manufacturing  to a  consumption  economy  global brands could benefit
 I think what s happening in China at this point is that there is a big change from an economy that was all lead by exports and heavy investments in fixed assets to now an economy that s more consumption  more consumer spending the segments that are more high priced are growing ahead of the ones that are lower price  And that s exactly where we have most of our business and most of our brands position  So I think this change  while it may be bad for the industry  is not bad for us      Beer Conglomerate 
But it s important to remember that China has formidable local competitors too
 In regards to China  we are impacted by increasing local competition      Pharmaceuticals 
And those competitors don t always like to play by international rules
 the negotiations with a handful of these licensees are taking longer than we previously expected  In some of these cases  although the licensees acknowledged they need to pay royalties to QUALCOMM  we believe in connection with the negotiations they have stopped reporting certain of their sales and royalties or did not report their sales and royalties in a manner that allows us to record revenue      Smartphone Components 
Europe continues to be a positive surprise
 So emerging markets turtled early this year if not late last year  U S  economy has not been in any great shape  so I think the only positive surprise you could point to economically in the world would be Europe  And our Europe business is reflecting it      Facilities Maintenance 
 we will expect our business in China and Asia to be sequentially down  But we make up for that elsewhere with a very  very strong Europe     Semiconductors 
All of Asia s industrial base has slowed  not just China
 I d say if you go down through Indonesia  Malaysia  wherever else  clearly the oil situation is acting as a depressant in that particular area  You get up into Korea and of course there re not a whole lot of ships being built currently and you re seeing this back up again      Diversified Industrial 
Financials 
International credit markets tightened up a lot during last quarter s volatility
Asia and Latin America issuance decreased by 58  and 72   respectively  This led to a 20  decline in global issuance overall  To put that in perspective  both Asia and Latin America had their lowest quarterly issuance since 2008 quarterly revenue from China experienced a decline for the first time in the last five years  In addition  this was Europe s lowest issuance quarter since the third quarter of 2013    
As spreads have tightened capital markets have opened back up
 So it is possible that with spreads coming back in and only being 5 bps up from August  that we could continue to see heavier issuance as we move into November out of the blackout period  and in fact the pipelines look pretty good for next week      Credit Rating Agency 
Despite concern over VC capital  Vornado is still seeing good vibrancy in SF
 Listen there has been a lot of chatter in the marketplace that with some VC capital potentially drawing up and the IPO marketplace not being as open as it was that we re seeing some pull back in terms of the tech tenancy and the San Francisco market  Our own experience has been that while there has been a lot of chatter and discussion about this we re still seeing very good vibrancy in the marketplace      REIT 
Companies can still borrow for 30 years at 3 5 
 we expect to issue  15 billion to  16 billion of debt with maturities from 2 years to 30 years  We re putting in place a long term capital structure  The weighted average cost of this debt could be around 3  to 3 5  depending on market conditions      Payments 
With low interest rates  it s not hard to find an accretive deal  but returns are low
 with the low interest rates right now  it s not that hard to have an accretive deal  I think what we re trying to be is also very careful about what types of returns these businesses are going to generate over the medium and long term  And we re going be disciplined there      Facilities Maintenance 
Many companies find that accretion is easiest through share buybacks
 We think Whole Foods is a compelling buy at these prices  Stock buybacks are going to be accretive in the short term and the long term  And it doesn t preclude us from making further stock buybacks in the future if necessary It s sort of a perfect situation with interest rates being what they are and the long term debt market being what it is and our trading metrics   stock price trading metrics  relative to history being what they are      Grocery 
Acquisition candidates are priced for perfection
 I think right now  things are generally priced for perfection  And as I continuously say  we kick a lot of tires  but we just haven t found the right thing      Investment Company 
Vornado says that the easy money has been made and it s time to prepare for the next cycle
 Trees don t grow it in the sky and pricing has   the easy money clearly been made  pricing is very aggressive  I don t know which way interest rates are going but people think that they are going up  I don t know which way cap rates are going but 50  they can t go much lower  So it seems that this is the time to begin to think about prepared for the next cycle  If you are in a position like we are running company like ours and you don t stop thinking like that you are not being responsible      Commercial REIT

TV networks were generally pleased with their performance despite cord cutting concerns
 I think we re all seeing that the dire predictions of cord cutting are overblown  but the good news for CBS is  no matter where distribution goes  no matter how or where you want your content  we are in a perfect position      Network Television 
 despite all the talk about domestic secular concerns  our U S  Networks grew revenues an impressive 8  this quarter     Cable Network 
Everyone is investing in content
 Programming remains by far the most significant area of investment for the company  As you all know  we have plans to invest aggressively in content in 2016 and beyond      Media 
Les Moonves says that there can never be too much content
 we are a content company  we believe the world can have more content  we don t believe the guy who says oh  there s too much content  There never can be too much content and we want more of it      Network Television 
A benefit of OTT television is that advertising can be more targeted
 One of the great characteristics of an IP streaming TV business in the future is the ability to have that data  the ability to use that to improve your products and services and monetize the viewership and the audience in the right way with respect to pricing  the attention of the audience correctly either for them or for advertisers     Media 
One in seven Americans received a Starbucks  O SBUX  gift card last year for Christmas
 You may recall that last year  one in seven Americans received a Starbucks Gift Card over the holidays  generating over  1 6 billion in card loads in our first quarter of fiscal year 2015      Coffee Shop 
Retail is about detail
 I mean retail ultimately always comes down to how satisfied the customer is  So it s about retail is detail is the clich   and it s a very appropriate one      Grocery 
Prepare to hear retailers talk a lot about warm weather when they report earnings
 We saw accelerated growth in footwear  although the warm weather tempered boot sales in the quarter  The watch business continues to remain under pressure in retail and wholesale      Fashion 
There s a lot of competition entering off price retail
 If you look at the department store model  it s completely changed  The off price concept has been a vehicle for growth  So a perfect example is Nordstrom  N JWN   Nordstrom is one where the department store is still doing quite well but the vehicle for growth has always been the Nordstrom Rack and they continue to try to add store count and up their expansion plans  I think Macy s and others are actually taking a page out of their playbook     Retail REIT 
But as the economy has gotten better  consumers have gotten a little less sensitive to price
 At the same time  we ve seen a decline in private label shares in many of our categories indicating the consumers preference for branded products and respect of our equities      Soap

Tesla s autopilot cars have already logged several hundred thousand miles of live driving
 This has gone out to the whole fleet of Autopilot enabled cars  and those are racking up miles extremely quickly  At this point  I don t have the exact number at the tip of my tongue  but it s  I believe  several hundred thousand miles of driving      Automobiles 
Within 15 20 years owning a manually driven car will be like owning a horse
  I think it will be quite unusual to see cars that don t have full autonomy  in the 15 year to 20 year timeframe It will be like owning a horse or not   you re really owning it for sentimental reasons      Automobiles 
Mark Zuckerberg tried to temper expectations for Oculus
 I can start off talking about Oculus and virtual reality  So the first thing that I want to stress here is that these kind of new platforms take a long time to develop  So we ve said often that we think that virtual reality and augmented reality could be the next big computing platform  But just to put that in perspective and compare it to the development of previous computing platforms like phones and computers  I think the first smartphones came out in 2003  and in the first year  I think BlackBerry and Palm Treo were the initial smartphones that came out  And I think they each sold in the hundreds of thousands of units  So just to kind of give a sense of the timeframe that we re thinking about this and how we expect this to develop  that s how we re thinking about that     The Social Network 
Ginny Rometty had an interesting analogy for the new architecture of cyber security

95611,317126,SBUX,Time To Buy Hong Kong ,opinion,"Is the Hong Kong market a bargain or losing its edge  With the Hang Seng Index trading at its cheapest valuation in 10 years   close to the valuations of Russia s and Pakistan s markets   it s an important question 
So what s wrong  A couple of things 
Crony Capitalism  The China controlled government is blocking any political reforms  As a result  crony capitalism is steadily rising  with  at the top position of a  crony index  put together by The Economist  The cost of living in terms of housing and food is soaring  Even the cost of groceries is 30  higher than in New York 
Manufacturing  A key pillar of the economy  manufacturing has almost completely migrated to other  low cost countries  And shipping  while still vibrant  is losing market share to lower cost ports like Shanghai 
Now  given my experience with Hong Kong politics  the economy  and business over three decades  I must say these trends are a little concerning  With China seemingly trying to marginalize Hong Kong in favor of developing Shanghai into the region s leading financial center  you might think the  Pearl of the Orient  is losing its luster as the commercial and cultural gateway to Asia and that you should avoid investing in Hong Kong companies 
I wouldn t bet on it for several reasons 
1  Hong Kong still has a well earned reputation for being one of the world s most open economies  That s why 1 389 multinational companies base their regional headquarters there  despite the fact that rents are double that of Shanghai 
In fact  according to the closely followed Heritage Wall Street Journal 2015 Index of Economic Freedom  Hong Kong has remained at the top of the heap  followed by Singapore  New Zealand  Australia  and Switzerland  The United States ranked No  12  while China is in the  mostly unfree  category at No  139 
2  In terms of growth and profitability  it matters a lot more where you do business rather than where your business is based  In this regard  Hong Kong companies have deep tentacles that reach into China and the dynamic Southeast Asian region 
The bottom line is that with the Hong Kong market trading at half the valuations of China  it s a genuine buying opportunity 
A Tale of Two Conglomerates
If you wanted to take the shotgun approach to investing in Hong Kong  there s the iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF  N EWH  
While this gives you exposure to a wide variety of large and mid sized companies  I suggest zeroing in on two leading consumer conglomerates with a long history in Hong Kong  instead 
The first is Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd   OTC JMHLY   Founded in 1832  the company is incorporated in Bermuda but headquartered in Hong Kong  About 40  of its profits are from greater China with 47  from Southeast Asia 
Here s just a sampling of its diversified businesses 

Jardine owns the leading supermarket and health and beauty chain  the 7 Eleven convenience store chain  and IKEA furniture stores  and it operates the Starbucks  O SBUX  franchise in Hong Kong 


It also owns large amounts of prime commercial property in the heart of Central Hong Kong  where its buildings form an interlinked network of offices and retail space 


The company currently owns or has substantial interests in 15 hotels worldwide  including the Mandarin Oriental  as well as car dealerships in Hong Kong  Macau  China  and the U K 

Jardine Matheson stock trades right at book value  nine times forward earnings  and is flush with  5 billion in cash  A share buyback is also a distinct possibility  And its 2 6  dividend yield offers some cushion and downside protection 
Data drawn from Jardine Matheson s website shows that its shares are trading at a 25  discount to net asset value  This is the clincher for me 
Another blue chip to put in your Hong Kong saddlebag is Swire Pacific Ltd   OTC SWRAY   Founded in 1816  Swire is active in a wide range of commercial activities throughout Asia  including aviation  property  and retailing  It trades at just 60  of book value  and during the last quarter the company booked earnings 23  higher than a year ago 
Bottom line  Buying quality value in growth markets that are out of favor coupled with a disciplined sell strategy is the key to building wealth

If you are digging for more U S  stocks  you are correct that all of the returns in 2015 have been in the largest names

The strong dollar and weak commodities are helping to take iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  N EEM  to a very oversold position 



If you are digging through the EM dumpster and looking at Brazil  then you must read this interview with Luis Stuhlberger 
 Brazil is going to get much worse before it gets better   At home  Mr  Stuhlberger sees problems deeper than a political crisis and low prices for commodity exports   The country isn t financially viable   he said   The government has tried to build a European social democracy in the third world  The numbers don t add up   Despite high taxes   at 36 percent of the country s gross domestic product  Brazil s tax burden is about the same as Germany s   the country is running a gaping budget deficit  in part because Brazilians retire with a government pension at an average age of 54   There will have to be a major crisis before the population accepts cuts in social spending   Mr  Stuhlberger said 

And though outrage at the way some of that spending is diverted has led to a groundbreaking investigation into corruption  Mr  Stuhlberger said the corruption was so endemic he feared that no new  clean political institutions existed to replace the old ones  While he waits for the crisis to deepen  his Brazilian allocation is mostly in local inflation protected bonds  He also holds currency derivatives that will profit if the real falls further  and has a small position long on Petrobras bonds and short on the stock 

If you are a U S  focused investor then Morgan Stanley  N MS  has some difficult news for you 



 The flatness of the  expected efficient  frontier means that the optimal portfolio will lie near the left hand extreme of the red line for a variety of investor utility functions   explained Sheets  which in effect  equals greater exposure to credit   Relative to prior later cycle periods  growth looks weaker  central bank policy looks looser  and credit risk premiums are more elevated  

I can t even recall the last time that I was in a bank branch  Millennials are increasingly turning to digital banking channels to perform their banking activities  and they re visiting their banks  branches less often than ever before  The behaviors and preferences of this generation   which makes up the largest share of both the US population and the employed population  at 26  and 34   respectively   will shape the future of the bank  as well as the relationship between the bank and the customer  As third parties increasingly provide the services that consumers are using to manage their finances  the valuable relationship between banks and their customers will continue to deteriorate

According to the Illinois based OSI Group  the company s latest move is aimed at rebuilding trust and cooperating with the ongoing investigation into the scandal that is feared to have tainted products sold by global chains  such as McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   Yum  Brands Inc  NYSE YUM  and Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX   Last week  the Chinese government suspended operations at Shanghai Husi  following local media reports that the company was selling spoiled meat 
 These decisions are the most responsible course of action we can take at this point in time   Brent Afman  a senior vice president and managing director of OSI s Asia Pacific  Middle East and Africa divisions  said in a statement   We are committed to openness and transparency  We are providing clear and full explanations and findings to all concerned as early as possible  
The company also said that it is conducting a  thorough internal investigation  into possible failures by former and current senior management at the Shanghai factory 
 Should any misconduct be uncovered  we will take swift and decisive action against those responsible  including all relevant disciplinary and or legal measures   In addition  a new management team has been brought in to China to ensure that operations run effectively   OSI said  on its Chinese website 

Last week  local authorities arrested five people  including the head of Shanghai Husi Food and its quality manager  as part of an investigation into the food scandal  There were quality lapses at a U S  based plant of OSI Group LLC too  International Business Times reported  citing a former employee 
Although no consumers have so far reported falling sick from consuming meat supplied by Shanghai Husi  long time customers  such as McDonald and Yum  Brands  suspended orders from the supplier in the past week  Yum  the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut chains  also said that it would no longer do business with OSI in China  the U S   and Australia 
 Today s announcement from OSI Group does not affect McDonald s as we had already stopped sourcing and serving product from Husi Shanghai upon learning of alleged food safety issues   Heidi Barker  a McDonald s spokeswoman  told Bloomberg via e mail ",2014-07-28,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/osi-group-replaces-food-scandal-hit-unit's-leadership-298236,298236
95634,317149,SBUX,In China food testing  safety inspectors are often one step behind,news,"By Adam Jourdan and Clare Baldwin SHANGHAI HONG KONG  Reuters    When inspectors visited Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd earlier this summer  the production line at the plant now at the centre of an international food scandal appeared in good order  with fresh meat being handled by properly attired workers and supervisors keeping a watchful eye over the process 
However  if they had arrived unannounced a day before  they would have found piles of blue plastic bags filled with out of date meat stacked around the factory floor  a worker at the facility told Reuters  adding the old meat was often added back into the mix to boost production and cut costs 
 The next day  that meat just disappeared   someone must have disposed of it  The manager said it was an inspection   said the worker  who wasn t authorised to talk to the media and so didn t want to be named 
On July 20  following an undercover local TV report that alleged workers used expired meat and doctored food production dates  regulators closed the factory  which is part of OSI Group LLC  a U S  food supplier  Police have detained five people including Shanghai Husi s head and quality manager 
The scandal   which has hit mainly big foreign fast food brands including McDonald s Corp  N MCD  and Yum Brands Inc  N YUM   which owns the KFC and Pizza Hut chains   underlines the challenges facing inspectors in China s fast growing and sprawling food industry  China is Yum s biggest market and McDonald s third largest by outlets 
Behind the thousands of brightly lit restaurants offering what Chinese consumers see as better quality food lie supply chains that rely on an army of poorly regulated and inadequately audited processing plants  Yum has around 650 suppliers in China alone 
China s government has struggled to restore confidence in its  1 trillion food processing industry since six infants died in 2008 after drinking adulterated milk  The head of China s Food and Drug Administration told the China Daily this week that the food safety situation  remains severe  and the existing oversight system  is not effective  
China s food testing industry is expected to top 8 billion yuan   1 29 billion  by next year  with more than 5 000 companies offering food inspection services  Regulators overseeing the industry are thinly stretched  company executives say 
Laws on food safety are incomplete and responsibility in enforcing them is unclear  making it difficult for regulators to do their jobs  Gao Guan  deputy secretary general of the China Meat Association  told Reuters 
 In developed countries people obey the traffic rules  You wait when the light is red and you walk when the light is green  But this is not the case in China  People walk when other people walk and no one cares about the light  So in this particular environment things like Husi are very hard to avoid   Gao said 
BEST PICTURE
OSI  ranked by Forbes at 62nd on its list of U S  private companies with annual revenue of close to  6 billion  said this week it suspended operations at Shanghai Husi Food and would review all its China plants  which would now come under direct control of its headquarters in Illinois  It said it would  assign a vigilant rotation of global experts to continuously survey these operations and implement exhaustive audit steps   including constant visual surveillance of production measures and document compliance 
The Shanghai Husi scandal exposes weaknesses in big foreign brands  ability to police their own supply chains and processing plants   whether in house or through third party auditors 
 The issue with quality control audits is that the factories usually know about it and get ready   said Max Henry  Shanghai based executive director of the Global Supply Chain Council 
Driven by extreme price pressures and an ambivalent workforce  suppliers often try to hide dubious practices from inspectors  showing them only certain parts of a factory or taking them to  fake  plants  so reports rarely give a full picture of compliance  auditors told Reuters 
 They want to give the customer the best picture of the factory  so when something s going wrong  they have to hide it   said Evelyne Mazaleyrat  product manager  food service for food auditor Bureau Veritas in Asia 
Audits of the Shanghai Husi factory by the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  in 2004 and 2010 to clear the way for potential Chinese poultry exports to the United States  gave the facility a clean bill of health  However  links to USDA audit forms show a one page  checklist  format that some food safety experts have criticized 
 BANKRUPT SYSTEM 
To be sure  gaps in the auditing process are not limited to China 
 It s a bankrupt system   said Mansour Samadpour  microbiologist and CEO of IEH Laboratories   Consulting Group in Seattle  noting audits are normally scheduled ahead of time and organised around publicly available questionnaires   It s become a way for people to abdicate their responsibilities for the safety of the food product they are selling  
Buyers such as Yum and McDonald s operate on huge volumes and demand very low prices from their suppliers  which compete fiercely for business on razor thin margins 
Shanghai Husi is just the tip of the problem 
Last year  Yum shareholders filed four lawsuits against the company for failing to properly oversee its Chinese poultry suppliers and misleading investors about growth in China  according to U S  court records  Yum says it audits each of its suppliers at least once a year 

 The Western firms have put in place regimes that clearly have holes in them  with KFC perhaps having the biggest problem because they have the most suppliers   said Richard Brubaker  an adjunct professor at the China Europe International Business School and founder of the Collective Responsibility consultancy 
A sample audit report from Silliker  which lists McDonald s as a client in some of its markets  covers basic information such as a facility s location and workforce  and asks  too  about cleaning  sterilization schedules and storage temperatures 
Pony Testing International  which lists McDonald s and KFC as clients  says it carries out physical and chemical tests including for nutritional make up  additives  non food substances  microbial indicators and pesticide residues

95635,317150,SBUX,Tim Hortons to battle Starbucks  price rises likely,news,"By Solarina Ho TORONTO  Reuters    Canadian coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons  which has offered only one coffee blend in its 50 year history  hopes to lure new coffee drinkers and fend off rivals such as Starbucks Corp  O SBUX  and McDonald s Corp  N MCD  with the launch throughout North America of its new dark roast blend 
Tim Hortons  which announced the move on Thursday  may also increase prices to tackle rising costs and competition from U S  rivals expanding in Canada 
 Looking at the coffee market  I would suggest that  given the degree of cost increases  that we are looking at prices going up sometime in 2015   Tim Hortons Inc  TO THI  chief executive Marc Caira said on Thursday 
Tim Hortons  which says it serves nearly 8 out of every 10 cups of coffee sold in Canada  outlined a plan in February to kick start growth and improve returns by fine tuning its menu to encourage more spending  improving service and opening new restaurant formats 
Last week  the chain reported market beating quarterly growth that showed its strategy  which includes higher priced and new menu items  is paying off  Still  traffic declined for the ninth consecutive quarter in Canada and is flat in the United States 
Caira expects the new dark brew  which will also be available for home brewing in formats such as Keurig Mountain Inc s single serve pod  to contribute to results  but he declined to give details 
The alternative brew was first sold late last fall in Columbus  Ohio and London  Ontario  and then in the province of Quebec in June  It will be offered at all 4 496 restaurants across Canada and the United States starting Friday 
 There s about 38 to 40 percent of coffee drinkers that are looking for a darker roast   said Caira   Those are very intriguing numbers for us     If we weren t pleased with the  initial  numbers  we wouldn t be launching it  
INFLATION PRESSURE
Caira  a former top Nestle SA executive who took over at the Canadian chain a little more than a year ago  plans to tackle inflationary pressure from higher coffee bean prices and labor costs by cutting waste and improving efficiencies 
 The last thing that we want to do is arbitrarily increase prices   said Caira  but he conceded the chain will likely raise prices in 2015  He could not say what products might be affected 
Caira said the company was also working with Ottawa to address labor shortages in some parts of Canada following tighter rules on hiring temporary foreign workers in the restaurant industry 
 There must be flexibility in the system to address labor issues in certain parts of the country   Caira said 
He added that in some markets there are not enough people to work in the company s restaurants 
 That is a fact proven out by number   he said   In those cases  there s a need for this program

The move will pit McDonald s directly against Starbucks Corp  NASDAQ SBUX  which  has been in grocery stores since 1998 when the company signed a deal with Kraft to distribute their Seattle s Best brand  but it has never been a big part of the company s U S  revenues

HollyFrontier broke above an Inverse Head and Shoulders neckline in July  It made it about halfway to the price objective before the broad market sell off pulled it lower  Since finding support it has been building a rising wedge over the neckline  This could be a reversal and continue back towards the price objective near 66  Or as rising wedges often do  break to the downside for another leg lower  The RSI is rising and crossed the mid line with the MACD about to cross up  These support more upside  Watch and react 
L Brands  NYSE LB 

L Brands had a strong move higher from October 2014 through to April this year  Then it pulled back over the next 5 months  but at a much slower rate  The decline retraced about 61 8  of the leg higher and then rocketed back up  It spent the last few days in a short term bull flag with major resistance from the prior high overhead  The RSI is firmly in the bullish zone and the MACD rising  Watch for a flag break to participate 
Progressive Corporation  NYSE PGR 

Progressive rolled up out of consolidation in April to a double top peak in August  It fell hard with the market and has been consolidating in an ascending triangle since  With a MACD about to cross up and a rising RSI breaking the mid line it has support for more upside  Look for a break of resistance to participate 
Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX 

Starbucks had a strong run higher from October 2014 as well  that ended in mid August  The spike down retraced 70  of that move  and it has been consolidating in an ascending triangle since  Friday s strong candle broke through the top of the triangle  It has support for more upside from a rising RSI that is moving above the mid line and a MACD that just crossed up 
Tractor Supply Company  NASDAQ TSCO 

Tractor Supply had a long trend higher from October 2014 interrupted by the August sell off  Since then it has formed a consolidation range  ending last week pressing towards the top  The RSI has been working higher since the drop and is pressing through the mid line  The MACD is crossed up and rising  Both support a push higher 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into September Options Expiration sees a series of higher lows on the short term charts showing some promise for equities 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil consolidates building a bull flag  The US Dollar Index is also consolidating with a short term downward bias while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets look to continue their consolidation with a bias lower 
Volatility looks to remain elevated but continuing the leak lower  with a possibility of a reversion to normal levels soon  This would lighten the bias lower for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  and work toward no bias  The ETF s themselves are showing short term consolidation with reversal signs after a plunge  But the move out of consolidation could be in either direction so a wait and see approach with an upward short term bias is my view 
Longer term a break of consolidation to the upside would be quite bullish  The QQQ remains the strongest of the indexes with the IWM and SPY showing bigger risk to the downside  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

95639,317154,SBUX,PepsiCo Releases Earnings  Time To Buy ,opinion,"PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  released its  yesterday  How did it go 
Here s what CEO Indra Nooyi had to say 

 We are pleased with our performance for the third quarter of 2015  Despite ongoing volatility in many of our key international markets  we delivered strong organic revenue growth  gross margin expansion and double digit core constant currency EPS growth  emphasis added   

PepsiCo released another quarter of excellent results  The company saw core constant currency earnings per share grow 14  versus the same quarter a year ago 
The company also raised its 2015 guidance to constant currency core earnings per share growth of 9  for fiscal 2015 
PepsiCo has long been a favorite due to its stability  above average dividend yield  and growth 
Is PepsiCo Rewarding Shareholders Too Much 
PepsiCo is expecting more than  10 billion in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2015  PepsiCo investors should be happy with what the company plans to do with its  10 billion in operating cash 
The company plans to return around  9 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2015 in the form of dividends and share repurchases 
About  4 billion will be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends  and  5 billion in the form of share repurchases 
The company currently has a 2 9  dividend yield  Dividend payments are nothing new to PepsiCo shareholders  The company has paid increasing dividends for 43 consecutive years 
PepsiCo is currently trading for an adjusted price to earnings ratio of 21 0  The company is by no means cheap at current prices  Over the last decade  PepsiCo has traded for an average price to earnings ratio of 18 6 
Based on the company s current price to earnings ratio in relation to its historical average price to earnings ratio  PepsiCo appears to be slightly overvalued or trading at the upper end of fair value 
In any case  PepsiCo is not cheap at current prices  Share repurchases are not always an effective use of cash 
Share repurchases done when a company is trading above fair value destroy shareholder value  Here s why 
Imagine a company spends  1 000 000 in cash to buy back shares  The company is currently overvalued  and the intrinsic value of the repurchased shares is only  700 000  The company just destroyed  300 000 in value by repurchasing shares at unattractive prices 
Based on PepsiCo s current price to earnings ratio  the company could better serve its shareholders by temporarily forgoing share repurchases  Instead  PepsiCo should do one of three things with the cash it has earmarked for share repurchases through the end of fiscal 2015 
Hold the cash for later share repurchases when the stock is undervalued 
Use cash to pay down debt 
Pay cash out in the form of a special dividend 
Any of these three alternatives would be more beneficial to PepsiCo shareholders than share repurchases done at current market prices 
There is a very good reason for PepsiCo to repurchase its shares regardless of overall market prices 
44  of the CEO s target compensation is tied to stock price performance and total shareholder return relative to the S P 500  Another 29  is tied to key metrics  notably earnings per share  
Share repurchases done at any price   even if they are detrimental to long term shareholder value will boost earnings per share  and very likely share price 
It therefore benefits the CEO  and other top management  of PepsiCo to engage in share repurchases regardless of the price of the stock 
Overly Critical Analysis Of PepsiCo
The analysis above is overly critical of PepsiCo  Are there conflicts of interests between shareholders and management  Yes  but that is the case with most publicly traded companies 
PepsiCo is a high quality business  In fact  the company has 22 brands that generate over  1 billion a year in sales  The table below breaks these brands down by type  Sparkling means carbonated beverages  Still means non carbonated beverages 
 Lipton and Starbucks RTD Beverages are partnerships with Unilever  NYSE UL  and Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   respectively  Dr  Pepper Snapple  NYSE DPS  owns the United States rights to 7 Up while PepsiCo owns the international rights 
With a name like PepsiCo  you d think the company was primarily a beverage business  But PepsiCo s chip brands are more valuable than its beverage brands 
Total Return Potential And Final Thoughts
PepsiCo shareholders can expect total returns from PepsiCo of around 10  to 12  a year over the long run  before valuation multiple changes  The company will generate these returns through dividends   3   and earnings per share growth  7  to 9  a year  
The company offers investors above average total returns with very little business risk  PepsiCo operates is the slow changing food and beverage industry  The company s strong brand based competitive advantage is not going anywhere  PepsiCo stock has a low price standard deviation of just 17 3   reflecting the company s high quality 
Despite solid expected total returns  now is not the ideal time to buy PepsiCo  The stock appears to be trading somewhat over fair value  or at the very upper end of fair value  In either case  PepsiCo makes an excellent business to hold for the long run  but now is not the time to add to or initiate a position in PepsiCo ",2015-10-07,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pepsico:-q3-results---suspicious-share-repurchases-267402,267402

SPX continues to rally strong here with a confirmed double bottom at 1997 
The 5 day moving average is showing a lot of support as it rides the underside of daily price action 
The next challenge for traders will be to see whether support in the 2040 s can be broken or whether it re ignites selling to the downside 
2059 is the break even level for the market on the year  It also happens to be where the 200 day moving average is sitting at 
N SPY volume was weak on Friday and much lower than the levels we saw on Thursday  The price action was also confined to a very tight range as well 
SPX has traded higher 8 out of the last 9 trading sessions  A bit of selling pressure in the form of profit taking shouldn t come as a surprise at some point  For now  ride the trend higher as long as it is willing 
VIX dropped 2  down to 17  I wouldn t be surprised if this market managed to rally up until the VIX reached the 11 12 range that has been the starting point for all market reversals this year 
SPX 30 minute chart remains strong with a nice series of higher highs and higher lows 
T2108    of stocks trading above their 40 day moving average  is currently trading at 65    one of the biggest rallies I have ever seen in the indicator   considering that it was trading at 12  just 9 days ago 
The Fed has never raised interest rates at a point where the market was trading lower on the year 
The large gaps in the market  the record number of stock buybacks  and ETFs that are constantly accumulating dumping large chunks of stocks  and most importantly the high frequency trading  shows just how illiquid this market has become in recent years  These entities are the most responsible for the massive market swings that stocks incur each day

95641,317156,SBUX,Premature Evacuation  Biggest Mistake Of My Investing Career,opinion," I like people admitting they were complete stupid horses  asses  I know I ll perform better if I rub my nose in my mistakes  This is a wonderful trick to learn    

The other day I noticed that Starbucks  O SBUX  had made a new  all time high  even in the midst of the steepest stock market correction in 4 years  And it got me thinking about the worst investing mistakes I ve ever made 
No  these were not really   These were more like what Warren Buffett calls his   mistakes of omission   investments he didn t make but should have  For example  I think I remember him lamenting his decision not to invest in Costco  O COST  back in its early days  This single mistake is far more costly than any of his   mistakes of commission   where he bought something he shouldn t have 
But mine are even worse than this because I actually did make the investment and I was proven right  I just sold way too soon  If I had just hung on rather than take premature profits  I would have made many  many multiples more money than I actually did  And the gains I missed far outweigh any of my worst losses 
Back near the financial crisis lows I bought a fairly sizable chunk of Starbucks stock around  5 per share  At the time I was amazed that  in the midst of the worst recession in decades  this stock had lost 75  of its value even though the company s earnings didn t decline at all  People were hurting financially  like they never had before in their lives  but they were so addicted to the product they couldn t stop buying it  What a business 
Like a jackass  I sold it when it hit  15 a year later  Not a bad trade but the thing is the stock s  60 today  I could have more than tripled my money again after first tripling it in 2010  Epic fail 
Here s another example  When Devon Energy s  N DVN  stock was halved in 2001 I noticed the company announce a major buyback  something like 20  of the outstanding shares  At the same time the top executives started buying with their own money and in size  This got me looking at the supply demand equation for natural gas along with the company s valuation  It was very cheap and highly levered to gas prices which looked like they would inevitably rise over the next few years 
I bought a slug of stock well under  20 per share  The price of natural gas rose almost 10 fold after that  I sold the stock at  60 a few years later  As the oil price shot to  150  the stock doubled again from where I sold it  I don t feel quite so bad about this one  however  because the stock today trades below my sale of a decade ago  Still  I left a lot of money on the table  at least for those 18 months after I sold it 
Probably the biggest mistake I ve ever made  though  was selling my Ball Corp  N BLL   shares in the early 2000s  At the height of the dotcom bubble this glass jar and aluminum can maker was essentially left for dead by investors  It was about as  old economy    bricks and mortar  as you could get 
What everyone missed was that Bill Stiritz had taken the company over  brought in his own management team  which had an incredible track record  and they all started buying stock  big time  My cost  after multiple splits  was probably around  3  Again  like the others mentioned above  the stock tripled pretty quickly  I don t remember exactly but I m pretty sure I sold around  10 
Ball s stock is  66 today  Instead of a triple  that would have been a 22 bagger had I just put it away and forgot about it  This is easily the biggest mistake of my investing career  It s also something I try to keep in the forefront of my mind these days so that I m not quite as quick to hit the eject button once I ve found a great investment ",2015-10-15,Jesse Felder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-biggest-mistake-of-my-investing-career:-premature-evacuation-268176,268176
95656,317171,SBUX,Brazilian Drought Means Fewer Beans For Global Coffee Producers ,news,"By    Ipanema Coffees  supplier to Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   said it expects a 40 percent drop in crop yields after an historic drought in Brazil 
Brazil is the world s largest coffee producer  responsible for about a third of the global supply  But a three month drought has left farmers scrambling to recover supplies  and bean prices rising  Brazilian officials say that the weather problems are over  but not everyone is as optimistic 
On Monday  Brazil s Agriculture Minister Neri Geller said that farmers should expect a better harvest next year  following the worst dry spell in 50 years 
 It s a mistake to suppose that coming rains will solve the problems we ve had   Washington Rodrigues  CEO of Brazil based Ipanema  said last week  according to Bloomberg   Once vegetative growth is lose  you don t recover it  
Typically  farmers are able to harvest about 110 pounds of green beans from 220 pounds of cherries picked from a tree  But the recent lack of water means farmers were only getting about 66 pounds from the same amount of cherries  according to the BBC 
Coffee prices have surged 54 percent this year  and analysts expect that demand will be 11 3 million bags above actual output this year 
But the price of a Starbucks latte isn t at risk  The company typically plans coffee purchases months out  and has already locked in prices for the rest of the year and a large portion for 2015  according to its most recent quarterly report 
But other companies are feeling the pinch  J M  Smucker Co   NYSE SJM   which makes Folgers and Dunkin  Donuts coffee  said earlier this week its bean prices increased by an average of nine percent  In April  Nestle SA  VTX NESN  predicted a 1 percent increase in costs as well

95660,317175,SBUX,Starbucks Vs  Juan Valdez ,news,"By    Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX  is finally taking on Juan Valdez 
Though the Seattle  Washington based caf  giant has more than 700 stores around Latin America  it opened its first one in Colombia on Wednesday  with plans for big expansion in the next five years 
It s main competitor will be the iconic Juan Valdez chain  which already has 200 locations in the country known for its high quality java  The new three floor caf  in Bogota will serve only locally grown coffee  a first for the company  which already sources more than 400 million pounds of its beans from the country 
 It s a continuation in Starbucks  highly successful international growth   Wedbush restaurant analyst Nick Setyan said 
Given its partnership with Mexican foodservice company Alsea  MX ALSEA  and Colombian food processing conglomerate Grupo Nutresa Setyan said  there is no reason for me to doubt that they will reach their 50 unit target over the next five years    
Both Starbucks and Juan Valdez have spent millions supporting local coffee farmers and their families  in a region the United Nations designated as a world heritage site in 2011 
Colombia s economy grew 6 4 percent in the first quarter of this year  and Starbucks isn t the only global company making a move there 
Starbucks will also be competing with Nespresso for coffee supremacy 

The market is a  big opportunity   according to Monica Acosta  local marketing executive for Nestle  XETRA NESN   which owns Nespresso  who spoke to CTV News 
 The economic momentum  the increase in both the number of Colombians travelling abroad and foreigners coming to Colombia    all that means that Colombia is more exposed than ever to globally known brands   she said 
 There s room in the market for us both   said Alejandra Londono  head of international sales at Juan Valdez  to the Associated Press 
Despite the competition  locals seem open minded 
 I like Juan Valdez but it doesn t mean I ll never go to Starbucks just because I want to support our own   said Bogota architect Marcela Gomez to the Associated Press ",2014-07-16,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/starbucks-vs.-juan-valdez-295521,295521
95661,317176,SBUX,Starbucks opens in Colombia  home of Juan Valdez,news,"By Lisa Baertlein
 Reuters    Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX  opened its first shop in Colombia on Wednesday  43 years after the world s biggest coffee chain first started buying beans from the country famous for its premium arabica coffee named after fictional coffee farmer Juan Valdez 
The first of 50 Starbucks stores planned for the coming five years will be in Bogota s Parque de la 93  one of the city s most exclusive neighborhoods  This store and all other Starbucks locations in Colombia will be the Seattle based company s first to serve only locally sourced coffee 
Starbucks is the world s largest buyer of Colombia high grade arabica coffee in the world  Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz told Reuters in a telephone interview 
Its new stores will compete with the roughly 200 unit Juan Valdez coffee shop chain owned by the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia  In addition  Nestle SA s Nespresso plans to begin selling home brewers this fall and open a boutique coffee shop in Colombia sometime this year 
 We think we can exist in a very complementary way   said Schultz  noting that his company s arrival often expands a market and improves business for competitors 
The Colombia business is run by a joint venture between Starbucks and two of its long time business partners in Latin America  Alsea SAB de CV of Mexico and Grupo Nutresa SA of Colombia 
Colombia is the world s biggest producer of high quality arabica coffee  The last few years  though  have been rocky 
Heavy rains and a replanting program that took many trees out of production drastically cut Colombia s coffee crop in 2008  That was followed by four more crop years that were well below average  in part because of an outbreak of a leaf rust disease  As a result  many U S  dealers were forced to look elsewhere for their high quality arabica beans  causing Colombia to lose some of its loyal customers 
Two years ago  Starbucks opened a Farmer Support Center in Manizales  Colombia  Last summer  the company announced a public private partnership with the U S  Agency for International Development that is investing  3 million to increase Colombian coffee yields 
More than half of the 400 million pounds of coffee purchased by Starbucks last year came from Latin America  where the chain has more than 700 stores 

Starbucks  other major coffee suppliers include Brazil  Indonesia and Africa

There s lots of uncertainty out there
 The global economy has never been as uncertain in my recollection  Not that there s a huge crisis here  but there s lots of uncertainty     P C Insurance 
There is plenty to worry about
 this relative tranquility belies the fact that there s still plenty to worry about  The U S  economic recovery remains tepid  Interest rates are poised to rise sometime in the coming year  and the global economic environment is quite unsettled with the overhang of the Greek debt crisis and a slowing Chinese economy      Asset Management 
UPS saw softening in the US economy
 The U S  Domestic business is on track with its revenue management and efficiency gains  however  we are seeing some softening in the economy We think the economy was certainly slower for sure      logistics 
Visa sees very little improvement in the US Consumer
 we continue to see very little change in the overall global economy  with a few exceptions  We are hopeful  but not counting on an improvement in the US economy  but we see very little improvement with the US consumer in our numbers thus far  if any      Payments Processing 
But Mastercard sees a healthy environment
 Overall  the environments in the U S  and Europe have continued to improve  as key economic indicators remained healthy  But the U S  consumer is still not spending all of their gas savings  in July through the 21st  Most of our business drivers are showing a higher growth rate compared to what we saw in the second quarter      Payments Processing 
Demand for polyolefins has been strong
 I mean at this point we still see demand as being relatively strong demand has grown through the first half year over year in polyolefins globally in the 3  to 4  range  And the U S  demand growth has been quite strong as has Asia     Chemicals 
PACCAR  NASDAQ PCAR  saw strong demand for trucks
 PACCAR delivered 41 600 trucks during the second quarter  an 8  increase versus the first quarter this year and slightly ahead of our expectations  The improvement reflects increased truck deliveries in North America and Europe due to economic growth and strong freight demand      Truck Manufacturer 
Marriott says that it doesn t see RevPAR growth slowing any time soon
 Undoubtedly a slower pace of RevPAR growth is likely to occur at some point in North America as economic growth matures  Trees don t grow to the sky While this slower pace is likely at some point  we think it is premature to call it today  Based on our data  we believe North American industry RevPAR growth will be solid for the foreseeable future     Hotels 
Last quarter Steve Wynn warned about Las Vegas  but now says it s  comfortable 
 In Las Vegas  we re enjoying a comfortable business  I think is the right word for it  It s not an aggressive growth by any means  but we are enjoying non casino revenue that is acceptable      Casinos 
Labor markets are tight  especially for skilled professionals
 revenue growth rates were the strongest in the United States  where skilled professional talent is currently at a premium as a result of the tightening labor market      Temp Staffing 
We re starting to see the development lights come back on
 we re starting to see the development lights come back on  If you look at the Urban Land Institute at their most recent meeting  there were a lot of developers there starting to talk about opportunities  growing their business  capital flows coming into their businesses and that sort of thing      Timberland 
We re six years into the recovery  but can it last longer 
 I think we ve got some apprehension as a marketplace  in part maybe driven by the fact that we re in the sixth year of a strong lodging recovery  I think all of us kind of wonder how long can it last and we re constantly looking for clues that maybe we re reaching a point where we can somehow say that we re transitioning to a different phase  and I understand that      Hotel 
International 
The Canadian economy has slowed more than the American economy
 The general economy in Canada has been more sluggish than what we ve seen in the U S  I think what Canada is facing  is people probably understated the impact of the energy complex cutback on capital expenditure  But we don t see Canada in a recession  We see Canada in a technical slowdown that happened to take place for the first six months of the year      Railroad 
Don t expect Chinese construction markets to rebound any time soon
 it s obvious I think that the Chinese economy is going through a change and their governments are very serious about making this change  So  I don t I m not optimistic that we are going to see a big pump up in any of our end markets in a hurry because I think that Chinese government is going to try to keep going on this change of their focused in the government not so much on infrastructure and not so much on build and export a little bit more on consumer and a little bit more disciplined in the provinces     Heavy Duty Engines 
Most people seem expect that the effects of the strong dollar are temporary
 The stronger dollar has slowed U S  lumber and log exports  and more Canadian supply has been directed towards U S  markets  This  combined with slow demand growth  put pressure on lumber prices  Our customers recognize these market forces as temporary and remain committed to their investment plans     Timberland

 apart from the weakening commodity and energy sectors  the credit fundamentals of the high yield bond market remain sound  Issuers of the bonds held in our funds in that strategy continue to post top line growth and solid EBITDA gains      Asset Management 
Moelis said that the restructuring market will eventually pick back up  we just don t know when
 there s certain sectors where you re starting to see some volatility and that could help  but in general  very low interest rates  kind of a decent economy  I think is   I don t see a short term reason why  the restructuring  market would pick up  but I know from being alive in Wall Street for 35 years  it will  I just don t know when      Investment Bank

Whole Foods played the victim card on its conference call
 It s just something that went viral in the media  and it has hurt our trust and yet  we do feel like we re victims of   we don t know exactly why the DCA went after Whole Foods like this  and we re not sure why the media went crazy with it  but it did happen  We are taking steps to not give cause for this in the future      Grocery 
This analyst was pretty unhappy with P G s management
  Analyst Comment    So you sound very different than I would have hoped on the call today or on CNBC this morning  There s still a lot of defiance  There s still a lot of confidence  it feels like  And look  all the frustration we re all feeling  I feel as well probably times 10  You re kind of brushing off the tough questions and maintaining this trust us  it ll turn  it ll turn  But just let me offer you a look through the lens of a shareholder  right  who you are as well  And you see what the stock price has done  and you look at organic sales growth and it s dismal and it s getting worse     Consumer Packaged Goods 
There are a lot of new retail entrepreneurs and they are much more sophisticated than they used to be
 the amount of new concepts and new entrepreneurs coming into our environment is at a high  the new retailers we are dealing with is that they are substantially more sophisticated than the crop of new retailers we dealt with say 10 years ago  better financed  much more focused on their niche and it s been much easier to deal this new crop of entrepreneurs than might have been the case      Mall REIT 
The pace of expansion in B2C shipping has slowed  but secular trends are still in place
 The pace of B2C expansion continued slowing  while B2B gains were due to omni channel and return services in the retail sector I think the secular trends are still in place     Package Logistics

 This was the sixth consecutive quarter of more than  10 billion of venture capital invested in a single quarter and the highest quarter of investing since 2000      Bank 
The competitive environment in the Bay is heated
 The competitive environment remains heated  Strong funding and exit markets have increased the amount of liquidity in the markets and borrowers have money options  As a result some vendors up here are willing to go to any length to win business regardless of whether that risk justifies that return      Bank 
San Francisco is running out of office space
 San Francisco Bay area is once again on pace to outperform most U S  real estate markets in 2015  In San Francisco  rental growth remains strong  The supply of large blocks of space is very limited and demand continues to grow  JLL reports that there are now more than 35 tenants in the market for office space greater than 50 000 square feet and only three available blocks of space of that size one thing about San Francisco remember it s 45 square miles  a share less than 10  can be developed for non residential you have this incredible kind of economics 101 of supply demand imbalance  So rents I think are going to continue to go up     Commercial Real Estate REIT

It s not a good sign that Yelp s chairman is stepping down
 I would like to take a moment to thank Max Levchin  Chairman of Yelp who has decided to step down from the board to pursue other interests  Given the demands on his time  we have mutually agreed this is the right time for him to transition off the board  Max provided the seed capital to start Yelp and I am forever grateful for all of his contributions and wish him all the best going forward      Small Business Reviews

Perhaps those are company specific  but even Facebook  NASDAQ FB  is expecting its revenue growth to slow
 Since the first quarter of 2014  we have seen year over year advertising revenue growth rates decline each subsequent quarter  We expect this trend to continue in Q3 and Q4 as we continue to grow off a much larger base and face currency headwinds due to the strong dollar      Social Media 
Meanwhile  the  unicorn bubble  is driving up the cost of good engineers
 As to the unicorn bubble question and we certainly are feeling those impacts the cost in a couple of these areas have gone up  in particular  product and development as a percentage of revenue continued to creep up and that s a function of compensation in the marketplace      Small Business Ratings 
What will happen if valuations fall and stock based compensation goes with it 
 We continue to expect stock based compensation in 2015 to be in the range of  3 billion to  3 3 billion  approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions  most notably WhatsApp      Social Media 
Not everyone is going to survive
 We ve always said  there is going to be some failures  the nature of   it s just like baseball  Not everybody gets up and it s a homerun and not every team with a winning season wins every game  I don t mean to be cute here  except for there are going to be companies that fail  this is the nature of it I think if anybody thought that all these companies are going to survive  they d be smoked at some point      Commercial Real Estate REIT

Data use could explode as more people move from linear TV to Over the top
 Typical subscribers watching OTT video delivered across the Akamai platform could consume 10 megabits per second or more of traffic while they re watching  This means that an audience size of only 5 million users  which is the equivalent of about four Nielsen points  could generate 50 terabits per second of demand  far more than we deliver today for all of our customers combined      Content Delivery Network 
Middle market companies have increasingly complex IT staffing needs

National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV  sees energy markets stabilizing
 Pricing appears to have stabilized across North American markets as the rig count has more or less stabilized There s a lot of conversations underway around land rigs  And I think generally  our land rig customers are much more optimistic about recovering commodity prices driving higher levels of activity      Oil Services 
Lower prices are leading to better than expected gasoline demand
 we certainly expected some price demand elasticity for gasoline with the fall in flat price  And we ve seen that  and we didn t really know exactly what the magnitude of the pent up demand would be  And it s been a very pleasant surprise  and I think we do expect that that response will continue into the future      Oil Refinery 
But supply has been surprisingly resilient despite the drop in rig count
 I think we ve been surprised with the decline in rig count  production still seems to be holding      Oil Refinery 
That s partially because producers are using the rigs that they have more efficiently
 we ve driven our drilling cost down in the Wattenberg field by almost 35  in the last six months and doubled our rig efficiency over the last year  drilling the same number of wells with half the rigs I think there is a lot of things we ve done that are permanent it s not just price reductions from various service vendors     Oil E P 
And there could be plenty of pent up supply as companies are drilling wells and waiting to complete them
 because we have drilled the wells  we are going to have a significant uplift in what we would call the DUCs  the drilled but uncompleted  We went in last quarter saying we d probably carry over 125 into next year and as we see it now  we re probably going to do   carry over around 200     Oil E P 
High inventories  coupled with refinery maintenance  could also keep pressure on oil prices in the back half of the year
 We re sitting on a pretty good overhang of crude oil inventory here in the U S  We re 90 million barrels above where we were last year  So with that overhang and then heading into a typical maintenance period where refiner demand is down  you would think that that would add pressure on the price of crude oil      Oil Refinery 
Sentiment has turned negative in the oil and gas space  but not negative enough quite yet
 The psychology is starting to turn negative  but it s just beginning and we haven t dived in yet by any means  We have a lot of dry powder and we are right now accessing opportunities that again are structured to basically minimize the risk  But we also want to take advantage if now happens to be in retrospect the right time to step in for part of the opportunity  So our instinct is that it s not time to dive into the water completely  but it is time to take advantage of low oil prices and gas prices      Asset Management 
Amazingly  it s still a seller s market for assets
 we see time and again  people coming in there and buying things at prices that surprise us  I will also say that we ve been   we fought fairly aggressively on a couple of things and were bid or rather were outbid by 2X  So to Bob s comment  it seems to be a seller s market     Oil E P 
Arch Coal says that a lot of smaller mines in Central Appalachia are probably closing for good
 From what I ve seen in Central App  a lot of these mines that are closing  particularly the smaller ones  I think are going for good  And the cost to reopen them  I think  is going to be very difficult when you look at regional natural gas pricing      Coal

95663,317178,SBUX,The Rich May Be Getting Richer  But Everyone Else Is Better Off Too,opinion,"The income inequality crowd is obsessed with the narrowest measure of median real household income compiled by the Census Bureau to measure poverty  Yet it excludes significant non cash government benefits  Furthermore  as I ve observed previously  this is pre tax so it doesn t reflect income redistributed through the tax system  Even with all their tax shelters  the rich pay lots of taxes  The poor can get the Earned Income Tax Credit to boost their incomes 
In June  personal income per household was at a record high of  130 277  saar  in current dollars  It was  118 803 in real dollars  and up a whopping 108  since the start of the Census data in 1967  I don t have a way of calculating median personal income per household  but I note that the trends in the Census measures of mean and median household income have been similar  though they do show the rich getting richer  In any event  mean real household income is up 49  since the start of the data  lagging well behind the comparable measure of total personal income 
The important point is that incomes haven t been stagnating as charged by the income inequality crowd  Furthermore  in June  personal consumption per household rose to a record  104 440 in current dollars  It was  95 244 in real dollars  saar   and up 118  since the start of the Census data in 1967 
There simply aren t enough rich people to explain this record high in the standard of living as measured by mean real consumption per household  To reiterate  mean real household income  which admittedly gives more weight to the rich than does the median measure  has also stagnated  but for a shorter period than the median  It is actually down 5  since 1999 through 2013  Yet since the start of 1999  real personal income per household is up 24  and real consumption per household rose 27   both to new record highs

95664,317179,SBUX,How To Make Money In China And Asia,opinion,"After all of the carnage in Chinese stocks this summer  some of you are probably patting yourselves on the back for avoiding China   and the rest of the Asia Pacific region  for that matter 
But if you followed my strategy for these markets  you d be pleased as punch and out of China after a 100  gain in the last year 
You see  in early 2014  Chinese stocks were dirt cheap  ignored and even hated with a passion by most investors  But as soon as an uptrend began to form  I recommended that investors begin buying 
In just over a year  this momentum driven market was up over 125  
I don t know if this was a bubble  But my rule of thumb is to sell half of any position up 100  in a year and then place a 15  trailing stop loss to protect the balance of my hard earned gains 
This value driven  disciplined strategy is the best way to play all emerging and frontier markets 
Another key is flexibility  Don t be like many investors  who  when they hear  Asia   can only think  China   There are so many other opportunities in this dynamic  fast growing region 
One example is Southeast Asia   10 countries comprising more than 600 million youthful consumers hungry to catch up with the West  Many of these countries have substantially lower manufacturing wages and  in the last year  Southeast Asia has attracted more investment capital than China 
So where should you invest right now 
I would take a good look at Hong Kong  This territory is trading at a sharp discount to Chinese stocks and is going after many of the same markets 
Focus on Value and Quality
Why not begin with the bluest of blue chips  Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd PK  OTC JMHLY  is what I call the Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  of Asia  Founded in 1832  the company is incorporated in Bermuda but headquartered in Hong Kong  About 40  of its profits are from greater China  with 47  from Southeast Asia 
Jardine is basically a conglomerate with deep tentacles in a variety of stable and growing consumer businesses  It has a pristine balance sheet and well connected executives  And it also happens to be trading at a roughly 30  discount to net asset value  Its stock also offers a 2 6  dividend yield 
Here s a quick overview of this conglomerate s key businesses 
Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd  SIN DAIR  is a leading pan Asian retail group  although Hong Kong remains its biggest market  It owns both the leading supermarket and the leading health and beauty chain 
Other Hong Kong operations include  the 7 Eleven  KL SEVE  convenience store chain  IKEA furniture stores  and a 50  interest in Maxim s  which operates the Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  franchise in Hong Kong  
Hongkong Land Holdings Limited  SIN HKLD  is one of Asia s largest property companies  It owns large amounts of prime commercial property in the heart of central Hong Kong  where its buildings form an interlinked network of offices and retail space 
Jardine Cycle   Carriage Ltd  SIN JCYC  is a Singapore listed holding company  Its main asset is a 50 1  shareholding in the separately listed Astra International  a large Indonesian conglomerate 
Mandarin Oriental International Ltd  SIN MOIL  owns and manages luxury hotels  It currently owns or has substantial interests in 15 hotels worldwide 
Jardine Pacific  SIN JARD  is a holding company for Jardine Matheson s non listed Asian businesses  These cover a wide range of industries and include a number of associates and joint ventures 
Jardine Motors operates car dealerships in Hong Kong  Macau  China  and the U K 
Jardine Lloyd Thompson is a London listed insurance broker and employee benefits adviser 
Jardine Matheson is trading at just 84  of book value and nine times forward earnings  and is flush with  1 billion in cash  A 2 6  dividend yield offers a cushion and downside protection  and some reasonable  A  share buyback is a distinct possibility 
Finally  data drawn from Jardine Matheson s website shows its shares trading at a 29  discount to net asset value  This is the clincher for me 
Buying quality value in growth markets that are out of favor   coupled with a disciplined sell strategy   is the key to building wealth

The week roared in like a lion and left like a lamb  For the week  the Dow gained 1 1 percent  the S P rose 0 9 percent and the Nasdaq added 2 6 percent  Go figure   gave way to a rush to buy on Wednesday and Thursday  And for many investors  it was just too much  Equity funds saw  29 5 billion head for the exits  the largest weekly outflow on record  On Tuesday  investors pulled out  19 billion  the biggest single day for outflows in the past 8 years  Some traders would call that  capitulation   a sign of a bottom in the markets 
The chaos of this week s markets appeared to hit smaller investors especially hard  leaving yet another dent in their stock market confidence  The Monday flash crash resulted in smaller investors being locked out of their online accounts  Strange glitches appeared  Exchanges spit out the wrong prices for widely held funds  For example  the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  dropped 33  in 15 minutes  then shot right back up 30 minutes later  while the stocks tracked by the ETF never fell that far 
The PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   which tracks 100 of the biggest NASDAQ Composite stocks  dropped 17  in a matter of minutes  The shares of the 100 companies that make up the PowerShares QQQ did not drop 17 percent  There is about  2 trillion held in 1 411 exchange traded funds in the US  Monday s flash crash raised an interesting question  how difficult would it be to liquidate those ETFs in a period of stress 
The crash also raised questions about whether the exchanges offer a fair playing field  You probably already know the answer  So far we have heard next to nothing from the Securities and Exchange Commission  What we really saw was a market failure  A playing field heavily tilted toward High Frequency Traders and tilted away from the average investor  Some traders see the outflows as capitulation  but most Mom and Pop investors likely just rode it out  if you own Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   you probably did not sell when it dropped 26   first you probably didn t realize it  second  you probably couldn t log on to trade it 
And so most of the outflow can likely be attributed to the institutional investors and algorithmic traders  those folks  or maybe we should say  those machines   Gillian Tett of the Financial Times wrote   these machines are being programmed to link numerous market segments together into trading strategies  So when computer programs cannot buy or sell assets in one segment of the market  they will rush into another  hunting for liquidity  
In Asia  Chinese shares rallied for a second day and the yuan gained the most since April on speculation authorities took several more steps to prop up equities  During this week s wild ride  China became the epicenter of a global selloff  with a five session crash starting last Thursday triggering steep losses in U S  and European stocks   only to be followed by surges  The Shanghai Composite index closed the session up 4 9   paring its loss for the week to just over 10  
So far the situation in China has not lead to credit contagion  just volatility that spread globally  Of course the really big risk of extreme volatility in the markets comes from the possibility that the High Frequency Traders and the market makers and their algorithms just freeze up  and we saw some of that on Monday  Then the circuit breakers kicked in  and things normalized  But here s where it gets tricky  When all those ETFs couldn t figure out pricing  it was really a pretty simple problem  check the prices of the stocks in the basket  recalculate  and then reset the prices  Remember that ETFs are a very basic form of derivatives  a fund derived from the valuations of a basket of stocks 
For every market and every index  there are derivatives  and most of them are much more complex than a simple basket of stocks  and they are still largely unregulated  Remember back in 2008  when the derivatives trading unit of American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG  collapse  AIG executive Joe Cassano had the famous quote that is was difficult to imagine  a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing a dollar in any of those transactions   And then of course  AIG collapsed when its credit default swaps defaulted and the financial world learned that they couldn t cover their bets  and the government came to the rescue with a  180 billion bailout for AIG 
Now you may think that this problem was cleaned up following the near global financial meltdown of 2008  Dodd Frank reform was supposed to make derivatives trading more transparent  but that didn t happen  Wall Street firms successfully lobbied to have a huge loophole inserted into the Dodd Frank Act that enables them to  Now traders and firms can shift the location of the swaps to places like London and avoid the oversight that was supposed to be provided by Dodd Frank  The trading affiliates of the largest banks remain largely outside the jurisdiction of U S  regulators  thanks to a loophole in swaps rules that banks successfully won from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2013 
The U S  derivatives market has shrunk but remains large  with outstanding contracts worth  220 trillion at face value  And the top five top banks account for 92 percent of that  US banks are still trading derivatives as vigorously as ever  But their trades  booked through London affiliates  do not carry any credit guarantees  meaning that when the next credit contagion hits  they won t be forced to pay off  meaning that all the financial institutions that purchased derivatives as a hedge against extreme volatility  kind of like what we saw on Monday  they don t actually have insurance 
 was revised lower for August  to 91 9 from a preliminary tally of 92 9 and a July reading of 93 1  That was the first reading since the market turmoil 
Total incomes rose 0 4 percent in July for a fourth month  Consumer spending increased 0 3 percent in July  matching the prior month s gain  Because spending increased less than incomes  the saving rate rose to 4 9 percent from 4 7 percent  Today s Commerce Department report also showed inflation remained tame  The personal expenditure index  or PCE  increased 0 1  from the prior month and was up 0 3 percent from a year earlier  The core price measure  which excludes food and fuel  also rose 0 1 percent from the prior month and was up 1 2 percent from July 2014  the smallest year to year gain in four years  Inflation hasn t reached the Fed s 2 percent goal since April 2012 
So what s on the menu at Jackson Hole  The Federal Reserve s annual economic policy conference kicked off late last night  and will run through Saturday  Fed policymakers have  in the past  used the conference to telegraph changes in monetary policy  In the past couple of days  we have heard from NY Fed President William Dudley  who seems split between hiking or waiting  KC Fed President Esther George is predictably hawkish  Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota is predictably dovish 
With Fed Chair Janet Yellen skipping the conference we probably won t hear anything definitive  traders will be watching for signals about the likely timing of an interest rate increase from Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer  Today Fischer was playing it close to the vest  saying the Fed is watching the situation in China  but also acknowledging that the US economy has shown signs of strength 
There is little doubt that the Federal Reserve s efforts to prop up the stock market since the 2008 financial crisis through monetary stimulus measures  like buying up government bonds and other assets  better known as quantitative easing  or QE  helped fueled one of the longest bull runs in history  But those who predict a cratering of the market with the cessation of QE have  so far  been proven wrong  At most  the market rally slowed  but it did not crater  The market anticipation of the end of QE  a taper tantrum  was far worse than the actual end of QE  We may be seeing something similar now 
And while QE and Zero Interest Rate Policy were certainly important parts in the market recovery from 2008  they were not the only parts  and it is probably misleading to make a direct connection when trying to gauge where the S P 500 is headed or why it might go in a particular direction  In short  an interest rate hike in the not too distant future is not off the table 
Crude prices were up again today after bouncing back from six and a half year lows on positive U S  growth numbers  recovering equities markets and reports of an emergency OPEC meeting  On Thursday  oil saw its biggest one day bounce since 2009 with North Sea Brent and U S  light crude rising more than 10   tacking on 6 3  today  WTI crude posted its first weekly gain in nine weeks  ending its longest losing streak since 1986 
Carl Icahn has set his sights on mining company  Freeport McMoRan  The stock surged almost 30  after announcing plans to cut spending and production  and lowering its 2016 capex budget by 29  from its  5 6B estimate issued in July  After the closing bell  Carl Icahn disclosed an 8 46  active stake in the company  sending shares up another 10  in after hours trading  In a new 13D filing  Icahn said he plans to engage with Freeport McMoRan management and may seek board seats

95666,317181,SBUX,China food scandal spreads  drags in Starbucks  Burger King and McNuggets in Japan,news,"By Adam Jourdan  SHANGHAI  Reuters    The latest food scandal in China is spreading fast  dragging in U S  coffee chain Starbucks  Burger King Worldwide Inc and others  as well as McDonald s products as far away as Japan   McDonald s Corp and KFC s parent Yum Brands Inc apologized to Chinese customers on Monday after it emerged that Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd  a unit of U S  based OSI Group LLC  had supplied expired meat to the two chains   On Tuesday  Starbucks said some of its cafes previously sold products containing chicken originally sourced from Shanghai Husi  a firm that was shut down on Sunday by local regulators after a TV report showed staff using expired meat and picking up meat from the floor to add to the mix   A Tokyo based spokesman at McDonald s Holdings Co  Japan  Ltd said the company had sourced about a fifth of its Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi and had halted sales of the product on Monday  Alternative supplies of chicken have been found in Thailand and China  he added  The company s shares briefly fell as much as 1 4 percent to a 15 month low before closing down 0 4 percent   China s food watchdog said it ordered regional offices to carry out spot checks on all firms which had used Shanghai Husi products  and would inspect all of parent OSI s sites around China to see if enough has been done to ensure food safety  It said the case could be handed over to the police   The regulator s Shanghai branch said in a statement on Tuesday it had demanded production  quality control and sales records from OSI  It added it already ordered McDonald s to seal over 4 500 boxes of suspected meat products and Yum s Pizza Hut to seal over 500 boxes of beef   Fast food chain Burger King and Dicos  China s third ranked fast food chain owned by Ting Hsin International  said they would remove Shanghai Husi food products from their outlets  Pizza chain Papa John s International Inc said on its Weibo blog that it had taken down all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi and cut ties with the supplier   FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS  Food safety is one of the top issues for Chinese consumers after a scandal in 2008 where dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of six infants and made many thousands sick  Other food scandals have hit the meat and dairy industries in recent years  and many Chinese look to foreign brands as offering higher safety standards    China is McDonald s third biggest market by number of restaurants and Yum s top market by revenue  McDonald s is due to report quarterly earnings later on Tuesday   The scare has stirred local consumers and become one of the most discussed topics online among the country s influential  netizens   with some users spreading long lists of firms thought to be tarnished   The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China  Wal Mart Stores Inc came under the spotlight early this year after a supplier s donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat  It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011   Starbucks said on its Chinese microblog site that it had no direct business relationship with Shanghai Husi  but that some of its chicken acquired from another supplier had originally come from Husi for its  Chicken Apple Sauce Panini  products  This had been sold in 13 different provinces and major cities  The company added that all the products had already been removed from its shelves   Burger King said in a Weibo statement posted late on Monday that it had taken off its shelves all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi Food and had launched an investigation   Dicos said it pulled all ham products supplied by Shanghai Husi  and would stop serving its ham sandwich product for breakfast   We will continue to carry out a probe into Shanghai Husi Food and its related firms  to understand whether or not it followed national regulations   Dicos said in a statement   Swedish furniture firm IKEA  IKEA UL   which has in store food outlets  said on Weibo that Shanghai Husi had previously been a supplier  but had not provided the firm with products since September last year  Domino s Pizza Inc and Doctor s Associates Inc s Subway brand  which were named in online reports as being supplied meat from Shanghai Husi  said their outlets in China did not use meat products from the firm

95667,317182,SBUX,How McDonald s  KFC  Others Can Recover From Chinese Food Scandal,news,"By    As the scope of China s latest food scandal broadens amid Tuesday reports that Starbucks  Burger King  Papa John s and IKEA all bought meat from a poultry firm shut down Sunday over food safety violations  experts say the implicated companies need to take meaningful steps to strengthen their food safety policies 
 Companies seem to be willing to make the investment to do due diligence for things like corruption and bribery because they have major legal consequences  but tainted food products can do enormous damage to reputations around the world as well   Alexandra Wrage  president of Maryland based nonprofit Trace International  which helps its members enact due diligence and compliance programs  said 
 There has to be the investment to get this right     In a place like China where you aren t confident in your supply chain  companies need to realize that the responsibility is going to shift to them to monitor their supply chain ensure that it is safe and reputable and reliable  
McDonald s  NYSE MCD  and Yum  Brands Inc  NYSE YUM  apologized to consumers Sunday as a result of the expanding scandal  which emerged in the wake of a report in Chinese media about Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd  A subsidiary of the U S  based  privately held OSI Group LLC  the supplier was shuttered by Chinese regulators on Sunday after a TV investigation showed footage of employees using meat dropped on the floor and expired chicken 
The fallout for McDonald s and Yum    the parent company of the KFC and Pizza Hut restaurant chains    has been swift  with their stocks falling by 1 45 percent and 4 25 percent respectively on Monday  underscoring the need for them to address their supply chain failings 
And Reuters reported Tuesday morning that other companies including Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX   Burger King Worldwide Inc  NYSE BKW   Papa John s International Inc  NASDAQ PZZA   and the privately held The IKEA Group have come forward to reveal that they too have sold products containing meat supplied by Shanghai Husi  McDonald s told the newswire that it had determined that it sold meat from the supplier in stores in Japan and Thailand 
The companies are left facing the twin uphill battles of restoring confidence in their brands and putting in place measures to ensure that they avoid future problems in China  which has been plagued by repeated food safety scandals in recent years  The latest allegations came as Yum    which earns more than half its revenue from its Chinese locations    finally seemed to be recovering from a late 2012 scandal over a report that revealed it had been using chicken from two Chinese suppliers that were overusing growth hormones 
The first thing the implicated companies need to do in order to recover from this current scandal is to launch a public relations campaign aimed at reassuring consumers  according to Candice Lee  a franchising attorney at the California law firm Palmieri Tyler 
 They need to show that they re looking for a replacement supplier or they re using a supplier from another country or are investigating the supplier  to make sure that they are going through the due diligence of ensuring that they find a supplier that will be up to their standards going forward   Lee said   Something to put the consumers  minds at ease that they re not going to use the tainted product and to ensure that this is not going to happen again  

That process has already begun in earnest  as McDonald s and Yum have released statements apologizing to their customers and announcing they have severed ties with Shanghai Husi 
 If confirmed  the practices outlined in the report are completely unacceptable to McDonald s   We are no longer serving product from the factory   This matter is being thoroughly investigated and we are cooperating fully with the authorities   McDonald s spokeswoman Becca Harry said via email 
Yum provided via email a lengthy Yum China statement translated from Chinese 
 We already required all KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and stop using all meat materials supplied to us from the Husi factory   Food safety is the most important priority for us  We will not tolerate any violations of government laws and regulations from our suppliers  Yum  China has immediately started the investigation on Husi  and will collaborate with government proactively  
But simply apologizing and dropping Shanghai Husi will not be enough to restore confidence in their brands  observers say  Tony Corbo  lead lobbyist at the U S  based advocacy organization Food   Water Watch  agreed that it is important for companies to take this process into their own hands  Despite the fact that China has made improving food safety a national priority  he said  the implementation has yet to catch up with the rhetoric 
 These companies need to be careful as far as who they re sourcing their meat and poultry from  That s common sense   he said   If they re not doing this  they re kind of stupid  but they should be going to these plants on a regular basis    these plants that are supplying ingredients and meat supply    to ensure safety standards are being met  
Hank Lambert  CEO of Pure Bioscience  OTC PURE   a California company that produces antimicrobial products for use in food safety and other applications  emphasized the importance of companies enacting their own inspection systems and safety standards to augment those of Chinese regulators 
 One thing they might want to do is tighten up the product specifications and specifications by which a company would become a supplier to them to include more frequent audits at their suppliers  plants  both announced and unannounced   he said 
 Their size and the size of the network of suppliers increases the complexity of the challenge to ensure that their suppliers are adhering to food safety standards  It s basically a resource commitment on their part  increase the number of auditors and inspectors that they have going into the plants   Lambert said ",2014-07-22,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/how-mcdonald's,-kfc,-others-can-recover-from-chinese-food-scandal-296874",296874
95683,317198,SBUX,Java Blues  Coffee  Coffee  Coffee,opinion,"Coffee has magical properties  Many people cannot wake up in the morning without it  Companies that sell it have thrived throughout the US  setting up shops like Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   Pete s  Green Mountain  NASDAQ GMCR   and a whole host of local ones  And when the people cannot get it  they get the Java Blues 
The price of coffee gave many those Java blues for a while too  Coffee prices went on a long trending rise higher from 2002 through to the peak in 2011  This was much like the chart for gold  Liquid gold maybe  and more important to most 

The monthly chart above shows the rise in prices to a double top at 3 08 four years ago  Since then  the price fell back nearly 78 6  before a sharp counter trend bounce into 2014  That bounce retraced 61 8  of the fall before it also reversed  Now  the drop lower has retraced 78 6  of the bounce higher 
A series of nested Fibonacci levels  Some similarities with the same 78 6  retracement  Time for another flip back higher  The rest of the chart suggest not  Looking at the RSI  it is leveling but not turned back higher  It has also not reached oversold levels yet  More importantly  the MACD at the bottom is still heading lower  At the last bottom  it had already stopped falling and started higher at the 78 6  retracement 
There are no signs of that happening soon here  These factors combine to suggest that there is more downside to come for coffee prices  That should keep prices lower at you local shop  or at least keep them from increasing  Maybe that will help keep away the Java Blues

95684,317199,SBUX,Moving Closer To The Edge,opinion,"Risk On  The Fed would like you to move closer to the edge for an even better view  Stocks rose last week  lifted by signals from the Federal Reserve that interest rate increases might come more slowly than previously thought  Nevertheless  for the second week in a row  the market gave up a portion of the gains on Friday  this time over intensifying worries that Greece might default on its debt or be forced out of the eurozone  The Fed s dovish comments on Wednesday brought the  risk on  trade back  and investors piled on Thursday into highflying  high momentum biotechnology stocks such as Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   up 5   among others  The Nasdaq managed to take out its previous intraday high set back in 2000  before easing back slightly  Pessimism over a Greek bailout got the upper hand on Friday  and stock prices faded  With little in the way of big domestic news expected this week  the market s focus is likely to stay on the small nation teetering on default

So the Dovish Optimists at the Federal Reserve updated their interest rate guidance last week  As has been the trend  they again lowered their rate increase expectations while throwing out many comments that want you to believe this rate hike cycle will be as enjoyable as a never ending massage 



U S  Equities took the RISK ON cue and ran with it  but fell short of making all time new highs  However  bases are being built in a low volatility environment  suggesting there is plenty of money buying on the dips

Within Large Cap stocks  the consumer must be feeling good with Nike  NYSE NKE   Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and Jurassic Park all setting new all time highs 




Also sparking the market to new highs is the insane number of Corporate Weddings occurring this summer  Although  a Roman Orgy might better describe what is happening over in the Managed Care industry 
  Anthem  NYSE ANTM  bids for Cigna  NYSE CI    Aetna  NYSE AET  throws flowers at Humana  NYSE HUM    United Healthcare is also winking at Humana   Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  is feeling lonely after being rejected by Maxim Integrated  NASDAQ MXIM    AMD is exploring all options   Cypress Semi  NASDAQ CY  is still wooing Integrated Silicon  NASDAQ ISSI    Fox wants to own all of Sky   Jana is upset at Conagra  NYSE CAG   so wants to control all of it   The owners of Duff   Phelps want to marry it off   Ryland Homes and Standard Pacific  NYSE SPF  decide to move beyond just being friends   Williams Companies  NYSE WMB  is now thinking of dumping Williams Partners  NYSE WPZ  and jumping into the arms of Energy Transfer  NYSE ETE    Martha Stewart  NYSE MSO  decides to cater her own wedding and sells out   Home Properties  NYSE HME  also sells out   And for French proposals  Numericable  PARIS NUME  gets one from Bouyues Telecom

Out of the ACME box thinking from Eric Peters this week  ACME Traps   Volumes are picking up   said Roadrunner  the market s top volatility trader  Greece has been the catalyst  activity jumped in Bunds and currencies   But there was no real bleed into the S P vol   said the savvy character  looking left  right  up   There are lots of concerns in this market  but prices keep moving higher   The cost of S P puts is near historical highs relative to the cost of calls   It is difficult for markets to fall in a material way when the skew is this high  it s hard to generate downside velocity  
ACME Traps II   Everyone s certain this will go horribly wrong  it s just a matter of when   continued Roadrunner  dodging falling anvils   When people are this scared  they prefer to be early   New highs are greeted with condemnation  not celebration  Leveraged money had no problem buying European bonds at negative yields  in the hopes that rates would fall further below zero  But that same insanity is absent in equities   People are not positioned for upside  yet the path of least resistance continues to be up  

Greece  okay  I said it  Yes  it is still a country on the Mediterranean that is impacting the European markets  Especially 2nd tier Euro bond spreads 


As well as the volatility of the German stock market  VDAX   But no visible impact on the volatility of the U S  stock market  VIX  

In the U S   the butterflies in the stomach can be seen in the performance of High Grade Corporate Bonds  which are continuing to underperform U S  Treasuries  As we have seen in the fund flows  a significant amount of money is leaving fixed income funds and ETFs  so hopefully  this is a temporary fund flow effect and not a leading indicator of credit risk in the U S  economy  But so far  this has had little impact on the Equity Markets 



Another area of concern in the U S  can be seen in energy stocks  ARCA XLE   which have now declined for 7 straight weeks 



China also decided to pause sharply last week after going vertical for 6 months 



Looking through the weekend reads  Barron s builds a case for buying the Airline stocks on this 20 30  pullback  Investors have sold the stocks off on capacity addition concerns  but Barron s thinks the valuations more than discount the increased capex worry 



So Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  just took over the smoke detector alarm business  Next up  Home Security and Monitoring  Nest  a business owned by Google that makes connected home products  refreshed its line of three devices today  but it was the firm s deal with insurance companies that s really exciting  Nest said it has established partnerships with American Family Insurance and Liberty Mutual Insurance to offset the costs of a Nest Protect smoke detector  and establish a monthly discount for homes that link their Nest smoke detectors to the insurance firms  American Family is the first insurer to have the program up and running  but it s only doing so in the state of Minnesota  The insurer will send the customer the Protect  which costs  99  at no cost  and the customer hooks the Protect up via the  Works with Nest  program  That will enable the Protect to share some data with the insurance firm  so it knows if the customer s house has working smoke detectors  This is great for the insurance company  since smoke detectors help reduce the damage done by fires  and can lower the insurance payouts  It s akin to the discounts that home insurance providers offer for people who install security systems

95685,317200,SBUX,Here s How The Coffee Market Can Determine What Kind You Drink ,news,"By    Wide price spreads for two types of coffee beans traded in New York and London dampen demand for the world s most popular coffee bean  Latin America s Arabica  just as demand for Asian Robusta rises 
 If you had a little more spread  then you would be growing that  Arabica  demand much stronger   said BNP Paribas SA EPA BNP agricultural strategist Keith Flury at a coffee industry conference on Saturday   But you re not  you re growing the Robusta demand  

Arabica coffee beans  grown in Brazil  Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America  are the type best known to Western consumers and used exclusively by chains like Starbucks Corporation NASDAQ SBUX  Robusta beans are largely popular in Asia and in instant coffee  They are produced by Vietnam and the Ivory Coast  among other countries 
Traders watch the Arabica Robusta spread  or price differential  to monitor variations in demand and price  Robusta futures are traded on London s LIFFE exchange  while Arabica contracts trade in New York  Many consumers and industry experts view Arabica as superior in quality and flavor 
 The market is encouraging Arabica rationing and production along with Robusta consumption   reads a presentation given by Flury on emerging market and currency impacts on coffee  The key price spread last peaked in 2011  though current levels compare more closely to ratios from 2012 
Arbitrage between Arabica and Robusta jumped almost 64 percent from January to February  said the International Coffee Organization in its latest monthly report  By the start of March  the differential exceeded  1 per pound  as Robusta stocks fell to their lowest level on record on the London futures market 

Back at the end of 2013  BNP Paribas forecast stronger Arabica consumption in 2014  based on low prices and little difference in Arabica Robusta prices  Now that Arabica coffee prices have rallied dramatically thanks to drought in Brazil  the world s largest coffee producer  that view must be revised  according to Flury    
 The idea that the world is going to consume more Arabica in 2014  we have to review that again   said Flury during his presentation   It s probably not going to happen on the kind of scale we envisioned  especially with the arbitrage as high as it is  
Coffee demand has grown slowly but steadily over the past decade  driven mostly by emerging markets  Consumers have drunk more Robusta relative to Arabica  as the latter bean has ceded significant share of global demand 
  

 The growth in demand in Robusta far outweighs the growth in demand of Arabica   said Flury   If you look at the demand globally of Arabica  it s actually been relatively flat for a number of years now  
Coffee is the best performing commodity for the year to date  gaining 58 percent since the start of 2014  That has been one of the steepest and fastest price gains in coffee ever  One recent 20 percent surge came as the steepest weekly rally since 1999  reported Reuters 
High price differentials can even push coffee roasters to tweak the composition of their coffee blends  to take advantage of cheap Robusta prices  according to the ICO 
 If the arbitrage is too high  he might want to use more robusta to reduce the total cost   said Mauricio Galindo  the organization s head of operations  in an email to IBTimes   
Arabica robusta coffee blends  frowned upon by some market participants  were last seen in 2011  when Arabica coffee touched over  3 per pound  On Tuesday  Arabica coffee traded at  1 74 lb in New York ",2014-03-25,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/here's-how-the-coffee-market-can-determine-what-kind-you-drink-273915,273915
95686,317201,SBUX,McDonald s Q1 Earnings Preview  Profits Seen Down 2 7 ,news,"By    In the fast food world  breakfast has lately gotten crowded    bad news for McDonald s  which derives a fifth of its American revenues from sales of Egg McMuffins  hash browns and other morning fare 
Trouble capturing enough breakfast customers is expected feature prominently in the report McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  plans to release before the markets open in New York on Tuesday detailing its sales and earnings over the first three months of 2014 
Forecasts anticipate that the fast food chain    the world s largest by sales     will report a 2 7 percent drop in net profit  to  1 24 billion  compared to the first quarter of 2013  according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters  Earnings per share is expected to come in at  1 24 on revenue of  6 73 billion  For the quarter  the company s stock price increased 1 percent to  97 24 
Harsh winter weather in the U S   a stronger dollar and weakness in Europe and Asia have combined to limit prospects at the McDonald s  the world s largest restaurant chain by sales 
 The competitive environment remains challenging in the fast food industry  particularly in the U S   as chains compete for foot traffic in a still soft retail environment   Deutsche Bank analyst Jason West  said this week in a research note   MCD has significant exposure to foreign currencies  most notably the euro and UK pound   which could cause volatility in sales and earnings  
Analysts also point to a menu that s too big  and the company s initiative to redesign prep tables for faster service isn t expected to begin until late this year  Meanwhile  the 59 year old Oak Brook 
Ill   company is seeing only incremental traffic from its re launched Dollar Menu  called Dollar Menu and More  while its premium Clubhouse Burger  may have fallen short of expectations   according to Jeffries equity analyst Andy Barish  In March the company was forced to cut its Mighty Wings losses by dropping the price by 40 percent to unload millions of pounds of the chicken parts that didn t sell as well as the company expected 
The winter weather in this past quarter that hit much of America kept many consumers away  U S  same store sales fell 3 3 percent in January  which offset increases in Asia  the Middle East and Europe where sales grew between 2 percent and 5 4 percent  Globally  the sales increased 1 2 percent in January  but they declined 0 3 percent in February  Because the sales are in dollars  McDonald s makes more from U S  sales and franchise revenue from the 80 percent of stores that are independently owned  Traffic in the U S  has the greater impact on the company s financials 
Last year  same stores sales grew only 0 2 percent and the consensus shows the same for the first quarter of 2013  Same store sales is a key measurement that excludes data from restaurants that have been open for less than a year and more accurately reflect general traffic to the company s more than 35 000 restaurants 
As the company struggles to attract consumers it s also facing a double team going after its  10 billion breakfast segment where for decades the Egg McMuffin has helped the company retain the top spot in the breakfast niche 
Yum  Brands Inc  NYSE YUM  the Louisville  Ky   owner of KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  and Seattle s Starbucks Corp  NASDAQ SBUX  have both added breakfast menu items to their roster in an attempt to grab some of the 30 percent U S  market share McDonald s has of the breakfast crowd  Yum s Taco Bell chain added in late March waffle tacos  breakfast wraps and egg burritos to most of the company s 3 700 U S  restaurants  Starbucks also launched in March baked goods under the La Boulange brand and new breakfast sandwich items 

McDonald s responded to these moves by offering free coffee in the first half of April and recently kicked off a new marketing blitz for its McGriddle pancake muffin sandwich  If the company loses market share in this important segment it will face pressure to renegotiate licensing and rental fees to it franchisers 
McDonald s is facing some important challenges for its long term growth  including its ongoing inability to attract the increasing numbers of younger health conscious consumers  But with  89 billion in global sales it would take a long time for the king of quick service to falter ",2014-04-18,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mcdonald’s-q1-earnings-preview:-profits-seen-down-2.7-278357,278357
95687,317202,SBUX,Why Bad Weather Won t Hurt Starbucks Q2 Earnings ,news,"By    Starbucks Corporation NASDAQ SBUX has been working to maintain global dominance as a coffee retailer by separating itself from rivals through the introduction of new food items and a digital strategy unique to the industry  That strategy is expected to pay off handsomely when the Seattle caf  giant posts quarterly results that leave the competition far behind 
The company has more than 2 000 locations in 60 countries  with major store growth in the China Asia Pacific region  where it plans to build most of the planned 1 500 new stores by 2015  But the most important thing isn t how many stores the company has  it s what they re serving    and especially how   
One of the ways Starbucks has stood out among other coffee retailers is through online and mobile projects  which CEO Howa rd Schultz has long been advocating 
When the Seattle based caf  giant will report on Thursday after market close  analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect profits in the fiscal second quarter of  425 34 million  up 8 9 percent from the same quarter last year  Earnings per share during the January March period is expected to jump to 56 cents  up from 51 cents a year earlier  as revenue jumps 11 1 percent to hit  3 95 billion 
 Starbucks is also much more than retail expansion story  At a time when most restaurant and retailers are struggling to stimulate transaction growth  Starbucks  recent transaction gains are impressive and underpin the global strength of its brand   Barclays analysts said in a note to clients earlier this month 
The 2013 holiday season was a shock for many brick and mortar retailers who watched foot traffic give way to online shopping  and physical gifts get replaced with cards 
 Starbucks was prepared for both of these shifts  having invested over many years in the creation and development of proprietary world class digital and mobile payment and card technology and expertise   Schultz said on the first quarter earnings all  where he also noted the nearly 10 million customers using the mobile payment app  which allows customers to pay using their phones  track loyalty points and even tip baristas 
In North America  14 percent of Starbucks transactions were made via mobile  and more than  612 million worth of loyalty cards were activated over the holiday period alone    benefits that should carry over in the next few months 
 We think post holiday gift card redemption could potentially offset any weather related choppiness   reads a note from analysts at Jefferies regarding the second quarter 
Nevertheless  they still predicted earnings per share at 55 cents  just under consensus  citing deteriorating economic trends   regional economic woes  affecting European business and a possible slowdown in the single serve market 
Jefferies  analysts wrote that it hasn t been a friendly quarter for most restaurants  but  companies with real menu innovation  attractive value propositions  strong brand loyalty and more effective marketing digital strategies  should be able to withstand it  citing Starbucks as one of them 
Starbucks has also added new products to stores to bring in new customers  with plans to increase the average ticket price  or how much each customer spends while there 
Barclays analysts forecast 11 percent top line growth driven by 5 percent growth in the Americas and 5 percent growth in China Asia Pacific based  largely on traffic gains as well as a modest increase in the average transaction size due to new in store food and packaged good offerings   according to a Jan  29 note 
Same store sales grew by 7 percent in both 2012 and 2013  but last year s increase had a higher proportion of ticket price growth than just traffic  meaning people aren t just going to Starbucks more often  they re also buying more than just coffee 

Cold pressed juices from Evolution Fresh and baked goods from La Boulange were successful during the first few months and are still in  early days   according to chief financial officer Scott Maw  who told Food Business News the products were only about 50 percent rolled out 
The segment s growth should continue to boost sales in the second quarter 
In a March 11 presentation at Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Starbucks executives cited such offerings as a  massive opportunity  since more than 30 million transactions a week don t include any food items 
Aside from that  they also noted big plans to build 1 500 net new stores this year  and forecast a minimum revenue growth of 10 percent  thanks to a  renewed focus on tea   with Starbucks  specialty Teavana locations  along with  single serve leadership  
Another important source of growth for Starbucks is branded products such as Seattle s Best bagged coffee  Verisimo coffee makers and single serve K cups  all of which are sold outside of retail locations  which they refer to as  channel development  
The Barclays analysts predict that this segment  will start to see meaningful margin expansion in fiscal 2014   despite the costs associated with launching new products and  formidable threats in both the retail and wholesale channels    
Analysts at William Blair wrote that growth in K cup sales moderated slightly  with the company s market share dropping to 21 percent from 22 percent the quarter before  However  it s still up from just 17 percent during the same period last year 
They expect operating margin to rise 380 basis points in the segment to 31 6 percent  due to lower coffee costs 
Although coffee futures are up more than 60 percent since the end of January due to a drought in Brazil  Starbucks contracts its purchases months or even years out and shouldn t be affected 
 With Starbucks already fully locked in for its coffee needs for fiscal 2014  we do not expect any impact this year from the recent spike   wrote the analysts  whose revenue estimates were in line with consensus 
Another development during the quarter as an April 16 announcement that the company would move uts European headquarters from Amsterdam to London  with plans to  pay more tax in the U K    after reports that Starbucks was paying very little taxes there  despite making more than  2 billion profit  according to a 2012 Reuters report    
The company has also made a variety of new executive appointments  including the promotion of Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead to the position of chief operating officer  to create a new leadership structure that will help it gain  maximum benefit from the retail  consumer  mobile and digital shifts currently underway in the global marketplace   according to a press release ",2014-04-23,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/why-bad-weather-won't-hurt-starbucks-q2-earnings-278924,278924
95688,317203,SBUX,Lattes  Burritos and Handguns  Which One Doesn t Belong ,news,"By    Even before the latest outbreak of gun violence on American streets    the mass shooting over the weekend in Southern California    major consumer brands were already facing pressure to stake out positions on gun control as part of a trend in which companies promote social causes along with their products 
Earlier this month  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc issued a statement asking customers to leave their guns at home  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and Jack In The Box Inc  NASDAQ JACK  had previously asked patrons not to carry guns while dining  Analysts suggest such public stances could become a new normal  with major brands effectively shaping policies in reaction to changing public values 
 This move is all about how these companies want to position their brands   said Nick Setyan  restaurant analyst at Wedbush Securities   The overarching trend today is brand evolution towards a more sustainable planet  peaceful world  
Starbucks  the world s largest coffee retailer  has been one of the first to adopt a no guns on the premise stance 
 Few topics in America generate a more polarized and emotional debate than guns   Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wrote in an open letter Sept  17  2013 
 In recent months  Starbucks stores and our partners  employees  who work in our stores have been thrust unwillingly into the middle of this debate  That s why I am writing today with a respectful request that customers no longer bring firearms into our stores or outdoor seating area   he wrote 
On May 19 of this year Chipotle made a similar public statement asking customers not to bring guns into their locations  The declaration came soon after a group of rifle toting gun rights activists gathered at a Chipotle in Texas 

 Recently  participants from an  open carry  demonstration in Texas brought guns  including military style assault rifles  into one of our restaurants  causing many of our customers anxiety and discomfort   a company representative said  according to local news reports  adding a request that customers not bring guns into their restaurants 
Chipotle s experiences illustrates the complexity at issue for brands that operate across the United States  In some areas of the country  showing support for gun control can be a popular means of currying consumer favor  but in others it can place a brand at odds with local values 
In many states  people are allowed to carry firearms openly in public  The term  open carry  has become shorthand for a movement to increase visibility and awareness of this practice in places where it s allowed  Advocates for the practice say it helps preserve their Second Amendment rights  and often gather at retail locations for demonstrations 
On one such occasion earlier this month  members of the advocacy group Open Carry Texas entered a Jack in the Box in Fort Worth with their assault rifles  It was enough to scare employees into the restaurant s freezer until police arrived  and prompted yet another corporate anti gun statement from the fast food company 
 The presence of guns inside a restaurant could create an uncomfortable situation for our guests and employees and lead to unintended consequences   a representative said  according to a press release 
The statement came just days after a group called Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America petitioned the company to take a stance on the issue after the incident 
The group  which formed after the mass slaughter of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown  Connecticut  in December 2012  aims  to build support for common sense gun reforms   according to its website   Members have successfully petitioned major companies including Starbucks and Chipotle  to publicly address gun issues 
 Laws continue to change at local and state levels  and businesses are becoming involuntary participants in the debate   said Patrick Lenow  a spokesman for fast food company Sonic Corp  NASDAQ SONC  
One of Sonic s locations was featured in a video that Mother Jones published Tuesday  depicting a group of seven or eight men who were carrying semi automatic rifles getting kicked out of a Sonic Drive Thru  Lenow said the company has historically relied on local gun laws to guide how employees address guns on the property  and is continually analyzing how the organization treats the issue 
In the clip  an employee tells the men he won t serve them and will call the police  The men cancel their orders  leave the restaurant and linger in the parking lot discussing their situation  One man leads his young daughter to his car  rifle slung over his shoulder  Others debate waiting for the police  and other dining options 
 Man  we can t do nothing   the gun toting man says as he filmed the video at Sonic    Nobody likes us  ",2014-05-27,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/lattes,-burritos-and-handguns:-which-one-doesn't-belong -286491",286491

95704,317219,SBUX,CORRECTED   CORRECTED Starbucks Japan lifts outlook on cost cuts  local appr,news," Corrects degree of sales forecast cut in para 7 to      by 2 5
percent      not  by 4 percent  
  TOKYO  Oct 15  Reuters    Starbucks Coffee Japan raised its
full year profit forecast by 50 percent as cost cutting and
higher sales of locally developed drinks helped it boost margins
even in the face of slumping sales 
 The company  which is 40 percent owned by the Seattle based
coffee chain giant Starbucks Corp  has been revamping its cost
structure since last year  when the world s second largest
economy slipped into recession 
 Starbucks Japan  which runs 875 stores  said profits have
been boosted by strong sales of items developed specifically for
the local market  such as Coffee Jelly Frappuccino and Creme
Brulee Macchiato 
  In addition to the fact that locally developed menus fit our
customers here  by developing our own items  we can better
control costs and the level of raw material stocks   said Norio
Adachi  a spokesman at Starbucks Japan 
 In contrast  products that are common globally require buying
ingredients in bulk and often far in advance of sales  For the
company  this raises the risk of a build up of inventories if
demand does not materialise as planned 
 It now forecasts a net profit of 2 7 billion yen   30
million  for the year to March  up 50 percent from its prior
estimate and roughly in line with the average forecast of 2 8
billion yen from two analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I B E S 
 But the company lowered its annual revenue forecast by 2 5
percent to 94 6 billion yen and cut its estimate for same store
sales in the October March second half to a decline of 7 percent
from a fall of 5 percent 
 In addition to sluggish consumer spending  Starbucks Japan
faces tough competition from Tully s Coffee Japan  Doutor

   Price increases expected to boost sales	
   Japan disasters  Borders bankruptcy to hit EPS	
   Risks include rising coffee costs  higher gas prices	
 
 By Lisa Baertlein	
 LOS ANGELES  April 27  Reuters    Starbucks Corp  
the world s biggest coffee chain  is likely to report that
higher prices for its prepared coffee drinks boosted sales at
its core U S  business this past quarter    even as higher food
and gasoline costs cut into consumers  disposable income 	
 The Seattle company  which reports fiscal second quarter
results on Wednesday  looks to the United states for 70 percent
of overall revenue  money that funds expansion in key growth
markets like China 	
 Investors particularly focus on Starbucks  sales at
established U S  cafes  a key gauge of performance 	
 Those sales were up 8 percent in the first quarter  when
more customers came in and also spent more money per visit 	
 Analysts  on average  expect U S  sales at Starbucks cafes
open at least 13 months to be up about 5 percent for the second
quarter 	
  I think the sense is that they re far stronger than that  
said RBC Capital Markets analyst Larry Miller 	
 Indeed  some analysts expect an increase in second quarter
U S  same restaurant sales of as much as 7 percent 	
 Starbucks has been rolling out price increases to various
markets since last year to offset a spike in coffee costs  Those
higher prices should again help boost the same restaurant sales
results  Miller said 	
 Consumer focused companies generally had healthy results for
the March quarter  led by stores that cater to customers in
higher income brackets  William Blair   Co analyst Sharon
Zackfia said 	
 Starbucks appeals to more affluent consumers and its cafes
are packed  Zackfia said   I think the trade up is on again  	
 Starbucks ended a long time grocery distribution deal with
Kraft Foods on March 1 and investors are standing by to
see how much the company will have to pay Kraft as a result of
that decision   ID nN25130983 	
 Shortly after ending the Kraft deal  it also raised the
price of packaged coffee sold in grocery stores by an average of
12 percent   ID nN18111123 	
 Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said in late
March that the chain would take a 1 cent to 2 cent charge
related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and to the
bankruptcy of cafe partner Borders Group Inc  ID nN16268041  	
 Japan is one of Starbucks largest markets and the natural
disasters there resulted in some store closures 	
 While Alstead repeated Starbucks  prior call for
second quarter earnings of 32 cents or 33 cents per share  he
said   these unusual events have likely removed earnings upside
in this quarter beyond that level  	
 Analysts  on average  expect a second quarter profit of 34
cents a share  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S

 NEW YORK  April 28  Reuters    U S  stock index futures
edged lower on Thursday  a day after the Nasdaq rose to a
10 year high and investors looked ahead to first quarter growth
data amid concerns the U S  economy may be starting to slow 
   Economists in a Reuters survey forecast a 2 0 percent
annualized pace of growth  compared with 3 1 percent in the
fourth quarter  but rising commodity prices have left some
worrying about a deeper slowdown 
   The prospect of continued low interest rates after Fed
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke s first ever press conference
drove stocks Wednesday and helped to cement a bullish stocks
outlook  even as the seasonally weak month of May approaches 
    The  sell in May and go away  is not likely to happen
this year   said Peter Cardillo  chief market economist at
Avalon Partners  referring to an old stock market adage 
 But he added   obviously the market is at high levels here
and any negative news could take some of the starch out of the
market   noting that a GDP reading under 1 5 percent would be a
blow for investors 
   A number of companies reported earnings  but the market
impact was slight ahead of the GDP data  Aetna Inc raised its
full year profit forecast  continuing a string of strong
results for the health insurance industry  The shares rose 5 5
percent to  42 in premarket trading 
   Procter   Gamble Co lowered the high end of its profit
forecast as it tries to trim expenses and increase prices to
offset rising costs for materials 
   S P 500 futures fell 1 2 points and were just below fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures dropped 11
points  and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 3 75 points 
   U S  crude futures rose to their highest in 2 1 2 years
and metal prices rallied as the Fed appeared in no rush to
tighten monetary policy 
   The dollar sank to a three year low against a basket of
currencies and was at risk of a drop to  1 50 versus the euro 
with momentum driven investors anticipating that U S  interest
rates will be low for a long time 
   Japan s Nikkei closed up 1 6 percent while European
stocks edged 0 1 percent higher in morning trade  gaining

 NEW YORK  April 28  Reuters    Wall Street was set for a
lower open on Thursday after a report showed the U S  economy
grew less than expected in the first quarter and a number of
companies pointed to rising costs 
 U S  economic growth slowed more than forecast in the first
three months of the year as higher food and gasoline prices
dampened consumer spending and sent a broad measure of
inflation rising at its fastest pace in 2 1 2 years  Growth was
1 8 percent compared to a Reuters consensus estimate of 2
percent   ID nCAT005418 
 In Wednesday s session the Nasdaq hit a 10 year high on the
prospect of continued low interest rates and liquidity until
the end of June  after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke s
first ever news conference 
  With the amount of injection of capital into the economy 
you d hope that we would be able to get above 2 percent
growth   said William Larkin  a portfolio manager with Cabot
Money Management   In the short term this is bad for stocks and
good for bonds  
 S P 500 futures  fell 2 3 points and were below fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the

19 points  and Nasdaq 100 futures  lost 4 5 points 
 In a Labor Department report  new U S  claims for
unemployment benefits surprisingly rose last week to their
highest level since January in a sign an anticipated recovery
in labor markets may take time 
 Earnings season has been strong but there were signs of
creeping costs from some companies  Procter   Gamble Co

   The company warned on Wednesday that costs will take
a bigger chunk out of earnings than previously anticipated  and
its full year forecast disappointed Wall Street  The shares
fell 2 5 percent to  36 24 in premarket trade 
 But many investors are bullish  with around three quarters
of S P 500 companies beating Wall Street s earnings forecasts
so far and with the prospect of continued low interest rates at
least until the end of the year 
   The  sell in May and go away  is not likely to happen
this year   said Peter Cardillo  chief market economist at

the traditionally weaker May and summer months for equities 
 Aetna Inc  raised its full year profit forecast 
continuing a string of strong results for the health insurance
industry  The shares rose 9 2 percent to  43 49 premarket 
 U S  crude oil futures rose to their highest in 2 1 2 years

Thursday after data showed the U S  economy grew less than
expected in the first quarter and a number of companies pointed
to rising costs  but the Nasdaq remained close to its 10 year
high reached in the previous session 
 The slowdown in the economy extended to a report showing
new U S  claims for unemployment benefits surprisingly rose
last week to their highest level since January  but investors
said they needed to see more data before calling an end to the
rally 
  Over the next week or so we will get a little bit better

 NEW YORK  April 28  Reuters    U S  stocks edged up on
Thursday  erasing early losses as investors brushed off
disappointing economic data and bet on a further rally in
equities 
 The gains came after major indexes hit multi year highs in
the previous session  The enthusiasm in the market had pushed
the Nasdaq to a 10 year high  and the Dow is now up 10 percent
and the S P 500 up 8 percent for the year 
 Stocks were pressured at the open after a report showed new

 Separate data showed U S  economic growth slowed more than
forecast in the first three months of the year as higher food
and gasoline prices dampened consumer spending and sent a broad
measure of inflation rising at its fastest pace in 2 1 2
years 
  Investors are willing to look through the GDP data because
most of the weakness was beyond the consumer    If you really
just look at the organic power of the consumer  for the most
part it is remarkable to me that spending is as strong as it is
in the face of  4 gasoline prices   said Jack Ablin  chief
investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago

  These consumer products  companies  are bearing most of

 NEW YORK  July 28  Reuters    U S  stock index futures rose
on Thursday after Wall Street suffered its worst day in eight
weeks  but the session was predicted to be volatile ahead of a

on global equities

95730,317245,SBUX,Is The U S  Headed For A Financial Collapse  ,opinion,"Americans are going to spend more than 600 billion dollars this Christmas season  and on Friday we got to see our fellow citizens fight each other like rabid animals over foreign made flat screen televisions and Barbie dolls   As disgusting as this behavior is to many of us  there may soon come a time when we will all fondly remember these days   Most Americans are  of what is currently happening in the financial world  but right now there are deeply troubling signs that we could be on the verge of another major global financial collapse   If the next great economic downturn does strike in 2015  that could mean that we may have just witnessed the last great Black Friday celebration of American materialism   As you read this  stock prices are  the value that they should be  margin debt is hovering near all time record highs  and the  too big to fail  banks are being far more reckless than they were just prior to the last major stock market implosion   So many of the exact same patterns that we witnessed back in 2007 and 2008 are repeating right now  and as you will see below  this includes a horrifying crash in the price of oil   Anyone with half a brain should be able to see the slow motion financial train wreck that is unfolding right before our eyes 
Every year  it has been my tradition to write an article about the mini riots that erupt in retail stores all around the country on Black Friday   This year things were a bit calmer because so many stores opened up on Thanksgiving itself  but there was still plenty of chaos   
But instead of launching into another diatribe about how we are committing national economic suicide by buying hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign made goods with money that we do not have  I want to focus on what is coming next 
You see  I believe that in the not too distant future many of us will be wishing for the days when the debt fueled U S  economy was healthy enough for people to be wrestling with one another on the floor over good deals in our retail establishments 
The next great financial crash  which many have been anticipating for years  is rapidly approaching   So many of the same things that happened last time are happening again   As I noted above  this includes a crash in the price of oil 
In the months prior to the last stock market collapse  the price of oil began plummeting dramatically in the summer of 2008   This was an  early warning signal  that something was deeply amiss in the financial world 

Many people assume that a lower price for oil is good for the economy  but the exact opposite is actually true   The oil industry has become absolutely critical to the U S  and Canadian economies   And in recent years  the  shale oil boom  has been one of the only bright spots for the United States   If the shale oil industry starts to fail because of lower prices  a lot of the boom areas all over the nation are going to go bust really quickly and a lot of the financial institutions that were backing these projects are going to feel an immense amount of pain 
Unfortunately for us  the  shale oil revolution  simply does not work at 80 dollars a barrel 
And it certainly does not work at 70 dollars a barrel 
As I write this  U S  crude is sitting at about 66 dollars a barrel due to OPEC s recent decision to not cut output 
That is the lowest price for U S  crude since September 2009 
So just like we saw during the summer of 2008  crude oil prices are collapsing once again   The chart below comes from the Federal Reserve  but it is a few days out of date   Now that the price of crude is down to about 66 dollars  you have to imagine the price actually going below the bottom of this chart 

Needless to say  this price collapse is having a huge impact on the stock prices of oil companies   The following information about what happened in the markets on Friday comes from  

Here were some of the biggest losers on Friday 
BP Plc  NYSE BP   down 5 
Royal Dutch Shell A  NYSE RDSa   down 6 
Total SA  NYSE TOT   down 5 
Statoil ASA  NYSE STO   down 14 
Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM   down 5 
ConocoPhillips  COP   down 9 
Marathon Oil  NYSE MRO   down 13 
Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY   down 7 
Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC   down 14 
Linn Energy  NASDAQ LINE   down 13 
Whiting Petroleum  NYSE WLL   down 28 
Oasis Petroleum  NYSE OAS   down 32 
Kodiak Oil   Gas Corp  NYSE KOG   down 28 
And this list goes on 

But this could just be the beginning of the oil price declines 
The most powerful oil official in Russia believes that the price of oil  next year 

Russia s most powerful oil official Igor Sechin said in an interview with an Austrian newspaper that oil prices could fall below  60 by mid way through next year 
Sechin  chief executive of Rosneft  MCX ROSN   Russia s largest oil producer  also said U S  oil production would fall after 2025 and that an oil market council should be created to monitor prices  the same day the OPEC cartel met in Vienna and left its output targets unchanged 
 We expect that a fall in the price to  60 and below is possible  but only during the first half  or rather by the end of the first half  of next year    Sechin told the Die Presse newspaper 

And one oil industry analyst just  that he believes that the price of oil could ultimately plunge as low as  35 a barrel 

 When you look at the second half of 2015  that s when you see oil beginning to dwarf demand by about a million  a million and a half barrels a day   he said   Thirty five dollars is a possibility if they don t get an agreement next spring because that s when the oil really starts to build and you can have a billion barrels of oil with really no place to put it  

This comes at a time when there are already a whole host of signs that the global economy is slowing down   Three of the ten largest economies on the planet have already slipped into recession  and the economic nightmare over in Europe just continues to get even worse   In fact  we just learned that the unemployment rate in Italy has shot above 13 percent  
In addition  it is important to remember that the  real economy  in the United States is in far worse shape than it was just prior to the last financial crash   Just consider these numbers 
 In the United States today  the number of payday lending locations  than the number of McDonald s  NYSE MCD  and the number of Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  
 One recent survey found that  of all Americans have had to turn to a church food panty for assistance 
 This year   households in the United States celebrated Thanksgiving on food stamps 
 The rate of government dependence in America is at an all time high and approximately 60 percent of U S  households get more in transfer payments from the government  
 According to a report that was  by the National Center on Family Homelessness  the number of homeless children in the U S  has soared to a new all time record high of 2 5 million 
If things are this bad now  what are they going to look like after the next great financial crash 
And without a doubt  the next crash is coming   Hopefully we have at least a couple more months of relative stability  but many experts are now urgently warning that time is quickly running out 
By this time next year  Black Friday may look a whole lot different than it does today ",2014-11-30,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-u.s.-headed-for-a-financial-collapse-234089,234089

95732,317247,SBUX,The Price Indicator Rate Of Change,opinion,Comparative Analysis Indicators  Comparative and relational indicators are a vital part of every technical trader indicator tool kit  These indicators provide an unusual perspective on how Price and or Volume are behaving  by comparing the most current data to X period ago  Comparative indicators are not generally used for long term investment analysis   Although there are few comparative indicators they divide into two distinct groups  one group for price and the other for quantity of shares traded over time  By incorporating both in technical analysis of a stock  index  or other stock derivative  technical traders are able to see things that are not exposed by moving averages and other common overly popular indicators   Price Rate of Change ROC is a comparative Price and Time indicator that can provide a different analysis for Momentum  Swing  and Position trading   How Comparative Indicators differ from Moving Average Crossover Indicators  The preponderance of technical traders rely upon indicators based strictly on moving averages  where two different time periods are set with two separate moving averages laid over one another  This provides a shorter moving average over a longer moving average to create a  signal  that many traders use for entries and exits  What a comparative indicator reveals is how the stock Price or Volume is behaving in relation to how price was behaving N periods ago   The chart example of Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX  has Price ROC applied to the same indicator chart window as the Accum Dist indicator  These are both Primary Indicators and are plotted separately  rather than the normal use of a subordinate indicator which is plotted against the primary indicator  What this means is each indicator is functioning independently of the other  rather than like a moving average applied to a primary indicator which would then be reacting to the primary and reflecting that relationship   As two primary indicators this provides a powerful  yet simple tool that exposes velocity and momentum activity prior to Price moving with momentum  In today s automated marketplace over 80  of all orders are triggered by a computer with preset trade parameters  Therefore Momentum  Swing  and Position traders need to have powerful indicators that show momentum energy is building up within the Price action  prior to the momentum run occurring   The candlestick chart below of SBUX clearly shows the leading qualities of combining ROC and Accum Dist together as a combination primary comparative indicator for momentum  swing  and position trades  This combination comparative indicator provides earlier entries for fast moving momentum bottoms and tops  which are key areas where most technical traders struggle to enter soon enough to capture the best gains of the velocity or momentum Price action   The indicator in the bottom chart window is MACD which is the indicator High Frequency Traders HFTs are using to front run technical traders  and are doing so with ever increasing success  The chart windows show that the ROC and Accum Dist indicator combination comparative analysis  allows for a much earlier entry out of the momentum bottom    Trade wisely  Martha Stokes CMT     Summary   Technical Traders need to use every possible advantage to compete in the automated marketplace where Dark Pools  HFTs  and Professional traders are highly active  By incorporating additional leading indicators that have comparative qualities  bottoms and tops are exposed well ahead of momentum and velocity Price action  This allows traders more time to plan their trading rather than taking the knee jerk approach which is actually chasing the HFTs  Professional traders  and Dark Pools  Disclaimer  Learn more about Stock Indicators by clicking on the button below to the main TechniTrader website and the Stock Indicators Training Video  Then when you click to begin viewing the video  you will be taken to the TechniTrader Free Training Access Form to Create Your Account with no obligation and no cost ,2014-12-13,TechniTrader Stock Market Education,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-price-indicator-rate-of-change-235643,235643

95750,317265,SBUX,The Week Ahead  Are Market Divergences A Warning For Investors ,opinion,"In the wake of the FOMC meeting and the Alibaba IPO hype  we face a week with little new information   the lull before earnings season  This sort of vacuum makes it difficult to predict the week ahead  but I have an interesting idea 
This week will feature discussion about market divergences   gold  oil  small caps  and bitcoin are losers  Large cap stocks have been winners  Why  
A lot of buzz came from a  saying that 47  of NASDAQ stocks were  mired in a bear market   This was portrayed as showing a narrowing appetite for risk and loosely links it to prospective changes in Fed policy  It is an intriguing topic for further study 
Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted that the media focus would be the FOMC and the potential for changing course  That was very accurate  since the Fed meeting was the center of attention through Thursday  My question of whether the Fed would change course was answered with a firm   No  
Feel free to join in my exercise in thinking about the upcoming theme  We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead 
This Week s Theme
Whenever there is a light schedule for data and events  the market focus can easily change  We have some important housing data this week  but my sense is that many are still digesting the implications of the Fed meeting  It seemed to be a non event  with no change in the  considerable time  language or the pace of QE tapering  Despite media efforts to coax a story out of nothing  the  spikes  in stocks and bonds exhibited less volatility than we often see on the average trading day 
What was interesting  The continuing strength of the dollar  The currency market was the closest to showing a real spike  even when the Scotland effect removed one threat to the euro  The dollar strength is a combination of the perception of increasing US interest rates  the relative rate advantage for US investors  and the comparative strength of the US economy  If you are a European investor  and you do not see a currency risk  why not take the higher US interest rates  We can guess that some fund managers are doing this trade on a leveraged basis 
The expectation of higher interest rates comes not from the official policy statement or from Fed Chair Yellen  but from the  dot plots   This chart reveals the individual expectations of Fed members  Despite repeated warnings that this is not official policy  that the group decision is not the sum of individual opinions  that not everyone has a vote  etc   etc   the market takes the dot plot seriously  Here is the recent version  

Here are some interesting supporting themes  Expect to read and hear more about them in the week ahead 
Outflows from European stocks    
Smallcaps struggling   with the chart you expect  
Gold has  looked like death  according to    the same point in time  comparing gold to stocks   
Oil prices are falling    and so are oil stocks 

Izabella Kaminska   wouldn t trade it  but thinks it is a key support level  Kaminska has some interesting charts  but here is the key argument 

Well it s the same old story of frivolity  irrational exuberance  hysteria and of course the mistaken belief that something like a free lunch is truly possible   Not to mention the cult s last great hope being lost  that of Scotland adopting Bitcoin  

 As usual  I have a few thoughts to help with these questions  First  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was a lot of very good news  supporting the general thesis of economic strength 
Dow Transports have been strong   Bespoke observes   Many investors look for the Transports to lead the way  and the fact that it has done so well is a bullish sign for the major indices like the Dow and S P 500 in our view   See the  for the expected fine chart 
BLS benchmark revisions were extremely low  This little followed story is actually very important  Each year  the BLS checks their monthly estimates of net job change by comparing the employment data from surveys with actual reports at state employment agencies  It takes months to compile  but it avoids the popular criticisms of the monthly employment data  There is no issue about seasonal adjustments  surveys  revisions  or the birth death model  The job count is not exaggerated because no business will pay employment taxes on non existent employees  It is our best employment data  but it comes with a delay   the story  quoting from employment experts at The Liscio Report 

The annual benchmark is based on the unemployment insurance system s records  which cover close to 100  of establishment employment  and are the last word in employment  It will be made official early in 2015 


The revision  through March 2014  was an unusually small 7 000 jobs  which is less than  0 05   far below the     0 3  average of the last ten years 

And concluding 
This is  of course  a disappointment for those of us who await the annual benchmark with bated breath  but it might quiet some chatter about the birth death model  whose job is done once the benchmark is in place  It was remarkably accurate for the 12 months ended March 2014 
This is something to keep in mind each month as we get the employment data  Those who intone  birth death adjustment  while rolling their eyes  or complain about seasonal adjustments  or claim that data were fabricated    they were completely wrong last year 
Initial jobless claims hit a new low  Most people follow the seasonally adjusted four week moving average  shown in the chart below   also provides the NSA data and chart  the lowest reading for this week of the year since 2000 

The Scotland independence referendum failed  Please note that I am scoring this as  good  because it was market friendly  not because of the merits of the issue  There were many dire warnings about what would happen had it passed   bank failures  plunging European currencies  and worldwide ripples  Overnight futures rallied as the results came in 
Homebuilder confidence is at the highest level since 2005      Are they seeing something not apparent from the reported sales data  Builders report an increase in buyer interest and traffic  See also  

Retail sales were in line  but the revisions were positive   the relationship with his earned income proxy and the continuing growth of both series 

FOMC policy  No matter what you think of the Fed  the market quietly celebrated the decision and even held ground through the Yellen press conference 
Inflation data were benign  See  for comprehensive analysis and his typical fine charts 
 The Bad
There was also some important negative news  especially housing data 
Industrial production fell 0 1   A gain of 0 3  was expected   looks at the story from several viewpoints  including the unadjusted data  See the full post and the interesting collection of charts 
Student loan debt is hurting home sales   of the WSJ has a helpful account of a report from   The estimate is that each  250 in monthly loan payments reduce purchasing power by  44 000  Those with  750 payments or higher are often completely priced out of the market 

Earnings revisions drop significantly  Check out the green line in  below and you will see the dramatic decrease in Q3 estimates  Dr  Ed looks on the bright side  expecting a strong beat rate  Earnings  sees a chance for 2014 growth of 10  and highlights the potential in financial stocks 

High frequency indicators show deceleration  New Deal Democrat has his regular  for these data 
Housing starts were poor  So were building permits  my own preferred lead indicator   as follows  while noting that the months in 2014 still show improvement over the same month in 2013 

This was a disappointing report for housing starts in August 
Starts were only up 8 0  year over year in August 
There were 670 thousand total housing starts during the first eight months of 2014  not seasonally adjusted  NSA   up 8 6  from the 617 thousand during the same period of 2013   Single family starts are up 3   and multi family starts up 23    The key weakness has been in single family starts 


 The Ugly 
Our  ugly  list for the last few weeks remains unfortunately accurate  We had headline news from all conflicts with plenty of violence and death competing for our attention  The Ebola crisis  cited a few weeks ago  is deepening  Some are calling it a    for the World Health Organization 
Looking for some new themes to worry about   an overhaul in end of life health care  Here is another political third rail  We are delivering costly care that patients do not want while depriving them of counseling and comfort that they need  Until you have witnessed this personally  you do not really understand how dysfunctional our system is  Despite this  it defies correction 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts   Think of The Lone Ranger  No award this week  Nominations are welcome

How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders 
Felix has shifted from bullish to neutral based upon overall strength  Ratings for the broad market ETFs are mixed  Our Felix trading accounts remain fully invested for now because there are still at least three solid choices  With the generally modest ratings  Felix might signal a move to more cash during the coming week  The trading program can sometimes go short via the inverse ETFs  but that has not happened in more than a year 
Traders should all be reading everything from my friend  Dr  Brett Steenbarger  This week I especially liked his article about  the emotional response familiar to poker players  Hint  Be realistic in your expectations 
You can sign up for Felix s weekly ratings updates via email to etf at newarc dot com 
Insight for Investors 
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  The current  actionable investment advice  is   In addition  be sure to read this week s final thought 
We continue to use market volatility to pick up stocks on our shopping list  We do this because we also sell positions when they reach our  constantly updated  price targets  Being a long term investor is not the same as  buy and hold  
Here is our collection of great advice for this week 
Economic prospects are better than most people think   including Alan Greenspan  Last week I featured the former Fed Chairman s   It seems only fair to include a   Chief Investment Officer at New York Life  who notes that he has access to a perspective different from Greenspan s  He has 9 Reasons Why Alan Greenspan is Wrong about Everything  This is an interesting list  and I recommend taking a minute to consider the various points  listed in reverse order  The final point relates to big data  The following is a key section 

We are at a point where we can quantify the positive impact of Big Data  Kim said  noting that as we realize some  300  600 billion in annual cost savings and productivity gains from Big Data  the U S  economy is building fresh GDP equivalent to about  1 5 to  3  all from Big Data  The Economist noted that data is new big natural resource  analogous to what steam was in the 18th century  what electricity was in the 19th century and what hydrocarbons were in the 20th century 


And the U S  is driving it 

Beware of unregulated and leveraged commercial loans  Lisa Abramowicz at Bloomberg has an excellent story    showing the dangers  the big payoffs for banks  and the possibility for cascading effects throughout the financial system  The reach for yield has driven fund managers to include these holdings  which are not securities  The article does not explain exactly how to protect yourself  I am studying this further  It fits a general pattern of investments that supposedly offer safe yield 
Celebrity stock pickers  Be careful   with a story about leading jazz musician Kenny G  a favorite of Mrs  OldProf   He starts his day with Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX    the stock price  not the coffee  Barry reviews the results from Playmates  actresses  and models  as well as the infamous story of Lenny Dykstra  Remember when Gisele Bundchen insisted on payment in euros  This article is fun  but it also has an educational lesson 
Strong dollar stocks  Here are some ideas  and from  
Beware the pump and dump schemes  I know that I have emphasized this topic before  but I am trying to help individual investors  People continue to fall for these schemes  What is your defense  My colleague at   Cody Willard  will not permit the penny stock promotions that you see on other investment sites  Global Economic Intersection is all over these stories  with regular updates  Here is the key quote from the SEC on this one 

Zirk de Maison concocted an array of reverse mergers and company name changes on his way to gaining control of the vast majority of Gepco stock in order to conduct a multi faceted manipulation scheme  To help avoid the pitfalls of microcap fraud  it s important to check the histories of companies and determine their legitimacy before deciding whether to invest in them 

Speaking of   there is a new feature that you might want to try  If you register at the site and add  question to your scuttle  you can get answers from a number of experts with differing methods  It is easy  fun  and educational  There was a good debate Friday on Alibaba   I was bidding for one of our programs   the  high octane  portfolio   but it was too rich for us   Others bought and some were very skeptical 
Don t go  all out  of the market  The safest investment strategy is not one of all cash   that even risk averse investors should have a 20  stock allocation   even with time horizons of only three years 
If you are stuck in gold or out of the market completely  you might want to reconsider your approach  The current economic cycle is in the fifth inning  This is one of the problems where we can help  It is possible to get reasonable returns while controlling risk  You can get our report package with a simple email request to main at newarc dot com  Also check out our recent recommendations in our    a starting point for the long term investor    Comments and suggestions welcome   I am trying to be helpful and I love and use feedback  
Final Thought
I currently have a free trial subscription to an  independent  take on the news  Each night I am told that the official government data are wrong  the stock rallies are all contrived  and the wheels will come off at any moment  Reading it is an interesting exercise  but I have an advantage  I know what to look for and taught graduate level classes in research methods and statistical analysis  My guess is that most consumers are either deceived or falling victim to confirmation bias 
The divergence story is a bit like that  When small stocks were leading the rally  we were warned that the market was frothy   a sign of a top  Now that the big stock small stock relationship is coming into line  it is a sign of a  dangerous divergence  
I have two suggestions 
Ignore the various death crosses and omens   does a careful analysis of the Death Cross  showing that the effect lasts only a week or so and then quickly decays  His method is actually more likely to show an impact than you usually see  since his comparisons use the upward sloping baseline from stock performance  His post  which you should read carefully if you are an investor who depends on technical indicators  notes that much of technical analysis depends upon compelling visual impressions rather than statistical support 
Many of the current effects are dollar related and difficult to time  The obvious first line effects are energy and materials stocks  These are core holdings for value managers because they are all cheap by traditional metrics  Gold is also a casualty 
The strong dollar will eventually be good for the US economy  consumers  and stock investors  It is important to understand this instead of chasing short term dollar effects  Investors who want to understand the time frames better could start with  by Schwab s Liz Ann Sonders  It is right on target ",2014-09-21,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-week-ahead:-are-market-divergences-a-warning-for-investors-226531,226531

95755,317270,SBUX,Fairtrade coffee sales steady in economic downturn,news,"By Phakamisa Ndzamela
    LONDON  Oct 30  Reuters    Global sales of Fairtrade
coffee are holding up well despite an economic slowdown  coffee
dealers and farmers  unions said on Thursday 
 The Fairtrade system helps farmers and workers from poor
countries to develop their communities through fairer terms of
trade  The movement developed in the 1990s at a time of falling
commodity prices 
 Barbara Crowther  head of communications at London based
Fairtrade Foundation  the certification body behind the
Fairtrade label  said the global financial crisis would not stop
consumers from buying premium cost Fairtrade coffee 
  We believe that if people need to economise they are not
going to stop buying Fairtrade coffee   she told Reuters in a
telephone interview 
  From all the consumer research that we can see  the public
remains committed to their values when it comes to Fairtrade  
she said 
 Crowther said consumers with less disposable income due to
the credit crunch  could switch to a cheaper brand or buy their
Fairtrade coffee from a different store  rather than abandon the
Fairtrade label 
 Fairtrade coffee farmers  groups in Ethiopia and Uganda said
they were concerned about the impact of the financial crisis 
although they had not yet felt the impact deeply 
  As of now we have not yet experienced here a significant
impact in terms of reduction in the price of fairly traded
coffee   said Joseph Nkandu  executive director of the National
Union of Coffee Agribusinesses and Farm Enterprises in Uganda 
  It has not been so long since the financial crisis began 
Probably we will start noticing if it drags on  
 Dessalegn Jena  deputy general manager of the Oromia Coffee
Farmers  Co operative Union in Ethiopia  said the Fairtrade
coffee market was growing to meet consumer demand  but he voiced
concern about the outlook due to the economic meltdown 
  Because of the global financial crisis  it is uncertain
that demand will increase because Fairtrade is part and parcel
of global markets   Jena said 
 Spokesmen for Nestle  the world s biggest food group  and
ASDA  Britain s second biggest supermarket group  said the
global credit crisis had not yet affected sales of Fairtrade
coffee 
 Fairtrade coffee sales at ASDA were steady  and
non Fairtrade coffees and instant coffees were growing modestly 
an ASDA spokesman said 
  Consumers tend to buy into Fairtrade because they believe
in the ethics behind the products   he said 
  We are waiting to see whether the credit crunch begins to
impact Fairtrade coffee sales in the future 
 Seattle based coffee shop chain Starbucks Corp said this
week it was doubling its global buying of Fairtrade certified
coffee to 40 million pounds   64 13 million  in 2009 making it
the largest purchaser of Fairtrade certified coffee 
  The increased purchases will come from  Fairtrade 
co operatives in Latin America  Asia Pacific and Africa   a
Starbucks spokeswoman said

95756,317271,SBUX,INTERVIEW UPDATE 1 Starbucks sees no slowdown impact on China,news," Adds details  comments 
 By Kirby Chien
 BEIJING  Jan 13  Reuters    Starbucks Corp said on Tuesday
that it had not seen any impact on its China business even as it
closes stores in other markets  and expected its growth in the
mainland to accelerate down the road 
 China accounts for just over 350 stores out of Starbucks 
global portfolio of some 17 000  but is one of its fastest
growing markets  Martin Coles  president of Starbucks Coffee Co
International  told Reuters in an interview 
  We have not seen a drop off at all in the demand for
Starbucks in China   he said 
 Coles did not give any growth forecast for China  saying only
it would take less than 10 years to open the next 350 stores 
  We have seen an acceleration in our  China  business   he
said at an event marking the firm s first 10 years in China 
  International is the future engine for our company  
 The comments come as Starbucks has already closed 205 of the
600 stores due to be shut by the end of fiscal 2009  and also
lowered its forecast for fiscal 2009 net new international stores
to 700 from 900 
 Part of Starbucks  push into China includes increasing the
current small amount of coffee it sources from the mainland 
  This is about how we introduce China coffee to the world  
said the executive  seated on a sofa at one of the coffee shop
operator s newest stores in Beijing 
 Starbucks will sign cooperation agreements in the next couple
of days with local governments in southern Yunnan province aimed
at helping farmers increase coffee yields and improve quality 
  Our ambition is to have a far greater presence in Greater
China   he said 
 The China outlook contrasts sharply with the company s recent
earnings results 
 Starbucks  net profit for the fiscal fourth quarter ended
Sept  28 dropped 97 percent to  5 4 million  while comparable
sales fell 5 percent in the United States during fiscal 2008 
with results worsening throughout the year

95758,317273,SBUX,Starbucks  Seattle s Best recruiting US franchisees,news,"By Lisa Baertlein
 LOS ANGELES  Feb 3  Reuters    Starbucks Corp s 
Seattle s Best Coffee chain said on Tuesday it is recruiting
U S  franchisees in a move aimed at helping the two brands grab
a bigger share of the domestic specialty coffee segment 
 Starbucks  which is closing roughly 1 000 stores around the
world as it fights to revive U S  growth  bought Seattle s Best
in 2003 and the smaller brand now has more than 550 cafes
across the United States 
 Seattle s Best Coffee is known for its smoother  milder
blends and flavored coffees  which executives said sell at
prices that are in line with rivals ranging from Starbucks to
McDonald s Corp  
  The world of premium coffee has expanded  and customers
now expect a great cup of coffee wherever they are   said Tom
Ehlers  vice president and general manager of Seattle s Best 
 The different products and the different flavor profile we
bring really compliments what Starbucks has out there  
 Ehlers expects new franchisee owned cafes to expand the
specialty coffee market rather than to steal customers from
Starbucks  which last week said it would close another 300
stores around the world on top of the nearly 700 global
closures announced last year  Some 800 Starbucks stores slated
for closure are located in the United States 
  We re not doing this with the mind that this will bring
down the Starbucks business  rather we think we ll help grow
the entire industry   he said 
 Seattle s Best first will focus on attracting franchisees
from western states and from Texas  where the economy is a bit
more resilient and Seattle s Best already has some  great
prospects   said Marie Gill  director of franchise business
development at Seattle s Best 
  We ll certainly go east if the opportunity is correct  
Ehlers said 
 Approved franchisees must have bank financing in hand
before they can choose from a variety of cafe sizes and types 
which include everything from kiosks and carts to cafes with
full food and beverage menus 
 A dozen franchisees already operate 36 Seattle s Best
cafes  which are located in places like a mall in Portland 
Oregon  a Las Vegas casino and the Atlanta airport 
 Still  the vast majority of Seattle s Best cafes are
located in stores run by licensees such as bookseller Borders
Group Inc  and Supervalu Inc  grocery chain
Albertsons 
 Starbucks does not break out results for Seattle s Best and
executives declined to give growth targets

95759,317274,SBUX,UPDATE 1 INTERVIEW Starbucks CEO aims to expand Via line,news,"  Starbucks hopes to bring out decaffeinated Via in 2009
   May launch Via in more international markets in 2009
   Starbucks CEO mindful economy not getting better soon
  Adds CEO comments  stock activity 
 By Jessica Wohl
 CHICAGO  March 3  Reuters    Starbucks Corp plans to bring
out more versions of its new instant coffee and sell it in more
countries to consumers looking for value  Chairman and Chief
Executive Howard Schultz said on Tuesday 
 Schultz  speaking in Chicago where the Via instant coffee
packets hit Starbucks stores on Tuesday  said he hopes to bring
out decaffeinated Via this year  While Via is hitting shelves
during the recession  the timing was just fortuitous  Schultz
said  He said Starbucks has been working on Via since 1993 
  We felt the wind was at our back given the economic
pressure  so I think the timing is very good for us but it
wasn t planned   Schultz said 
 For now  Colombian and Italian Roast versions of Via are
being sold in Starbucks stores  on its website and in Target 
Costco and Barnes   Noble stores in Seattle and Illinois  where
Starbucks is testing the product 
 The packets will be sold across the United States starting
this fall 
 Some Starbucks stores in London will start selling Via on
March 25  Schultz said that  perhaps  Starbucks will sell Via
in other international markets later this year 
 Schultz  sipping a cup of Via  said the product is aimed at
brewed coffee drinkers looking for a portable option 
  It s stale coffee once the jar is open   Schultz said of
regular instant coffee   We re reinventing the category and we
will transform the industry as a result of this  
 Starbucks sees plenty of room for growth with Via  Of the
66 billion cups of coffee Americans drink each year  75 percent
of them are brewed at home  Schultz said  While Starbucks is
the largest coffee chain  it has less than a 4 percent share of
the market for coffee consumption in U S  homes 
  CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC 
 Schultz  who also spoke about the company s new  3 95
pairings of breakfast foods and drinks  said he has been
holding town hall meetings with customers and received an
 overwhelming  response about the company s value offerings 
  We re committed to providing value to our customers  
Schultz said   The economy isn t going to get better in the
near term and we want to be mindful of that  
 Schultz said he thought that President Barack Obama s
recovery plan  is the right first step to rebuilding  consumer
confidence 
  I think it s going to take time  But I m also cautiously
optimistic that we are going to get through this  
 He said Starbucks  with its strong balance sheet  will
weather the storm  The company is also cutting about  500
million in costs this year 
  We will be a stronger company for having gone through
this  And consumer confidence will improve as it has in the
past  
 Schultz said he also visited Colombia a week and a half ago
and met with President Alvaro Uribe and coffee industry
leaders  There has been a supply crunch of arabica beans in
Colombia but Schultz seemed pleased with Starbucks  ability to
get the beans it needs 
  I m quite confident that both the supply and the quality
of coffee beans is ensured for Starbucks and for Via

This quarter 39 contributing analysts on  have come to a consensus earnings expectation of 67c EPS and  4 148B in revenue compared to a consensus of 66c EPS and  4 158B from Wall Street  Throughout the past couple of years Starbucks has been posting year over year revenue growth of approximately 11  to 12  each quarter  This quarter contributing analysts on Estimize are looking for steady growth of 12    

Last quarter  Starbucks reported earnings in line with Wall Street s earnings consensus after previously beating it 3 periods in a row  On Thursday the Estimize community expects Starbucks to come in just 1c per share ahead of the Street s consensus and for earnings to increase by 22  compared to the same quarter of last year  Starbucks is also raising the prices of some drinks in stores between 5c and 20c and increasing the cost of packaged goods in food stores by 8   which should help to boost profit margins further going forward

Contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are forecasting that on Thursday Starbucks will report earnings a penny per share ahead of Wall Street s earnings forecast and miss the Street s revenue consensus by  10 million   1    This quarter the Estimize community is expecting Starbucks to keep grinding along with earnings and revenue growth rates that are in line with recent quarters despite the rising cost of coffee in the first half of 2014 which may slow down the competition ",2014-07-24,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-set-to-maintain-pace-of-growth-despite-rising-cost-of-coffee-220437,220437

Noticing the  4 12 sequential dollar increase in the S P 500 EPS the first week of April  here is the sequential increase in the forward 4 quarter estimate since early  2013 

Q2  14  to  122 77 or  4 12 increase   3 4  increase
Q1  14 to  120 77 or a  3 83 increase   3 2  increase
Q4  13 to  119 04 or a  3 58 increase   3  increase
Q3  13 to  116 67 or a  3 53 increase   3  increase
Q2  13 to  115 25 or a  3 41 increase   2 96  increase
Q1  13 to  113 88 or a  5 05 increase   4 4  increase

Being a data geek of the highest order  I need to delve into the data further  work back further and see what it tells me  but as the reader can quickly see  it looks like earnings growth is starting to accelerate  still modestly  but it certainly isn t falling apart 
Q4  13 earnings for the S P 500 grew 9 9  y y  the highest rate of growth since 2011  Revenues in Q4  13 grew 1  y y  with the Financial sector revenues falling 10  y y thanks to the Health Insurance and Industrial REITs 
In Q1  14  the y y growth estimate for S P 500 earnings is just 1 1   versus expected revenue growth of 2 7     We expect that when the majority of Q1  14 earnings are reported by mid May  2014  actual earnings growth will be closer to 3    5  
Here is how Q1  14 earnings estimates have changed since January 1 for the 10 S P 500 sectors   first column is the sector  the 2nd column is the expected sector earnings growth as of April 4  the third column is the expected growth as of January 1 

Consumer Discretionary   5 8    14 5   estimates have been hit hard  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  doesn t look good technically  Still think the selling is overdone for the sector and within retail  
Consumer Staples   3 3    9 3 
Energy   5 3    0 4 
Financials   2 7    5 9   We are still seeing litigation charges come through for big banks and financials  I do think  14 will be a tougher year for the sector 
Healthcare   3 7    5 8    We are staying with large cap pharma like Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and Merck  NYSE MRK 
Industry   0 2    5   Surprised at the estimate slashing 
Basic Materials   0 6    9 8   Commodity stocks have been some of best year to date performers 
Technology   2 4    7 
Telco   12 8    14 2 
Utilities   7 7    1 5   the only sector to see higher growth revisions through Q1  14 

The bloodletting in biotech in terms of the correction in the stocks is emblematic of the difference between the market and earnings  For full year 2014  Healthcare has actually seen earnings growth revised higher  but the sector  led by biotechs has gotten pounded 
Alcoa  NYSE AA   JP Morgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   report Tuesday after the bell  and Friday morning respectively 
We should see revisions for the Financial sector after these two big banks report when we look at the data next week 
I do think that Q1  14 earnings estimates are too low  and we should see the typical upward drift through the quarter as earnings are released 
We will have our eye on changes for full year 2014 as the 1st quarter numbers are released ",2014-04-06,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/s-p-500:-forward-4-quarter-earnings-estimate-increases-to-$122.77-208666,208666
95786,317301,SBUX,3 Opportunities For Exposure To The Growing Mobile Payment Industry,opinion,At the end of 2013  Business Insider  that the total value of global offline transactions facilitated by mobile devices would reach approximately  1 5T by 2017  up from  120B in 2012  In the U S  specifically  the transaction value will reach  244B in 2017  up from  15B during 2012  The potential for growth has sparked a number of high profile acquisitions  and analysts  the mobile payment industry to be one of the leading M A spaces during the next 12 months  Here are a few of the currently available options for exposure to the industry  eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  The first exposure on the list in eBay  Inc  In September last year  eBay s PayPal announced its contribution to the mobile payment space  Beacon  Beacon leverages the readily available PayPal app to enable mobile payments in stores that accept PayPal payments  Mobile device users can  check in  to a retail location using the PayPal application  At the point of sale  POS   a USB device enables existing POS hardware to detect customers that have checked in to the location  The POS hardware displays a photograph and details of the customer to the merchant  and when a customer indicates they wish to pay for an item  the merchant selects the applicable details and the system automatically debits the customer s PayPal account  The advantage of the PayPal system does not stop at hassle free transactions  Contrary to a number of other alternatives  beacon uses Bluetooth Low Energy  BLE   BLE allows Beacon to communicate with mobile devices  and vice versa  using a fraction of the energy of near field communication and GPRS technology  This helps the technology to overcome one of the hurdles to industry growth  battery power  In addition  PayPal does not have to overcome another of the major hurdles to mass adoption  security concerns  More   110M individuals have already trusted the company with their personal and financial details  which should make rolling out the technology much smoother than it otherwise would have been  Beacon is not yet available  but PayPal expect to roll out the system throughout summer 2014  EBay offers investors a relatively low risk exposure to the industry  with the company s other business operations serving as a buffer if mass adoption of the concept fails or another company s technology takes market leadership  Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX   Starbucks has developed its own in house payment system  accessible through its mobile application  Customers who wish to pay using their mobile phones preload their Starbucks application account from their credit card  At POS the application generates a QR code  and the retailer scans the code to initiate a transfer of funds from the customer s account to the location s account  During a Q2 2013 earnings call  Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz reported the application has more than 10M active users  and is approaching 4M payment transactions per week    accounting for more than 10  of total U S  tender  In addition  because the system is rooted in prepay  mobile payment allows the company to capture more than 30  of its revenues before customers enter a location  Starbucks offers investors a different type of exposure to the industry than eBay  The PayPal system relies on widespread adoption of the concept by both retailers and consumers  This could take a number of years  The Starbucks system however  is already active  and the company need only achieve adoption among its customers  New Media Insight Group  Inc   NMEDD  The final addition to the list is New Media Insight Group  Once again  this addition differs from the previous two  in that the company approaches the mobile device payment system with a focus on adoption incentive  both from the perspective of the retailer and the consumer  New Media Insight Group has developed a system called mCards  Similar to the Starbucks approach  mCards is a mobile device application based system that consumers can use to pay for goods and services at POS  This is where the similarity ends  however  Consumers download and link their credit card to the mCards application  When they reach POS at a participating location  the application generates an  mCard   which has a preset maximum value and displays the standard details of a traditional credit card  16 digit number  expiry data and three digit CSC code   The retailer uses these details with their existing card processing hardware  and the application debits the customers linked credit card to complete the transaction  As mentioned  New Media Insight Group has taken steps to incentivize use of its mCards system  and promote adoption  From the consumer perspective  the system involves a loyalty aspect  When they use the system to pay for goods and services at a participating location  the retailer offers rewards and discounts on futures transactions  From retailer perspective  in addition to the ability to create branded loyalty programs  New Media Insight Group offers a  Merchant Dashboard   which allows the retailer to track the spending habits of its customers  and analyze data specific to their business  Additionally  the company offers a third party marketing feature whereby the retailer can pay marketers to drive customers to their location  The retailer compensates marketers on a per transaction basis through a tailored compensation plan  The mCards system also addresses the security concerns that surround a number of the alternative mobile payment options  The mCard functions similarly to a prepaid credit card  meaning even if someone did steal the mCard number and its corresponding details  they wouldn t be able to transact with it because mCards are a single use form of payment  Additionally  because merchants can either key the card number into their existing credit card terminals or use an NFC or QR code scan  there is no risk of data being stolen from swiping the card  New Media Insight Group offers direct exposure to the potentially huge mobile payments industry  Traditionally a marketer  the company switched its focus to mobile payment systems during 2013  in anticipation of widespread adoption  If validated  the switch offers early investors a chance to benefit from a large potential upside in the company s stock  There is risk involved however  The same focus that links New Media Insight Group s stock to the growth of industry also links it to industry stagnation  If the mobile payment concept fails to grow as expected  any holding in New Media Insight Group could deteriorate in value  Conclusion If expert opinion proves correct  mobile device payments will revolutionize the way consumers and retailers interact  Many companies have realized the industry s potential  and are already taking steps to establish themselves as an early mover  This widespread interest offers investors a plethora of options when it comes to gaining exposure  each with a different take on the technology  and the processes involved  The three options covered in this piece illustrate this variety  and any one could become market leaders in the space before 2017 ,2014-04-07,Samuel

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the shortened Passover and pre Easter week sees the equity markets looking to continue lower  Elsewhere look for Gold and Crude Oil to continue their moves higher  The US Dollar Index looks weak and headed lower  but with support nearby while US Treasuries may be ready to break the long consolidation to the upside  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets look strong with a chance that Emerging Markets consolidate for a bit  Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   iShares Russell 2000 Index  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   but it is biased to the upside and under watch  The equity index ETF s themselves show no signs of a reversal higher  only a continuation lower  They all still have room to major trend reversal levels but it appears the short term direction is firmly lower  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

95819,317334,SBUX,Why Is The Smart Money Suddenly Getting Out Of Stocks And Real Estate ,opinion,If wonderful times are ahead for U S  financial markets  then why is so much of the smart money heading for the exits  Does it make sense for insiders to be getting out of stocks and real estate if prices are just going to continue to go up  The Dow is up about  so far this year  and it just keeps setting new record high after new record high  U S  home prices have risen about 11 percent from a year ago  and some analysts are projecting that we are on the verge of a brand new housing boom  Why would the smart money want to leave the party when it is just getting started  Well  of course the truth is that the  smart money  is regarded as being smart because they usually make better decisions than other people do  And right now the smart money is screaming that it is time to get out of the markets  For example  the SentimenTrader Smart Dumb Money Index is now the lowest that it has been   The smart money is busy selling even as the dumb money is busy buying  So precisely what does the smart money expect to happen  Are they anticipating a market  correction  or something bigger than that  Those are very good questions  Unfortunately  the smart money rarely divulges their secrets  so we can only watch what they do  And right now a lot of insiders are making some very interesting moves  For example  George Soros has been dumping almost all of his financial stocks  The following is from a recent article by Becket Adams Everyone s favorite billionaire investor is back in the spotlight  and this time he has a few people wondering what he s up to  George Soros has dumped his position with several major banks including JPMorgan Chase  Capitol One  SunTrust  and Morgan Stanley  He has reduced his exposure to Citigroup and decreased his stake in AIG by two thirds  In fact  Soros  financial stock holdings are down by roughly 80 percent  a massive drop from his position just three months ago  according to SNL Financial  So exactly what is going on  Why is Soros doing this  Well  there is certainly a lot to criticize when it comes to Soros  but you can t really blame him if he is just taking his profits and running  Financial stocks have been on a tremendous run and that run is going to end at some point  Smart investors lock in their profits while they still can  And without a doubt  stocks have become completely divorced from economic reality in recent months  For example  there is usually a very close relationship between corporate earnings and stock prices  But as  recently reported  that relationship has totally broken down lately    That trend disrupted a formerly symbiotic relationship between earnings and stock prices and is indicating that the bluechip average is in for a substantial pullback  according to Tom Kee  who runs the StockTradersDaily investor web site   They ve been moving in tandem since 2009  until recently  Earnings per share for the Dow Jones industrial average have flatlined and the price has taken off   Kee said   There is something happening here that defines a bubble   At some point there will be a correction  If the relationship between earnings and stock prices was where it should be  the Dow would be  right now  That would be a fall of nearly 2 000 points from where it is at the moment  And we appear to be entering a time when revenues at many corporate giants are actually declining  As I noted in a previous article  corporate revenues are falling at Wal Mart  WMT   Proctor and Gamble  PNGSL BO   Starbucks  SBUX   AT T  T   Safeway  SWY   American Express  AXP  and IBM  IBM   Of course a stock market  correction  can turn into a crash very easily  Financial markets in Japan are already crashing  and many fear that the escalating problems in the third largest economy on the planet will soon spill over into Europe and North America  And things in Europe just continue to get steadily worse  In fact   is reporting that the European Central Bank is warning that the risk of a  renewed banking crisis  in Europe is rising    The European Central Bank warned on Wednesday that the euro zone s slumping economy and a surge in problem loans were raising the risk of a renewed banking crisis  even as overall stress in the region s financial markets had receded  In a sober assessment of the state of the zone s financial system  the E C B  said that a prolonged recession had made it harder for many borrowers to repay their loans  burdening banks that had still not finished repairing the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis  And there are many financial analysts out there that are warning that their cyclical indicators have peaked and that we are on the verge of a   We see building evidence of a cyclical downturn   said Fredrik Nerbrand  HSBC s global asset guru   We find it highly troubling that the eurozone is still marred in a recession at the same time as our cyclical indicators appear to have peaked   In the United States  a lot of the smart money has also decided that it is time to bail out of the housing market before this latest housing bubble bursts  The following is one example of this phenomenon that was discussed in a recent  Hedge fund manager Bruce Rose was among the first investors to coax institutional money into the mom and pop business of single family home rentals  raising  450 million last year from Oaktree Capital Group LLC  Now  with house prices climbing at the fastest pace in seven years and investors swamping the rental market  Rose says it no longer makes sense to be a buyer   We just don t see the returns there that are adequate to incentivize us to continue to invest   Rose  55  chief executive officer of Carrington Holding Co  LLC  said in an interview at his Aliso Viejo  California office   There s a lot of    bluntly    stupid money that jumped into the trade without any infrastructure  without any real capabilities and a kind of build it as you go mentality that we think is somewhat irresponsible   So what does all of this mean  Is there a reason why the smart money is suddenly getting out of stocks and real estate  It could just be that the insiders are simply responding to market dynamics and that many of them are just seeking to lock in their profits  Or it could be

95820,317335,SBUX,International Expansion  Creating Global Brands  Increasing Value,opinion,There are only two methods to drive revenues  a company can increase its price to the consumer  but this doesn t always come across as being prudent  especially given the current low interest rate and inflation period   and then there s the more viable way  which is to expand into foreign markets  Companies can expand nationwide or internationally like many of the world s multinational companies  Just take a look around and see how many American companies are found outside of our borders and spread across Europe  Asia  and Latin America  Whole Foods Market  Inc   WFM  has the majority of its stores in the United States  but also has a small presence in Canada and the United Kingdom  The company just made its first foray into Detroit  Michigan  Now at first glance it doesn t seem odd but  as my stock analysis suggests  given that the  Motor City  has a massive unemployment rate of 17 5   source  U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  last accessed June 18  2013  and Michigan has more people looking for work than the national average  you have to wonder why the company has decided to expand there  While there may be more economically viable places for expansion  the reality is that the company is searching far and wide for places to expand  as it doesn t want to face growth issues down the road  as my stock analysis indicates  The need to expand internationally has made many American companies into global brands and has rewarded shareholders along the way  as my stock analysis suggests  Expansion is what companies need to do in order to grow and become much bigger companies  Maintaining a market within America s borders alone means limiting your market to 300 million people and ignoring the other 500 million people in the eurozone and 2 4 billion people spread across China and India  based on my stock analysis  My stock analysis indicates that U S  companies tend to expand internationally into our neighbor to the north  Canada  as a first move  McDonalds Corporation  MCD  is now a global powerhouse and one of the most recognizable brands in the world  according to my stock analysis  The company first moved into Canada in 1967   Read  The Secret to Success in the Fast Food Sector    In the home supplies sector  The Home Depot  Inc   HD  expanded into Canada in 1994  which was followed by Lowes Companies  Inc   LOW  in 2007  Retail giant Wal Mart Stores  Inc   WMT  expanded into Canada in 1994 via its acquisition of Woolco Canada  The company has become a retail icon in Canada and is expanding aggressively into China and Brazil to drive revenues  based on my stock analysis  And it s odd that it took nearly two decades before Wal Mart s rival Target Corporation  TGT  launched its first stores in Canada this past April  Target still doesn t have any exposure outside of North America  which makes the company an inferior stock to Wal Mart and its aggressive foreign exposure  based on my stock analysis  I favor companies that look outside of their base country s borders for growth  As my stock analysis suggests  other stocks that fit this profile include The Gap  Inc   GPS   Starbucks Corporation  SBUX   Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc   YSE CMG   and YUM  Brands  Inc   YUM  Disclaimer  Dear Reader  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose ,2013-06-20,George Leong,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/international-expansion:-creating-global-brands,-increasing-value-172163",172163
95838,317353,SBUX,Starbucks  Pour Your Heart Into By Schultz,opinion,I don t drink coffee  As such  I ve never quite understood the draw Starbucks  SBUX  has on people  Until I read this book  that is  The founder of Starbucks tells the story of how Starbucks came to be in   which I recently had the pleasure of reading  You re not likely to get an unbiased view of a company when you read about it from the company s founder  and this book is no different in that regard  The propaganda did get a bit heavy at times  as Schultz went into a ton of detail about how Starbucks gives back to communities and has helped improve the lives of its most successful employees  which is the case in every company  of course   But if you don t let the propaganda distract you  there is quite a bit to learn from Schultz  journey in taking Starbucks from a small bean only retailer to an international  multi channel coffee distributor  The coffee shop industry was considered mature even when Starbucks was a tiny operation that didn t even serve cups of coffee  This made it difficult for Schultz to raise expansion money  as much like today  VC firms would much rather invest in the hottest new sectors rather than firms in stodgy industries  But Starbucks revolutionized this industry with a focus on quality that was hard to find elsewhere  Before Starbucks  coffee at retailers was often not fresh  used low quality beans  that are more abundant and cheaper   used light roasted beans  as regular quality beans are ruined under intense roasting conditions  and had inconsistent brewing procedures  leading to volatile and relatively poor results  Starbucks  focus on quality  more expensive beans  more thorough roasting  procedures for consistent brews  fresher grinds and fresher brews  garnered it a loyal customer following that allowed it to grow successfully at an incredible rate  Schultz describes the core principles on which the company focused that he believes led it to lead the industry through this transformation  Schultz  personal journey is just as interesting  Schultz grew up poor  and disregarded the advice of much of his family to leave a relatively cushy job in order to join this tiny company with an uncertain future  For three years  as Starbucks implemented its plan to expand into one which matched Schultz  vision  the company lost money while positive results were far from certain  A few times  Starbucks was close to running out of money  forcing Schultz to pound the pavement to look for new investors  Schultz gives some credit to the role of luck in the success of Starbucks  but not a whole lot  At many points in the book  though  it did look as though luck played a rather dominant role  For example  if the aforementioned last minute financing had not come through  a tiny  young Starbucks  future would have been very much in question  Some of Starbucks  early expansion mistakes also caused losses that could have cost Schultz his job at a crucial time for the company  which could have jeopardized both his future and that of the company  At the same time  however  there is no question that Schultz has obviously put systems in place that put Starbucks in a position to succeed even in the face of a great deal of competition  If the stories of how great companies are made interest you  in my opinion there is no better place to read about them than from the founders themselves  If you can put aside the hindsight bias and the propaganda  this story of Starbucks offers great insight into how a company was taken from thousands to billions ,2012-12-30,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks:-pour-your-heart-into-by-schultz-149095,149095

95840,317355,SBUX,Market Indicators  Consumer Staple Vs  Discretionary Stocks ,opinion,As I write this on Tuesday night there still seems to be a lot of back and forth playing out with Congress and the fiscal cliff  As the fiscal cliff ordeal comes to an end  we still have the ridiculous debt ceiling to worry about and contend with  Why Congress still has to vote on the debt ceiling after they already have approved the spending that takes us to the aforementioned ceiling is in my opinion an utter waste of time  But that s neither here or there  let s get back to the markets I m constantly looking at market relationships  intermarket analysis fascinates me and I think it can give a key insight into determining the  health  of a decline or advance by monitoring market leadership  One of the relationships I follow is between consumer staples and consumer discretionary ETFs  Often during declines in equities  we see a relative outperformance in consumer staple stocks in relation to discretionary names  This can show us if traders are positioned for a  risk on  or  risk off  market environment During uptrends and periods of an expanding economy we normally see discretionary stocks outperform staples as consumers have more flexibility in their spending  The opposite is often true when the economy begins to falter  investors shift back into consumer staples as shoppers spend more of their paychecks at the grocery store and less at Amazon com  AMZN  or Starbucks  SBUX  The below chart looks at the ratio between the SPDR Consumer Discretionary ETF  XLY  and the SPDR Consumer Staple ETF  XLP   When the green line is rising it means XLY is going up more or down less than XLP  and can be viewed as a sign that traders are potentially taking on more risk within their portfolios   a positive sign for equities  So while the S P 500 has come off its recent high of 1446  consumer discretionary stocks have continued to outperform their staple counterparts  The ratio is heading towards its previous high of 1 36  bucking the trend of the major indices  We ll see if it breaks past this level or if XLP can begin to gain ground and start outpacing XLY  giving us a potential sign that traders are starting to take risk off the table  Disclaimer  Do not construe anything written in this post or this blog in its entirety as a recommendation  research  or an offer to buy or sell any securities  Everything in this post is meant for educational and entertainment purposes only  I or my affiliates may hold positions in securities mentioned in the blog  Please see my  page for full disclaimer ,2013-01-02,Andrew Thrasher,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-indicators:-consumer-staple-vs.-discretionary-stocks-149312,149312

95842,317357,SBUX,Coffee JO And KC Look Ready To Rise,opinion,Coffee is a sector I have been watching for while and think this is a good long for 2013 and longer term  Coffee has declined over 50  from its highs in 2011  which has helped companies like Starbucks  SBUX   Smuckers and GMCR as their margins where much higher  But these lower prices really affect the growers  the lower the prices get the harder it is for them to make money  Now it appears this decline could be over and growers could start benefiting while roasters and sellers might start feeling a squeeze   Historical Charts  Over last couple of weeks coffee had been basing around 141 55 level where it seem to finally stop and slow down the current downtrend  Looking at the weekly chart this level is strong support  The 141 155 support level comes from the breakout level from 2010 when coffee prices rose to highs at 310 are a 120  increase  In fact  the 141 level has been the normal bottom price for coffee over the last few decades  Even if coffee is to move lower  the lower prices just add to continued support  Historically coffee has bottomed around 123  so there is the potential for coffee to move lower  The drop in 1998 2002 was caused by a coffee crisis  which will do not appear to be having now and safeguards and industry standards are in place to prevent the crisis again   Short Term Bullish Breakout  The key bullish break for coffee was the breakout on Friday which broke above resistance at 150 and more importantly the immediate term downtrend line  The break above the 150 levels is a new potential support level and new stepping stone to move upwards  The 70 day ema stopped the lastest move upwards and have been the measuring stick to see if a rally can happen  A break above this would add to the bullishness of the stock  Coffee s decline has also caused a large amount of short speculation which leaves it open to a short squeeze and potentially higher prices   Support and Resistance  If coffee continues to rise a long term potential target is 181 53 which is only a 23  retracement from the fall in 2011  But since coffee is in its beginning stages of a run upwards  we need to take a short term view first  The 150 level should hold as support  if not expect the 141 to be tested again  The next resistance level is at 157 22  above this level is where Coffee can really run  since there lacks resistance till 173 34  Above this level resistance is at the 23  retracement and the highs from 2012 which will be resistance  Coffee could continue lower if it fails to move upwards and breaks back below 141  The drop would not be to far just 8 10  to 130 123 which would provide even more historical support  How to Play this   JO  is the coffee ETF that can be used to play this bounce and get exposed to a coffee trade  For JO support is at 34 and the key long term support is at 31 38  JO potential 23  retracement is at 43 53  JO needs to get above 36 35 to really get a run up to the 43 level  Overall  Coffee appears to be ready to run upwards after its year and a half decline  This will be good for the coffee growers but it could potentially hurt the roasters and sellers of coffee  It won t affect them right away since Starbucks makes its own prices and buys well out in advance  But if we get a rise of 20  and a price that stays 20  higher  the great margins the coffee industry is enjoying now will be affected and you the coffee drinker may be forced to pay for this ,2013-01-14,PikerTrader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/coffee-jo-and-kc-look-ready-to-rise-150687,150687
95860,317375,SBUX,A Strangling At Starbucks,opinion,Starbucks   SBUX  has technically been a very interesting stock of late  The chart below shows that from a high in April it fell to a low in August before rebounding  The bounce ran right into the corner of the 50  Fibonacci retracement and the Fibonacci Arc before rising the Arc lower  On consolidating through the Arc it then jumped to the next Arc and over the 38 2  Fibonacci level after releasing earnings  Still with me  Now is where it gets interesting  Bouncing between the 50  and 38 2  Fibonacci  or roughly between 50 and 52 50 it is setting up for a move  The Relative Strength Index is bullish and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator  MACD  is positive  supporting an upside break  But both are fading and there is now a large gap to fill below  What to do  Play it both ways  The swing stock trader would wait for a break above 52 50 to enter long or below 50 to enter short  But by using the options market we do not have to wait  Looking at the options chain  implied volatility is relatively low and flat at near 25  for all strikes  compared to the historical volatility of 33   This is a good time to buy options  Since we want to play it both ways we will look at a Strangle  buying both a put and a call  In this case the December 50 52 5 Strangle  buying the December 52 50 Call and the December 50 Put costs  2 29 as of late Monday  The stock would need to move beyond the range 47 71 to 54 79 by December Expiry to profit  A gap fill lower would certainly do this  as would a break of resistance from the highs in May and June  You can improve your odds by turning it into an Iron Condor  This is just a fancy name for turning the trade into two Spreads  A Call Spread and a Put Spread  By selling both the December 55 Call and the December 47 Put  the cost of the structure drops to  1 46 and the trade becomes profitable when the price moves outside of the range 48 54 to 53 96  But it also caps the upside at a price of 55 if it rises and 47 if it falls  Still a potential 71  return at 55 and 105  return at 47 is not too shabby  Disclaimer  The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment  I or my affiliates may hold positions or other interests in securities mentioned in the Blog  please see my  page for my full disclaimer ,2012-11-13,Gregory W.

95891,317406,SBUX,Earnings In Process Of Bottoming,opinion,Sometimes  it is hard to come up with something intelligent to say regarding the market  which is how we felt Sunday night while writing the weekly earnings report  and is the primary reason we left the headline empty We continue to think earnings are in the process of bottoming  and will trough in the 3rd calendar quarter of 2012  but we don t start seeing that earnings data until October 10th or so Although we may have no way of taking an intelligent poll of the entire market  my guess is this latest rally has caught a lot of folks off guard  if not outright short  given that we have decoupled from last year s pattern as of the Friday before the July payroll report and continue to deviate from 2011  That being said  I do think the market is overbought here  and could use a retracement of 5   However  we are now  comping  against the weakest part of the stock market decline from 2011  which was the USA watchlisting of the AAA credit rating and the Euro mess As always  our first look after futures each day and at the market open is how Treasuries are acting  particularly the 10 year Treasury and how the high yield ETF s are faring  and thus far the 10 year Treasury yield continues to trek higher after its  outside reversal  week prior to the July payroll report  and the two high yield ETF s   HYG and JNK   continue to be well bid  but not yet at multi year highs This is what we like to see  US rates rising  faster economic growth  and European sovereign debt rates falling  more confidence in the euro and European banking system  Moody s concluded this week in their North American edition of Leveraged Finance that  fundamental credit conditions for Leveraged Finance remain attractive in North America   Furthermore  low readings on Liquidity and Covenant Stress indices support a benign default rate forecast  per Moody s  Everybody  knows credit is a good place to be today  given global central bank liquidity  not to mention the downside protection credit affords sharply rising rates  i e  duration risk   Corporate bond fund inflows still exceeding  by far  corporate stock funds  That cant be good  So many retail investors and 401 k  investors are going to be caught off guard when rate do rise   this will be far  far worse than 1994  for those who remember that experience  The high tick for the HYG was  92 85 in the Spring  2011  The high tick for JNK was  41 32 in Nov  2010 So far  despite the high yield or junk bond strength  we havent taken out those multi year highs So why the strong stock market rally   Well maybe it was thanks to Bill Gross and his  death of equities  call last week  or Harry Dent coming on CNBC yesterday  predicting Dow 3000  yes as in 10 000 Dow points lower   Bill Gross has made more money in a month than I probably have in my entire career  but I dont understand his equity call  I thought the last paragraph where he said that equities do not perform well in periods of inflation  kind of tipped his hand in terms of the column  We have had 12 years of deflation  and at this point I would think the Fed wants some inflation  and stocks will perform better under an inflationary environment  than a deflationary environment  It is hard to say why he timed his call as he did  It will be interesting what the next few years holds for stock returns Listening to the debate over the future and relevance of Microsoft  Hewlett Packard and Dell today on CNBC  left me reminiscent of what it must have been like to be Apple in the late 1990 s  No one cared about the stock or the company back in the late 1990 s as Steve Jobs was re engineering one of the greatest turn around efforts in the history of business  or maybe since IBM   Microsoft  Intel  Dell and Hewlett Packard are all value stocks today  dirt cheap on a valuation basis  great dividend yields  unloved  and unwanted  Will they survive   Sure  Intel and Microsoft will  at least for now  Most people don t realize that the growth in PC s correlated with job growth in the 1980s and 1990 s very closely  Can Apple take over the  enterprise  as Wintel did in the 1990 s   It is why I think the Microsoft tablet might have a future   Long Intel  Microsoft  Apple  Our big ger  buy last week was Starbucks  SBUX  which we bought for a bunch of accounts  The stock has declined about 20    25  since its  62 high in late April  2012  There should be very good technical support in the  42    43 area for the stock  Whole Foods  WFM  had a monster quarter   the big difference we see between the two great brands is that WFM is primarily USA based  while SBUX is international  Still SBUX s China comp s were still pretty strong  better than we thought they d be  SBUX should bottom in here shortly  but give it some time  We ll likely see a rally then another pullback  Expected earnings growth for SBUX is still pretty decent  We ll have a longer article on the topic shortly   Long SBUX  WFM We continue to think telecom and utilities are a crowded trade  for reasons we detailed in the August 5th corporate earnings update  Very little organic growth  and whole slew of retail investors chasing dividends  Not sure when it ends  but it wont end well   Sold VZ in March  12 at  38   not too bright  but I d do it again  ,2012-08-08,Brian

95926,317441,SBUX,Starbucks Plunge Is Beginning Of Bad Trend,opinion,When stocks are priced for perfection as Starbucks  SBUX  is  they are very risky  Just look at today s 10   drop in SBUX shares in a market that is up 1   My regular readers know that I have  for a while  warned investors that SBUX was overpriced and due for a correction  See     In my  on January 26  I explain why SBUX fell even though they beat estimates and raised guidance  The point is that the stock s valuation is too expensive  At  46 share  the stock price implies the company will grow profits    at nearly 15  compounded annually for 10 years  That is a high growth rate for a long time   even after a 10   drop in the stock today  My thesis on selling SBUX is detailed in my 10 4 11 article     The key points are Why risk money in such an expensive stock when there are many cheaper  and better  stocks available  such as McDonalds  MCD  and Exxon  XOM   both have valuations that imply their profits will permanently decline by 10    That s a lot lower risk than the 15  growth for 10 years in SBUX SBUX has lots of competition  from other stores  GMCR  CBOU  PEET  etc  from customers that home brew  etc  The stock s valuation implies they practically own the entire market  when they do not and will not Commodity prices have little effect on the stock price  Do not buy the stock because you think the price of coffee will drop K Cups margins will fall  It is a good strategy and is generating high ROICs  but the packaged food industry is super competitive and it is unrealistic to expect the fat margins SBUX gets now will persist for long International growth is not a panacea for profits   a  Lots of competition there too and  b  consumers abroad are in worse shape than in the U S  and  c  the company s brand power is diluted overseas Momentum investing is a dangerous strategy  It pays to be more selective about the stocks you buy The last time SBUX pursued a high growth strategy  it ended poorly Here s some context on just how expensive SBUX is  15  compounded annual growth in NOPAT for another 10 years means Starbucks  after tax cash flow will  in 2022  be higher than the 2011 NOPAT for Goldman Sachs  GS   Morgan Stanley  MS    two businesses that have built rather large franchises and substantial competitive advantages  Are you willing to bet that home brewing coffee will be as profitable as investment banking  SBUX s NOPAT would also be higher than 2011 NOPAT for Kraft  KFT   which has a slightly larger product offering than Starbucks  It would also be higher than 2011 NOPAT for 3M  MMM   Home Depot  HD   Eli Lilly  LLY  and Altria  MO   Here are my   You get the point  SBUX is already priced to become one of the most profitable companies in the US  For an  investor  to own the stock at these levels  he she must believe that the company s cash flows will exceed the current expectations by a significant margin  Maybe you believe Starbuck can do that  but I do not  With all the cheap stocks in the market  e g     why would any investor want to place a bet that SBUX s future profit growth would be better than what is already baked into the current stock price ,2012-07-29,David Trainer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-plunge-is-beginning-of-bad-trend-131210,131210
95927,317442,SBUX,Starbucks Becomes A Short As 2012 s Gains Disappear,opinion,Ahead of Starbucks  July earnings report  I warned that the stock was at a critical juncture  I concluded that Starbucks  SBUX  becomes a compelling short if it broke down through support  On Friday  SBUX broke down and at one point had erased all its gains for the year  The  9 4  post earnings performance was likely driven by disappointment in      While still representing earnings growth of approximately 20  over last year s fourth quarter  we have lowered our expectations for Q4 FY12 earnings per share to  0 44 to  0 45 to reflect the difficult economic environment all global retailers are confronting today Nonetheless  we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business  in the strategies we have in place for driving sustained  profitable growth  and in our ability to again drive earnings growth in the range of 15    20  in fiscal 2013 SBUX is a momentum stock that peaked a full year before the stock market peaked ahead of the last recession  SBUX recovered an amazing 786  to all time highs from seven year lows at the depths of 2008  This means that any miss in guidance will trigger outsized responses like Friday s  Particularly jarring about this miss is that in  SBUX was VERY bullish  accelerating store openings and INCREASING earnings guidance     On the strength of our business and recent trends  we are accelerating new store growth in fiscal 2012 to approximately 1 000 net new stores globally  and raising our earnings targets for the year  With coffee cost pressures easing in the second half of the year and momentum building from investments in our growth initiatives  we are well positioned to deliver on our aggressive targets With a forward P E of 22  SBUX is neither cheap nor expensive  so I imagine follow through selling will not be vicious  but it should unfold slowly but surely  The best way to initiate a short would be to wait until the stock bounced upward into presumed resistance at the 200DMA and or 2012 breakout line  Choosing long dated puts also make sense  Be careful out there  Full disclosure  no positions ,2012-07-29,Dr. Duru,https://www.investing.com/analysis/starbucks-becomes-a-short-as-2012′s-gains-disappear-131252,131252
95949,317464,SBUX,Was the Drop in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters  Stock Price A Wake Up Call  ,opinion,Up until very recently  specialty coffee stocks were among the best performing stocks in the market since the great recession of 2008  The following performance table comparing four of the leading specialty coffee companies against the S P 500  the average company  illustrate just how extraordinary their performance has been  Even more amazingly  these performance results reflect precipitous percentage drops in the stock prices of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters  GMCR  and Coffee Holding Co  Inc   JVA  where each saw their stock prices essentially cut in half Historical Performance Since the Great Recession of 2008Estimated Performance Next Five YearsWhen turning our attention to the future  as prudent long term investors must always do  we discover that Coffee Holding Co   JVA  and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters  GMCR  are  based on fundamentals  expected to offer the best future five year performance  just as they did over the past four years  We believe there are two primary reasons for this   First of all  these two companies are expected to achieve the fastest future earnings growth rates of the group   Second  both of these companies were overvalued prior to their stock prices crashing  but now can be bought with PE ratios that are lower than their expected future earnings growth In contrast  both Starbucks Corp   SBUX  and Peets Coffee   Tea Inc   PEET  are currently trading at PE ratios that are almost double their expected earnings growth rates   This is a reliable indication that current fundamentals do not support today s valuations on either Starbucks Corp   SBUX  or Peets Coffee  Tea Inc   PEET    Therefore  current holders and prospective buyers of these quality businesses should take caution based on current valuations that are not supported by earnings and cash flows   In other words  the risk of owning these stocks is currently higher than the potential rewards would justify based on fundamentals The following table lists each of our specialty coffee companies in order of highest five year estimated annual total return to lowest   The table shows each respective company s four year historical EPS growth rate  followed by its current PE ratio  followed by the consensus five year estimated EPS growth  and finally  a five year estimated annual total return based on these fundamental relationships  The most important takeaway that we believe this table illustrates is how the combination of attractive valuation coupled with strong earnings growth leads to high potential return expectations The first two companies with the best return expectations have PE ratios significantly below expected earnings growth   Conversely  the last two companies with the lowest return expectations have PE ratios that are significantly higher than their expected EPS growth  The first two companies on the list  thanks to low relative valuation  have return expectations significantly higher than earnings growth  On the other hand  the last two companies  due to overvaluation  have return expectations significantly below expected earnings growth Essential Fundamentals at a GlanceThe following fundamental analysis provides a comprehensive look at the important dynamics of the relationships between earnings growth and valuation  Successful long term investing requires a firm grip on and understanding of how these relationships intertwine to produce shareholder returns  and perhaps even more importantly  the amount of risk taken to achieve any given return  Of course  the investor s goal should be to achieve the highest possible return while simultaneously taking the lowest possible amount of risk to achieve it ConclusionsThe specialty coffee industry has been a great source of shareholder returns since the great recession of 2008   However  the strong returns did not go unnoticed by investors which therefore culminated in extended valuations for each of the four companies highlighted in this article   Two of these companies  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters  GMCR  and Coffee Holding Co  Inc   JVA  at one point experienced stock price valuations that far exceeded their earnings justified levels   In both cases  Mr  Market  as he inevitably will  brought the stock prices of both companies back to more rational levels  Consequently  both of these companies may represent better and safer opportunities for above average future returns than they have in a long time In contrast  both Starbucks Corp   SBUX  and Peets Coffee   Tea Inc   PEET  have also achieved stock price valuations that exceed their expected operating potential   Therefore  we would caution investors that the risk of owning these quality specialty coffee companies are high and the long term return potential lower than it should be  Although these are both superb businesses with excellent fundamentals and solid prospects for future growth  there is a rational limit that prospective investors should be willing to pay  Overvaluation needs to be recognized and respected for successful long term investing to be

106722,328237,SBUX,Why Starbucks and Luckin Coffee Can Both Win in China,news,"Much ado has been made of Luckin Coffee s NASDAQ LK  incursion into China 
The Middle Kingdom has long been Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX  turf as the java giant essentially introduced the cafe culture to China  starting with its first store there 21 years ago  However  Luckin has blanketed China since it opened its first location a little more than two years ago  and as of the end of 2019 it had 4 500 stores  slightly more than Starbucks at 4 300  With its rapid expansion  Luckin s sales have been booming as well  up 558  in its third quarter  After a successful IPO last May  Luckin s market cap ran up as high as  13 billion before fears about the coronavirus pushed it lower  Still  the company is the most valuable publicly traded coffee chain after Starbucks  even ahead of Dunkin  
Though Luckin appears to be a unique threat to Starbucks  investors shouldn t overreact here  Here s why both companies can win in the world s second biggest economy 

Apples and oranges
China is a huge market with over a billion people  and there s room for more than one kind of coffee chain  Luckin seems to understand this as its business model is much different from Starbucks  Rather than focusing on the cafe experience and being a  third place  as Starbucks does  Luckin s business is built around pick up and delivery  Most of its stores have limited seating and do not accept cash  requiring payment through an app  Starbucks  by contrast  has built its business as an upscale brand that offers a desirable and comfortable location for dates  business meetings  meet ups with friends  and other kinds of gatherings 
Rather than functioning as a Starbucks copycat  Luckin Coffee is more like a 7 11  according to local reports  While its prices tend to be half that of Starbucks  Luckin s quality in both food and beverages is believed to be worse  It s a no frills chain  while Starbucks is offering a high end experience  
Asked about new competition in China  CEO Kevin Johnson said on the recent earnings call   If you look throughout history there is a consistent pattern  In most all cases our competitors shift to focusing more on the value play and you see that time and time again  And I think we continue to see that trend  So the lesson for us is continue to amplify those unique differentiators that make us Starbucks   In the case of Luckin  there is a clear gap in its value proposition from Starbucks  as Johnson understands 
Starbucks has expanded its own pickup and delivery options in China and partnered with Alibaba in order to capture some of the demand for those conveniences  but in general  Starbucks and Luckin are much different brands  targeting different kinds of customers  
There s plenty of opportunity for Starbucks and Luckin
In Luckin s own prospectus last year ahead of its IPO  the company argued that the coffee market in China had enormous potential  saying   China s rising urbanization and disposable income have been and are expected to continue to be the main growth engines of its coffee industry  and more and more people in China have begun to consume more coffee in their daily lives  
However  compared to the other East Asian countries  per capita coffee consumption in China is minuscule  In 2018  the average Chinese person drank just 6 2 cups per year  That compares to 209 4 in Taiwan  249 5 in Hong Kong  and 279 in Japan  If the traditionally tea drinking country goes the way of some of its neighbors  coffee demand could grow by 30 times or more 
Luckin believes that as China becomes more urbanized and disposable income grows  so will coffee consumption  By comparison  coffee drinking tripled in Japan between 1963 and 1970 during a similar period of urbanization  while Taiwan and Hong Kong also experienced coffee booms in the 1980s and 1990s 
In other words  a rising tide lifts all boats  If coffee drinking goes mainstream in China  it will lead to more business for both Starbucks and Luckin  and both companies together can drive that market expansion  To the extent that Luckin introduces coffee to Chinese people who have never had it and expands the market for it  its presence could even help Starbucks 
The coronavirus factor
For now  investors may want to be cautious with these stocks and Chinese stocks  more broadly as the coronavirus outbreak continues to expand  The World Health Organization has declared it a global emergency  Wuhan  the city where the disease originated  remains on lockdown  and some airlines have canceled their flights to China  
Both companies have closed stores in China due to the outbreak  Starbucks stock slipped earlier this week despite a strong earnings report as the company said more than half of its stores in China were closed and that the closures would have a material effect on results for the year  Luckin Coffee shares have lost nearly half their value since their peak on Jan  17 over coronavirus fears  but a short seller report out on Jan  31 has also hastened the stock s decline 
Still  over the long run it seems like a mistake for investors to view these two companies as pure competitors  Starbucks has continued to deliver positive comparable sales growth in China since Luckin s launch  showing that it can grow even during Luckin s whirlwind expansion 
Both companies offer different experiences and cater to different ends of the Chinese market  They also have the ability to expand the greater Chinese coffee market  creating a mutual benefit  This isn t a zero sum game  Starbucks and Luckin can both be winners here ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqe3q,2074340

Feb 2  The second largest economic leader in the world already declared a state of emergency  quarantined major cities including Wuhan  which is the epicenter of the epidemic  Besides  it withstood the economic downturn in China from the shock of the rampant Novel Coronavirus  2019 nCoV  The infection is believed to have transmitted from animals into humans  and has now spread to more than 24 countries across the globe  Several countries imposed unprecedented travel ban on passengers moving in and out of China  Further  news of the first foreign death from this virus in the Philippines on Jan 2  also intensified the health scare The number of people afflicted by the coronavirus already crossed the victims of SARS and forced the World Health Organization to dub the crisis a global emergency China s Viral Outbreak Stalls Global GrowthPer a research conducted by Warwick McKibbin  a professor of economics at Australian National University  the coronavirus eruption could impact the global economy  three to four times larger than the  40 billion fatal blow from SARS  Globalization and the availability of cheap as well as efficient work force prompted several companies to open factories in China  Thus  even if an entity is of a foreign origin  its presence in China makes vulnerable to the coronavirus onslaught  From retail stores to companies expecting hefty sales this Chinese lunar new year  all have been sadly shut down Companies Bearing the Brunt of CoronavirusMore than thousands travel worldwide on the Chinese lunar new year  But the rush in the airports following this health emergency upset the vacation plans at large as several airlines  namely American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  Group Inc   Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   Inc   et al canceled flights to

workers fashioning its products  Due to the quarantine order issued by the Chinese government  the staff is allowed an extended holiday  This  in turn  induces a delay in production  sparking uncertainties around the reopening of the plants 5 Defensive Stocks to Buy  The virus is wreaking havoc not only across the health care space but also disrupting trade routes and companies  outlooks

106724,328239,SBUX,Starbucks Is On to Something,news,"Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  investors this week focused most of their attention on the negative financial impacts that a virus outbreak in China might have on the wider business  The management team revealed widespread store closings in recent days  and the volatile situation persuaded executives to resist upgrading their fiscal 2020 outlook following a record first quarter 
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts  CEO Kevin Johnson and other leaders discussed the scale of those Q1 operating wins while detailing a few promising growth initiatives in the works for the rest of the year  Below  I ll look at some highlights from that presentation 

The U S  rebound has legs

With the two year sales comp of 10  for the past two consecutive quarters  it is clear that our focus on the customer experience  beverage innovation  and digital customer relationships is working    Johnson

It s a good sign when a consumer company can point to several metrics that all imply its growth strategy is delivering robust results  Starbucks did just that this quarter  as global comparable store sales rose 5   The U S  market was especially strong  with 3  higher customer traffic combining with a 3  average spending boost to push comps up to 6   That result easily beat McDonald s  NYSE MCD  trends over the same period and likely cemented the coffee titan s leadership position in the domestic restaurant industry 
Management cited several other metrics that told a similar story  including the fact that comps and traffic rates have outperformed the industry for over a year now  Comps on a two year basis are up double digits over the past two quarters  too  indicating a meaningful growth acceleration  CFO Patrick Grismer tied the market share gains to three factors  improved customer satisfaction  popular drink releases  and a winning digital ordering and payment strategy 
Beating back the competition

There is no doubt that our partners and the investments we make in them are at the core of creating the unique Starbucks experience that fueled our Q1 performance   Johnson

Executives outlined several major factors that supported the unusually strong start to the year  Some of them  like popular seasonal drink releases  can be replicated by rivals like Dunkin Brands  NASDAQ DNKN   Others represent part of Starbucks  competitive advantage  though  including its leading brand affinity in both the U S  and China  its ability to customize and personalize drinks at scale  and its massive digital platform  That e commerce segment saw a 16  spike in membership  for example  up to 19 million users 
An upgrade delayed

Given the strength of our first quarter results  we had intended to raise certain aspects of our guidance for the full fiscal year  However  given the extraordinary circumstances that are rapidly developing in China  we are simply reaffirming our original guidance and will provide an update when we have better visibility to the impact of coronavirus    Grismer

Starbucks could have lifted its outlook  considering comps were 5  to start the year while the company is officially targeting gains of 3  to 4   Its 20  operating income spike this quarter similarly outperformed the annual 2020 target by a wide measure  Yet management decided the quickly developing situation in China  which is comparable to the U S  in terms of its importance to the business  warranted caution 
While it s anyone s guess how the virus outbreak might progress from here  it s clear that Starbucks has an effective plan in place to win market share   We do not take this  performance  for granted   Johnson said   We will continue to take clear and decisive steps to build our brand for the future  focusing on our competitive advantages  investing in our partners as they create those unique Starbucks experiences for our customers  driving beverage innovation  and enhancing digital relationships  ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqh-n,2074619
106725,328240,SBUX,3 Dividend Paying Stocks For Investors To Buy To Fight Off Market Uncertainty ,opinion,"The Dow  S P 500  and Nasdaq all climbed Monday to help them bounce back from a tough Friday and a rough week  Clearly  coronavirus worries seem set to linger over global markets as investors wait for clarity about the spread and potential impact on economic growth 
Despite coronavirus fears  U S  markets could be poised to expand this year  given the strong backdrop  Fourth quarter earnings season has been solid so far  driven by giants such as Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    And overall corporate earnings were already projected to bounce back in 2020 
Plus  the Fed recently maintained low interest rates  U S  unemployment rests near 50 year lows  and the U S  economy is expected to expand by at least 2  in 2020  also read    
With all that said  we found three dividend paying stocks that investors might want to buy to help combat coronavirus based market pullback fears 
Coca Cola   NYSE KO  
Coca Cola topped our quarterly earnings and revenue estimates last week  with Q4 sales up 16  and fiscal 2019 revenue up 9   The historic beverage giant has spent the last several years focusing on expanding beyond sugary drinks to adapt to changing consumer habits  Coca Cola s portfolio now includes potential Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX   rival Costa Coffee  investment in upstart Gatorade challenger BodyArmor  a new Coke branded energy drink  and more 
The Atlanta headquartered firm also bought Topo Chico in 2017 to help give it exposure to the growing seltzer water craze  Plus  it is set to launch its own sparkling water brand AHA in March 2020  And KO s transition has seemed to pay off so far  Last week  KO executives said they were confident about hitting their 2020 targets and analysts have upped their earnings estimates for fiscal 2020 and 2021 since then  This helps KO earn a Zack Rank  2  Buy  at the moment 
Coca Cola also holds a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and its industry rests in the top 26  of our more than 250 Zacks industries  Our estimates call for KO s sales to climb 4 7  in 2020 and another 4 4  in 2021  Coca Cola s adjusted earnings are projected to pop 7 1  and 7 4   respectively  during this same stretch  Meanwhile  KO shares have climbed 10  in the past three months and over 30  in the last two years to top the S P 500 s 21  expansion  This run helps make Coca Cola s 2 74  dividend yield  which tops rival PepsiCo  Inc    NASDAQ PEP   and the 10 year U S  Treasury s 1 5   all the more impressive  And KO has consistently raised its quarterly payout 
IBM   NYSE IBM  
IBM topped our quarterly earnings estimates in January and reported surprise Q4 revenue growth  which came after it had posted five straight quarters of declining sales  Analysts upped their longer term earnings estimates for IBM since its report  which helps it earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Shares of IBM are now up 9  in the last month and 6  since its January 21 release  This recent positivity might help IBM rebound after a rough couple of years  with the stock now up 8  in the past 12 months 
Our estimates call for the company s adjusted fiscal 2020 EPS figure to pop 4   with 2021 projected to climb 6 2  higher  The company also rocks an  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system and trades at a solid discount against its industry s average in terms of forward 12 month Zacks earnings estimates  10 7X vs  18 3X   Plus  IBM s dividend yield sits at 4 51   This payout easily tops Qualcomm s   NASDAQ QCOM   2 91  yield  Cisco s   NASDAQ CSCO   3 05   and Intel s   NASDAQ INTC   1 97  
IBM s cloud computing revenue surged 21  last quarter to account for over 30  of total sales  Looking ahead  the historic tech giant hopes to compete alongside industry powers like Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    as it continues to invest in  higher value growth areas   Alongside cloud  Red Hat s revenue soared 24  in Q4 to help justify why IBM acquired the open source software firm for  34 billion  And the firm has already reduced its debt by  10 billion since closing the Red Hat acquisition in July 2019 
Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE  
Pfizer is one of the largest pharmaceutical firms in the world  but it s trying to transform into a smaller operation aimed at big growth  PFE plans to achieve this by focusing more on patent protected drugs for diseases such as cancer  which often offer more growth upside   2020 is expected to be an exciting year for Pfizer with the close of the Upjohn Mylan transaction anticipated by mid year  leaving New Pfizer positioned to deliver revenue and Adjusted diluted EPS growth that is expected to be among the industry leaders   CEO Albert Bourla said in prepared Q4 remarks 
 New Pfizer will be a smaller  science based company with a singular focus on innovation while also continuing to allocate significant capital directly to shareholders  primarily through dividends   Pfizer s patent protected medicine sales popped 7  in the fourth quarter  And the company s strong fiscal 2020 and 2021 earnings revision activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  right now  PFE also holds an  A  grade for Value and a  B  for Growth 
Shares of PFE are down 11  in the last year  as investors try to make sense of the transition  Peeking back  the stock is up 16  in the past three years  which tops the Drug Market s 1  average climb  Plus  Pfizer returned  16 9 billion to shareholders during fiscal 2019  mostly through buyback and dividends  And Pfizer s 4 08  dividend yield tops Eli Lilly s   NYSE LLY   1 85  and Bristol Myers Squibb s   NYSE BMY   2 86

buyout of Keurig Green Mountain Inc  O GMCR  in a deal that would give it 60 percent control of North America s single serve coffee market and advance its ambitions to build a global coffee powerhouse   The transaction  pitched at a rich 78 percent premium to Keurig s Friday closing price  would be the biggest coffee acquisition by JAB  the investment vehicle of Germany s billionaire Reimann family  as it tries to become a formidable competitor to world coffee market leader Nestle SA  VX NESN   For Luxembourg based JAB  the deal for the maker of K Cup coffee pods  is a fantastic opportunity for them to be really a global player in the coffee market  Now they can have some scale in the U S    said Vontobel analyst Jean Philippe Bertschy   The price represents a  demanding valuation  of about 15 times Keurig s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   he said  The stock was trading around eight times EBITDA last week  Bertschy said   Keurig has struggled with declining sales because of increased competition and slower than expected adoption of its newer 2 0 brewing machines because of consumers  confusion over which brands could be used with the devices  Analysts have also questioned the growth prospects for the company s latest countertop device  a single serve cold drink maker called Keurig Kold  citing its high price and a disappointing rollout  As a result  shares of Keurig had lost more than 60 percent of their market value this year up to Friday s close  On Monday  the stock closed up 72 percent at  88 89  but still remained below JAB s offer price of  92 per share  The increase represented a blow to influential investor David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and other short sellers  who hold nearly 13 percent of the total Keurig float in a bet the shares would fall further  COFFEE POWERHOUSE  JAB had long been eyeing Keurig as an acquisition target as it moved aggressively to build its presence in all aspects of the coffee business  from bagged coffee to cafes  a source familiar with the situation said  Keurig leads the  6 1 billion North American single serve coffee market with a 61 percent market share  according to market research firm Euromonitor International  Nestle has only a small presence in that business  JAB also owns two Nordic coffeehouse chains as well as Caribou Coffee and Peet s Coffee   Tea in the United States  where the market is dominated by Starbucks  O SBUX   Speculation has even surfaced that JAB might be interested in Dunkin  Donuts  which has a loyal following for its coffee  Three senior partners run JAB  and its ambitions in coffee may be modeled partly upon the global strength of acquisitive brewer Anheuser Busch InBev  where JAB senior partner Olivier Goudet serves as chairman and JAB senior partner Peter Harf was formerly chairman  JAB in July completed the formation of a joint venture called Jacobs Douwe Egberts  now the largest pure play coffee company by volume  combining its D E  Master Blenders 1753 business with the coffee business of  Mondelez International Inc   O MDLZ    It still trails Nestle in global market share by retail value  with Nestle accounting for 22

The Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration said  in a statement  that it visited 581 food related businesses as part of its investigation and had dispatched 875 personnel to conduct inspections  Reuters reported  adding that Chinese police  local governments and prosecutors are also now involved in the case  Earlier in the week  the Chinese government had suspended operations at Shanghai Husi after local media reported Monday that the company was selling chicken and beef beyond the expiration date

106742,328257,SBUX,Hedge funds hold their nerve on China  seek opportunities,news,"By Samuel Shen and Ira Iosebashvili
SHANGHAI NEW YORK  Reuters    Hedge funds are holding their nerve on China s ability to rebound quickly from the coronavirus outbreak rattling global markets  but many are also adding caveats as they try to predict the potential economic fallout 
Mainland China stocks fell sharply on Monday when Shanghai and Shenzhen markets opened after an extended Lunar New Year break  wiping out nearly  700 billion in market capitalization 
But the broad blue chip CSI 300  CSI300   which fell almost 8  on Monday  rose 2 5  on Tuesday 
 In a crisis  everyone feels the sky is falling  But the sky does not fall in the end   said Gu Weiyong  chief investment officer at Shanghai based hedge fund manager Ucom Investment Co 
He said he favored battered stocks of airport operators such as Shanghai Airport  SS 600009  on the basis that an economic recovery was only a matter of time 
Shares in Shanghai Airport were down 19  so far this year as of Monday s close  but gained 8  on Tuesday 
Oil prices  often considered a barometer of investor confidence in the global economy  eased off 13 month lows hit on Monday  with benchmark Brent crude  LCOc1  gaining 0 8  to  54 90 a barrel 
Futures prices also indicated an opening gain for the U S  S P 500 index  SPX  to add to a 0 7  bounce on Monday 
 The market seems to have reacted quite reasonably   said Switzerland based David Nietlispach  portfolio manager for Pala Asset Management  who added that it was  however  a  wait and see  moment for Chinese stocks  as the government continued to battle the epidemic and assess economic damage 
HEDGES  VOLATILITY BETS
Stock market volatility   a favored play for many hedge funds   has risen sharply in recent days  On Monday the VIX index  VIX  measuring U S  market volatility  reached its highest in more than three months 
Christopher Stanton  chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners LLC  on Monday bought derivatives that rise in value if volatility picks up 
The fund uses computer driven strategies to time short term market swings 
 Am I happy about it  No  Because everything in my body tells me this is not over yet   he said pointing to the risk that a faster than expected increase in the number of coronavirus cases could trigger more selling 
The epidemic has claimed more than 420 lives in mainland China but has spread to several countries such as the United States  Japan  India and Singapore 
 What do you think isolating the world s second largest economy is going to do    he said   It can make  trade  tariffs look like a mosquito bite  
Yuan Yuwei  who manages a global macro fund from China s eastern city of Hangzhou  said the sectors most vulnerable to an epidemic included property  retail  luxury goods  travel and leisure 
He shorted several stocks ahead of China s new year holiday  including Yum China  N YUMC  and Starbucks  O SBUX   while also betting on some potential gainers  such as Chinese online video platform Bilibili  O BILI  
 In such a crisis  if you re cool headed  there are plenty of opportunities to jump into a trend   he said 
Yang Xiaofan  Japan based hedge fund manager  was however more pessimistic  and is shorting copper  whose price typically tracks global growth  while buying silver as a less crowded safe haven trade than gold 
 The new virus itself is not that horrible but the supply chain disruptions and factory closures caused by city lock ins and holiday extensions would deal a real blow to the economy in the near term   he said
