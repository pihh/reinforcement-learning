20807,242322,ADUS,4 Value Stocks For Growth Investors To Enrich Portfolio,opinion,Investors got the much needed confidence with the current year showing improvement across various aspects like the noteworthy tax reform  improving economy and rising interest rates to name a few  Banking on these positives  we expect investors to witness a bullish market in 2018 We will discuss some of the above mentioned factors in detail to help shed light on how these are likely to support the current momentum in the markets The gradually improving interest rates have come as a blessing for investors with the Fed indicating four rate hikes this year  thereby lending an impression of aggressive rate raises The FOMC  Federal Open Market Committee  meeting held on May 2  2018 did not witness any rate hike with the regulatory body members unanimously deciding not to increase the rates post the March conference  However  this month s assembly buoyed hope among investors as the Fed officials remain on track to augment rates at their June meeting  The current interest rate ranges between 1 50  and 1 75  This apart  inflation has finally reached the Fed s 2  target after unable to achieve the same for the past six years Also  the unemployment rate is projected at 3 8  in 2018 while the gross domestic product is likely to grow 2 7   an increase from the earlier estimate of 2 5    Further  rise in household spending as well as ramped up business activities are expected to drive growth in 2018  The tax cut  which reduced the tax rate to 21  from 35   is anticipated to help attain an economic boom  higher job opportunities as well as a spike in inflation rate All aforementioned factors represent a bullish economic outlook  further picking pace in the recent months At this point of time  when the economy is on a rebound  it seems prudent to invest in reasonably priced stocks  by current trading standards  Keeping this in mind  putting money on value stocks looks wiser as stocks trade at a lower price regardless of what the performance of the companies might indicate  On the flip side  growth investors usually incline toward stocks with above average earnings growth rate than the market  These stocks are mostly overvalued and are bet on to generate substantial capital gains Value investment is for those investors looking to buy stocks with price lower than the intrinsic one

likely to have contributed significantly to the company s top line in the third quarter by expanding its offering in the fast growing gene therapy market However  the life science solutions segment

third quarter  Outside the United States  the company s largest market lies in China and it has taken measures to sustain the momentum in this market in the third quarter  The company s commercial infrastructure in China is likely to have aided growth in the third quarter However  Thermo Fisher is apprehensive about negative impacts of foreign exchange fluctuation  which are likely to have

20809,242324,ADUS,5 Top Stocks To Gain From Fed s Stable Monetary Stance,opinion,On Oct 30  Federal Reserve cut benchmark interest rate by a quarter basis points for the third time in a year  This happened for the first time in more than a decade  However  the third rate cut was widely expected  What is important is Fed Chair Jerome Powell s message that the central bank will keep its monetary policy steady      neither rate cut nor rate hike      so long its outlook for the U S  economy remains unchanged Fed Adopts a Stable Monetary PolicyOn Oct 30  Fed reduced the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 1 50 1 75   After raising interest rate for four times last year for a full 1 percentage point  Fed adopted a dovish stance since the beginning of 2019  Notably  Fed s aggressive monetary stance was blamed as one of the major reasons for stock market disaster in 2018 After keeping interest rate stable in the first half of 2019  Fed was compelled to reduce it in three consecutive and equal tranches of 25 basis points to sustain the expansion of the U S  economy amid heightened trade conflict with China  global economic slowdown and slowing pace of U S  economic growth     particularly contraction in business spending However  in his latest policy statement  Powell dropped the phrase that Fed would  act as appropriate  to sustain expansion  and said instead that it  will assess the appropriate path of the target range  for fed funds  This clearly indicates the end of mid cycle  insurance cut  monetary policy adjustment At the same time  the Fed Chair has also assured market participants that the central bank will not consider a rate hike until there is a sustained and significant uptick in inflation rate  which was remained muted at below 2  target rate of Fed so far in 2019 Is This the Best Solution It seems that the Fed was facing a dilemma while finalizing monetary policy in its FOMC  The United States is witnessing a dichotomized syndrome in 2019  The business investment  especially the manufacturing sector is suffering owing to a tariff war with China  which raised input costs as well as reduced export demand for high end U S  products On the other hand  consumer spending remained firm and is driving the U S  GDP  In the third quarter of 2019  the U S  economy grew 1 9   higher than the consensus estimate of 1 6   primarily buoyed by strong consumer spending  Two recently released consumer centric data     consumer confidence and consumer sentiment     clearly reflected most of the Americans are happy with current economic conditions Since  consumer spending accounts for nearly 70  of the U S  economy against 12  weight of business spending  U S  GDP is growing even after 10 years of expansion  albeit at a slow pace  Wall Street is also reaping benefits as the S P 500 Index recently achieved a new all time high  while both the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite are at striking distance from their record highs At this stage  adoption of a stable monetary policy was appreciated by investors as the S P 500  the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite       gained 0 3   0 4  and 0 3   respectively  after Fed s

slowdown and slowing pace of U S  economic growth     particularly contraction in business spending However  in his latest policy statement  Powell dropped the phrase that Fed would  act as appropriate  to sustain expansion  and said instead that it  will assess the appropriate path of the target range  for fed funds  This clearly indicates the end of mid cycle  insurance cut  monetary policy adjustment At the same time  the Fed Chair has also assured market participants that the central bank will not consider a rate hike until there is a sustained and significant uptick in inflation rate  which was remained muted at below 2  target rate of Fed so far in 2019 Is This the Best Solution It seems that the Fed was facing a dilemma while finalizing monetary policy in its FOMC  The United States is witnessing a dichotomized syndrome in 2019  The business investment  especially the manufacturing sector is suffering owing to a tariff war with China  which raised input costs as well as reduced export demand for high end U S  products On the other hand  consumer spending remained firm and is driving the U S  GDP  In the third quarter of 2019  the U S  economy grew 1 9   higher than the consensus estimate of 1 6   primarily buoyed by strong consumer spending  Two recently released consumer centric data     consumer confidence and consumer sentiment     clearly reflected most of the Americans are happy with current economic conditions Since  consumer spending accounts for nearly 70  of the U S  economy against 12  weight of business spending  U S  GDP is growing even after 10 years of expansion  albeit at a slow pace  Wall Street is also reaping benefits as the S P 500 Index recently achieved a new all time high  while both the Dow and the Nasdaq

20828,242343,ADUS,Small Cap Rally Set To Continue  5 Top Ranked Picks ,opinion,Small cap stocks are enjoying a good year  While the benchmark S P 500 is up only 0 6  year to date  the Russell 2000 and the S P SmallCap 600 indices have gained 4 9  and 6 3   respectively  over the same period  Last week  this class of stocks enjoyed a record run of gains  The Russell 2000 hit record highs over three consecutive sessions Analysts feel that the recent run of gains is likely to continue for small caps  This is because a combination of factors is working in their favor  An analyst from investment bank B  Riley FBR thinks the Russell 2000 will hit 1800 by the end of the year  increasing 16  year over year  Picking small cap stocks looks like an exceedingly profitable option at this point Domestic Focus a Major PositiveOne of the major advantages that small caps hold over their large cap peers is their strong domestic focus  Per data from S P Dow Jones Indices  domestic revenue exposure for companies which make up the S P SmallCap 600 index is 78 8   This is significantly higher than the S P 500 and the S P MidCap 400  domestic exposure for which stand at 70 9  and 73 3   respectively This level of domestic exposure ensures that small caps are insulated from multiple headwinds  These include surging bond yields  a resurgent dollar and trade related conflicts  In fact  domestic focused small caps could even stand to gain from the dollar s rise Over the last 10 years  a 1  increase in the U S  dollar has been accompanied by a 0 95  increase in the value of small caps  In contrast  mid caps and large caps have gained only 0 82  and 0 71   respectively  over the same period Poised to Grow in Historically Unfavorable PhaseAccording to Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   the United States is in the end stages of its current economic cycle  Historically  such a period is considered detrimental for small and mid cap stocks  This is because wage increases and other cost hikes crimp margins at a time when such companies have few options to increase efficiency  But this trend is unlikely to be repeated this time around However  growth in revenues has been  underwhelming  during the current economic recovery  per the investment bank  Morgan Stanley feels that large caps have been able to boost results through cutbacks and inorganic growth  Small caps have been unable to resort to such tactics But this state of matters is likely to change soon  Tax cuts ushered in last year and extensive deregulation are likely to  disproportionately benefit  small caps going forward  This  in turn  would boost earnings performance for the group Our ChoicesSmall cap stocks  recent run of gains can be attributed to a confluence of factors  Firstly  their domestic focus insulates them from a variety of external risk factors  Additionally  they are well poised to grow during the end stages of an economic cycle  a phase where they have historically performed poorly Adding small cap stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart choice at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is

20860,242375,ADUS,Conatus  CNAT  Q1 Loss Narrows Y Y  Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ CNAT   reported first quarter 2017 loss of 14 cents per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but narrower than the year ago figure of 35 cents  Conatus  shares have outperformed the Zacks classified  industry so far this year  Shares of the company gained 46 5  while the industry registered an increase of 14 4  
Conatus has no approved product in its portfolio at the moment  However  the company recognized  7 0 million as collaboration revenues for the first quarter of 2017  It also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 88 million  The collaboration revenues were related to an agreement with Novartis AG   NYSE NVS    which was inked in Dec 2016  for the worldwide development and commercialization of Conatus  lead candidate  emricasan  as a single agent treatment for NASH  Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  cirrhosis in both compensated and decompensated patients  As a part of the deal  Novartis will share 50  cost of four ongoing phase IIb clinical trials on emricasan In the first quarter  research and development expenses were  7 9 million  up 68  from the year ago quarter  This was mainly due to cost related to the ongoing Encore study  General and administrative expenses were  2 8 million  up 7 7  from the year ago quarter  This was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs partially offset by lower consulting fees The company has raised  15 million from Novartis by issuing a convertible promissory note It anticipates another  7 million as Novartis exercises its option to an exclusive license for the global development and commercialization of emricasan in May 2017 Emricasan in FocusEmricasan is being developed for the treatment of patients with chronic liver disease With the initiation of the ENCORE LF clinical trial in May 2017  there are four ongoing emricasan Phase IIb clinical trials  The ENCORE LF  Liver Function  is a placebo controlled phase IIb study evaluating twice daily treatment with emricasan for preventing or delaying the clinical outcomes associated with the progression of advanced liver disease in 210 patients with decompensated NASH cirrhosis  Data from this 48 week study are expected in 2019 In Nov 2016  Conatus initiated a placebo controlled  phase IIb study  evaluating the effect of emricasan for the reduction of hepatic venous pressure gradient  HVPG  in patients with compensated or early decompensated liver cirrhosis caused by NASH  and severe portal hypertension confirmed by HVPG of  12 mmHg at baseline  Data after 24 weeks of twice daily treatment with emricasan or placebo are anticipated in 2018 The company is conducting two additional phase IIb studies on emricasan  These include the POLT HCV SVR study evaluating potential improvements in Ishak fibrosis score in post orthotropic liver transplant  POLT  recipients with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis post transplant caused by recurrent hepatitis C virus  HCV  infection in those who have successfully achieved a sustained viral response  SVR  following HCV antiviral therapy  Data are expected in the first half of 2018 ENCORE NF is the other study evaluating potential improvements in fibrosis and steatohepatitis in patients with fibrosis caused by NASH  Results are expected in 2018 The company also plans to initiate a new study   ENCORE XT   on emricasan under the ENCORE program We expect investor focus to remain on updates pertaining to the candidate s development GuidanceCash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are expected between  45 million and  55 million by year end 2017 Conatus expects its current financial resources  together with the anticipated license option exercise milestone payment and expense reimbursements related

20861,242376,ADUS,Avoid Market Volatility With 5 Low Beta Stocks ,opinion,Don t follow the crowd especially when it comes in investing money  The crowd believes that only risky securities can give above market returns  Don t get into the trap  instead do your own research to come up with lucrative investment strategies We agree that risky stocks could generate lucrative returns only when the market is bullish but we also need to consider the converse scenario  In this article  we present a strategy which proves that low risky securities can also reap rewards if some specific parameters are considered Beta UnderstandingBeta indicates the volatility of a particular stock with respect to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of stock price movement relative to the market  we are considering S P 500 here  If a company has a beta of 1  it means that the relative volatility of the stock is the same as that of the S P 500  In the same way  if the stock s beta is greater than 1 then it is more volatile compared to the market  Conversely  a beta below 1 signifies less volatility Now  if a portfolio s beta is 3  it is three times more volatile than the market  Hence  if the market is projected to give 20  return  the portfolio will then definitely contribute 60  return which is amazing However  the opposite case also holds true  If the market slips 20  then the portfolio return plummets 60  which is surely a matter of concern The Winning StrategyIn our screening criteria we included beta in the range of 0 to 0 6 for short listing low risk stocks  But this

20864,242379,ADUS,Wall Street Brushes Off Trade War Fears  Top 5 Gainers,opinion,Major bourses made a remarkable comeback on Apr 4  with the Dow Jones gaining more than 700 points from trough to peak  Initially  the bourses had plunged below key technical levels after China retaliated with threats to impose tariffs on a number of American goods But stocks rebounded after investors gauged that the tariffs threats are merely negotiating tactics and both the sides won t risk a full blown trade war  After all  trade conflicts dent corporate profits and impede economic expansion  President Trump also downplayed fears over tariffs announced by both China and the United States As trade war worries dissipate and the broader market moves north  investing in stocks making the most of the recovery seems judicious Wall Street s Massive RecoveryThe Dow Jones rebounded from 510 points  or 2 1  plunge  to finish the session up about 230 points  or 1  on Apr 4  The blue chip index  thus  registered its best single session comeback since Feb 6  when blue chips had slipped 2 33  to end at 2 33  The S P 500 and the tech heavy Nasdaq staged their biggest intraday turnarounds since Feb 9  when the S P tumbled 1 9  but ended with a gain of 1 5  and the Nasdaq logged a gain of 1 4  after being down 2 2  on that day On Apr 4  the S P gained 30 points  or 1 2   while the Nasdaq rose 101 points  or 1 5   eventually erasing steep opening losses  With such gains  the S P closed above its 200 day moving average for the second straight day  indicating encouraging long term trends  The S P  in particular  gained in back to back sessions for the first time since Mar 9  The Nasdaq  in the meanwhile  ended in the positive territory for the year What Led to the Initial Losses Concerns about a potential trade war between the United States and China had unnerved investors  China s Ministry of Commerce plans to impose tariffs on 106 U S  products  including soybeans and airplanes  affecting  50 billion worth of goods American soybean manufacturers are likely to face steep losses  as they export almost  13 billion out of the  20 billion yearly agricultural sales to China  Investors are also selling shares of airline manufacturer The Boeing Company   NYSE BA   and heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT     These behemoths have huge business operations in China  thus  their revenues and profits are vulnerable to trade disputes China retaliated after the Trump administration levied duties on 1 300 Chinese exports  worth  50 billion  The list includes video monitors  electromagnets used in MRI machines  aerospace products  and machinery  U S  levied tariffs on China to punish the second largest economy for theft of trade secrets including software and patents Trade War Worries LessenBut  investors soon realized that the countries do not want a full blown trade war despite the tit for tat tariff threats  After all  a trade war is a big worry for corporate America as its profits will be hurt if trade restrictions are put  It may also deal a heavy blow to economies  resulting in widespread unemployment Lest we forget  market pundits expect Q1 earnings results to be quite impressive  while Trump s economy is in good shape with the jobless rate near a 17 year low  Total earnings for the S P companies are estimated to improve 16  from the same period last year on 7 4  higher revenues  the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years  Such an uptick will follow 13 5  earnings growth on 8 5  revenue improvement last quarter  read more     The White House also played down the notion of a trade war  Trump s chief economic advisor  Larry Kudlow told reporters that he is willing to resolve the trade disputes with minimum hassle And when it comes to Trump  we all know that his actions are not as tough as his rhetoric  How can we forget that he was supposed to impose hefty tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum  But  he chose to give exemptions to countries like Mexico  Canada  the European Union  South Korea  Australia  Brazil and Argentina after his top allies threatened retaliation Top 5 Winners Not only did major indices end up more than 1  in the last trading session  but these also have the scope to scale higher on reduced trade war fears  We have  thus  selected five stocks that can make the most of the encouraging

20865,242380,ADUS,3 Healthcare Stocks Set To Beat Q1 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"First quarter earnings  reported so far  have showed all around strength backed by a strong economy  Even the Fed  in a recent comment  stated that  economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate   Business investment  continued to grow strongly   reinstating the firm footing that the U S  economy is on 
Importantly  the U S  economy featured a record low unemployment rate and gradual wage increase  both of which bode well for the healthcare sector  High employment increases demand for healthcare  and in turn the size of the healthcare market  This in turn pushes up the number of participants with the entry of new hospitals or expansion of existing hospitals  expansion of products and services by insurers  higher demand for diagnostic and lab service operators  and more 
Moreover  an increase in wages would raise consumers  propensity to spend on costly healthcare services  it is to be noted that U S  healthcare is the costliest in the world   While insurance covers a large part of healthcare spending  the rise of high deductibles health plans in recent years had kept consumers away from the market when the unemployment rate was high and wage growth was low  High deductible requires the insured to pay the initial amount  which is quite high   before the insurance coverage kicks in 
The overall bullishness reinforces our sentiment that the growth cadence for the sector should continue  Let s take a look at the factors affecting Q1 results for payers in this sector 
Acute Flu Season
The 2017 2018 flu season was severe and has been a shot in the arm for the hospital operators  diagnostic and lab service providers  and companies in the drug supply chain  Most of the hospital companies that reported first quarter results saw an increase in emergency rooms and inpatient admissions on account of flu 
According to an article in Pharmacy Times  this flu season broke records in terms of higher than average hospitalization rates  According to the report  the overall and all age specific hospitalization rates surpassed the end of season hospitalization rates for the 2014 2015 season  which was also an influenza A predominant season categorized as high severity Nevertheless  increased flu activity has been a pain for insurers  having been slapped with high claim costs as more patients seek treatments and file for claim on their health insurance cover 
Aging Population to Fuel Demand
The aging U S  population has been one of the main drivers for healthcare services  as retirees demand more healthcare services in their old age  The graying population of America has led to an unprecedented rise in demand for Medicare Advantage  MA  plans  a private version of the Medicare plan provided by the government to the retirees 
While previously Medicare was provided by the government to Americans  saddled with high cost in recent years  the government is increasingly outsourcing this program to the private health insurance  which has effectively managed costs for this program  This has led to an increase in private participation in the MA market  These plans have been highly profitable for health insurers  
Since MA members have higher medical utilization rates  they bring in about three times more revenues than commercial members  which has helped top line growth of the companies engaged in MA  Also  health insurers have been able to maintain profitability in these plans by keeping claim cost down via measures such as preventive healthcare and accountable care organizations  
This business has proven to be a cash cow for the health insurance industry  Health insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    Humana Inc  NYSE HUM    Centene Corp  that have already reported earnings results this quarter have reported an increase in membership in MA  which has aided revenue growth 
High Cost
We  however  expect to see high capital costs for hospitals as companies invest in the electronic health record system  Moreover  high labor expenses in its largely unionized workforce would cause a rise in labor and wage expenses  which should weigh on their margins  For health insurers  a number of acquisitions made recently should lead to an increase in acquisition integration costs  Adoption of technology would entail greater expenditure too  thereby raising operating costs 
Tax Reform
As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which became effective in December 2017  companies in the health care space project a reduction in the corporate income tax  CIT  rate   Most of the companies that have reported first quarter results so far have seen higher margins on account of lower taxes 
The tax reform  however  repealed Obamacare s key requirement that all Americans obtain health insurance  which would cause an increase in uninsured rate  But since this provision will be effective in 2019  we would not feel an impact in the first quarter earnings 
3 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Heading in to Q1
The aforesaid factors will surely help healthcare companies to emerge as winners in Q1  The healthcare industry is a part of the broader Medical sector 
For the   we now have Q1 results from 83 1  of the sector s total market cap in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these companies are up 14 7  on 8 1  higher revenues  with 88 9  beating EPS and 75  beating revenue estimates 
Let s take a look at some of the stocks that are poised to beat estimates in the first quarter  These stocks have a Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  
Envision Healthcare Corp    NYSE EVHC   operates as a financial holding company for TBK Bank  SSB that provides banking and commercial finance products and services to retail customers and small to mid sized businesses in the United States  The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending March 2018 on May 7
