116455,337970,RL,Italy sees fashion sales hit due to China virus  Pandora warns of business freeze,news,"By Claudia Cristoferi and Silvia Aloisi
MILAN  Reuters    Italy s fashion industry expects revenues to fall 1 8  in the first half of 2020 due as the coronavirus outbreak hits sales  an industry official said on Tuesday  as jewelry maker Pandora warned business in China had ground to a halt 
Several high end brands also said they had shut down stores in China  the world s biggest luxury goods market  stoking concerns that the industry could face significant damage to sales if the virus is not contained quickly 
Carlo Capasa  head of Italy s national fashion chamber CNMI  said the coronavirus outbreak would cause turnover for the Italian industry to fall by 1 8  in the first six months of the year  mostly in the first quarter 
Home to the likes of Prada  HK 1913   Armani and Moncler  MI MONC   Italy is second only to France among European countries for fashion and luxury goods sales  Total turnover for the sector was 90 billion euros last year  or about 5  of gross domestic product in the euro zone s third biggest economy  according to CNMI figures 
 In December the outlook for 2020 was a return to our historical annual growth rate of around 3   but all that changed with the China virus spreading   Capasa said 
 The full economic impact can t be calculated yet  but we would be lucky if the sector grew 1  this year  
Chinese shoppers fueled a decade of growth for the luxury goods industry and today account for 35  of the sector s global sales  estimated at 281 billion euros last year by consultancy Bain   Co 
But the coronavirus has seen parts of China put under quarantine  flights halted and many Chinese cancel trips abroad  including during the New Lunar Year holiday  a peak retail season in China and overseas 
Companies around the world have warned that the outbreak could disrupt supply chains or hurt bottom lines 
Ralph Lauren Corp  N RL  said on Tuesday it has shut about half of its 110 stores in China due to the disease  which has so far killed over 420 people 
Tiffany   Co  bought recently by LVMH  PA LVMH   said it had also temporarily closed several stores in affected areas 
   As I sit here and watch the Chinese business  it is in a standstill mode  I mean there s pennies being sold   Pandora s Chief Executive Alexander Lacik told Reuters on Tuesday  describing an  unprecedented  drop in business 
The Danish company  about 10  of whose annual sales are to Hong Kong  China and its tourists  has closed 70 of its 240 shops in China on government orders  customer traffic at other stores  mostly in shopping malls  is  next to none   Lacik said 
Capasa said three Chinese designers had been forced to cancel their shows at Milan s Women s Fashion Week on Feb  18 24  and about 1 000 Chinese people who had been expected to attend would now likely not show up 
 The Chinese are big spenders  for us this is quite relevant   he said ",2020-02-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/italy-sees-fashion-sales-hit-due-to-china-virus-pandora-warns-of-business-freeze-2075754,2075754
116456,337971,RL,Stocks   S P Soars as Virus Fears Abate,news,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing com   The S P rallied sharply Tuesday on easing fears about the new coronavirus  impact on global economy as China s aggressive measures to limit the economic fallout from the virus boosted sentiment 
The S P 500 rose 2 3   while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1 9  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1 6  
For a second straight day  China introduced stimulus measures to steady business lending and offset the economic impact from the coronavirus  which has killed more than 400 people 
Sentiment on risk was also supported by data showing that the coronavirus may not be as deadly as many feared   
The coronavirus death rate was 2 1   lower than SARS  9 6   according to China s National Health Commission 
Despite the efforts from China  Goldman Sachs estimated that the global gross domestic product growth this year could fall by 0 1 to 0 2  even if infections slows significantly in February and March 
 The near term impact is quite large   Goldman s chief economist Jan Hatzius said   What happens to 2020 as a whole really depends on how quickly the episode is brought under control

Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  surged 12  after its topped quarterly results as price hikes for its winterwear collection boosted margins

Ralph Lauren s profit nearly tripled in the holiday quarter and breezed past analysts  estimates  A one time tax benefit also helped lift the bottom line

116464,337979,RL,Why Ralph Lauren Stock Jumped Today,news,"What happened
Shares of Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  were gaining after the preppy apparel brand posted better than expected results in its third quarter earnings report  Though revenue growth was sluggish  the company saw solid comparable sales momentum and strong growth on the bottom line 
As of 2 35 p m  EST  the stock was up 10 1   

So what
Ralph Lauren has struggled with many of the same challenges as other retailers in recent years as key distribution partners like department stores have lost market share and shuttered locations  but its third quarter earnings report showed its recent efforts to refresh its brand were paying off   
Overall revenue rose 1 5   2  in constant currency  to  1 75 billion  which topped estimates of  1 72 billion  Overall  comparable sales were up 2   while they grew 4  in North America  the company s biggest market  a sign that the brand is resonating with customers as its investments in marketing and updating its product line delivered results  
The comparable sales growth helped deliver margin expansion  and adjusted earnings per share jumped from  2 32 to  2 86 with the help of aggressive share buybacks  That was better than estimates of  2 45 
 We continue to make strong progress on our Next Great Chapter plan amid a volatile backdrop  with third quarter results ahead of our overall expectations  including better than expected revenues  operating margin  and double digit EPS growth   CEO Patrice Louvet said  
Now what
The retailer is facing some challenges in Asia due to the recent protests in Hong Kong and now the coronavirus outbreak  which has forced the closure of half of its stores in China  However  management raised its full year outlook  saying it expected revenue growth of 2  to 3  after previously guiding toward the low end of that range  though that does not include any impact from the coronavirus outbreak  The company didn t give earnings per share guidance  but it did say it expected operating margin to rise slightly for the full year  
While wholesale revenue continues to decline  investors should be encouraged by the comparable sales growth during the key holiday season  It s not a surprise to see shares rising today ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pr1rl,2075990
116465,337980,RL,Stocks   Nasdaq Notches Record on Tesla s Surge Higher,news,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing com   The Nasdaq closed at record highs Tuesday  led by a surge in shares of Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  as the electric automaker continued its drive higher following its upbeat results last week showing record deliveries 
The S P 500 rose 1 5  to close at a record high  while the Nasdaq Composite surged 2 10  to a record  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1 44  
Tesla was soaring  but saw sharp selling just before the close  There were unconfirmed rumors of a seondary offering  but shares still ended the day 15  higher  Shares have been on fire this week  with rises showing the hallmarks of a short covering rally 
  M any have attributed the ascent to short sellers who bet against the stock and may have to cover their positions as Tesla stock leaps higher   Wedbush said in a note    Half of what we ve seen is just a historic short covering rally for the ages  That s put gasoline on the fire for the Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  bull story  
Tesla regained its position as the most shorted stock in the U S  at the end of January  according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners 
The broader market  meanwhile  was also lifted by growing expectations that central banks will act should the outbreak of the coronavirus intensify and threaten global growth 
China introduced stimulus measures for a second straight day in a bid to steady business lending following the rapid spread of the virus  which has killed 400 people and infected more than 20 000 
For weeks  the rapid spread of the virus had raised worries that the death toll could pick up pace  but new information suggests the death rate is not as bad as initially feared

thank you for joining today s call  We continue to make strong progress on our Next Great Chapter plan with third quarter results  ahead of our overall expectations  including better than expected revenues  operating margin and double digit EPS growth Over the important holiday season  our teams consistently executed across each of our strategic priorities  enabling us to elevate our brand and deliver for our consumers across every touch point  The solid foundations we ve put into place to reposition and elevate our brands  helped to drive positive comp growth across all three regions  excluding the impact of Hong Kong this quarter We were also encouraged by AUR growth of 6  as we invest in brand elevation through our products  marketing  distribution and unique consumer experiences  At the same time  we continue to execute key initiatives to stabilize our North America business against an evolving retail landscape As I ve shared before  the three principles underlying this work include  putting the consumer at the center of everything we do  elevating the brand across all consumer touch points and balancing growth and productivity  And we are doing all of this while managing through volatile industry dynamics  including the recent coronavirus outbreak  which we are actively monitoring Our top priorities are to keep our employees and consumers safe and to heed the advice of local and international health authorities  The situation is a dynamic one and we will continue to assess the implications for our business across retail  corporate and our supply base  Our thoughts are with the many impacted by this virus During the third quarter  we drove our performance across the five strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our five year plan to deliver long term  sustainable growth and value creation  These include  first  win over a new generation of consumers  second  energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories  third  drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels  fourth  lead with digital across all activities  and fifth  operate with discipline to show growth Starting with win over a new generation of consumers  We re investing in media channels that matter most to consumers today  namely  digital and social and remain on track toward our long term marketing investment target of 5  of sales  In the third quarter  marketing increased 16  the last year as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period  We are encouraged by consumer engagement across generations through our campaigns and programs  Notably  our total social media followers surpassed 40 million in the third quarter  a double digit increase to last year led by a 30  organic increase on Instagram Let me touch on some of the highlights from our holiday campaigns this quarter  First  we launched a fully integrated holiday campaign across social media  television  our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments  which we called Every Moment is a Gift  Among the exciting activations online  we drove strong engagement through our Snapchat holiday shopping filter and our first ever global digital game  The Holiday Run  where our iconic Polo bear dash through the streets of New York City  Paris  London and Tokyo to collect festive bobbles and signature Ralph Lauren products We also launched a digitally targeted campaign for our Lauren women s ready to wear business in North America this season  Featuring supermodel and mom  Lily Aldridge along with her family  it was the first dedicated campaign for the brand in many years that had significant media support behind it  We were encouraged by the early consumer response as we work to get the Lauren women s business back on a positive trajectory On our North American mobile app  we drove a successful 7 Days  7 Drops program  featuring limited edition releases and one of the kind experiences  A highlight of the week was our 5 Horseman Rugby shirt  which sold out in just 15 minutes online  And congratulations to Ralph Lauren Golf Ambassador  Justin Thomas  he captured his 12th career win at the Century Tournament of Champions last month  wearing RLX to capture the number one spot in the FedEx Cup standings Moving on to our second key initiative  energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories  In the third quarter  Ralph and our design team drove excitement in core product categories  while also expanding into our five high potential underdeveloped categories  While we were pleased with the overall performance of these categories  our outerwear and fleece programs were the clear standouts this holiday  outperforming our total sales trends on both the sell in and sell out basis  Popular styles included heavyweight parkas  quilted car coats  light and midway down jackets  windbreakers and sharper styles Other successes this season included woven shirts  sweaters and denim  In addition to the holiday drops in our mobile app  we released our limited edition Polo Sports Outdoors collection in November  The products retailed on our own digital commerce sites  North America app and select flagship stores around the world  We also partnered with influential specialty retailers including Bodega  Fred Segal  Essence  Browns in the U K  and Beams in Asia  Other exciting projects this quarter included an exclusive holiday capsule with Zalando  the Polo Sport collaboration with Musinsa  one of the largest fashion online retailers in Korea and the WeChat mini program for Singles Day in China Moving on to our third key initiative  drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels  Our long term expansion strategy remains focused on building a cohesive  elevated Ralph Lauren experience across our retail  wholesale and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world  During the third quarter  we opened 48 new owned and operated stores and concessions globally and closed 31 locations  This included 37 openings in Asia  We also continue to invest indoor refreshes across our own stores and wholesale partners in key markets  as we work to elevate our fleet across every touch point Our city by city ecosystem approach drove strong results in the quarter  with Chinese Mainland sales up more than 30  in constant currency  driven by comp growth and new stores  Total China sales were up 6  to last year in constant currency despite headwinds in Hong Kong that we discussed last quarter  In Europe  we opened six owned and partnered full price stores  including Polo boutiques in Covent Garden  in London  Torino  Aix en Provence and Lisbon  We re making good progress  but we still have significant expansion opportunities with only 46 full price stores across Europe  with all of this complemented by our successful expansion into new specialty wholesale accounts and digital commerce growth Which brings me to our fourth key initiative  lead with digital  Our global digital ecosystem including our directly operated flagship sites  departmentstore com  pure players and social commerce increased low double digits in the third quarter in constant currency  The strong performance exceeded our expectations across all three regions  This was driven by double digit growth in Europe and Asia  with North America up high single digits  improving from flat performance in the first half Starting with Europe  digital sales were up high teens in the quarter  with solid performance across both owned and wholesale digital accounts  led by digital pure play retailers  We added six new partners  including LuisaViaRoma in Italy  SockShop in the U K  and Brown Hamburg  in Germany  Our directly operated digital sites in Europe also saw further momentum  delivering 15  comp growth this quarter  Highlights included the November launch of our Polo mobile app in the U K   our first app launch outside of North America and the new digital commerce flagship for Switzerland  as we expand our localization efforts by market In Asia  digital ecosystem sales were also up double digits  led by the Chinese Mainland  We launched new partnerships this quarter with Myer in Australia  as well as Tmall s luxury selected platform in China  Lastly  our digital growth in China accelerated on the launch of Buy Online Ship From Store fulfillment to leverage our store inventories  These omnichannel orders contributed to roughly half of our digital growth in the quarter Turning to North America  third quarter comps on ralphlauren com were up 6   largely in line with our expectations  We saw softness from international consumers due to FX and import restrictions in Asia  similar to the first half of the year  However  sales to domestic shoppers grew single digits as we started to drive improvements in mobile  tight personalization and rebalancing our buys to emphasize stronger selling core and seasonal core products  Lastly  we continue to build partnerships with newer digital platforms in North America  which are extending our reach to new and younger consumers In the third quarter  we launched Women s Polo on Daily Look  the premium subscription based personal styling service  and Men s Polo on Simmons  a specialty designer boutique online  We also added kids to Rent the Runway joining our Lauren  Women s Polo and Club Monaco brands on the platform Touching on our fifth key initiative  operate with discipline to show growth  In the third quarter  we focused on challenging every cost and improving our efficiencies  Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points  slightly ahead of our expectations with stronger than expected top line growth  partly offset by the planned timing of higher investments around holiday marketing and new stores One important margin driver for us and a central part of our Next Great Chapter strategy is raising AUR to elevate the brand globally and create value  We re using multiple levers to realize AUR increases  including lower discounts  elevated product mix  geographic and channel shifts and strategic ticket price increases  We began phasing in strategic ticket price increases in our North America factory outlet channel in late September  followed by our North America full price wholesale and direct to consumer doors in spring  20 Leveraging the success  we ve had implementing this strategy in Asia and Europe  these ticket increases reflect our competitive benchmarking analysis and our focus on providing a superior value proposition for our consumers  We were encouraged by the impact of these initial price increases this fall  While traffic was still a headwind for our factory business  we were able to drive positive comps in this channel through an 8  increase in AUR in the quarter  This was on top of 8  AUR growth last year and well above our expectations  Though it is still early in this journey  we are focused on elevating our brand positioning in the North American market and globally as part of our AUR led strategy And finally  I want to provide an update on our journey to further integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business  More than 50 years ago  Ralph built our company based on the idea of timelessness  creating products that are meant to be worn  loved and passed on to the next generation  This continues to inspire everything we do as we build the business to deliver value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders for the next 50 years  As part of this work  in December  we announced a new commitment to power all of our globally owned and operated offices  distribution centers and stores with 100  renewable electricity by 2025 We also took the Arctic shipping pledge  committing to reroute shipping to avoid the environmentally delicate Artic area  Driving diversity and inclusion across our business is another important piece of this work  and we are pleased to report that we have achieved our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than three years ahead of our target In closing  Ralph and I are energized by our team s execution over the important holiday quarter and we are encouraged by the progress we are making on our Next Great Chapter plan across the business  While we are mindful of the challenges across our markets globally  we are intensely focused on delivering on the commitments we have made across every aspect of our business as we look to drive long term  sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders And before I turn it over to Jane  sadly I want to note the recent passing of our long time board member and friend  Arnold Aronson  On behalf of Ralph and the entire organization  I want to express our deepest gratitude for his kindness  wisdom and service to our company over nearly two decades Now over to Jane and I ll join her at the end to answer your questions Jane Nielsen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Patrice  and good morning  everyone  Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season and our team s agility in navigating a dynamic global  geopolitical and retail environment  We delivered top line and bottom line growth and good progress across key metrics  including 6  AUR growth  double digit growth in digital commerce and growth and operating margin expansion  coupled with solid inventory control Third quarter revenues increased 1  on a reported basis and 2  in constant currency  Every region posted positive revenue growth  driven by mid single digit constant currency growth in Europe and Asia despite the ongoing headwinds in Hong Kong  as well as slight growth in North America  Excluding the impact of Hong Kong  total company top line grew 2 5  in constant currency and every region delivered positive comps as we work to elevate our brand across every consumer touch point  drive product quality  reduce promotional levels and enhance our digital presence Adjusted gross margin was up 60 basis points in the third quarter  both on a reported and constant currency basis  Gross margins benefited from AUR growth of 6  on better pricing  lower promotions and elevated product mix  along with favorable channel and geographic mix  these more than offset investments in product elevation and sustainability and diversification of our supply chain Looking ahead  we are encouraged by the early results of our fall pricing actions and expect our AUR strength to continue through the rest of the year  driving our full year expectation of low single digit AUR growth for fiscal  20  Our inventory positions for both our direct to consumer and wholesale businesses are current and well controlled coming out of this holiday season  And we remain focused on managing our inventories with discipline and leveraging our supply chain agility and responsiveness Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 14   up 10 basis points on a reported basis and in constant currency  Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 3  to last year  Adjusted operating expense increased to 48 2  of sales  up 50 basis points to last year both on a reported basis and in constant currency  Marketing was the key driver with spending up 16  in the quarter as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period versus last year s focus on our 50th anniversary show and related events in the second quarter  We still expect marketing spend to grow ahead of sales for the full year fiscal  20 as we invest behind our brands with an emphasis on digital media  Excluding marketing  our adjusted operating expense leveraged 20 basis points to last year as our teams generated operating efficiencies across our business Some key highlights from third quarter include  first  we continue to drive efficiencies across our end to end supply chain including incremental savings across facilities  labor  airfreight and consolidation of materials  all contributing to mitigate the impact of tariffs  This work is also delivering an improved experience for our consumers including faster delivery speeds on digital orders  Over the peak holiday period for example  we more than doubled our penetration of orders delivered in two days or less over the prior year  We also piloted a new fast track model in the quarter where we were able to meaningfully accelerate the development of special product concepts from design to shelf Leveraging our investments in digital product development  we designed  produced and delivered an exclusive fleece sweater to a key wholesale customer in just 16 days  right in time for Black Friday  While just one early example  we expect this model to be a growing part of our supply chain as we continue our progress toward our three  six and nine month lead time targets Moving on to segment performance  starting with North America  Revenue increased slightly in the third quarter as strong growth in our retail business more than offset wholesale revenue declines  Adjusted operating margin was 22 3   a 30 basis point decrease to last year with operating margin expansion in our retail businesses more than offset by SG A deleverage in our wholesale business on lower sales In the retail channel in North America  comps were up 4  and ahead of our expectations  driven by 4  brick and mortar comps and 6  comps on our owned digital commerce site  Brick and mortar comps were driven by an 8  increase in AUR on top of 7  growth last year  This strong growth reflects our targeted price increases and a reduction in promotions  along with an improved product offering  new marketing activations and rebalanced assortments toward stronger selling core and underpenetrated categories We also made key operational improvements such as the rollout of RFID technology across our fleet to improve out of stock replenishment sales  In addition  new staffing optimization tools in our stores drove productivity and improved service in peak periods  Our factory business led our AUR increase in North America with improved conversion  While traffic continued to be a headwind in the channel  we are focused on driving better traffic trends through enhanced digital marketing and refreshed and differentiated store experiences Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business were up 6   Our investments in mobile  personalization and site navigation drove positive growth from domestic consumers in the third quarter  Our digital business also benefited from favorable product mix toward categories like outerwear and fleece  along with a timing shift into the third quarter as we saw higher sell through in the holiday period versus clearance period in Q4  Excluding this shift  we still expect second half comps to improve incrementally compared to first half comps  Sales to international shoppers purchasing on our U S  site and shipping to U S  addresses remained soft in the third quarter and should remain a headwind through the rest of fiscal  20 Moving on to North America wholesale  third quarter revenue declined 8  in line with expectations  Excluding a decline in off price sales  our underlying North America wholesale business was also down high single digits  However  our full price sellout improved from recent trends  In the near term  we are focused on improving the consumer experience in the wholesale channel through in store refreshes  expansion into underpenetrated categories and increased marketing Our inventories in the wholesale channel are clean and down on a year over year basis  We are driving a more favorable product mix  emphasizing core categories and testing targeted brand marketing for Lauren Women s  We continue to expect it will take some time for our wholesale business to start reflecting these strategic improvements  which have shown success in our direct to consumer channels Moving on to Europe  third quarter revenue was up 3  on a reported basis and 5  in constant currency  Adjusted operating margin expanded 300 basis points  both on a reported and constant currency basis  Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins and SG A leverage  In the retail channels in Europe  comps were up 3  driven by a 15  increase in our own digital commerce sites and a 2  increase in our brick and mortar stores  The increase in our directly operated European digital commerce business was above our expectations  driven by strong AUR growth  solid merchandising execution and traffic increases  along with the shift in seasonal product sales  similar to our North America site Across our Europe direct to consumer channels  our ongoing efforts to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the third quarter  with AUR up 10  on top of an 11  increase last year  This is consistent with our long term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization in the marketplace  Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 5  in constant currency and also ahead of our expectations  Similar to Q2  the strong performance reflected solid sell out trends driving stronger reorders  particularly with our digital pure play partners Turning to Asia  revenue was up 5   on both the reported and constant currency basis in the third quarter  Excluding the impact of Hong Kong where protest related store closures and tourism declines were an ongoing headwind  Asia revenues were up 9   This solid performance was driven by several markets in Asia  led by Chinese Mainland sales growth of over 30  in constant currency  Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region  And we continue to drive our digital efforts  expand and elevate our store fleet  And engage with local influencers and celebrities Comps in Asia decreased 1   with slight AUR declines  Excluding Hong Kong  Asia comps were up 2   Store closures and traffic declines to Hong Kong remained a challenge in the third quarter  but we were able to partially mitigate some of this impact by pulling forward a friends and family event in our factory stores  We continue to expect Hong Kong to remain a near term headwind  especially with the emerging impact of the coronavirus  as Patrice mentioned  Adjusted operating margin was down 50 basis points to last year on a reported basis and down 70 basis points in constant currency  driven by SG A deleverage in Hong Kong  Excluding Hong Kong  margins were up 130 basis points in constant currency Moving on to the balance sheet  our balance sheet remained strong and we continue to return capital to our shareholders  We ended the quarter with about  1 9 billion in cash and investments and  694 million in total debt  which compares to  2 1 billion in cash and investments and  687 million in debt at the end of last year s third quarter  We repurchased  98 million in shares in the third quarter for a total of  498 million in repurchases year to date  We will continue to opportunistically buy back stock and remain on track to complete our target of about  600 million in repurchases for full fiscal  20 Moving on to inventory  at the end of the third quarter  inventory was down 1  to last year and flat in constant currency  We still expect to end the year with inventories relatively aligned to our sales outlook Now  I d like to turn to guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal  20  As a reminder  this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility from macroeconomic and geopolitical events  Specifically  our outlook still incorporates the impact of tariffs  Brexit and protest related business disruption in Hong Kong  At this early stage  our guidance does not include potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak given the dynamic nature of the situation  However  we are monitoring developments closely and will be transparent about the expected impact  providing updates if needed For full year fiscal  20  we still expect revenues to be in the range of 2  to 3  growth in constant currency  Based on a better than expected holiday  revenue should be slightly better than the low end of the range we guided to last quarter  Foreign currency is expected to have about 110 basis points to 130 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth based on currency shifts  We now expect operating margin expansion at the high end of our previous range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points in constant currency  driven primarily by gross margin expansion and slight SG A leverage  Foreign currency is estimated to have about 10 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal  20 Based on the timing of shipments  our guidance now assumes a little less than  10 million of negative tariff impact to our fiscal  20 cost of goods  We expect the majority of this impact in our fourth quarter  However  based on our supply chain diversification out of China and recent tariff reductions  we estimate tariffs will have about  12 million to  15 million of total impact in fiscal  21  We now expect our full year tax rate to be about 20  For the fourth quarter of fiscal  20  we expect revenues to be up slightly both on a constant currency and on a reported basis  Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 50 basis points in the quarter  We expect protest disruptions in Hong Kong to negatively impact our Asia comp by about five points in the quarter Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be up slightly in constant currency and on a reported basis  Similar to Q3  this is primarily due to timing of SG A investments with our highest number of new store openings weighted to the back half of the year  largely offsetting gross margin expansion in the quarter  Fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 26  above our full year expected rate based on our expectation of discrete one time items  We look forward to sharing the details of our fiscal  21 guidance when we report our fiscal year end in May In closing  we are proud of the focus  agility and passion  our teams around the world demonstrated this holiday quarter  Guided by Ralph s vision  our teams elevated our brand  delivering comp  AUR and profit growth  all while maintaining disciplined on inventories and costs  While we are navigating and watching the challenges in the broader environment closely  we are first and foremost committed to the safety of our employees  partners and consumers  We believe we have the right strategy and team to deliver across our strategic priorities and create value for the long term With that  let s open up the call for your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  The first question comes from Adrian with Barclays Capital Adrienne Yih    Barclays Capital    AnalystGood morning  and congratulations on continued progress in a very tough environment Patrice Louvet    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Adrienne  Thank you Adrienne Yih    Barclays Capital    AnalystGood morning  So Patrice  I wanted to    you gave such great color on sort of the AUR and what was driving the pricing increases  It s accelerated in the back half of the year from the first half despite the tougher compares  Obviously  you talked about where you were taking selective price increases  What have you learned about the price elasticity  particularly in North America  And does this give you confidence in your ability to continue to take pricing up over the next year or so  Thank you Patrice Louvet    President and Chief Executive OfficerGreat  Thank you for your question  Well  let me just step back a little bit to kind of give you the overall how we re thinking about this  The first thing I would say is  brand elevation is really at the core of our strategy  right  and AUR is obviously then a key component to that The second point on AUR is we have four drivers for AUR that we re working on  One is pulling back on promotional support  And actually in the last quarter  we reduced our promotional pressure  The second is leveraging product mix and you saw us invest in categories that had higher AUR like outerwear and fleece  The third is obviously leveraging geographic and channel mix  And then the final point is indeed targeted pricing Now  we ve actually started this journey of taking target pricing in the context of this broader AUR strategy in international I d say past 18 months  24 months and we ve been pleased with the results that we ve achieved there  But it s really important to understand that it isn t just pricing and isolation  it s the result of work that we ve done on elevating the brand across all the touch points  The work we ve done on inventory  on product  on brand from distribution that enables that We are at a stage now where we think the conditions are set for us to execute that in North America  So as you mentioned  we now have about a quarter under our belt in the factory outlet channel which is where we started  We re encouraged both by the way the teams have executed  they ve done a terrific job  and the consumer response across the board because we saw significant AUR growth  Now AUR growth in isolation doesn t make any    growth that needs to drive comps and we re pleased with the 4  comp growth that we achieved in North America In terms of then expanding this across the ecosystem for North America  the plan is actually to do that now  So literally as we speak  we are implementing pricing for the consumer on the floors both in our full price stores that have wholesale  leveraging the learnings that we ve picked up in our execution in factory outlets And we re at the very beginning of this journey  We were quite encouraged by what we ve seen so far  And to the point on your guidance long term relative to our expectations for AUR growth  we continue to expect AUR to grow low to mid single digits throughout the lifetime of the plan OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse  Your line is open Michael Binetti    Credit Suisse    AnalystHey  guys  Let me start with congrats on a really nice quarter and what sounds like a tough holiday Patrice Louvet    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Michael Jane Nielsen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Michael Michael Binetti    Credit Suisse    AnalystI want to ask you in North America wholesale down 8  was a bigger decline than we ve seen since maybe fourth quarter last year and you were going against a big off price correction in the fourth quarter last year  lapping a negative 10  I kind of    if I add this to some comments you just made on now starting to raise prices in wholesale  I am trying to think how you guys think about the North America wholesale numbers going forward from here  obviously the compare gets easier  you ve got some pricing  but then  due you think we are a point where we can    you can see turning a corner on North America wholesale turning positive yet at some point during the course of fiscal  21 And then I also want to ask you about how you re thinking through all the dynamics you just laid out about margins for next year  It sounds like you re happy with how the increased marketing is going  obviously  the results are there on the top line  But I m wondering how you re thinking about gross margin as well for next year  which has been a nice contributor for several years now  I mean you did say AUR should keep moving in the right place  you re happy with tickets  So I m wondering if we can    if you still think the gross margin and SG A dynamics we ve seen in the first two years  the plan should be similar next year Jane Nielsen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Michael  it s Jane  So let me answer the AUR gross margin question first and then I ll go to North America wholesale  So we re really encouraged with what we saw in North America in Q3 from a gross margin standpoint led by the AUR increases with comp growth  Those AUR increases really reflected our ability to both continue our discount reduction journey  We are starting to see a nice contribution from product mix and the elevation of products  Better assortments  better rebalancing in the core the things we ve been talking about  So early stages  but we re starting to see that in this quarter  And then the consumer response to the ticket increases were also very positive So that s what s giving me confidence in continued gross margin expansion  Obviously  we ve guided that for Q4  but I do think that the things that we ve called out as durable  reductions in promotions  targeted consumer value oriented price increases  product mix benefits  And then some tailwind benefits from geographic and channel shifts  those things are durable  And we re able to manage some of the cost inflation  And tariff impact through the work    through working those levers So I continue to remain optimistic that gross margin is a driver for us today  Obviously  we have guided to for the future  but it s also durable to the plan  Now the magnitude will have    we re pretty clear on our guidance  But I m encouraged and I think it s a strength for us  So good progress there Then if I turn to your North America wholesale question  I would tell you that again off price was down  I would say meaningfully more than our full price business  so double digit decline last year  double digit decline this year  And again  the flow of off price is related to excess flow  Our inventory is clean  And so we re really I think looking at that channel from a strategic standpoint than where it should be which is the good partners to us  They re an opportunistic way for us to liquidate excess  and that s what you re seeing come through In terms of the timing of North America wholesale covering  we know that that will take some time  right  So what is encouraging to us is that we re on the right track  strong comp growth in DTC in North America  this quarter  The underlying trend in comp is encouraging  While I still think quarter by quarter there will be some choppiness  the underlying trend is encouraging and we believe that we re taking the right actions in wholesale  as Patrice called out in terms of rebalancing assortments  focusing on sell out  which we did see improve this quarter  And we re starting some targeted marketing within the channel  that s showing some very early signs of positive trends So we re pleased with that  And we re overall pleased with our marketing investments and the way they re enabling our brand elevation and price increases  So still encourages how that will flow through on OI margin Corinna Van der Ghinst    Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question  please OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Matthew Boss with J P  Morgan Matthew Boss    J P  Morgan    AnalystGreat  Thanks  and congrats on a nice quarter Patrice Louvet    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Matt Matthew Boss    J P  Morgan    AnalystMaybe Patrice and I know this is somewhat higher level  but as we think about differentiated versus undifferentiated retail  I guess maybe what inning overall do you see the brand today in North America  So  maybe if you could touch on wholesale distribution  how you feel about your existing department store doors  maybe the number and the quality of the doors that you re in  I know Jane just touched on off price  And then at retail where you see the opportunity from a footprint perspective in terms of what you have today and the opportunity that you have going forward Patrice Louvet    President and Chief Executive OfficerJane is very happy that we re back to baseball analogies  So listen  on the differentiation front  I think we re in the very early innings in North America actually  right  So if you d ask me for a number  I d probably say two out of nine  I think we see opportunities to actually in the context of the brand elevation strategy to increase our presence in higher end wholesale where we see opportunities both in North America and actually around the world We re also in kind of the current wholesale footprint    you know we ve reduced it significantly already  right  We re down 25  from where we were about three years ago to make sure that the brand shows up in the right place  We continue to assess the locations on a very regular basis working closely with our partners  So this is also a dynamic process As far as DTC is concerned  we believe we have opportunities obviously to continue to fuel our dot com operations  which is a very important factor of the DTC part of our business  And also similar to our thinking internationally with the introduction of Polo boutiques  we believe there is an opportunity in North America to expand our DTC footprint smaller format stores  So that won t happen tomorrow morning  but as we look at kind of the next few years and where we want to take the brand and how we want to drive interactions with consumers across the country  we do believe there are opportunities to expand the footprint so that the brand is better represented in a more dispersed way across the entire country  all guided by our brand elevation strategy  right  That s really the filter that we use to decide where we should be and then how do we ensure the differentiation is very clear by channel for the consumer both online and brick and mortar  so that he or she knows exactly what to get in which location and how the brand will show up differently based on the different environments Corinna Van der Ghinst    Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISIOmar Saad    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks  I d add my congratulations  nice quarter guys  I appreciate all the information  I wanted to ask a follow up on the sales guidance  Obviously a really strong quarter and your comps accelerated  you came in above your number  You kind of kept the full year guidance the same  Are there any timing issues going on  Especially with all the AUR upticks  it feels like an easier comparison in the fiscal fourth quarter  It feels like there could be some opportunity for revenue upside there  Is there something I m missing And then  a follow up on the coronavirus and maybe it s related  We re hearing stories of double digit million population cities that are like ghost towns right now and some pretty significant comp declines  Wondering if you re seeing any meaningful impact in your business in real time  And is there anything on the supply chain side we should think about in terms of disruption there potentially  Thanks Jane Nielsen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerAll right  Why don t I unpack your question in terms of the guidance first and in terms of revenue upside  What we are seeing  and I think we called it out in the script is obviously Hong Kong will have a more meaningful impact as we head into the fourth quarter We ve seen travel bookings deteriorate from the third to the fourth quarter and this is obviously a big quarter for Hong Kong given that it was a Lunar New Year  And so we called out and we had about a three point impact to Asia comp in the third quarter that leads to about a five point impact in the fourth quarter  So that s one factor this going into that And then we called out some digital commerce that we had a very big stronger than expected digital commerce  As we look at that and underneath the covers of that in both Europe and in North America  what we saw is that we sold out stronger at full price  We had less inventory seeding clearance in the fourth quarter  That s a good quality of sales move and we re pleased with this And so you ll see some of that sitting on our digital comps in the fourth quarter as we move forward  We also have some    given the shorter holiday season  We move to fulfill demand to make sure consumers had a good service experience  And we ll have slight    we ll have some more process returns in the fourth quarter and we were less promotional at the end of the third quarter  So those are some things that are sitting in digital  So those two things are the biggest things that are guiding our fourth quarter revenue call Patrice Louvet    President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd then on the coronavirus  and obviously  it s a highly dynamic situation  right  But if we take a snapshot  today for us in China  we have about half of our fleets closed  So about    we are about 110 stores  so roughly half of that is closed as we speak today Obviously  we monitor that very closely  As far as supply chain is concerned  well first  the other thing I would say relative to our business penetration in China just for the benefit of the whole group is  while the China opportunity is a massive growth opportunity for us  to some extent  it s a blessing to be underpenetrated today because our business today    China represents less than 4  of the total company business  Now we still are very bullish about our ability to win long term in that region and very excited about what we can do there On the supply chain front  I d say same thing  Omar  very dynamic situation  We have been working as you know over the past year  two years to diversify our supply chain so that we re less dependent on one market  less dependent on China  So we have a greater ability to leverage a footprint that s much broader and much more flexible We re in the middle of the Lunar New Year vacation  We ll need to see and which has been extended by week  We ll need to see how employees return to the various factories post the vacation  So we re watching it  We are working on being as agile as possible and we ll make sure we make the best of the situation that we re dealing with The priority in all of this  right  because this is a human    we can t lose sight of the human dimension of all  This obviously is to make sure that our employees are safe  our consumers are safe and that we follow very closely the guidance both from the local and the global authorities on this health crisis Corinna Van der Ghinst    Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler Erinn Murphy    Piper Sandler   Co     AnalystGreat  thanks  Good morning  Just a couple of questions for me  I guess Patrice  just on the speed to market opportunities you gave that 16 day example  Could you just talk a little bit more about where that product was produced  And as you assess the opportunity  how repeatable is this process  And then  just a follow up for Jane on the North American wholesale  Can you talk a little bit more during the quarter of what did you see with Men s Polo versus Lauren within the full price business  Thank you Patrice Louvet    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo Erinn  I m glad you took note of that example  That s actually really good  It was a pilot exercise for us  It was a sweatshirt that we developed with one of our wholesale partners  And we did execute it from ideas to delivery to the partner in 16 days We re not going to move our entire supply chain to 16 days  What s key    our lens is to understand what is the timing required to be well positioned to win in a specific category  in a specific geography  in a specific channel  So we still have kind of our nine  six  three month lead times  And then there are some projects where we want to have this ability to react in the span of days The specific project  Erinn  was sweatshirt I believe manufactured in Mainland China  And something that s replicable  which is why we shared it as an example  It s a pilot  but I think it s an indication also that our organization is becoming more agile  more aggressive in terms of how we manage time lines and also more creative  So I think you re going to continue to see from us faster lead times  but not just for the sake of lead times  also just to understand what s required to win in the marketplace Jane Nielsen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerAnd Erinn  I would just add that we remain confident in the    in achieving the goal that we laid out at Investor Day that we will get to more than 50  of our product on a six month or less lead time and we re making great progress on some of our key categories in moving almost 80  of our sport shirts on to six months or less and even working on faster track  So great progress by our supply chain in that area And then to the second part of your question  regarding what we re seeing    what we saw on Polo and the Lauren brands  We did see across the company that the Polo brand really drove our growth  And we saw    and it s specifically in North America wholesale we saw the Polo brand be stable and a driver for us The Lauren brand  we re seeing some positive signs  but they re very early based on the marketing that Patrice called out and some targeted work that we re doing with our wholesale partners that  one  makes us believe that the Lauren opportunity is an opportunity in North America wholesale that our consumer is still there and that when we assort into the right categories with the right product quality and right consumer value that the consumer will respond  And so we saw some encouraging trends there  I d say too early to call the turnaround  It will take some time  but it s an encouraging sign Corinna Van der Ghinst    Vice President of Investor RelationsOkay  Next question  please OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Alex Walvis with Goldman Sachs Alex Walvis    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGood morning  Thanks so much for taking the question Patrice Louvet    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Alex Alex Walvis    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYou commented on some pretty strong performance in the outerwear segment through the quarter which was a tough category for some others  so some good progress there  I wonder if you could share some comments on the other underdeveloped categories  And you mentioned denim was strong  Any comment on where we are in the progression for accessories  but where    wear to work and so forth Patrice Louvet    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Yeah  we were actually really encouraged by the growth on outerwear  And frankly  I m becoming even more bullish on the size of price on that part of the business as we build capabilities in house  So good momentum on outerwear Denim also performed well for us  And that actually contributed to the solid trends  On our men s business  I think the team is doing a very good job in terms of understanding the customer we want to serve  developing product that resonates and then finding a way to communicate and execute it in store in a way that really connects with the consumer We re making good progress on wear to work  Probably the key thing to highlight here is the way we are complementing our line on particularly on Polo Women s  And some of the work that s also under way on Lauren to really make sure that we have the right offering to meet that kind of wear to work consumer need  so good progress there And if you remember  this is an oversimplified  But we really want to shift to being a kind of seven day brand solution as opposed to maybe two or three days a week  both for men and women  So I m encouraged by the progress we re making there As far as footwear and accessories  so we had talked about the fact at Investor Day that footwear and accessories progress and impact would be more back loaded in the five year program  which is why you re seeing further acceleration on outerwear and denim first  But we are making good progress on footwear and accessories Job one for us is really building capability  working with Ralph and having the right design talent both on bags and on shoes  We brought some extraordinary talent from key players in this space that have joined us over the past year  year and a half  So  that we make sure we ve got people that really understand fundamentally  how these categories work And then  now working on bringing these products to life in the market  these things take a bit of time  So I expect the impact to be most visible in the outer years of the plan  But we re starting to see some encouraging signs on different parts of the portfolio that give us confidence that we re making the right progress and that we will see the benefits that we expect from those two categories  as well Corinna Van der Ghinst    Vice President of Investor RelationsLast question please  Angela OperatorThank you  Our final question comes from Rick Patel with Needham   Company Rick Patel    Needham   Co     AnalystGood morning  guys  Thanks for squeezing me  and I ll add my congrats as well  I was hoping you could provide some more color on Europe wholesale  You reported some nice growth there despite the negative impact of some timing shifts  Is there anything to call out aside from digital wholesale accounts  And how sustainable is this growth as we think about the run rate for this segment Jane Nielsen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerI think we re encouraged  We ve been consistently calling out our Europe wholesale underlying trend as being in the range of what we called out for the long term sort of in that low to mid single digit growth  Obviously  our pure play partners are leading that growth  But we re also encouraged with what we re seeing in our core bricks    more traditional bricks and mortar partners in terms of their trajectory both on a comp basis So store    same store sales growth within those areas and some distribution expansion that we re seeing on a more regional basis with partners that we ve had from a number of years  so that s very encouraging to us  I think we see this as durable growth  And we re encouraged by the progress that we re making  and where the brand sits within the wholesale European ecosystem  I think it s elevated  The pricing is accretive to our overall portfolio  And our inventories are in good shape there  So  we re very pleased with the progress in that business Patrice Louvet    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood  So thank you everyone for joining us today  We look forward to sharing our fiscal year end results and fiscal year  21 guidance with you on our next call in early May  Between now and then  have a great time

116497,338012,RL,Global brands urge Cambodia to reform labor amid EU sanction threat,news,"By Prak Chan Thul
PHNOM PENH  Reuters    Global clothing and shoe brands  including Adidas  DE ADSGN   PUMA and Levi Strauss  NYSE LEVI  have written again to Cambodia s longtime leader saying the country s record on labor and human rights threatens to bring down sanctions on its crucial garment industry 
The letter urges the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen to amend a trade union law  repeal the law on non governmental organizations  NGOs  and drop all outstanding criminal charges against union leaders 
 The credibility of Cambodia s apparel  footwear  and travel goods sectors are at stake   said the letter  seen by Reuters 
 We are concerned that the labor and human rights situation in Cambodia is risking the loss of trade preferences for Cambodia   they added 
Government spokesman Phay Siphan did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment on Friday 
Labour Ministry spokesman Heng Sour said he had not seen the letter but said it  might contain the same out of date concerns that we have already addressed according to the Cambodian law and legal process  
The European Union will decide next month whether or not to strip Cambodia of its  Everything but Arms  EBA   initiative after a European Commission report found that Hun Sen s government has cracked down on the opposition  civil society groups and the media 
The European Union accounts for nearly half of Cambodia s exports  the country s largest industry  which employs about 700 000 people and accounts for 40 percent of gross domestic product 
The letter  sent to Hun Sen on Wednesday  represents major apparel and footwear companies  including Adidas  Levis Strauss  New Balance  Puma  Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL   Under Armour  VF Corporation  NYSE VFC  and American Apparel   Footwear Association

116541,338056,RL,StockBeat   Levis Slides as Goldman Warns of Unfashionable Performance Ahead,news,"Investing com   Levi Strauss led the slump in apparel stocks Tuesday after Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  signaled it was time to move out of apparel brands who rely on department stores to flog their branded merchandise amid fears that increasingly unfashionable performances await in the second half of the year  
Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on Levi Strauss  Ralph Lauren and PVH  parent company of brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger  to sell from neutral  triggering selling across the sector  
Levi Strauss  NYSE LEVI  fell 5 6   Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  4 5  and PVH  NYSE PVH  3 5   
The bank warned that several multibrand retailers were laden with more merchandise than they re able to sell amid overly optimistic expectations for spring demand and a tough first half  
 The combination of persistently tough first half retail trends and an optimistic spring ordering season has driven inventory overhangs at several multibrand retailers   the Goldman note said  
The dour second half outlook comes ahead of the key back to school shopping season  with the investment bank warning of increased pressure on brands that shift high volumes of their clothes through department stores   
 These retailers are thus tightening up ordering as we head into the critical back to school and holiday season  We thus see incremental sell in risk for apparel brands  particularly those with high exposure to department stores   
The bank zoned in on the woes facing the trio of downgraded apparel stocks   
Citing Levis  weaker first quarter  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  said the apparel retailer s first quarter results show it isn t impervious to the sluggish retail backdrop that has weighed on it s peers margin growth 
At Ralph Lauren  same store sales are  languishing  amid headwinds in the wholesale market  the bank said  
PVH  meanwhile  is behind the curve when it comes to investment in direct to consumer sales channels  so will likely come under pressure as outlets remain an important sales channel  
But not all apparel brands are to face the same second half fate  Goldman said  as brands that have been investing in building strong direct to consumer omnichannel commerce such as   Nike    NYSE NKE  are likely to be more insulated  
 We take a more cautious view on nonathletic apparel brands whose direct to consumer businesses are skewed towards outlet stores  particularly given challenged traffic trends in these locations   Goldman said ",2019-07-17,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/stockbeat--levis-slides-as-goldman-warns-of-unfashionable-performance-ahead-1926401,1926401

116576,338091,RL,Stocks   Dow Bounces Triple Digits After Trade Related Selloff,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks bounced higher Tuesday  a day after a steep selloff triggered by an escalation in trade tensions between the U S  and China 
The Dow Jones jumped 117 points  or 0 5   to 25 441 89 points by 9 43 AM ET  13 43 GMT   while the S P 500 gained 16 points  or 0 6   2 827 76 points and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite traded up 54 points  or 0 7   at 7 700 57 points 
The gains came after a broad based selloff on Wall Street Monday that saw the Nasdaq post its largest percentage drop this year and the worst performance in the Dow and S P 500 since Jan  3 
Investor sentiment was soothed somewhat after U S  President Donald Trump said he plans to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the meeting of G20 leaders next month 
 That ll be  I think  probably a very fruitful meeting   he said 
Trump also predicted that the outcome of trade talks would come  in about three or four weeks  
But the escalation has substantially changed the outlook for the stock market  some analysts say 
 If Trump is serious and slaps 25  tariffs on all imports from China  profits  at S P 500 companies  could fall by between 20  and 30    warned Deutsche Bank strategist Ulrich Stephan 
The Chinese government also said on Tuesday that both sides would continue to talk  fueling hopes that the recent escalation in tensions could be reversed 
Beijing announced Monday that it would place tariffs on about  60 billion in U S  imports in retaliation for American tariff increases on its products Trump insisted via Twitter that  China wanted to make a deal  and took the opportunity to take another shot at the Federal Reserve 



 China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates  as always  in order to make up for the business they are  and will be  losing  If the Federal Reserve ever did a  match   it would be game over  we win   he tweeted 
Investors will look for signs to see if policymakers have shifted their expectations to stay on hold throughout the year  Fed officials Esther George and Mary Daly are scheduled for appearances later in the session and could give indications on whether the Fed would act to pre empt any economic slowdown caused by the recent escalation of the trade dispute 
Earlier Tuesday  New York Fed President John Williams said slow recoveries from recessions and low inflation are here to stay unless policymakers can get a better grip on how to stabilize the global economy in an era of lower interest rates

116580,338095,RL,Ralph Lauren  RL  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Ralph Lauren  RL  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This upscale clothing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 43 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 71 billion  down 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 69  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ralph Lauren 
For Ralph Lauren  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 08  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ralph Lauren will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ralph Lauren would post earnings of  2 39 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 55  delivering a surprise of  6 69  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ralph Lauren doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ralph-lauren-rl-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200502303,200502303

116596,338111,RL,Opening Bell  Risk Appetite Comes Roaring Back  Oil Rebounds  Gold  Yen Dip,opinion,"Additional Chinese stimulus  strong U S  data spur investors
China shares rebound after yesterday s market plunge
Oil entered a bear market yesterday after it completed a 21  decline from its  63 27 high
Key Events
U S  index futures and European stocks followed Asian indices higher this morning as risk appetite vigorously returned to markets  Contracts for the S P 500  Dow Jones and NASDAQ are seeing robust gains on Tuesday  in the aftermath of a rebound in Chinese stocks which  on Monday  experienced their worst selloff since 2015 
Haven assets  including Treasurys  gold and the yen dropped  The dollar strengthened 
Global Financial Affairs
This morning  global investors were looking to buy  and they were hungry  However  it s not clear if this is a dead cat bounce when the market falls so fast that a rebound is inevitable given such market mechanics as portfolio repositioning and preset algorithmic trading  or whether  in fact  what s going on right now is institutional dip buying after panic selling by the crowd making it meaningful to the trend 
It s too early to tell  though  since prices are at an intersection  meaning they can go either way 
Nonetheless  for a second day  U S  futures rebounded  as the spreading coronavirus was overshadowed by additional efforts from China to pump more stimulus into stabilzing the country s economy  
S P 500 futures jumped back into a rising flag today  whose upside breakdown signals a resumption of the previous downturn 

Note that the flag s body is right on the uptrend line since the October low  underscoring how crucial this price level and the next move could be for the trend 
Chemicals and mining firms led the STOXX Europe 600 Index   BP   LON BP  surged  gaining 4   after management raised its dividend payout by 2 4   which helped the global energy major buck the current oil market selloff 

From a technical perspective  the advance  however impressive  is nothing more than an upward correction within an obvious downtrend 
Asian markets were all green  All major exchanges  except for New Zealand s Dow Jones    0 39    rallied  South Korea s KOSPI outperformed    1 84    After yesterday s record breaking  720 billion wipeout  China s Shanghai Composite rebounded    1 34   
On Monday  during the Wall Street session  equities came back from their worst weekly performance in six months  on news of global efforts to contain the epidemic s spread  Also helping the mood  better than expected U S  manufacturing data  Tech shares outperformed while Industrial and Energy sector shares lagged 
Today s durable goods release will be eyed to see if the economic news continues to signal growth  As well  corporate results from Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and Clorox  NYSE CLX  are on the docket before the market open 
Treasurys dropped in favor of equities 

The yield on the 10 year Treasury note jumped at the top of the session  to finish slightly above yesterday s intraday highs  While the RSI suggests there is plenty of room for an upward move  bouncing off the support of the broken downtrend line since the November 2018 high  rates have a long way to go in order to return back above the violated uptrend line since the August bottom  or to at least form two rising peaks and troughs  The 50 DMA is falling away from the 200 DMA 
Despite the sovereign bond selloff  the dollar advanced for a second day  although it s now off its highs 

The Australian dollar rebounded from the lowest levels since March 2009  after the country s central bank held rates steady while underscoring the influence of previous cuts  saying it s too early to know what effect the deadly virus will have on the Aussie and global economies  If the AUD falls below the 0 6670 level  it would target the 0 6000 level 
Fears the coronavirus would smother energy demand as the global economy shrinks  yesterday pushed oil below the crucial  50 level  thereby completing a 21  reversal from the January high  putting the commodity in a bear market 

Currently  WTI is back above  51  fighting to stay above water  Tthe  50 support level will soon meet with the uptrend line since the February 2016 bottom of  26 05

116610,338125,RL,3 Things Under the Radar This Week,news,"Investing com   Here s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week 
1  Jury Still out on China Rebound 
The latest China Beige Book report suggests there s plenty of fight left in Beijing s economy as growth rebounded in the first quarter  But it s not the good kind of growth  raising fears the world s second largest economy will resume its drift lower in the months to come 
China mounted  an unmistakable first quarter recovery   driven by a credit binge  according to China Beige Book  CBB   a quarterly review of the economy based on a survey of more than 3 300 Chinese businesses 
Beijing appears willing to sacrifice its pledge to wean itself off government credit in a bid to stop its economic stall 
China s addiction to credit has been well documented over the years  but Leland Miller  president of China Beige Book  said Beijing s latest credit binge was coupled with an increase  rather than a decrease  in borrowing costs  casting doubt on the sustainability of the rebound 
The report also noted that corporate borrowing reached the highest point since the middle of 2013  with each sector and region of China reporting a rise in credit costs for the quarter compared with the prior one 
China s Premier Li Keqiang also talked up the rebound in economic growth earlier this week  saying that changes in the Chinese economy exceeded expectations in March 
 Fixed asset investment has rebounded steadily  consumer confidence index  manufacturing new orders index went up significantly  and capital market transactions were active   Li said 
Still  there are many who question the accuracy of China s data 
China s statistics bureau has attempted to reassure market participants that it has no need to artificially inflate data as the government wants quality growth  not rapid expansion 
When asked if he believed the numbers coming out of China  former Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  CEO Lloyd Blankfein famously once said   Do I believe the numbers  I believe there are numbers  
But given the importance of China  which accounts for about a third of global growth  market participants appear willing to give the numbers the benefit of the doubt 
 There are signs that China is now pursuing policies that should allow economic growth to stabilize  but we expect only stabilization rather than a large stimulus given low unemployment  record high leverage and a lack of term limits for President Xi    Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  said in a note to clients 
2  Playing Polo Pays Off
There were a lot retail stories in the market this week  from Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  soaring after being challenged for board seats by an activist investor to  Lululemon Athletica   NASDAQ LULU  hitting all time highs on quarterly results 
What some may have missed is Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL   which not only got a big vote of confidence  but has become one of the darling stocks of the year 
On Wednesday   Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  upgraded the fashion company s stock to outperform from market perform  with a price target of  150 
Wells Fargo analyst Ike Bochurow said the maker of the iconic Polo clothing can expect China  Europe and global e commerce to drive top line growth  which will improve valuation 
The stock is a  rare standout  in apparel  Bochurow said 
That endorsement on valuation looks especially strong considering shares of Ralph Lauren  rather stealthily  have risen more than 25  year to date 
That s nearly twice the performance of the S P 500  up about 13   its best quarter since the third quarter of 2009 when it rose nearly 15  
Ralph Lauren also beat the gains of the SPDR S P Retail ETF  NYSE XRT   which is up less than 10  
3  The Present Isn t Looking as Good
Things ain t what they used to be  In fact  things right now look a lot worse than they did just a month ago 
That s the general consensus of consumers surveyed this week by the Conference Board 
The headline of the Conference Board s monthly report is its consumer confidence index  which fell unexpectedly in its latest measure issued Tuesday   But it provides a host of other measures  including the present situation index 
In March  posted the biggest drop since Lehman Bros  collapsed in 2008 
The index  which is based on consumers  assessments of current business and labor market conditions  sank 12 2 points  to 160 6 this month from 172 8 in February 
The present situation index was 61 1 for September 2008  Lehman filed for bankruptcy on Sept  15  By October  the present situation index had tumbled 17 6 to 43 5 
The good news for bulls is that the main consumer confidence index stands about 100 points higher than its recent nadir hit shortly after Lehman s collapse

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Ralph Lauren shares have lost about 2 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 22 7  
What s Next for Ralph Lauren 
While Ralph Lauren has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

116635,338150,RL,Should Value Investors Pick Ralph Lauren  RL  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put  Ralph Lauren Corporation   NYSE RL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Ralph Lauren has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 35  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 08  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level Ralph Lauren puts current PE ratio below its midpoint  which is 16  over the past five years  Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 24 39  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Ralph Lauren has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 39  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  the stock has a P S ratio of about 1 45  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 47 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Ralph Lauren currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes RL a solid choice for value investors and some of its other metrics make it clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Ralph Lauren is just 1 84  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 98  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Ralph Lauren might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C  This gives RL a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while current year estimate has seen three upward and two downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up 0 8  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has nudged up 0 4  in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below  Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite having a bullish trend  RL sports a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   This indicates that analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future  Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRalph Lauren is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  Top 34  out of more than 250 industries   the company deserves attention right now  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to Double Each was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020

116686,338201,RL,Why Ralph Lauren  RL  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Ralph Lauren  RL   which belongs to the Zacks Textile   Apparel industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this upscale clothing company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 10 84   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Ralph Lauren was expected to post earnings of  1 66 per share  but it reported  1 77 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 63   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 93 per share  while it actually produced  1 07 per share  a surprise of 15 05  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Ralph Lauren lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Ralph Lauren has an Earnings ESP of  0 67  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on November 7  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-ralph-lauren-rl-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200478590,200478590

116709,338224,RL,Should Value Investors Choose Ralph Lauren  RL  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Ralph Lauren Corporation   NYSE RL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Ralph Lauren has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 81  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 22  If we focus on the long  term PE trend  Ralph Lauren  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16 72 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  However  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 82  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Ralph Lauren has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 83  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Ralph Lauren  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Ralph Lauren has a P S ratio of about 1 44  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Ralph Lauren currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Ralph Lauren a solid choice for value investors For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 21  which is better than the industry average of 10 61  Clearly  RL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Ralph Lauren might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of B  This gives RL a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three upward revisions compared to none downward in the past sixty days  whereas the current year estimates have seen four upward revisions compared to two downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate increased 5 03  in the past two months  whereas the current year estimate rose 0 79   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and Consensus   Even though Ralph Lauren has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRalph Lauren is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 28  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but

116710,338225,RL,Ralph Lauren Hurt By Weak North America Unit  Can It Recover ,opinion,"Shares of Ralph Lauren Corporation   NYSE RL   have declined 13 4  in the past three months against the  s growth of 1 5   The stock s dismal run on the bourses is attributable to the sluggish North America business and adverse currency rates 
These factors weighed on the company s fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results  Notably  it has been witnessing weak traffic and soft performance at both retail and wholesale channels  

 
Revenues at the North America segment fell 7  in the fiscal fourth quarter  with a comparable store sales  comps  decline of 4  owing to a 7  decrease in brick and mortar stores  offset by a 6  rise in digital commerce  Further  wholesale revenues dropped 10  year over year due to soft select spring fashion concepts and fall in off price sales 
This apart  currency headwinds hurt revenues by nearly 270 basis points  bps  in the fiscal fourth quarter  This is likely to persist in fiscal 2020  
The company estimates foreign currency to negatively impact revenue growth by 90 100 bps and operating margin expansion by 10 20 bps in fiscal 2020  For first quarter fiscal 2020  currency headwinds are expected to mar revenue growth by approximately 190 200 bps and operating margin by 10 bps 
However  we are encouraged by this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s initiatives that may cushion the stock in the long run  Let s get a glimpse of these initiatives 
Efforts to Counter Hurdles
Despite the afore mentioned hurdles  management is leaving no stone unturned to improve its growth prospects  In this regard  Ralph Lauren s  Next Great Chapter  plan  announced in June 2018  is delivering robust results  The plan focuses on delivering sustainable long term growth and value creation 
The company expects to execute this growth plan through five strategic priorities   winning over a new generation of customers  energizing core products and accelerating underdeveloped categories  driving targeted expansion in its regions and channels  leading with digital  and operating with discipline to fuel growth  Backed by such well chalked plans  the company was ahead of its commitments regarding revenues  quality of sales  operating income and earnings per share in fiscal 2019

116729,338244,RL,RL Or VFC  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Textile   Apparel stocks have likely encountered both Ralph Lauren  RL  and V F   VFC   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Ralph Lauren and V F  are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
RL currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 82  while VFC has a forward P E of 21 51  We also note that RL has a PEG ratio of 1 44  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  VFC currently has a PEG ratio of 1 89 
Another notable valuation metric for RL is its P B ratio of 2 74  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  VFC has a P B of 8 40 
Based on these metrics and many more  RL holds a Value grade of A  while VFC has a Value grade of C 
Both RL and VFC are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that RL is the superior value option right now ",2019-05-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rl-or-vfc-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200422613,200422613
116730,338245,RL,Ralph Lauren Stock Plummets,opinion,"As much as I love everything about Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL   one item I will not buy now is this stock  Although it saw a bright start to the year  this came to shuddering halt in the last few weeks with the price fell from a high of  133 63 to the current trade of  108 02 at the time of writing 
From a technical perspective the volume point of control as denoted by the yellow dashed line was a key contributor to the congestion which followed the rally off the lows of last year  with the heavy concentration of volume around this fulcrum of price revealing its own story  with dense volume continuing higher up towards the  140 per share price point  In addition  the price resistance detailed at  132 per share and denoted with the red dashed line on the accumulation and distribution indicator  also came into play  and the combination of volume and price based resistance was sufficient to cap further advances  The initial move lower started in early May  and an injection of volume two weeks ago on the widespread down candle confirming the heavy selling pressure now in place 
Last week s candle also signaled further bearish price action to follow with the weak effort to rise on high volume denoted by the deep wick to the upper body  These candles are typical in price waterfalls as the market makers sell into a weak market stock they have been forced to absorb in the move lower  which results in a temporary pause as new buyers rush in hunting for bargains believing the market is about to reverse  only to be trapped in weak positions as the market makers then sell out  and the stock moves lower once more 
So where next for one of my favorite retailers  The good news is a potential platform of support awaits just below  105 per share  but should this be breached  then expect to see a return to double figures in the longer term  and possibly a move towards  95 per share where further potential support awaits  This was the level that provided a platform for the rally early in the year  so perhaps a repeat is on the cards  Note also the Quantum Trend Monitor is also in transition and moving from bullish into bearish and confirming the current negative picture 
And failing that  I can always come to its aid with some serious retail therapy ",2019-05-29,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/i-love-ralph-lauren-but-not-the-stock-at-the-moment-200425851,200425851
116731,338246,RL,Lululemon  LULU  Reports After Close  Can They Exceed Agressive Expectations ,opinion,"Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU   is reporting Q1 earnings after market close today and traders are preparing for a big move  Over the past 4 quarter  LULU has moved double digit percentages on earnings reports  keeping investors and traders on their toes 
LULU is expected to report an EPS of  0 71 along with revenues of  757 million  illustrating a 29  year over year  YoY  increase in EPS and a 16 5  growth on the top line  Lululemon has beaten top line estimates every quarter since 2016 and only missed on 1 EPS estimate by less than a percent  but keep in mind that this miss led to an over 20  drop in stock price 
Company Overview
LULU is a diamond in the retail rough  propelling ostensibly unending growth  Lulu is a lifestyle brand that has rooted itself into the millennial culture  something other retailers have only dreamed  Lululemon has become synonymous with active and healthy living  which appears to be the basis of the shifting consumer s focus     
The brand started as a yoga studio in Vancouver at the end of the 90s and is now a multinational corporation operating 440 stores in 14 different countries  They operate an omni channel business to meet the new generation s consumption patterns  with over 25  of their revenue being driven by direct to consumer sales  aka e commerce  
E commerce sales grew 45  from last year and are expected to continue this prolific trend as more and more retail revenue is being driven by our increasingly online lifestyles  This is good news for a retailer like this if a customer doesn t have to leave their home to consume it takes a lot fewer steps for Lululemon to capture a spontaneous purchase 
Performance
LULU  blue  has been outperforming the market  green  and the industry  red   demonstrating over 350  growth over the past 5 years and 40  since just the start of 2019  more than doubling any other benchmark  Below you can see LULU s year to date performance compared with its top peers  Ralph Lauren   NYSE RL    Canada Goose   NYSE GOOS    and Gap   NYSE GPS   
LULU has been a Zacks Rank  1 2  Strong Buy   Buy  for 11 out of the past 12 months  as sell side analysts perpetually push EPS estimates north 
Take Away
Lululemon continues to impress investors and analysts alike driving expectations up aggressively  The firm is expected to have robust double digit growth figures for both the top and bottom lines over the next 3 years  even with our economic cycle expecting to come to an end  I believe that analysts are looking for a beat on both metrics this evening as well as strong forward guidance 
Some key points to look out for are same store sales growth as well as a solid increase in e commerce driven revenue  New store openings and anticipated openings are going to be signal that the business is expecting its steady expansion to continue

116783,338298,RL,Is Ralph Lauren  RL  Outperforming Other Consumer Discretionary Stocks This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Consumer Discretionary space have likely heard of Ralph Lauren  RL   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  Let s take a closer look at the stock s year to date performance to find out 
Ralph Lauren is one of 244 companies in the Consumer Discretionary group  The Consumer Discretionary group currently sits at  3 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups 
The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months  RL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for RL s full year earnings has moved 3 82  higher  This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock s earnings outlook is improving 
According to our latest data  RL has moved about 27 48  on a year to date basis  Meanwhile  the Consumer Discretionary sector has returned an average of 21 85  on a year to date basis  As we can see  Ralph Lauren is performing better than its sector in the calendar year 
Looking more specifically  RL belongs to the Textile   Apparel industry  which includes 21 individual stocks and currently sits at  108 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 30 30  so far this year  so RL is slightly underperforming its industry in this area 
Investors in the Consumer Discretionary sector will want to keep a close eye on RL as it attempts to continue its solid performance ",2019-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-ralph-lauren-rl-outperforming-other-consumer-discretionary-stocks-this-year-200416598,200416598
116791,338306,RL,Ralph Lauren  RL  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Ralph Lauren  RL  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 14  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This upscale clothing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 93 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 47 billion  down 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ralph Lauren 
For Ralph Lauren  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ralph Lauren will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ralph Lauren would post earnings of  2 15 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 32  delivering a surprise of  7 91  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ralph Lauren doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ralph-lauren-rl-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200418093,200418093
116792,338307,RL,Domestic violence rife amid Cambodia land conflicts  rights group,news,By Chris Arsenault KOH KONG  Cambodia  Thomson Reuters Foundation    Facing eviction from the five hectare rice plot he had been farming for years and worried about how he would feed his three kids  Ngeth Sim did something he will always regret    I beat up my wife after we lost our land   said Sim  42  wearing a knock off Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  cardigan and plastic sandals on calloused feet   After their land was taken  the family had no money to send their children to school   We couldn t buy food   he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview in the farming region of Koh Kong  160 km  100 miles  west of the capital  Phnom Penh    I used domestic violence even though I know it s against the law   he said  as his young daughter slept in his lap   Domestic violence is plaguing Cambodian communities beset by land conflicts linked to a mix of unclear ownership deeds  booming urban construction and large scale agricultural investment  according to a report by the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights  CCHR   echoing findings of an earlier U S  study   A recent survey by the CCHR found that about a quarter of the 612 Cambodian women it interviewed said they had been victims of domestic abuse  More than half of these women had not experienced domestic abuse before their families had faced eviction or had become involved in land disputes  according to the survey  carried out across 12 provinces of the southeast Asian nation   Women  in Cambodia  are generally expected to fulfill traditional roles  which involve duties that can only be performed where there is security of tenure  such as providing shelter and food for the family   said the report  CHALLENGING TRADITION Between 2000 and 2014  about 770 000 Cambodians   more than six percent of the population   were affected by land conflicts  according to charges presented by human rights lawyers at the International Criminal Court  ICC  in the Hague   Cambodia s government disputes those statistics  but agrees that land conflicts have been a problem  Officials said land disputes have been falling as the government steps up titling initiatives  dispute resolution systems and enforcement against companies that break the rules   This decline comes amid a significant drop in poverty  fueled by economic growth rates of seven percent  largely due to a boom in agriculture and construction  officials said   Today  less than 20 percent of Cambodians are living below the national poverty line  down from more than half in 2004  according the World Bank  although the average annual income is still less than  1 100  The Ministry of Women s Affairs said domestic violence in the country of 15 million people has reduced over the past five years    Women have been changing their mindset  they no longer accept domestic violence as tradition   Sar Sineth  a senior official at the Ministry of Women s Affairs  told the Thomson Reuters Foundation    The ministry has taken action by providing training to police and the community  bringing awareness to make them understand about gender violence   she said  The government does not keep specific statistics on women and land conflicts  Sineth said  adding that the ministry  helps all women  including the ones with land disputes    TROUBLE FOR ACTIVISTS But women involved in land conflicts are still living with the fear and stress of their situation  they say  Phao Nheung  a 40 year old farmer  has been under threat of eviction from her house in Koh Kong province since 2009  when a sugar plantation took an interest in her land  Nheung said the struggle has put immense pressure on her family and destroyed her marriage   My husband said   Just leave the land  it will be easier   But I wouldn t leave   Nheung told the Thomson Reuters Foundation   Then he left me   Female land rights activists in Cambodia s cities say they have faced similar problems   Sy Heap  68  lived in Boeung Kak Lake  an area in downtown Phnom Penh  where about 3 500 families waged a drawn out battle over compensation with a real estate developer who took control of the land in 2007    I lost everything  my house and my business   Heap told the Thomson Reuters Foundation  sitting across from a large construction site where luxury apartments are being built   Heap and other women are still demanding that 20 families who rejected a compensation package presented by authorities  receive land titles from the government   The pressure of protesting led to her divorce  said Heap  adding that her daughter is in prison for organizing protests    CONSTANT FEAR   Women are disproportionately impacted by evictions   Jayson Richardson  a professor at San Diego State University in the United States  told the Thomson Reuters Foundation    Drug use and domestic violence are huge  following displacement  as a result of stress   said Richardson who has studied the link between gender and land conflicts in Cambodia   Some women live in  constant fear that the government is going to pull the property out from under them   leading to psychological problems  he said   Nearly half of women surveyed by the CCHR report on land conflicts and domestic violence said they had contemplated suicide  while 18 percent of the women had attempted it   Since being evicted from what he said was his land in 2006  Ngeth Sim and his family have worked as casual laborers on other farms   He hasn t hit his wife since the village council got involved in their dispute following their eviction  he said  but their uncertain future still puts pressure on the family   Now we sell our labor but the money isn t not enough  This is why  my wife

With first quarter earnings in full swing  market sentiment is largely influenced by corporate results and guidance  Though earnings are a good enough indicator of a stock s future performance  identifying future growth drivers is not always an easy task 
A company s better than expected earnings may not always translate into a solid price appreciation for its stock due to some reasons that are not easy to identify  Therefore  it is wise to depend on expert advice  One way to do this is to follow broker recommendations 
Brokers have a better understanding of stocks  deeper industry knowledge and a grasp over the economy at large  They scrutinize the company s fundamentals and place them against the current economic backdrop to find out how the stock will fare as an investment option 
Brokers go through the company s publicly available documents  attend conference calls and are in direct communication with the top management  At times  to get more insight into the company s products and services offered  they even communicate with customers 
After an in depth research  brokers decide to rate the stock  So  when an analyst upgrades a stock  one can easily rely on it 
Still solely depending on analyst recommendations is not the right way to build investment portfolio  One must also take into consideration certain other factors to ensure solid returns

116837,338352,RL,Bull Of The Day  Ralph Lauren  RL ,opinion,"Ralph Lauren  RL  shares have surged 25  this year to outpace the apparel market s roughly 16  climb and the S P 500 s 12  gains  The luxury fashion brand posted stronger than expected holiday quarter results and has seen analysts turn more bullish recently in terms of RL s bottom line expansion 
Overview   Growth Plans
Ralph Lauren has long been a powerhouse of more attainable high end fashion  unlike say Gucci or Saint Laurent  which are owned by Kering  PA PRTP  SA  PPRUY   On top of Ralph Lauren s namesake brands  the company owns Club Monaco  The brand competes against the likes of Walmart  NYSE WMT   WMT  owned Bonobos  Meanwhile  RL raised its marketing investment by 18  last quarter to help drive brand awareness and attract younger customers  who have been won over by the likes of Lululemon  LULU  and Canada Goose  GOOS  
Last summer  RL and chief executive Patrice Louvet who took over in 2017 laid out plans to drive growth  Ralph Lauren aims to  lead with digital across all activities  energize core products and accelerate under developed categories   and more  The company also projected at the time that its revenue would grow at a compounded annual growth rate in the low to mid single digits in constant currency between fiscal 2018 and 2023 
Part of Ralph Lauren s push focuses on e commerce  including social media  RL has boosted its following on quickly expanding Instagram  FB   where brands are now built and people shop directly  to over 10 million on its core page alone  These efforts helped the company post 20  digital revenue growth last quarter  RL s digital comps soared 62  in Asia and 21  in North America during Q3 fiscal 2019  which included the vital holiday shopping period  The New York based fashion giant s moves helped the company s quarterly earnings pop over 14  to  2 32 per share and top our quarterly Zacks Consensus Estimate  on the back of 5  revenue growth 
It seems that consumers and investors have been drawn to Ralph Lauren s longer term plan to drive growth  especially recently  As we mentioned at the top  shares of RL have surged over 25  this year  Despite the climb  RL stock rests roughly 12  below its 52 week highs at  129 40 per share which includes Thursday s 3 76  jump 
With that said  the chart below puts Ralph Lauren s current climb into historical context and helps investors see that shares of RL still have plenty of room to climb before they would reach their 2014 highs 
 
 
Outlook   Earnings Trends
Looking ahead  the firm s current quarter revenue is projected to slip 4 3  to hit  1 46 billion  Despite the projected top line decline  Ralph Lauren is expected to see its adjusted Q4 fiscal 2019 earnings pop 2 2  to  0 92 per share  Clearly  RL s short term outlook does not appear that impressive  but it looks poised for longer term expansion 
The company s fiscal 2019 EPS figure is projected to jump nearly 17  on the back of 1 4  revenue growth  These positive full year estimates are expected to be followed up in fiscal 2020  RL s revenue is projected to jump 2 3  above our current year estimate to reach  6 42 billion  Meanwhile  at the bottom end of the income statement  Ralph Lauren s adjusted full year earnings are expected to climb roughly 8  higher than our 2019 estimate to hit  7 60 per share 
Along with the actual bottom line projections  investors can see that analysts have become far more positive about the company s earnings outlook  In particular  Ralph Lauren has earned a significant amount of upward earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2019 and 2020  which helps highlight its longer term positivity 
Plus  the company s earnings are projected to climb by 10 3  over the next three to five years  on an annualized basis  And Ralph Lauren almost always beats quarterly earnings estimates  which includes an average positive earnings surprise of 6 9  in the trailing four periods 
 
 
Bottom Line
Ralph Lauren s positive earnings estimate revision trends help it sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  at the moment  RL boasts an overall  A  VGM score  supported by  B  grades for Value and Growth and an  A  for Momentum  The company is also a dividend payer  with a yield of 1 99   that recently announced a new quarterly payout of  0 625 per share 
Furthermore  Ralph Lauren presents solid value at the moment  trading at 16 6X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  This represents a discount compared to its industry s 20X average and falls just below the S P  More significantly  Ralph Lauren has traded as high as 22 4X during the last five years  with a 17 3X median

systems  buy online and pick up at store facility  improved e commerce sites and effective mobile apps are some of the efforts that keep companies on the dot com bandwagon  While costs associated with such investments and competition may drag margins  textile apparel players  robust cost containment endeavors are likely to offer cushion   Incidentally  players are undertaking cost saving actions

include  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc    NYSE HLT    Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF    AMETEK Inc    NYSE AME    Ralph Lauren Corp    NYSE RL   and Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc    NYSE SPR   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  4 Factors to Guide Wall Street s Course in April  5 Top PicksWall Street is on the verge of closing a blockbuster first quarter despite the perceived threat of a potential recession  All three major stock indexes   the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite   are likely to provide double digit returns in first quarter 2019  The benchmark S P 500 index is heading for its best first quarter since 1998 Will this momentum sustain in April  Although we do not have a clear cut answer at present  four important factors will determine the fate of Wall Street in coming months US China Trade ConflictThe year long tariff related problems between the United States and China has finally reached advanced stage of negotiations  On Mar 27  Reuters reported that China has made unprecedented proposals on a range of issues including protection of U S  intellectual properties to resolve trade disputes  An amicable solution between the two of the world s largest trading nations is likely to boost global economy Several industry experts have said that a US China deal is already factored in the market  Nevertheless  such deal will no doubt bolster investor confidence on risky assets like equities  However  if the negotiation process lingers even beyond April  investors are likely to get jittery resulting in volatile trading First Quarter 2019 EarningsExpectations for first quarter 2019 earnings are far from encouraging at present  Total earnings of S P 500 Index are anticipated to be down 3 7  from the same period last year on 4 8  higher revenues  Current estimates indicate first earnings decline since the second quarter of 2016  The Technology sector is likely to take the biggest hit with the semiconductor space acting as the biggest drag   Read More   However  if actual earnings results fare better than expectations  even if that stays in the negative territory  it is likely to result in Wall Street rally  It is to be noted  Technology Select Sector SPDR  XLK  has been the best performer of S P 500 for the first quarter and the second best performer in the past one month  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  SOX  jumped 17 9  year to date and 1 7  in the past one month First Quarter 2019 GDPAlthough we are yet to get consensus estimates for first quarter GDP  the general sentiment in the investor space is that the U S  economy will grow at a modest rate of around 1 5 1 7   Historically  first quarter GDP remains weak due to seasonal factors  To add to this  the United States faced partial government shutdown for a record 35 days this year However  a better than expected result will be a major boost for the market  Notably  the Atlanta Fed  which estimated first quarter GDP growth at a meager 0 3  on Mar 4  revised it to 1 3  in Mar 26 and further to 1 5  in the next day Shape of the Treasury Yield CurveOn Mar 22  yield on 3 month US Treasury Note surged ahead of 10 year US Treasury Note resulting in yield curve inversion  Concerns about global economic slowdown and Fed s extra dovish monetary stance compelled investors to opt for safe haven government bonds lifting their prices  The yield curve inversion is continuing for last seven days Although an inverted yield curve is not resulting in an immediate recession  persistence of yield inversion for a long period will result in severe market volatility Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in stocks with favorable Zacks Rank  We have been able to narrow down our search to five stocks  which have moved higher in 2019 and still hold potential provide for further upside  All five stocks currently sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see   These companies also provide regular dividends Hilton Worldwide Holdings

116840,338355,RL,Use Relative Price Strength To Land Up On 4 Winning Stocks,opinion,Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether

116884,338399,RL,Armed vigilantes in Burundi s capital expose deepening crisis,news,By Goran Tomasevic BUJUMBURA  Reuters    As darkness falls  vigilantes armed with automatic rifles emerge to patrol the streets of Bujumbura  a city plagued by killings and violence as Burundi s crisis deepens  For months  the trill of cicadas in the tropical night has been interrupted by sporadic gunfire and explosions across the capital  center of the turmoil sparked by President Pierre Nkurunziza s bid for a third term in office  Thousands initially protested against the president and opposed his re election in a disputed July vote  Now some have formed vigilante units  coming out at night in tracksuits and jeans  clutching AK 47 rifles as they patrol   If the police shoot at us  then  yes  we will fight back   the leader of one group  giving his name only as Fred  told this Reuters photographer  who followed his unit last week   All hotspot neighborhoods are protecting themselves in this manner   Residents and vigilantes in other districts confirmed this  It is the first time a foreign journalist has been allowed to follow such a group  securing images from Bujumbura that will stoke international worries about a new conflict erupting in a nation where an ethnically charged civil war ended just a decade ago after 300 000 people were killed  The region remains haunted by the 1994 genocide in next door Rwanda  in which 800 000 people  mostly members of the Tutsi minority and moderates among majority Hutus  were massacred  Western powers say it must not be repeated in Burundi  which has the same ethnic mix  More than 200 people have been killed in violence since April  although rivalries have tended to run along political rather than ethnic lines so far  Burundi s government  which dismisses suggestions of a new war  has described its armed opponents as  terrorists   while police say some  armed criminals  come out at night  In the latest violence  at least four people were killed in Bujumbura at the weekend  Protesters in one district denounced Nkurunziza s third term  although a court had ruled before his re election that he could serve five more years  Vigilante leader Fred said he and his men had taken part in anti government protests that erupted in April but they formed patrols in their area when police began to hunt them down   I can t say that this is a rebel movement  and no one is claiming that   he said  dressed in a Ralph Lauren  N RL  shirt and pulling a white baseball cap over his eyes to mask his face as he spoke to a Reuters camera  DISINTEGRATING SECURITY  Since the government has been killing people  we decided to come up with this initiative to protect ourselves   Fred said  flanked by half a dozen young men with rifles  some with balaclavas and others with improvised masks  Top government officials have been assassinated  while the bodies of opposition figures have also been found on the street  The government denies any extra judicial killings  The emergence of organized armed groups highlights disintegrating security in the capital and shows a marked change from the impromptu barricades of stones and tree trunks set up to bar access into residential districts early in the crisis  At the start the nightly sortie  dozens of young men   about 20 of them carrying guns   lined up in military style on the street  When addressed by Fred and other commanders  they pumped fists in the air in salute  Then they split up One unit paced through streets a few hundred meters from a police checkpoint  made of barbed wire strung across the road  There was no confrontation during the two hours or so while this journalist walked with them  The presidential offices lay less than 2 km away  A presidential spokesman said it was up to the police to comment on any such vigilante groups  if they existed  Asked how the government would deal with those carrying illegal arms  he said the president had been  crystal clear   Earlier this month  the president set a Nov  7 deadline for illegal arms to be handed over and said those who did not do so would be considered  enemies    It s only the police who patrol night and day   deputy police spokesman Mo se Nkurunziza told Reuters   We are aware of armed criminals who sometimes clash with the police on patrol  especially at night   Residents say armed vigilante units are now present in several areas  notably places where anti government protests erupted earlier this year  Some residents said they felt safer with the vigilantes at night than the police during the day   Not all of us are armed with firearms but those who don t have guns or grenades use machetes   said a 35 year old member of a vigilante group in another district of Bujumbura   If the situation deteriorates and nothing is done politically  the population will continue getting arms   World powers and regional states fear unrest in Burundi could escalate if left unchecked  The Security Council has asked U N  chief Ban Ki moon to prepare a report by the end of this month outlining options for boosting the U N  presence    Additional reporting and writing by Edmund Blair  editing by Giles

116888,338403,RL,4 Factors To Guide Wall Street s Course In April  5 Top Picks ,opinion,Wall Street is on the verge of closing a blockbuster first quarter despite the perceived threat of a potential recession  All three major stock indexes   the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite   are likely to provide double digit returns in first quarter 2019  The benchmark S P 500 index is heading for its best first quarter since 1998 Will this momentum sustain in April  Although we do not have a clear cut answer at present  four important factors will determine the fate of Wall Street in coming months US China Trade ConflictThe year long tariff related problems between the United States and China has finally reached advanced stage of negotiations  On Mar 27  Reuters reported that China has made unprecedented proposals on a range of issues including protection of U S  intellectual properties to resolve trade disputes  An amicable solution between the two of the world s largest trading nations is likely to boost global economy Several industry experts have said that a US China deal is already factored in the market  Nevertheless  such deal will no doubt bolster investor confidence on risky assets like equities  However  if the negotiation process lingers even beyond April  investors are likely to get jittery resulting in volatile trading First Quarter 2019 EarningsExpectations for first quarter 2019 earnings are far from encouraging at present  Total earnings of S P 500 Index are anticipated to be down 3 7  from the same period last year on 4 8  higher revenues  Current estimates indicate first earnings decline since the second quarter of 2016  The Technology sector is likely to take the biggest hit with the semiconductor space acting as the biggest drag   Read More   However  if actual earnings results fare better than expectations  even if that stays in the negative territory  it is likely to result in Wall Street rally  It is to be noted  Technology Select Sector SPDR  XLK  has been the best performer of S P 500 for the first quarter and the second best performer in the past one month  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  SOX  jumped 17 9  year to date and 1 7  in the past one month First Quarter 2019 GDPAlthough we are yet to get consensus estimates for first quarter GDP  the general sentiment in the investor space is that the U S  economy will grow at a modest rate of around 1 5 1 7   Historically  first quarter GDP remains weak due to seasonal factors  To add to this  the United States faced partial government shutdown for a record 35 days this year However  a better than expected result will be a major boost for the market  Notably  the Atlanta Fed  which estimated first quarter GDP growth at a meager 0 3  on Mar 4  revised it to 1 3  in Mar 26 and further to 1 5  in the next day Shape of the Treasury Yield CurveOn Mar 22  yield on 3 month US Treasury Note surged ahead of 10 year US Treasury Note resulting in yield curve inversion  Concerns about global economic slowdown and Fed s extra dovish monetary stance compelled investors to opt for safe haven government bonds lifting their prices  The yield curve inversion is continuing for last seven days Although an inverted yield curve is not resulting in an immediate recession  persistence of yield inversion for a long period will result in severe market volatility Our Top PicksAt this

116908,338423,RL,Ride On Rising P E Investing With These 5 Top Ranked Stocks,opinion,"Generally  investors love stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio  The perception is that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  The simple logic that a stock s current market price does not justify  is not equivalent to  its higher earnings and therefore has room to run is behind investors  inclination toward low P E stocks 
But stocks with a rising P E can be equally worth buying  We ll tell you why 
Why Rising P E a Valuable Tool 
Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price 
So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank equals to 1  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 57 
Here are five out of the 57 stocks 
Ralph Lauren Corporation    NYSE RL     This is engaged in designing  marketing and distributing men s  women s and children s apparel and accessories  It carries a Zacks Rank  2  It hails from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 11    You can see

116930,338445,RL,American Apparel s Charney loses support of some factory workers he championed  ,news,"By Lisa Baertlein and Alicia Avila
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Ousted American Apparel Inc  A APP  head Dov Charney supported workers in the clothing industry with his stance in favor of immigration rights and determination to keep jobs in the United States  but some employees are not returning the favor 
Four of the six workers who would talk to a Reuters reporter outside the company s downtown Los Angeles factory said they back the board s decision to fire Charney  the company s outspoken founder who has been dogged by lawsuits and allegations of sexual harassment 
During breaks at a food truck parked near American Apparel s main 800 000 square foot factory that produces brightly colored T shirts and leather goods  workers said they hoped new leadership would fix problems that have saddled the 250 store chain with losses in 16 of the past 17 quarters 
 I hope things do change  Work has been slow for about five months   said Jose Barrera  42 
 That s bad because my wife also works here and sometimes she can only work three days a week   said Barrera  who has been with American Apparel for about two years and makes  10 per hour in the sewing department 
While he would like to earn more  he said he is glad to be making  1 above Los Angeles  minimum wage in an environment that lacks the pressure he experienced at some other textile factories in the city 
Many workers declined to comment  saying they weren t authorized to 
NUDE PHOTOS
Charney  45  started American Apparel s predecessor companies in 1989 and has been at the helm since 2007  when the company went public 
Last month American Apparel s board dismissed Charney  It accused the chairman  president and chief executive of misusing corporate funds and failing to prevent the dissemination of nude photos of a female ex employee who sued him 
Charney  who is known for his unconventional behavior  has fought off a series of sexual harassment lawsuits in recent years  including one from the former employee who claimed she was held as a teenage sex slave  American Apparel claimed the woman had stalked Charney and was trying to shake down the company 
American Apparel and Charney did not respond to requests for comment 
Charney made immigration reform a central theme of American Apparel s message  and the phrase  Legalize LA  is emblazoned on the company s salmon colored factory 
He grabbed headlines in 2009  when he marched with workers in a May Day protest rally for immigrant rights  However  just a few months later  American Apparel was forced to lay off 1 500 workers who lacked documents needed to work in the United States  It is unclear how many people currently work at the factory 
The company is a poster child for the  Made in the USA  movement  especially given that only an estimated 3 percent to 5 percent of apparel sold in the country is from domestic factories 
Experts say it works because American Apparel makes its T shirts  leggings and other products in small batches that can be delivered quickly to stores  something foreign manufacturers can t do cost effectively 
David Williams  31  works in the department that makes leather handbags and belts  He recently got a promotion  but still earns Los Angeles   9 per hour minimum wage because the company put his  1 raise on hold due to a slowdown in business 
Williams  who is leaving next week for a better paying job as a longshoreman  expects new management to run the company a  little better  
Manuel Arellano  52  who has been with the company almost five years  is concerned that new bosses may not be as involved as Charney 
 Maybe     they don t even come to see how things are going here   he said 

Shortly after firing Charney in June  local management told workers at the factory that American Apparel would not be sold 
 We re not shutting down  so everything is OK   said Heather Baez  26  who works in the corporate office onsite

116951,338466,RL,Top Stock Reports For Chevron  CSX Corporation   Regeneron,opinion,"Thursday  February 07  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Chevron  CVX   CSX Corp   CSX  and Regeneron  REGN   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Chevron s shares have gained  5 9  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Integrated Oil industry s  1 3  increase  Chevron s Q4 earnings increased roughly 20  year over year and was ahead of analysts  expectations  while free cash flow and upstream production for 2018 hit a record  
The Zacks analyst emphasizes that Chevron s existing oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry  targeting volume growth of around 4 7  in 2019 thanks to planned expansion in the Permian Basin  Chevron pumped 84  more out of the West Texas shale play in the quarter compared with the same period last year  with production set to soar in coming years  
Moreover  the growing free cash flow should enable Chevron to deliver safe and growing dividend for the foreseeable future  However  there are worries over drop in its downstream earnings that once again cut into overall gains from rising E P income  
The massive capex might also create headwinds  Hence  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point before buying shares in Chevron 
 You can   
Shares of Buy ranked CSX Corporation  NASDAQ CSX  have gained  34 9  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Rail industry  which has gained  21 8  over the same period  Ushering in further good news  the company reported better than expected revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018  Moreover  both earnings and revenues improved year over year  
Results were aided by volume growth and favorable pricing  Improvement in operating ratio is an added positive  Backed by operational efficiency  the company expects to achieve its operating ratio target of 60  this year itself instead of 2020 as expected earlier  In fact  CSX Corporation is looking to cut costs for driving bottom line growth  
The Zacks analyst thinks the company s efforts to reward its shareholders are impressive  In February 2019  CSX Corporation hiked its quarterly dividend by 9 1   However  the company s high debt levels are worrying  As of Dec 31  2018  long term debt totaled  14 739 million compared with  11 790 million at 2017 end 
 You can   
Buy ranked Regeneron s shares have outperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry in the past six months  gaining  8 6  vs  a decline of  13 8   Regeneron s fourth quarter results were impressive as the company comfortably beat on both the top and the bottom line  Regeneron s growth driver  Eylea continues to drive sales  and label expansion of the drug into additional indications has further boosted growth  Dupixent too has boosted performance 
The company is working to expand Dupixent s label further in several other indications  The Zacks analyst thinks this should diversify the company s revenue base and reduce dependence on Eylea  
In September 2018  the FDA approved its immuno oncology therapy  Libtayo  for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation  New drug approvals boost growth prospects of the company  However  the company is highly dependent on Eylea for growth

116968,338483,RL,Relative Price Strength Makes These 5 Stocks Worth Betting On,opinion,Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen

116998,338513,RL,Ralph Lauren  RL  Beats Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Ralph Lauren  RL  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 32 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 15 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 03 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7 91   A quarter ago  it was expected that this upscale clothing company would post earnings of  2 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 26  delivering a surprise of 4 15  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Ralph Lauren  which belongs to the Zacks Textile   Apparel industry  posted revenues of  1 73 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 62   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 64 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Ralph Lauren shares have added about 10 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 8 7  
What s Next for Ralph Lauren 
While Ralph Lauren has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Ralph Lauren was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 85 on  1 48 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  6 79 on  6 22 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Textile   Apparel is currently in the top 8  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ralph-lauren-rl-beats-q3-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200383686,200383686
117028,338543,RL,Will Ralph Lauren  RL  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Ralph Lauren  RL   which belongs to the Zacks Textile   Apparel industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this upscale clothing company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 7 47   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Ralph Lauren was expected to post earnings of  2 17 per share  but it reported  2 26 per share instead  representing a surprise of 4 15   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 39 per share  while it actually produced  1 54 per share  a surprise of 10 79  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Ralph Lauren  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Ralph Lauren currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 78   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 5  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-ralph-lauren-rl-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200374541,200374541
117029,338544,RL,Fastenal  FAST  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Offing ,opinion,Fastenal Company   NASDAQ FAST   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Jan 17  before the opening bell The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 9  in the last reported quarter  In fact  it reported positive earnings surprise in all the trailing four quarters  with average of 3 8  How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is currently pegged at 60 cents  remaining unchanged over the past 60 days  Nonetheless  this reflects an increase of 33 3  from the year ago earnings of 45 cents per share  Revenues are expected to be  1 22 billion  up 12  year over year Fastenal Company Price and EPS Surprise    Let s take a look at the factors that might affect the company s results in the fourth quarter Fastenal is expected to benefit from its core product offerings like Onsite Locations vending machines managed inventory  However  higher product and freight expenses  along with changes in product and customer mix raise concerns Vending Machines to Drive Growth  Over the past few quarters  Fastenal s sales have been driven by an increased installation of industrial vending machines  Sales through vending devices continued to grow at a double digit pace  both in the first nine months and the third quarter of 2018  primarily due to higher installed base  Fastenal s signings of industrial vending devices grew 23 2  year over year in the quarter and were up more than 13  in the first nine months of 2018  Installed device count  as of Sep 30  2018  increased 14  from the year ago quarter  The trend is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter as well Onsite Locations to Boost Sales  A consistent increase in the number of on site locations is likely to strengthen Fastenal s market share and boost quarterly numbers  As of Sep 30  2018  it had 828 active sites  up 49 2  from a year ago  The increased number of onsite locations is likely to expand Fastenal s market share  The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well  Fastenal aims to achieve 360 385 onsite signings in 2018  reflecting an increase from 270 signings in 2017 Solid End Market Demand  Robust construction market  especially the non residential one  has been acting as a major tailwind for Fastenal s performance over the past few quarters  Non residential construction grew 16 2  and manufacturing increased 13  in the third quarter  consistent with the second quarter s growth  The trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well The company is expected to report impressive top  and bottom line growth in the fourth quarter  courtesy of sustained strength in most of its end markets  as well as strong momentum in vending machine installations and onsite locations Gross Margin Pressure  Fastenal s changes in product and customer mix have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time now  In the first nine months of 2018  gross margins contracted 90 basis points year over year  Moreover  freight and product cost inflation added to the woes  That said  Fastenal remains optimistic about its performance in the second half of the year  given improved pricing expectation as well as reasonable gross margin comparisons through the rest of 2018 Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts Fastenal does not have the right

117030,338545,RL,Ralph Lauren Stock Set For A 50  Gain ,opinion,"Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL   the maker of Polo  is another top apparel brand  which was left for dead during the  retail apocalypse  of 2017  In just four years between May 2013 and May 2017  the company lost over 65  in market value as the stock fell from an all time high of  192 to as low as  66 
Then  just when the future looked the bleakest  bargain hunters apparently started picking up RL shares  By July 2018  Ralph Lauren stock was hovering in the vicinity of  148 a share  Unfortunately for the bulls  the roller coaster did not stop there 
Searching for Elliott Wave Logic in Ralph Lauren
RL closed at  111 57 last week  Since the market price is far more volatile than the company s fundamentals  our job as analysts is to apply the Elliott Wave principle on the chart below and try to make sense of all the swings 

The 4 hour chart of Ralph Lauren reveals that the recovery from  66 06 to  147 79 is a textbook five wave impulse  labeled  1   2   3   4   5   The five sub waves of waves  1  and  5  are visible as well 
In addition  the market has obeyed the guideline of alternation  since wave  2  is a sideways correction  while wave  4  is a sharp pullback  What is even more interesting is the structure of the following  a   b   c  retracement to the 61 8  Fibonacci level 
Wave  b  appears to be an a  b  c  running flat correction  Waves a  and b  are simple a b c zigzags and then there is an ending diagonal in the position of wave c   Note how extended wave b  of  b  is and how deeply below the bottom of wave  a  it goes

117033,338548,RL,Ralph Lauren  RL  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Ralph Lauren  RL  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This upscale clothing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 67 billion  up 1 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 58  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ralph Lauren 
For Ralph Lauren  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 86  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Ralph Lauren will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ralph Lauren would post earnings of  2 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 26  delivering a surprise of  4 15  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ralph Lauren appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ralph-lauren-rl-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200380580,200380580
117060,338575,RL,RL Vs  VFC  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Textile   Apparel stocks are likely familiar with Ralph Lauren  RL  and V F   VFC   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Ralph Lauren has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while V F  has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that RL is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
RL currently has a forward P E ratio of 15  while VFC has a forward P E of 18 95  We also note that RL has a PEG ratio of 1 45  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  VFC currently has a PEG ratio of 1 70 
Another notable valuation metric for RL is its P B ratio of 2 37  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  VFC has a P B of 6 70 
These metrics  and several others  help RL earn a Value grade of A  while VFC has been given a Value grade of D 
RL has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than VFC  so it seems like value investors will conclude that RL is the superior option right now ",2018-12-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rl-vs-vfc-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200371967,200371967

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is RL due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts Ralph Lauren Q4 Earnings   Revenues Surpass EstimatesRalph Lauren reported fourth quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 90 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents  The bottom line figure also increased by a penny from the prior year quarter  Notably  this marked the company s 13th straight quarter of earnings beat The company s better than expected results stemmed from stringent focus on key initiatives that focuses on its core business  improving product assortments and delivering better quality of sales On a reported basis  Ralph Lauren posted earnings per share of 50 cents compared to loss per share of  2 48 in the prior year quarter  Reported earnings for the quarter primarily included restructuring and other charges associated with the company s Way Forward plan as well as the impact of tax reform RevenuesRalph Lauren s net revenues decreased 2 3  year over year to  1 529 2 million  However  the top line figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 493 million  On constant currency basis  revenues were down 7  better than the company s guidance of 8 10  fall  The company s efforts to improve quality of sales  reduced promotions and improve distribution  alongside brand exits and soft consumer demand led to decline in revenues During the quarter under review  foreign currency aided revenue growth by nearly 440 basis points  bps  owing to favorable currency rates  This was above the company s guidance of 330 bps positive impact Segment DetailsNorth America  During the fourth quarter  revenues at this segment slumped 14  on both reported and constant currency basis  to  759 3 million  This downturn can be attributed to lower wholesale sales backed by distribution and brand exits  planned reduction in shipments and promotions to enhance the quality of sales  and soft customer demand  On a currency neutral basis  comparable store sales at North America s retail channel remained flat owing to a 6  rise in brick and mortar stores  which were compensated by an 18  fall in online channel Europe  Revenues for this segment rose 13  year over year to  420 million  while currency neutral revenues fell 1   Currency neutral comps dropped 6   including 8  decline in stores due to traffic challenges in certain markets and planned inventory reductions  This was somewhat offset by 8  rise in e commerce Asia  Revenues at this segment were up 17  to  256 8 million and 11  in constant currency  The upside was driven by strong retail and wholesale sales  Comps rose 4  on a currency neutral basis  courtesy of increased average unit retail and number of transactions MarginsRalph Lauren s adjusted gross profit margins expanded 440 bps to 59 8  backed by efforts to enhance quality of sales through lower promotions  positive geographic and channel mix shifts  as well as reduced product costs and mix  Additionally  foreign currency aided gross margins by 90 bps However  adjusted operating income margin contracted 110 bps to 5 6   This year over year decrease can mainly be attributed to expense deleverage  which was more than offset by higher gross margin  Further  foreign currency hurt operating margins by 240 bps FinancialsRalph Lauren ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of  2 004 million  total debt of  596 million and total shareholders  equity of  3 457 4 million  Inventory declined 4  to  761 million at the end of fiscal 2018  This was due to enhanced operating methods Moreover  the company incurred capital expenditures of  162 million in fiscal 2018  For fiscal 2019  the same is now estimated to be roughly  275 million Store UpdateAs of Mar 31  2018  Ralph

Ralph Lauren stock has been making its way higher since bottoming around  66 per share in May 2017  RL is up 80  year over year  and just off its June 7 three year high of  145 94  The stock s few pullbacks this year have been quickly contained by the 50 day and 120 day moving averages  which formed a bullish cross last August 

Looking back  Ralph Lauren stock has swung higher the day after the company reports earnings in five of the past eight quarters  including a 14 3  surge higher in May  On average  the equity has moved 7 4  in the post earnings session  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in larger than normal 10 1  swing  If the post earnings swing turns positive  this could mean another round of multi year highs is in store for the retailer

The stock s August 135 call has seen the largest increase in open interest over the past 10 days  with roughly 2 150 contracts added here  Data from the major options exchanges points to buyer driven activity at this in the money strike  which currently sports a delta of 56     implying slightly better than coin flip odds that the option will expire in the money three weeks from now 
Elsewhere  short interest on RL fell 10 8  during the past two reporting periods  but still represents more than 11  of the stock s total available float  At Ralph Lauren stock s average daily trading volume  it would take the better part of two weeks for shorts to cover their bearish bets  This leaves RL well positioned to benefit from continued short covering activity if the luxury stock can pull off a positive earnings surprise tomorrow morning ",2018-07-31,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/call-buyers-eye-outperforming-luxury-stock-200334750,200334750

117184,338699,RL,Ralph Lauren  RL  To Post Q2 Earnings  What s In The Offing ,opinion,Ralph Lauren Corporation   NYSE RL   is slated to release second quarter fiscal 2019 results on Nov 6  before the opening bell The company has an impressive earnings surprise history  having outpaced estimates for the last 14 quarters  Also  it delivered an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 7 2  Ralph Lauren Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings is pegged at  2 16  reflecting 8 5  growth year over year  Notably  the consensus mark remained stable over the last 30 days Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement Factors at PlayRalph Lauren has been benefiting from strategic initiatives  including focus on core business  improvement in product assortments and delivery of better quality sales  Moreover  its progress on the Way Forward Plan  with stringent focus on digital and international growth is commendable  As part of its focus on the core business  management is keen on improving assortments by discontinuing unproductive styles  Further  Ralph Lauren is on track to reduce its supply chain lead times to improve the quality of sales and curtail markdowns  It is also focused on lowering inventories to keep it on par with demand These apart  Ralph Lauren is well on track with its restructuring plan  which is likely to generate savings of roughly  140 million by the end of fiscal 2019  These restructuring activities include rightsizing the portfolio and cost structure alongside streamlining the structure of the organization On the international front  Ralph Lauren is bolstering its presence by continually broadening its base in underpenetrated markets with new and highly productive small format stores  In first quarter fiscal 2019  the company s constant currency revenues in China grew more than 25   with over 40  of growth coming from Mainland China  Further  expansion of digital platforms remains a key catalyst behind Ralph Lauren s global growth strategy  Also  its digital wholesale business has been performing well  Backed by these robust growth strategies  the stock has surged 29 5  year to date  outperforming the  s 17 4  rally However  the company s North America business remains a headwind since the last few quarters  At this segment  revenues dipped 2  on both reported and constant currency basis in first quarter fiscal 2019  On a currency neutral basis  comparable store sales at North America s retail channel declined 3   due to a 3  fall in brick and mortar comps and a 2  drop in digital comps  In store comps at the unit were mainly impacted by the timing of Easter in the fiscal first quarter Further  management projects net revenues in a band of flat to down slightly on a constant currency basis for the fiscal second quarter  Foreign currency is expected to mar revenue growth by approximately 30 50 basis points  bps   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  1 66 billion  down 0 3  from the year ago figure Nevertheless  operating margin is anticipated to grow around 30 bps in constant currency and expected to be slightly benefited by foreign currency in the fiscal second quarter  Additionally  the aforementioned growth initiatives make us optimistic about Ralph Lauren s second quarter fiscal

117195,338710,RL,Trump s Trade Remarks Sap Risk Appetite  UK CPI And Fed Minutes On Horizon,opinion,"Here are the latest developments in global markets 

FOREX  The US dollar index is 0 1  higher on Wednesday ahead of the release of the minutes from the May Fed meeting  building on the modest gains it posted yesterday  Meanwhile  the Japanese yen rebounded yesterday and is on the front foot today  advancing 0 5  against the dollar and 0 6  versus the euro  as some  pessimistic  comments from US President Trump on trade dispelled expectations that the recent negotiations had borne fruit 
STOCKS  US markets closed lower yesterday  as some less than optimistic comments by President Trump regarding the US China trade talks weighed on risk appetite  The Dow Jones led the way lower  falling by 0 72   while the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite declined by 0 31  and 0 21  respectively  Futures tracking the Dow  S P  and Nasdaq 100 are all currently pointing to a lower open today  though it should be noted that the forthcoming direction in these indices may be largely dictated by the Fed minutes later today  The negative sentiment rolled over into Asian markets as well  with Japan s Nikkei 225 and Topix falling by 1 18  and 0 68  correspondingly  In Hong Kong  the Hang Seng plunged 1 35  on its first day back from a holiday  In Europe  futures tracking all the major indices were a sea of red  pointing to a much lower open today 
COMMODITIES  Oil prices corrected lower yesterday and the pullback is continuing today  with Crude Oil WTI and Brent Crude being down by 0 3  and 0 5  respectively  While there was no clear catalyst for the declines  they may be owed to a combination of deteriorating market sentiment  the latest advance in the US dollar  as well as the smaller than expected drawdown in the private API crude inventory data yesterday  In precious metals  gold prices are down today  but by less than 0 1   trading not far above the  1 292 per ounce mark  The yellow metal continued to overlook discouraging comments on the trade outlook yesterday  in contrast to other haven assets like the yen  which surged  That said  gold has been quite responsive to movements in the dollar lately  so it could well react to the release of the FOMC minutes later today 

Major movers  Yen rebounds as Trump s  pessimism  saps risk appetiteUS President Trump expressed his dissatisfaction over the recent US China trade negotiations yesterday  indicating he is  not really  pleased with the results so far  His comments came in stark contrast with those of Treasury Secretary Mnuchin a few days ago   who had implied that the talks had borne fruit   and likely reignited speculation that the  trade war  theme may still have some legs to run  The result was a deterioration in risk sentiment  causing US equity indices to cross into negative territory and triggering safe haven flows into the Japanese yen  Funnily enough  these signals came just hours after China declared it will reduce the import tariff it imposes on cars to 15   from 25  previously 
Further sapping risk appetite were some remarks from Trump that cast doubt on whether the widely touted summit with North Korea will ever take place  He said there is a  very substantial chance  it won t work out   pushing back on expectations for a swift resolution of the Korean dispute 
As for the dollar  while it s down by 0 5  against the yen and 0 1  against the Swiss franc respectively today  it s higher against all its other major counterparts  Today  investors will scrutinize the Fed minutes from the May meeting for any insights on whether policymakers are willing to allow inflation to overshoot the 2  target without raising rates for a while  something they teased in the statement 
In the antipodeans  Aussie dollar and Kiwi dollar are both down by 0 5  today  following a miss in Australian construction data and some dovish signals from the RBNZ overnight respectively  In emerging markets  the Turkish lira continues to break record lows  as investors remain concerned the central bank may not act decisively and raise rates as much as needed to rein in double digit inflation Day ahead  Eurozone flash PMIs  UK inflation and Fed minutes on the horizonWednesday is a busy day in terms of data releases  featuring important figures from the US  the eurozone and the UK  as well as Fed minutes pertaining to the central bank s latest monetary policy meeting 
At 0800 GMT  the eurozone will be on the receiving end of flash PMI numbers for the month of May  All three data points   the manufacturing  services and composite PMI   are expected to comfortably stand above the 50 expansion contraction level  though yet again point to further easing of activity  Earlier in the day  0730 GMT   Germany  the eurozone s largest economy  will see the release of its respective PMI figures  while France s numbers were made public at 0700 GMT  euro dollar fell upon the release  the services PMI negatively surprised and the manufacturing PMI surprised to the upside  
UK inflation figures for April are due at 0830 GMT  Headline CPI is anticipated to have held steady at 2 5  y y  and to have grown at a faster monthly pace relative to March  0 5  vs 0 1    Core CPI  which excludes volatile items from its calculations  is forecast to edge down to 2 2  y y  from 2 3  in March  A data beat is projected to increase the odds for a Bank of England rate hike sooner rather than later and consequently support sterling 
Also at 0830 GMT  the UK will see the release of data on producer prices and retail price inflation for April  while May s Confederation of British Industry Distributive Trades figures are due out at 1000 GMT 
Markit s May flash manufacturing PMI out of the US is slated for release at 1345 GMT  The measure is expected to remain constant at 56 5  A little later  1400 GMT   new home sales data for April will be made public out of the US  A 2 0  decrease in sales is anticipated  after a 4  rise in March 
The European Commission s Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs will release its May flash consumer confidence figures at 1400 GMT  consumer morale is anticipated to remain in positive territory 
Market participants  attention will again next turn to the US  as the official record of the Federal Reserve s meeting in early May will be made public at 1800 GMT  That meeting left traders speculating that FOMC policymakers are willing to accept an inflation overshoot without accelerating their tightening cycle  Any communication to the contrary is likely to boost the US currency 
In energy markets  EIA weekly data on US crude inventories due at 1430 GMT may give short term direction to oil prices 
In equities  Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  and Tiffany   Co NYSE TIF   NYSE TIF  are among companies releasing quarterly results today  both will be reporting before the US market open 
In terms of policymakers  appearances  Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves and the Head of the Financial Stability Department Olof Sandstedt will be attending a press conference at 0900 GMT  after the release of the Bank s relevant report on financial stability at 0730 GMT  RBA Governor Philip Lowe will be giving a speech at the Australia China Relations Institute at 0805 GMT  while Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  non voting FOMC member in 2018  will be participating in a Q A session at 1815 GMT 
Meanwhile  trade  US China deliberations  and geopolitical  for example a meeting between Trump and North Korea s Kim  developments remain on the background  In this respect  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be meeting the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at 1800 GMT  while he will also be seeing the German and Japanese foreign ministers on Wednesday  Brexit is also in focus  with Brexit ministers Steve Baker and Suella Braverman appearing in front of the Brexit committee on progress of EU exit talks at 0800 GMT Technical Analysis  GBP USD hits 5 month low  looking oversoldGBP USD posted a five month low of 1 3372 earlier on Wednesday  The negatively aligned Tenkan  and Kijun sen lines are projecting a bearish short term picture for the pair  A note of caution is warranted though as the Chikou Span is signaling an oversold market 
Worse than anticipated UK inflation numbers are likely to push the pair further down  Support in this case might come around the 1 33 round figure  the region around this also encapsulates the seven month low of 1 3301 from mid December 
A UK CPI beat on the other hand is anticipated to boost the pair  Resistance to advances could be met around the current level of the Tenkan sen at 1 3490  and before that around the 1 34 handle which failed to act as support earlier in the day and might instead provide resistance 
US data  and perhaps most importantly the release of the FOMC meeting minutes  have the capacity to move GBP USD as well ",2018-05-23,XM Group,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trumps-trade-remarks-sap-risk-appetite-uk-cpi-and-fed-minutes-on-the-horizon-200318541,200318541

The buyouts of VocaLink and NuData Security complement the company s efforts to participate in new payment flows and enhance its safety and security offerings   The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised upward over the last 60 days  However  escalating costs continue to bother  Also  higher incentives and rewards will put pressure on its bottom line

Shares of Buy ranked VMware have gained  17 7  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Software industry which is up  16 9  over the same period  VMware reported impressive first quarter fiscal 2019 results  Both earnings and revenues increased on a year over year basis  Strong top line growth was primarily driven by robust performance from NSX and vSAN product line  Management provided strong guidance for fiscal 2019  
The Zacks analyst likes the fact that VMware has been consistently taking initiatives to diversify its product portfolio to include most of the IT infrastructure  The company s dominance in SDDC along with expanding customer base in cloud driven by partnerships with the likes of IBM  NYSE IBM  and AWS is positive

The Zacks analyst is particularly optimistic about sales prospects of Dupixent  which could prove to be an important growth driver  The acquisitions of Ablynx and Bioverativ have strengthened Sanofi s position in the rare blood disorders market  However  Sanofi s Diabetes franchise is under significant pressure with key product  Lantus facing increasing competitive pressure at the payor level and the presence of biosimilar competition in several European markets and Japan  
Other headwinds include generic competition for many drugs and slower than expected uptake of new products like Praluent  Meanwhile  the performance of the Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare franchises has been soft lately   Nonetheless  Sanofi expects to return to growth in the second half of 2018

117257,338772,RL,Rocky Brands  RCKY  Hits Fresh Highs  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Rocky Brands   NASDAQ RCKY    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12 6  over the past month  RCKY hit a new 52 week high of  24 45 in the previous session  Rocky Brands has gained 27 8  since the start of the year compared to the 0 5  move for the Consumer Discretionary sector and the 5 6  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 24  2018  Rocky Brands reported EPS of  0 44 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 25 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 35  
For the current fiscal year  Rocky Brands is expected to post earnings of  1 5 per share on  246 9 million in revenues  This represents a 29 31  change in EPS on a  2 49  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 65 per share on  254 5 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 10  and 3 08   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Rocky Brands may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for RCKY  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Rocky Brands has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 16 1X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 11 8X versus its peer group s average of 13 3X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Rocky Brands  Inc  Price and Consensus   Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Rocky Brands currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Rocky Brands fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though RCKY shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Rocky Brands Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Rocky Brands have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Xtep International Holdings   OTC XTEPY    Ralph Lauren   NYSE RL    and PVH   NYSE PVH    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 31  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for RCKY  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-04-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rocky-brands-rcky-hits-fresh-highs-is-there-still-room-to-run-200310210,200310210

117309,338824,RL,Consumer Sentiment Soars To Record High  5 Picks,opinion,On Feb 16  The University of Chicago said that its consumer sentiment index had increased in February to its second highest level since 2004  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and continuing resilience in the jobs market were primarily responsible for this increase  These factors helped Americans ignore recent volatility in the equity markets  which threatened to snap a long streak of gains Steady growth and resilience in the jobs market have been the highlights of the continuing economic expansion  The impetus generated by recent tax cuts will also help to raise the disposable income of U S  citizens  This is why this is an excellent time to invest in consumer discretionary stocks Second highest Level in 14 YearsThe University of Michigan s consumer sentiment index increased from 95 7 in January to 99 9 in February  This was the highest level recorded since 2004 and the second highest recorded since the

of Americans  opinion about their finances  increased from 110 5 to 115 1  Additionally  the expectations index increased from 86 3 to 90 2  The overall number experienced a 4 4  increase from January s figure of 95 7  Meanwhile  expectations for current year inflation levels remained unchanged at 2 7  Tax Cuts  Jobs Growth Boost Sentiment The survey indicates that consumers are choosing to concentrate on encouraging economic data  This includes an increase in income levels  a booming job market and other related factors  Such a mindset was not impacted by recent stock market gyrations According to the survey s chief economist Richard Curtin  only 6  of the respondents chose to recall discouraging news related to the equity markets  that too when prompted  Nearly 35  of the respondents provided positive references to government actions  This figure was in line with January s reading  the highest level recorded in more than 50 years Our ChoicesThe latest reading of the University of Chicago s consumer sentiment index indicates that American consumers remain upbeat following recent tax cuts  A resilient job market and increasing income levels have also contributed to the uptrend in sentiment Adding consumer discretionary stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in

117310,338825,RL,Will The Joy Ride For Luxury Goods  Stocks Continue In 2018 ,opinion,The luxury goods market had a lavish 2017 with impressive sales figures from top players  Given the continuing economic recovery  the momentum is likely to continue in 2018  Also  optimism surrounding steady economic growth  lower tax rates  strong wage growth and a robust earnings season hint at a brighter future for luxury stocks  Robust sales figures registered by a number of luxury brands in China along with an increasing number of millennials spending more on luxury goods bode well too  A Stunning 2017 U S  luxury stocks witnessed a robust 2017  The S P Global Luxury Index has risen 34 76  in the last year  Shares of PVH Corp    NYSE PVH   have surged 62 4   while Michael Kors Holdings Limited   NYSE KORS   has rallied 67 02  in the same time frame   The last 12 months were also great for LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA   OTC LVMUY    Ralph Lauren Corp    NYSE RL   and Tapestry  Inc    NYSE TPR    which gained 51 35   34 44  and 29 31   respectively While LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA  Michael Kors Holdings Limited and Ralph Lauren Corp  carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   PVH Corp  and Tapestry have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see Interestingly  it wasn t only the domestic market but also the international space  particularly China  that saw companies coming up with a stellar show  Overall  the impressive performance of luxury goods was a global affair following a change in the tastes and habits of shoppers The overall global economy too was strong  which helped luxury goods  stocks to grow  A good start to the holiday season in 2017 gave an added thrust to the share price of luxury brands that range from wearables  to handbags  belts  eyewear  sportswear and shoes Global Factors Influencing GrowthThe overall picture for luxury goods was quite rosy in 2017 with the big players going all out to make their presence felt in the global market  One of the primary reasons was that most brands focused more on millennials  who are splurging on luxury goods pretty early According to a February 2018 survey report by Mindshare North America  57  of shoppers are between the ages of 18 and 34  indicating that millennials are now the biggest shoppers That said  the optimism surrounding steady economic growth  higher wages  business friendly policies by the government and an appeal for luxury in emerging economies cannot be overlooked Moreover  a number of luxury brands also expanded globally  which helped them come up with higher sales  While Tapestry acquired Kate Spade for  2 4 billion last year  Kors acquired Jimmy Choo for  1 2 billion to expand its presence in China LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA registered record sales for 2017 with a like for like sales growth of 12   double the rate of 2016  The growth was driven by the stupendous performance of its fashion and leather goods divisions  Moreover  one of the best U S  holiday season in years helped Tiffany rev up its sales China Powers Global ExpansionFor global luxury brands  China remains the hottest destination  Most big names reported of benefiting from the China market in 2017 and 2018 too won t be any different  And those who are yet to explore that market are fast gearing up to set up shop in China Per a January 2018 Bain   Co report  sales of luxury goods in China  which moved at a snail s pace for years  escalated at the fastest rate in more than half a decade in 2017 and are expected to perform well in 2018  The report further says that sales of luxury goods in China touched 142 billion yuan   22 07 billion  in 2017  increasing almost 20  from a year ago  The highly dynamic Chinese market helped brands like LVMH and Kors and Tapestry Global luxury goods purchases by Chinese shoppers jumped 12  last year to  84 billion   104 billion   per Bain   Co  This surge in consumer spending is being attributed to the changing demographics in China  Those born after the adoption of the one child policy in 1979  today comprise the highest number of shoppers Moreover  the millennials  who are setting new fashion trends  are the biggest spenders and most luxury brands are following them  At the same time  per a February 2018 BCG report  social media and word of mouth are the first and second sources of information for shoppers in China  with 49  and 30  share  respectively  Keeping that in mind  most global luxury brands are going the D2C  direct to customer  way in China  Last July  LVMH launched its directly operated online store that country  Prior to that  Kors and Burberry too opened e commerce sites in China Millennials   Boomers to Power 2018 GrowthMillennials are dominating the changing preferences and habits of consumers as they comprise the highest percentage of shoppers  Naturally  focus on millennials will be the key to success for luxury brands in 2018  Millennials  tastes and preferences are increasingly blurring the gap between premium and luxury brands According to Mindshare North America s recent survey  55  millennials are of the opinion that big luxury brands are losing their personal feel compared with 46  Gen X and 23  of Boomers  Hence most brands are addressing these perceptions and trying to meet the demands of millennials  who are trend setters At the same time  Boomers cannot be neglected as they are the ones with great spending impact in the market right now  So  while millennials are setting trends  Boomers have more spending power  Most luxury brands are trying to strike a perfect balance between the two Future PerfectWith positives such as a recovering economy  lower tax rates and business friendly policies  luxury brands are poised for growth in 2018  The China market  which saw sluggish sales for years  is finally recovering with sales of luxury goods touching record highs  This certainly has made luxury brands optimistic about the China market and expansion plans are afoot for quite a few big names  Moreover  millennials have emerged as the biggest spenders and are expected to impact sales this year too  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies It s hard to

117338,338853,RL,Bull Of The Day  Urban Outfitters  URBN ,opinion,"There s no denying that the retail sector has made a sort of a comeback in the past few weeks 
Black Friday weekend this year made history  with Cyber Monday becoming America s largest ever online shopping day  In store foot traffic didn t fall as much as analysts had feared  and if you went out shopping on Black Friday  you likely noticed that a ton of other people decided to join you 
Consumer confidence is high  and when consumers feel good  they like to spend money 
One company that is benefitting from this recent revival is millennial favorite and Zacks  1  Strong Buy  Urban Outfitters Inc  NASDAQ URBN    URBN   the parent of brands like Urban Outfitters  Anthropologie  Free People  BHLDN  and Terrain 
Urban Outfitters and Pizza 
When Urban announced that it would be acquiring The Vetri Family group of restaurants  which includes the award winning Pizzeria Vetri  investors were a little wary 
It seemed random and a little unorthodox at the time  in addition to the fact that running a restaurant business is costly  How could Urban  a retailer that was already struggling to boost its core apparel business  manage a pizza chain 
What was hard to pinpoint initially was the profit potential  But consumer spending on fast casual dining has been growing rapidly for some time now  and Pizzeria Vetri offered the company an opportunity to create a unique in store experience and leverage this restaurant trend to drive store traffic 
The acquisition seems to be working  becoming another strong example of the retail restaurant model and following in the footsteps of Ralph Lauren  RL  and Restoration Hardware  RH   Last quarter  Urban s Food and Beverage segment pulled in  6 24 million  up from  5 85 million in the year ago period 
Impressive Third Quarter Earnings
Speaking of last quarter  Urban posted strong third quarter numbers 
The apparel retailer reported earnings of 41 cents per share  soaring past the Zacks Consensus of 33 cents per share 
Record revenues of  893 million were much higher than our consensus estimate and increased 3 5  year over year 
Overall  comparable retail segment sales  though only increasing 1   were driven by strong  double digit growth in the direct to consumer channel 
Breaking it down by brand and excluding the estimated impact if the North American hurricanes in the quarter Free People comps increased 5   while Anthro rose 2  and Urban increased 1  
Rising Estimates
As a result  growth estimates have been steadily increasing  and analysts have grown quite bullish on URBN lately 
For its current quarter  earnings are expected to grow almost 12   and 12 analysts have revised their estimates upwards in the last 30 days compared to none lower 
Fiscal 2017 figures are also looking quite promising  with 13 estimates moving higher in the past month  compared to none lower  The consensus estimate trend has seen a boost for this time frame  increasing from  1 56 per share to  1 43 per share  an increase of 9 1  
Earnings estimates for 2018 are on the rise as well  jumping to  1 74 per share from  1 58 per share in the last 30 days 
Will the Rally Continue 
2017 was a pretty rocky year for URBN  but the stock has been able to bounce back  and is currently up around 14 4  year to date compared to the S P 500 s return of 18 8 
Its Q3 earnings were a huge boosting factor  and in the last three months  shares have gained almost 44  Urban Outfitters  Inc  Price and Consensus   Urban is now trading with a forward P E of 20 96 
And it s not just URBN right now either   is a fairly strong industry right now  and sits in the top 28  of all industries that we cover

117340,338855,RL,Is Ralph Lauren  RL  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Ralph Lauren Corporation   NYSE RL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Ralph Lauren has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  RL s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Ralph Lauren has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 20 5  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  RL has a P S ratio of about 1 5  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 6x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Ralph Lauren currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Ralph Lauren a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the Price to Cash Flow ratio for RL is 11 9  lower than the industry average of 14  Clearly  Ralph Lauren is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Ralph Lauren might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives RL a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen two up and one down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 5 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite this bullish trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRalph Lauren is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  Top 29  out of more than 250 industries   the company deserves attention right now  In fact  over the past six months  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-ralph-lauren-rl-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200283012,200283012
117341,338856,RL,Is A Surprise Coming For Ralph Lauren  RL  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Ralph Lauren Corporation   NYSE RL   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Ralph Lauren is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings   with the most up to date information possible   is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for RL in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at  1 88 per share for RL  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 87 per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for RL  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  0 98  heading into earnings season Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that RL has a Zacks Rank  3 and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Ralph Lauren  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-a-surprise-coming-for-ralph-lauren-rl-this-earnings-season-200285343,200285343

117371,338886,RL,Politics Can t Spoil Solid Week For Dow  SP,opinion,"The news that Michael Flynn will be cooperating with Robert Mueller s Russian probe ruined a perfectly good morning on Friday  The major indices were modestly higher early in the session  but then took a severe plunge when the headline broke  However  it didn t ruin the week  The major indices came well off their lows throughout the rest of the day on optimism that the Senate would be able to pass its tax bill  Eventually  two of the major indices finished the week with strong gains  
	So how bad was the plunge after the Flynn news  At one point  the Dow was below 24000 on Friday after starting the session nearly 300 points above that mark  When all was said and done  the index made a ferocious comeback and finished lower by only 0 17  to 24 231 6  In fact  the Dow just completed its best week of the year with a surge of 2 9  over the past five days 
	The S P ended just 0 2  below breakeven to 2642 2  marking a weekly advance of 1 5   The NASDAQ declined 0 38  on the day to 6847 6 for a weekly loss of about 0 6   but most that deficit can be blamed on Wednesday s sharp pullback for tech 
	In the end  the market decided to focus more on the Senate tax cut bill than the Russian investigation  No one knows what will come of this Flynn news  or the entire probe for that matter   the tax issue is much more immediate and important to sustaining the market s rally

	  ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF  UVXY   Here s a protection play following this morning s news that Michael Flynn will be testifying in the Russian probe  If nothing comes of this news  it s no problem to just exit this insurance policy but its good to have if uncertainty continues to spike 
	  Ralph Lauren Corp   NYSE RL   With money flowing back into retail this week  Jeremy added a 9  position in this popular apparel giant in anticipation of a potential breakout that might lift the stock to  100 by early next year  Shares dipped following a positive earnings surprise  but are now nearing post earnings highs

117457,338972,RL,Ralph Lauren s Strategic Efforts Paying Off  Time To Hold ,opinion,Premium lifestyle products retailer  Ralph Lauren Corporation   NYSE RL   seems to be striking the right chords as evident from the progress made on its Way Forward Plan and other Restructuring initiatives  The cumulative effect of this progress is not only reflected in the company s solid earnings surprise trend but has also seeped in to the recent stock performance Shares of Ralph Lauren have shown significant growth last month as against its dismal past performances  The stock witnessed a solid 19 4  growth in the past month  outperforming the  s 4 7  upside Further  this apparel retailer boasts a  of A and has a long term EPS growth rate of 15   That said  let s take a closer look at the factors behind this solid performance Q1 Performance Reflects Progress on Strategic PlanRalph Lauren s first quarter fiscal 2018 performance was a testimony to its progress on the Way Forward Plan and Restructuring initiatives that was announced in Jun 2016  Divided in two parts  the plan is all about refocusing on the core  strengthening the brands and returning the company to profitable growth in the long term During the fiscal first quarter  the company enhanced quality of sales by reducing promotions and markdowns  alongside reducing Stock Keeping Units  SKUs  count to drive productivity  Further  the company improved inventory turns by curtailing inventory levels by 31  year over year and also achieved cost savings by lowering operating costs  Additionally  the company is keen on optimizing its wholesale distribution by shutting down underperforming points of distribution Earnings Trend   OutlookRalph Lauren flaunts a solid earnings history  with positive earnings surprises delivered in 15 out of the last 16 quarters  Notably  first quarter fiscal 2018 marked its 10th consecutive earnings beat  Further  the bottom line grew year over year and gross profit margin continued to expand   thanks to favorable geographic and channel mix shifts along with lower promotions and cost controls  Also  the company curtailed operating expenses  which in turn drove operating margin expansion Ralph Lauren Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Looking ahead  management remains confident of Ralph Lauren s performance based on its efforts related to global brand reorganization  constant infrastructural investments and eCommerce enhancements  Further  the company s efforts to evolve product and marketing bode well  Additionally  management lowered effective tax rate forecast for fiscal 2018  which we believe should benefit the bottom line Positive Estimate RevisionsThese factors led to an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the last seven days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and fiscal 2018 rose to  1 77 per share and  4 89 per share  respectively  from  1 70 and  4 81 Sales Continue to DeclineWhile all is well with this New York based company  its sales continued to be soft due to weak demand  brand exits and efforts to drive quality of sales  This marked the company s second consecutive sales miss Currency HeadwindsApart from the aforementioned factors  foreign currency continued to have an adverse impact on Ralph Lauren s top line and margins in the most recent quarter  In fact  currency has long been a hindrance for Ralph Lauren  given its international exposure  Currency impacted revenues by nearly 130 basis points  bps  and operating margin by 50 bps in the fiscal first quarter Further  it anticipates the headwinds to continue to impact results in second quarter fiscal 2018  For the second quarter  the company expects currency headwinds to hurt revenue growth and operating margin by nearly 40 bps  each ConclusionWhile the company s soft top line picture is discouraging  we commend its progress on its strategic plans  which should bear fruit in the long term  Further  we note that the soft sales performance is more or less a function of its ongoing revival efforts and should recover as the company implements its plans  Aptly  Ralph Lauren currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Meanwhile  investors interested in the space can also count on Michael Kors Holdings Limited   NYSE KORS    PVH Corp    NYSE PVH   and Lululemon Athletica Inc    NASDAQ LULU    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Michael Kors  with long term EPS growth rate of 8 3   has increased 15 2  in the last six months PVH Corp  has a long term EPS growth rate of 12 6   Further  the company has soared 40 5  in the last six months Lululemon has a long term EPS growth rate of 12 6   Further  the company has to its credit a positive earnings surprise of 5 7  for the trailing four quarters One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars This proven stock picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing  You can apply it to your portfolio starting today ,2017-08-16,Zacks

At 2 30 CT yesterday  the total trading range in the S P 500 futures was 2472 75 to 2476 25  Over the next hour  the ES was able to creep up to 2480 25  The MiM started out showing  185 million to buy before it  flipped  to  25 million to sell  Get this  there was a total of 470 000 ESU s traded  with 116 000 of that coming from Globex pre 8 30 futures open  That means  in just over 6 hours  only 354 000 ES had traded 
It s not  almost unheard  of  it IS unheard of  Never before have I seen lower volume  not even on a holiday 
As we have always said  we like to write about the markets  but there really isn t much to say  The end of the summer trade is in full gear  and most investors are in a hurry to take time off before school starts

Slow Melt Up
While talk has gone wild about the VIX and all the risk  the Dow Jones futures  YMU17 CME  closed at a new all time high for the 8th consecutive trading day  and its 34th time in 2017  Other than the 1990s the only other time there were so many was the 122 all time highs from 2013 2016  Below is a graph by Pension Partners showing the number of all time new highs from 1910 to present 

I know there have been a lot of comparisons to the run up in 1987  and the 2000 tech bubble  and even I have said it  but it s way beyond that  rates were way higher back then  While we do not know when it s going to change  fighting the uptrend has not been very satisfying  Other than a few small pullbacks  it s been all  upside   It has clearly been a great example of the old adage   the trend is your friend   and in this case  until further notice 
While we are paying attention to the PitBulls warning about a possible u turn from the last week of July to the third week of August  we also think  like we have been saying  that the next targets for the ES is 2485 00  and then 2500 00  with a possible top at the 2535 00 to 2540 00 area  When the upside party will end is anyone s guess  but for now  it s best to just go with the flow

117516,339031,RL,Can Coach Become The Next Louis Vuitton ,opinion,"Coach s Acquisition Spree
Coach  NYSE COH  is a luxury lifestyle brand which has been on an acquisition spree with the aim of converting itself into an American version of European luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE  PA LVMH   Its aim at this reinvention as a multi brand company received a boost when it was able to reach a deal to acquire Kate Spade   Co  NYSE KATE  for around  2 38 billion 
The Kate Spade brand adds a fashion house that designs and markets a range of women s and men s apparel  handbags  accessories  and fragrance products  Coach expects that this acquisition will help the company save around  over the next three years  These savings will be driven by inventory management  supply chain efficiencies  and improved scale 
The company also acquired the luxury shoe brand Stuart Weitzman for  574 million in 2015  Coach was also rumored to have considered buying Jimmy Choo in a billion dollar deal  These rumors have been put to rest in the wake of the Kate Spade buyout  however  Coach has the financial arsenal to pursue this acquisition in the future 
Although Kate Spade is its biggest deal to date  it had also tried to unsuccessfully merge itself with Burberry  the iconic British fashion powerhouse  The discussions which took place in 2016 would have created a 20 billion dollar fashion giant  Ultimately  talks ended with Burberry rejecting its offers 
But after  earlier this year in a newly formed position as leader of the Coach brand  it is safe to say that the company will likely remain active on the M A front for the foreseeable future 
Market Gives Thumbs Up To The Deal
Shares of Coach are currently trading around  46 00 per share which is near the highest level observed over the last year  The stock jumped over 15  since news of the Kate Spade deal were rumored  Overall  Wall Street analysts praised the deal  both in terms of the premium paid for the brand and the brand fit in the overall portfolio 

Acquisitions Stimulate Growth Tailwinds
As a result of the Coach s recent acquisitive nature  analysts believe that the company will grow at a faster pace over the next five years than its competition  Michael Kors  NYSE KORS   Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF   Ralph Lauren  NYSE NYSE RL  and American Eagle  NYSE AEO  
Coach s projected 5 year CAGR for revenue and net income of 7 4  and 16 3   respectively  is well above the entire peer group  Wall Street clearly has high hopes for the company s ability to increase its revenue base and expand margins by streamlining operations of its portfolio brands 
Source  
Coach s Multi Brand Play And Its PE Ratio Impact
Coach currently trades at 24 9x LTM earnings as compared to under 10 0x for Michael Kors  This reflects how bullish the market sentiment is for Coach and its growth prospects via acquisitions going forward  However  Tiffany trades at 25 3x earnings with mediocre growth prospects demonstrating that investors are willing to pay a premium for a luxury brand that is growing and well run Source  
Coach s LTM PE ratio has traded at 18 7x on average over the last five years which is well below its current multiple  However  the premium that the market has built into Coach s multiple is likely the result of the Kate Spade buyout in addition to potentially acquiring other iconic brands in the future  A multi brand company will also make LVMH a better comparison which trades at 28 3x earnings  So at 24 9x earnings  Coach may not be considered a cheap stock but it is also not an expensive stock relative to LVMH 
A Multi Brand Company Offers Nice Upside
As an investor  the consolidation approach being pursued by Coach can be extremely lucrative  The opportunity for cost savings is significant as duplication of procurement and other operational and corporate expenses are phased out  These savings directly flow to the bottom line making the case for buying Coach even more compelling 
Furthermore  excluding these cost savings and simply selecting a multiple of 26 8x  the average multiple of LVMH and Tiffany  to capitalize Coach s current earnings implies a fair value of nearly  50 per share  This represents that the stock still has over 10  upside on a relative basis 
Source  
The Future Looks Bright
Coach is an iconic brand but its vision to manifest itself into a luxury powerhouse with multiple brands will give it a platform to cut costs  drive better deals with marketers and push cross pollination of brands online  Kate Spade offers a new avenue for reaching millennials while Coach s luxury brand is a natural progression as this group grows older and wealthier 
CEO Victor Luis has made it clear since taking over in 2014 that the leathered goods maker  traditionally  plans to be acquisitive while it transforms itself into a multi brand portfolio company  The new executives hired in April will help stimulate this push forward as another billion dollar acquisition is likely on the horizon  Shareholders should also expect continued expansion of Coach s valuation multiples as the company s portfolio grows  When all said and done  the stock may end up being considered a bargain at its current price ",2017-06-16,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-coach-become-the-next-louis-vuitton-200195704,200195704

Lauren s adjusted gross profit margins expanded 90 bps to 55 4  owing to enhanced quality of sales  favorable geographic and channel mix shifts  lower promotions and reduced product costs  However  the improvement was partly offset by foreign currency headwinds Adjusted operating income margin expanded 10 bps to 6 5   Excluding the impact of 53rd week  operating margin expanded 60 bps  The year over year increase can mainly be attributed to gross margin expansion  partly negated by higher fixed expenses and 100 bps impact from currency FinancialsRalph Lauren ended fiscal 2017 with cash and

The U S  trade deficit fell in February as exports increased to a two year high and slowing domestic demand weighed on imports  The Commerce Department reports the trade deficit declined 9 6 percent to  43 6 billion  Some of the decline in imports in February likely reflects slower consumer spending 
Trade will probably be either neutral or impose a small drag on gross domestic product in the first quarter after subtracting 1 8 percentage points from fourth quarter growth  In addition to trade  weak consumer spending also likely constrained the economy in the first three months of the year  The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 1 2 percent rate in the first quarter  a deceleration from the 2 1 percent pace logged in the fourth quarter 
In a separate report  Factory orders rose 1  in February for the seventh increase in eight months  a sign of the rebounding fortunes of the manufacturing industry

Trump will need to come up with ways to raise revenue if he wants to lower tax rates without adding to the deficit  House Republicans have proposed raising revenue through a tax on imports known as border adjustment  but that proposal is opposed by several GOP senators 
Value added taxes are a type of consumption tax  while carbon taxes would be imposed on the manufacturing of some types of fuel  Later in the day  the White House issued a statement saying   As of now  neither a carbon tax nor a VAT are under consideration   One thing is certain though  tax reform will not be easy

In 2012  my conduct was inconsistent with those important confidentiality policies 

JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  CEO Jamie Dimon is out with his annual letter to shareholders  in which he discusses not only the bank s business outlook but also various current economic and political issues  Dimon said he has high hopes for the U S  but believes there is  something wrong  with the country as well  writing 

Our problems are significant  and they are not the singular purview of either political party  We need coherent  consistent  comprehensive and coordinated policies that help fix these problems 

Dimon added 

The solutions are not binary   they are not either or  and they are not about Democrats or Republicans  They are about facts  analysis  ideas and best practices  including what we can learn from others around the world  

Dimon noted that the U S  is  an exceptional country   but there are numerous areas where the country needs to improve  Among them are low wage growth  high health care costs and overcrowded prisons  Businesses are overburdened with regulations  the nation s infrastructure needs help  and the education system  is leaving too many behind   he added 
Among the other ills  Taxes are making U S  companies less competitive globally  income disparity is widening  and social mobility is decreasing  Dimon said 

The lack of economic growth and opportunity has led to deep and understandable frustration among so many Americans  It is understandable why so many are angry at the leaders of America s institutions  including businesses  schools and governments   they are right to expect us to do a better job 

Dimon listed 11 self inflicted problems for the economy  excessive regulation  high spending on wars  student loan growth  high health care costs  high skilled immigrants leaving the US  felony convictions leaving millions with criminal records  a tight mortgage market  the labor force participation rate is too low  education leaves too many behind  the need to invest in infrastructure  and a flawed corporate tax system 
On other issues  Dimon said he s concerned the U K  s departure from the European Union might trigger political unrest throughout the region that could split the currency union  resulting in  devastating economic and political effects   Dimon devoted more than a third of his letter to deregulation 
Dimon asserted that the Dodd Frank Act effectively ended the possibility of government bailouts for  too big to fail  banks  He also called for modifying the Financial Stability Oversight Council   the panel of regulators created by the Dodd Frank Act  however he did not call for repeal of Dodd Frank 
Separately  JPMorgan said in its annual report that it expects  49 billion of net interest income this year  up from about  46 billion in 2016  assuming additional loan growth and no changes in interest rates  Average core loan growth will be about 10 percent  and loan write offs will remain close to historically low levels 
In what appears to be a reference to Warren Buffett  Dimon talked about the  secret sauce  that powers the American economy  trust  In the past  Buffett has also talked about the  secret sauce   Dimon wrote 

A strong and vibrant private sector  including big companies  is good for the average American  Entrepreneurship and free enterprise  with strong ethics and high standards  are worth rooting for  not attacking 

Dimon is right  trust is important  but it can t be cajoled or demanded  It must be earned

117641,339156,RL,Ralph Lauren  RL  Tops Q2 Earnings  Reiterates FY17 View,opinion,Ralph Lauren Corporation   NYSE RL   reported second quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of  1 90 per share that fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 70 but declined 10 8  from  2 13 reported in the prior year quarter In response  the company s shares rose nearly 2  in the pre market trading session On a reported basis  the company posted earnings of 55 cents per share against  1 86 earned in the prior year quarter  Reported earnings for the quarter primarily included restructuring and other charges associated with the company s Way Forward plan  which was announced in Jun 2016 Way Forward PlanUnder its Way Forward plan  Ralph Lauren s management expects to generate annualized cost savings worth  180  220 million  on the back of its fiscal 2017 restructuring activities  These restructuring activities include rightsizing the portfolio and cost structure  alongside streamlining the structure of the organization  Further  the company expects to incur  400 million and  150 million by the end of fiscal 2017  on account of these restructuring charges and inventory charge associated with the company s Way Forward Plan  respectively RevenuesNet revenue of this luxury apparel retailer was down about 8  year over year to  1 821 million and slightly short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 829 million  On a currency neutral basis too  revenues fell nearly 8  in the quarter  Quarterly revenue growth was in line with the company s guidance of a mid to high single digits decline During the quarter  reported revenues for the International business increased 2   offset by a 12  fall in North American revenues Segment wise  Wholesale revenues witnessed a 10  decline year over year to  831 million  both on a reported and currency neutral basis  The decline in Wholesale revenues is attributed to the soft performance in North America due to lowered shipments as part of its Way Forward plan  partly compensated by a rise in Europe Reported Retail revenues dipped nearly 5  to  942 million  while currency neutral revenues fell 6  owing to a decline in comparable store sales  comps   which were down 8  on a reported basis and 9  in constant currency  The decline in comps was mainly attributed to reduced traffic partly negated by diminished markdowns Licensing revenues increased 2  to  48 million on a reported basis  while the same remained nearly flat in constant currency MarginsRalph Lauren s adjusted gross profit margins expanded 40 basis points  bps  to 56 9   owing to favorable geographic and channel mix shifts and early efforts under its Way Forward plan to lower product costs and enhance the quality of sales metrics  However  the improvement was partly neutralized by foreign currency headwinds Adjusted operating income margin contracted 110 bps to 12 4  but fared better than the previously guided 200 250 bps decline  The better than expected operating margin was primarily owing to international quality of sales initiatives  higher inventory productivity and a change in the timing of operating expenses  However  operating margin comparisons suffered due to fixed expense deleverage  offset by gross margin gains FinancialsRalph Lauren ended the quarter with cash and investments of  965 million  long term debt of  597 million and total shareholders  equity of  3 598 million Store UpdateAt the end of second quarter fiscal 2017  Ralph Lauren had 485 directly operated stores and 620 concession shops across the globe  The directly operated stores included 128 Ralph Lauren  82 Club Monaco and 275 Polo factory stores Additionally  the company s global licensing partners operated 102 Ralph Lauren stores and 59 Club Monaco stores  bringing the total number of licensed stores to 161  Additionally  the company had 97 licensed concession shops in operation as of Oct 1  2016 GuidanceRalph Lauren provided its outlook for third quarter while it reiterated its fiscal 2017 guidance  The company expects fiscal third quarter reported revenues to be down in the low double digits to down low teens range  This is expected to be driven by smooth execution of its quality of sales actions  lowered inventory receipts and fleet optimization plans in sync with its Way Forward plan   Though the company anticipates currency headwinds to have lesser impact on the company s revenue growth  it is likely to reduce gross margin by about 120 bps Operating margin for the upcoming quarter is expected to contract about 200 250 bps from last year  as the timing shift in operating expenses will pressure third quarter margins  with synergies from the cost savings initiatives under the Way Forward plan anticipated to be realized in fourth quarter  Effective tax rate is projected at 29  Coming to fiscal 2017  the company reiterated its low double digit percentage revenue decline forecast  in line with its Way Forward plan  The fall is likely to reflect from an intentional pullback in inventory receipts  closing of stores  harmonizing pricing and other quality of sale initiatives  However  the company expects currency to bear minimal effect on its fiscal 2017 revenues  based on current exchange rates Further  the company anticipates operating margin for fiscal 2017 at 10  reflecting a rise in new store expenses  negative currency impacts  infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage  offset by synergies from cost saving actions  The company expects an effective tax rate of 29

Yes  hope is in the air  and decidedly not the Obama kind  Once the smoke cleared from the surprise election results  market participants now see a clear path to increased growth and prosperity  with a Republican Congress providing tailwinds  President elect Trump looks to have smooth sailing ahead for reducing corporate taxes  de regulating Wall Street  and other projects on his to do list starting next year 
Not only near term market activity  but 10 year bond yields have also broken out  from stubbornly low 1 7s all through the summer  we now see a 2 11  yield in the 10 year  This is the highest read since January 
These Japanese Nikkei has even bounced back    6  over night  and other Asian markets were up  as well  The yen is up  as is the British pound  while the euro has slipped overnight  The WTI and Brent crude oil reads are down 1  and 0 5   respectively  at this hour 
This may put a new wrinkle into next month s Fed decision to raise rates  This new hopefulness the market seems to be feeling may push economic activity forward  and if that happens the Fed may have no choice but to bump up interest rates another quarter point on December 14th   especially now that Trump announced yesterday he does not intend to seek the resignation of Fed Chair Janet Yellen Jobless Claims Down Again

Nordstrom Inc  NYSE JWN   Nordstroms along with Macy s and the rest of the names mentioned on this list was the beneficiary of better than expected earnings last quarter  The upscale department store was hit hardest from the changes in the retail environment that witnessed a shift away from luxury brands towards value channels  Shares are down 23  in the past 12 months but have since recovered to flat in 2016  Nordstrom s investments to expand its omnichannel capabilities along with efficient cost controls and store expansions remain driving factors for top line growth  Needless to say the overall rebound in the retail sector is well off its peaks with overall growth running negative 
Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS   Exceedingly low expectations made it easier for Kohl s to top its quarterly results in the second quarter  Despite topping expectations  the Q2 results included a 1 8  decline in comparable store sales on a 2  decline in total revenue  Sluggish comps could see a boost in the third quarter that includes the pivotal back to school season and tend to drive traffic trends  Continued efforts to improve its base business and maintains its strategic initiatives  Greatness Agenda  should help drive growth through the holiday season  Kohls along with its peers should remain cautious about the weak spending environment and continued adoption of ecommerce platforms 
Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL   Luxury brands have been amongst the worst performers in the broader retail sector as consumers shift their spending towards value channels  Ralph Lauren  in particular  has seen shares drop 28  in the past 12 months on sluggish comparisons  challenging retail trends and numerous store closures  Margins have been hurt from frequent discounting to compete with the value oriented retailers  negative currency translation and heavy infrastructure investments  Efficient cost controls may offset some of the losses while a recently applied restructuring strategy will help long term performance 
Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE KORS   After weak revenue results from Kate Spade   Co  NYSE KATE  and Coach Inc  NYSE COH  already this season  luxury brands appear to be unraveling  This doesn t bode well for Michael Kors who reports its third quarter results on Thursday  With a large exposure to volatile international markets and currency headwinds  both earnings and revenue could see their first downturn in over a year  after just getting by with flat growth in Q2  Estimates are seeing downward revisions activity ahead of its report  typically a sign of a miss on the horizon 
The main focus for KORS will be comps which in the past were driven by new store openings  expanding existing outlets and building out its omnichannel capabilities  But the retail environment is more challenging these days  Luxury brands and longtime status symbols are simply not resonating with consumers like they have in the past  As a result we have seen a great deal of discounting from key brands including Michael Kors  Discounting may very well drive sales but it also puts pressure on margins ",2016-11-09,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-retail-stocks-to-watch-that-report-earnings-tomorrow-200163767,200163767

surpassing estimates for the ninth consecutive quarter  Further  the company raised its earnings guidance for fiscal 2016  thus keeping the stock active in the after hours trading session yesterday The company s adjusted earnings per share of  1 47 not only significantly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 28  but also exceeded its own guidance range of  1 25  1 30  Also  the bottom line rose 7 3  year over year  despite having borne the adverse effects of about 46 cents per share from foreign currency headwinds  On a GAAP basis  PVH Corp  reported earnings of  1 11 per share that dipped 9  from  1 22 earned in the year ago quarter PVH CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Quarter in DetailPVH Corp  s total revenue gained nearly 4  to  1 933 3 million  but fell marginally short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 937 million  However  top line growth was in line with the company s projections  On a constant currency basis  the company s total revenue rose 5   coming in line with management s expectations Revenue growth was mainly driven by continued strength noted in the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands  particularly in international markets  The company is especially pleased with the spectacular performance of these brands in Europe and Asia  However  the top line miss can be attributed to the persistent weakness in the U S retail businesses due to soft traffic and consumer spending trends at its Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein U S  stores located in international tourist locations Adjusted gross profit rose 4 7  year over year to  1 038 2 million  with the adjusted gross margin expanding 50 basis points  to 53 7  Segment AnalysisPVH Corp  reports its financial results under three business segments  Calvin Klein  Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands Calvin Klein s revenue escalated 12  year over year to  726 million  On a currency neutral basis  it was up 15   driven by a respective 12  and 17  currency neutral revenue increase in the brand s North American and International business North American operations gained strength from solid wholesale business growth  which in turn was driven by robust performance across all businesses  On the other hand  the brand s retail sales witnessed only modest upside as benefits from store expansions were partly offset by soft comparable store sales  comps   Comps fell 4  year over year  on account of continued weak traffic and decreased consumer spending trends across the company s U S  stores in international tourist locations The brand s international business  comps jumped 11  on the back of strength in its European and Asian operations Revenue at the company s Tommy Hilfiger segment increased 6  to  860 million  while it rose 7  on a constant currency basis  backed by 3  and 11  constant currency sales growth in the brand s North American International businesses  respectively Tommy Hilfiger s North American revenue growth was attributed to strength in its wholesale business  offset by persistent softness in its retail operations  Evidently  comps for the brand s North American business tumbled 7   attributable to persistent softness in traffic and consumer spending trends at its U S  stores in international tourist locations On the other hand  the brand s international business continued to gain from strength in Europe and its Apr 2016 acquisition of the remaining 55  interest in TH China  Comps for the international business rose 8  The Heritage Brands segment s revenues slumped 14  year over year to  347 million due to the ongoing rationalization of this business by exiting various lines of business  As a part of this  the company recently shut down its Izod retail division and discontinued numerous licensed product lines in its dress furnishing business  Additionally  quarterly results were hurt by weakness in the neckwear category and a timing shift of wholesale shipments into the third quarter this year compared with the second quarter last year  These were  however  somewhat offset by a 11  jump in its Van Heusen comps FinancialsThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  741 7 million  long term debt  excluding current maturities of  3 358 2 million  and shareholders  equity of  4 803 5 million During the first half of fiscal 2016  the company repurchased about 1 4 million shares for roughly  129 million of common

	Chicago  IL   September 06  2016    highlights Cotiviti    as the Bull of the Day and  Luxottica Group    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  Haylard Health    

	Here is a synopsis of all three stocks 

  

Cotiviti     is a leader in payment accuracy solutions for major healthcare payers in the U S   along with audit and recovery for top retailers across the U S   U K  and Canada  The company acts as payment auditors for primarily the healthcare industry  but also focuses in retail  Cotiviti provides services to eight of the top ten U S  healthcare payers and helps clients capture over  3 billion annually through improved payment accuracy  The recent IPO is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and todays Bull of the Day after an impressive EPS beat and rising estimates 

	Cotiviti has a market cap of  3 billion with a Forward PE of 27  The stock has been strong since its IPO pricing back in May at  19  which it has surged over 65  since  In addition  the company also sits in a strong industry that is ranked 67 out of 265  Top 25   in the Zacks Industry Rank 

	The company s recent earnings  recent estimate revisions higher and broker upgrades make the stock very tempting to buy here at post IPO highs 

Q2 Earnings

	Q2 was reported on August 9th  when the company beat by 9 cents and beat on revenue  Q2 was seen at  0 37 versus the  0 29 expected  with revenue coming in above expectations at  158 3 million verse  146 million  The company also guided fiscal year 2016 above the 600 million expected  and now sees  610 615 million in revenue  In addition  adjusted EBITDA was seen almost 20  higher year over year  going from  52 6 million to  63 million 

	The stock responded to the strong Q2 earnings report  by spiking from  24 to  33 over a period of two weeks  After a one day pullback of 15  the stock has rallied and take out post earnings highs  This pullback under  30 was a fantastic opportunity to get long  as the stock looks poised to go even higher along with its estimate revisions 

Estimates

	Since the EPS report  revisions to estimates have gone higher for both fiscal year 2016 and 2017  For 2016  estimates have ticked 42  over the last 30 days  from  1 06 to  1 17  For 2017  estimates have been revised 24  higher  from  1 21 to  1 28  The stock next reports in November where estimates have stagnated over the last 90 days  If the company sees another beat  expect investors to rush into the stock in anticipation of more revisions higher 

Broker Upgrades

	In the days following the EPS report a couple brokers raised price targets for the stock  JP Morgan raised from  22 to  28  while Barclays  LON BARC  raise from  22 to  31  The stock was trading at  24 before earnings and the price targets have already been hit  so look for future upgrades from these two 

	Recently Baird Equity Research was out with another upgrade and a  39 price target  They base their target on a 15X multiple applied to the 2018 estimates  Baird s note went onto say that the need to curb healthcare spending  combined with payment complexity should support their 10 12  growth outlook  In addition  the Cotiviti s high margins and low capex results in strong cash flow and capital deployment optionality 

In Summary

	When a company comes to market in form of an IPO  the first six months  performance is an important indicator of future performance  So far Cotviti has impressed investors and analysts alike  Look for the stock to continue to drift higher into the next EPS report and possibly be a future Wall Street favorite

117683,339198,RL,The Economy  It s Worse Than We Thought,opinion," The economy is tanking and  while you may be the most pessimistic around  you may not be pessimistic enough  
To that I would say that I m significantly more bearish than is reflected in my public analysis  I spoke to a couple people today who offered anecdotal stories about their particular business niches   businesses in which new orders are somewhat tied to discretionary spending   and they both said that new business activity is unusually slow and that the last time they experienced new order flow this slow this was in 2008 
I ve been suggesting for most of this year that retail sales were slowing and would fall off a cliff heading into fall  I presented RL as a short idea in my on August 14th at  108 after visiting the Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  store in Aspen  I was the only person in the entire store and I was being hounded by the salesperson to the point of being uncomfortable 
RL is at  100 80 as I write this  which is a 7 2  ROR in 4 weeks for anyone who shorted the stock  Based on the point of last trade and where I recommended them  the January 2017  85 strike puts are up 35    so far  But the bigger gains will be made holding RL short when it drops to  40  where it was in early 2009 before the Fed s money printing stimulated credit induced retail spending 
My outlook on retail is supported by the BAC credit card spending report posted in  today  Based on BAC  aggregate card data   retail sales ex autos declined  1  in August from July and  3  in July from June  The 3 month average  Jun Aug  is down  2   These numbers are  seasonally adjusted   which means the actuals are probably worse 
BAC s data for department store sales show that they re down 4 6  year over year in August  Autopart sales are in a downtrend and beginning to comp negatively  Auto parts sales are highly correlated with vehicle unit sales  which are entering a downturn based on July and August numbers  especially if you strip out Chrysler s  
The weak retail sales reflect the deteriorating income and financial status of the average American household  And so do restaurant sales  Restaurant industry sales tracked by Black Box Intelligence show a  6  decline in August in same store sales  but same store traffic was down 2 7   This was the third consecutive month same store sales declined  with monthly sequential declines in 6 out of 8 months this year 
It s expected that Q3 corporate earnings will once again decline from Q2  This will be six quarters in a row that earnings drop  But it s even worse than that because the changes to accounting standards  GAAP  have enabled companies to manipulate their earnings reports to the upside  Despite those accounting gimmicks  earnings continue to drop 
The stimulative effects of the Fed s money printing program have faded  The subprime debt default crisis that plagued the housing market in 2008 has been replaced by a general reflation of subprime credit issuance that includes housing  autos  student loans and personal loans 
Synchrony  formerly GE Capital Retail Bank  is advertising a high yield  that pays 1 1  interest  or 8x the national average  That s because Synchrony is using depositor money to fund a plethora of high interest rate consumer lending platforms which primarily appeal to subprime borrowers  I would strongly advise avoiding this savings account because  even with alleged FDIC coverage  you might not see your money when Synchrony impales itself on the toxic loans it makes  Look for Synchrony to blow up sometime in the next 24 months  Same with Capitol One  Ally Financial and Credit Acceptance Corporation  among others 
The Fed will not only not raise rates this year   or anytime in the foreseeable future for that matter   but watch for signs that another big dose of  QE  is being tee d up  Otherwise our financial system and economy is headed into that same abyss into which it stared in 2008 ",2016-09-14,David I.

117754,339269,RL,Kellogg To Open Luxury Cereal Cafe In New York,opinion,"Would you pay  7 for a bowl of Frosted Flakes 
No  What if it was combined with Special K and sprinkled with pistachios and thyme 
What about a bowl of Fruit Loops with lime zest and marshmallows  Or some Honey Smacks with toasted pecans and banana chips 
Still no  Well  if you change your mind  you can visit Kellogg Co    NYSE K   s first ever caf  dedicated to cereal  that traditional breakfast staple  in New York City s Time Square  NYSE SQ   Opening on July 4  the restaurant was designed by Anthony Rudolf  who founded the members only restaurant professional club Journee and is the director of operations for chef Thomas Keller s restaurants  and has a sleek  intimate atmosphere 
Sales of cereal have been on the decline for years  as consumers are turning to more convenient  on the go breakfast options like yogurt or fast food breakfast sandwiches  Kellogg hopes to rebrand cereal by creating a dining experience that is exciting  luxe  and modern 
The menu was developed by Christina Tosi  who is the chef and founder of  bakeries in New York  Washington D C   and Toronto  It features Kellogg s classic cereals like Frosted Flakes  Chex  Rice Krispies  and Raisin Bran  among others  and in addition to the combinations mentioned above  customers can order cereal that goes way beyond the kitchen  For example  The Corny Blues mixes Kellogg s Corn Pops with blueberry jam  lemon zest  and just a pinch of salt  while The Chai Line uses fresh peaches and Chai tea powder on top of Crispix  You can even order Rice Krispies topped with ice cream  strawberries  and matcha powder 
In terms of price  a small bowl costs  6 50 and the large is  7 50  or roughly two times the cost of an entire box of any of these cereals at your grocery store of choice 
 Customers will pick up orders via a set of  kitchen cabinets   a kind of un automated automat  Inside the door will be their food and a little surprise  like those found in a box of cereal  Most days  it will be a small treat a plastic ring or a morning newspaper  But there are also plans in the works to give away several tickets to the Broadway smash Hamilton   notes  
Kellogg is following in the footsteps of other commercial food brands who have launched restaurants or pop up shops  There are M M World Stores in Las Vegas  New York  Orlando  London  and Shanghai  gourmet yogurt brand Chobani has a store in New York s SoHo neighborhood  and soon in Tribeca  and PepsiCo Inc    NYSE PEP   will soon unveil a new restaurant dubbed Kola House that specializes in cocktails inspired by the   Even fashion brands like Ralph Lauren   NYSE RL   has Polo Bar  its name brand restaurant on Fifth Avenue in New York  and Armani has luxury hotels in Milan and Dubai 
More than anything  this venture is about direct  clever marketing  It takes a standard  somewhat boring breakfast option and reinvents it  presented to consumers in a new  attractive way  John Stanton  a food marketing professor at Philadelphia s St  Joseph s University  said to the Journal that   cereal companies  are trying all different ways to get their name in front of consumers It s just that everything they did in the past is not going to be what makes companies successful in the future  
Have you changed your mind yet  Maybe  Because I don t know about you  but I would probably pay  6 50 for a small bowl of The Corny Blues or Frosted Flakes and Special K topped with pistachios and thyme  Only once though  and really  only to get a chance to win tickets to see Hamilton ",2016-06-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kellogg-to-open-luxury-cereal-cafe-in-new-york-200139053,200139053

117758,339273,RL,Rio Olympics  Zika And More,opinion,"The 2016 Rio Summer Olympics are in full swing  with the USA typically leading in the overall medal count behind big wins in the pool from Michael Phelps  Katie Ledecky and others  the women s gymnastics team  etc  But we ve also seen empty seats at various Olympic venues this time around  and a big reason for this might be the threat of the mosquito borne Zika virus 

Zika causes microcephaly  according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention  along with other brain defects in fetuses  This is obviously a major concern of pregnant women or women with the capacity to become pregnant  which may have caused plenty of cancellations to Rio de Janeiro  Brazil for the Olympic Games this year 

It s not only Brazil that s affected by this nasty virus   22 countries have reported Zika cases  including 21 in the U S  Four more cases have been reported in Florida recently  in the Miami area  Scientists fear these numbers will continue to climb  and those close to this contagion are imploring Congress to take action to stop it 

Inovio Pharma  is leading the charge toward eradicating the Zika virus  and although the company reported a Q2 loss on the bottom line  it brought in improved revenues for the quarter  The small cap pharma firm has been trading down recently  but is up 55  over the past 6 months 

Speaking of Florida  The Walt Disney Co   is riding high in the pre markets on top and bottom line beats for its fiscal Q3 earnings reported after the bell Tuesday  Among the positive surprises was bigger spending in the U S  theme parks  Disneyland Paris is still enduring a downturn  and Asian parks are holding steady overall   However  should the Zika virus threaten up the Florida peninsula  we might expect some empty seats at Epcot Center akin to those at the Rio Olympics currently 

Later this morning  we expect the U S  government s JOLTS report   Job Opportunity Labor Turnover   to give some additional perspective to the current U S  jobs market  This will be followed by the July fed budget statement due out this afternoon

117759,339274,RL,Ralph Lauren  RL  Stock Up On Q2 Earnings And Sales Beat,opinion,"Ralph Lauren Corporation  NYSE RL   reported a solid first quarter fiscal 2017 as the top and bottom lines cruised ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  In response  the company s shares rose over 6  in the pre market trading session and opened to trade at up nearly 8  
	Adjusted earnings of  1 06 per share fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents but declined 2 8  from  1 09 reported in the prior year quarter 






	On a reported basis  the company posted a loss of 27 cents per share against earnings of 73 cents in the prior year quarter  Reported earnings for the quarter primarily included restructuring  impairment and inventory charges related to the company s recently announced restructuring actions Quarterly Highlights
	Net revenue of this luxury apparel retailer was down 4  year over year to  1 552 million but ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 528 million  On a currency neutral basis too  revenues fell 4  in the quarter  Quarterly revenue growth was in line with the company s recently provided guidance of a mid single digit decline 
	During the quarter  reported revenues for the International business increased 10   offset by an 11  fall in North American revenues 
	Segment wise  Wholesale revenues witnessed a 5  decline year over year to  607 million  both on a reported and currency neutral basis  Similarly  reported and currency neutral Retail revenues dipped nearly 3  to  907 million  while licensing reported and currency neutral revenues were down 8  to  38 million 
	Consolidated comparable store sales  comps  at the retail division were down 7  on a constant currency basis  and 6  on a reported basis owing to challenging traffic trends 
	The decline in Wholesale revenues is attributed to the soft performance in North America due to adverse traffic trends in the U S  department store channel  partly compensated by a rise in Europe  In Retail  sales were hurt by a fall in comps  offset by improved non comparable store sales 
	Ralph Lauren s adjusted gross profit margin expanded 130 bps to 61 1   owing to favorable sales mix shifts  fall in product costs and a rise in Asia due to actions to enhance the quality of sales metrics 
	Adjusted operating income margin contracted 60 bps to 8 2  but fared better than the previously guided 110 160 bps decline  The better than expected operating margin was mainly due to better inventory control actions and a favorable product mix  However  operating margin comparisons suffered due to fixed expense deleverage and gross margin pressures Financials
	Ralph Lauren ended the quarter with cash and investments of  1 2 billion  long term debt of  602 million and total shareholders  equity of  3 566 million 
	During the reported quarter  Ralph Lauren deployed  78 million toward capital expenditure  Also  the company repurchased shares worth  100 million during the quarter  with about  200 million remaining under the current authorization Store Update
	At the end of first quarter fiscal 2017  Ralph Lauren had 485 directly operated stores and 598 concession shops across the globe  The directly operated stores included 132 Ralph Lauren  81 Club Monaco and 272 Polo factory stores  This took the company s net new directly operated stores  count to 18 and net new concession shops  count to 40 
	Additionally  the company s global licensing partners operated 96 Ralph Lauren stores  17 dedicated shops as well as 134 Club Monaco stores and shops as of Jul 2  2016 Guidance
	Ralph Lauren provided its outlook for the second quarter and fiscal 2017  The company expects fiscal second quarter reported revenues to be down in the mid to high single digits range  with minimal impact from currency headwinds at current exchange rates  Operating margin for the upcoming quarter is expected to contract about 200 250 bps from last year  while the effective tax rate is projected at 29   The company expects the initiatives related to its Way Forward Plan to bear a greater effect on its second half fiscal 2017 results than the second quarter results 
	Coming to fiscal 2017  the company reiterated its low double digit percentage revenue decline forecast  The fall is likely to reflect from an intentional pullback in inventory receipts  closing of stores  harmonizing pricing  and other quality of sale initiatives  along with challenging retail traffic trends and a highly promotional retail backdrop  However  the company expects currency to bear minimal effect on its fiscal 2017 revenues  based on current exchange rates 
	Further  the company anticipates operating margin for fiscal 2017 at 10  reflecting a rise in new store expenses  negative currency impacts  infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage  offset by synergies from cost saving actions  The company expects an effective tax rate of 29  
	The company also stated that its fiscal second quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance excludes any impact from the Way Forward Plan related charges

	The planning stage of long term corporate projects is complicated and tends to run into unforeseen difficulties  But when  after many months of planning and preparing  the strategy comes to fruition it is a wonderful thing to witness  This is the case with the Zacks Bull of the Day  Post Holdings     This company  through strategic planning  calculated acquisitions  and cost containment has caused management to increase guidance for fiscal year 2016 

	This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company is a manufacturer  marketer and distributor of branded ready to eat cereals in the United States and Canada  The Company s products are manufactured through a production platform consisting of four owned primary facilities and sold through a variety of channels such as grocery stores  mass merchandisers  club stores  and drug stores  Its portfolio of brands includes diverse offerings such as Honey Bunches of Oats  Pebbles  Post Selects  Great Grains  Spoon Size Shredded Wheat  Post Raisin Bran  Grape Nuts and Honeycomb  Post Holdings Inc  is based in St  Louis  Missouri 

Strong Q2 16 Earnings Report 

	In their most recent earnings report Post Holdings almost doubled the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate  and handily beat the Zacks Consensus Revenue Estimate  Specifically  the company saw year over year gains in net sales   20 7    gross profit   48 6    and adjusted EBITDA   66 1    Moreover  the company saw gains in net sales in all four divisions  Post Consumer Brands  Michael Foods Group  Active Nutrition  and Private Brands  According to management     The sales increase was driven by the fiscal 2015 acquisition of MOM Brands and the fiscal 2016 acquisition of Willamette Egg Farms  as well as organic sales growth    

Management Raised Guidance for FY 2016

	Because of the strong Q2 16 performance management increased their fiscal 2016 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range between  893m to  913m  this is up from the previous guidance range of  810m to  840m  Further  according to management  they continue    to expect to achieve  50 million in run rate annualized cost synergies within the Post Consumer Brands segment by the end of fiscal year 2016 and also announced an additional  25 million in run rate annualized cost synergies  which are expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2018    

  

	The retail sector has and continues to be extremely competitive and volatile  Specifically  in the apparel segment competition  cost cutting  and lowering headcounts have kept pressure on the sector for quite some time  For example  it was announced yesterday that Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  will be shutting down 50 stores and eliminating almost 1 000 jobs  This tough environment is the reason Abercrombie   Fitch     is the Zacks Bear of the Day 

	This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company is principally engaged in the purchase  distribution and sale of men s  women s and kids  casual apparel  The company s retail activities are conducted under the Abercrombie   Fitch and abercrombie trade names through retail stores  a catalogue  a magazine catalogue and a website  all bearing some form of the company name  Merchandise is targeted to appeal to customers in specialty markets who have distinctive consumer characteristics 

Recent Earnings Results

	In their most recent earnings announcement  the company beat the Zacks consensus revenue estimate  but came in way below the Zacks consensus earnings estimate  came in at   0 16 against the expectation of  0 12  Specifically  comparable same store sales  SSS  saw a  4  decline in both brands and geography  On the international side  comps declined in Asia  and all across Europe  Also  brand net sales fell  5   and geography net sales fell  5   Management also saw SG A expenses increased by 6 4 

	According to Arthur Martinez  Executive Chairman   Our results for the quarter reflect significant traffic headwinds  particularly in international markets and in our U S  flagship and tourist stores  resulting in negative comparable sales  However  in the face of these headwinds  we were encouraged by our U S  business  where comparable sales improved in the Hollister brand  and gross margin rate increased meaningfully for both brands  Overall  our business remains well managed in these challenging times  with our assortment and customer centricity efforts driving improved conversion  and expense and inventory well controlled 

Potential in Second Half of 2016

	Currently  management expects to see strength in the second half of 2016  Mr  Martinez commented on the second half stating   We expect the second quarter to remain challenging  but to see better results in the back half of the year as our assortments continue to improve and we see returns from significant investments in marketing  store management and omnichannel  In addition  with the new brand presidents and other key roles now filled  we have a strong team in place to drive our brands forward and capitalize on the many opportunities we see ahead of us

Facebook  Amazon Battle for Live Videogame Streaming

	Facebook    and Blizzard have announced the integration of Facebook login and Facebook Live application programming interfaces  APIs  with the game developer s Battle net gaming client 

	This means that starting later this month  serious gamers who also frequent Facebook can login with Facebook IDs to play Blizzard titles like the new Overwatch and other Battle net games  What s more  thanks to the Facebook Live integration  they can broadcast their gameplay live to their followers on Facebook 

	If it s a hit  Facebook might consider extending the time limit from the current 30 minutes allowed per Live stream  At any rate  they can create multiple live streams of 30 minutes each that are displayed on their timelines as videos 

Why s This Significant 

	For one thing  it could make Facebook a hub for sharing live gameplay 

	User generated content  and particularly gameplay  has captured people s imagination in recent times  leading to the popularity of platforms such as Alphabet s    YouTube and Amazon s     Twitch  Both of these platforms were acquired by the tech giants in an attempt to monetize through ads and subscriptions 

	Google s ad serving network and Amazon s retail business were natural supporters of this business  Facebook is just starting out  so it may not generate a lot of revenue right away  But advertisers certainly like its huge user base and professional content creators will appreciate its analytics  Facebook can churn out huge amounts of viewership data based on the user data it accumulates  

Amazon and Google Should Take Notice 

	Nothing will happen overnight of course  and Facebook may not even try to monetize the product until it has a significant fan following  similar to what it s done with other products  But if it s popular  there will definitely be ads and somewhere along the line  professional content along with subscriptions 

	So this is just the beginning  we should expect it to disrupt Twitch and YouTube Gaming in the future  The older platforms have a stickier community but this doesn t mean the companies can just sit back and relax 

Recommendations

	Facebook has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Amazon and Alphabet are ranked  3  Hold

Commentary The S P 500 nudged higher with marginal gains thanks to a late day fade from the highs  The meager 0 1  gain on the day was of course unimpressive  Yet other indicators were a lot more encouraging  T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   followed through on the previous day s punch into overbought territory with a close at 73 4   This close near the highs of the day and a 2 48 percentage point gain delivered the convincing follow through gain that the index did not  Even the NASDAQ underwhelmed with a 0 1  loss on the day 
The highlight of the day was T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  Like T2108  T2107 followed through on the previous day s gain  but it did not deliver the big breakout from the post recession downtrend that I am eager to see  The chart below is a close up on the recent action with the downtrend line represented by the black line in the upper right corner  T2107 closed right under that line after a small fade 

No breakout quite yet for T2107
The volatility index  the VIX  made an interesting move by gapping down to 12 77 and then rallying for the rest of the day  The VIX is valiantly trying to hold the lows of the recent range  The failure of the VIX to proceed lower provides perfect tension against the market s attempt to break out to a new all time high 
The volatility index rallies almost the entire day to recover from an initial gap down 
Two big moves caught most of my attention on the day  housing and retail 
The iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  popped 1 6  to easily out perform the S P 500 on the day  Despite a fade from the intraday high  ITB still managed to score a marginal 6 month high  This is the follow through buying I was looking for to confirm that the ITB likely has more room to run past the expiration of   I will be launching a fresh tranche of call options on ITB and getting back into Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL   TOL looks like it sells well under potential value 
The iShares US Home Construction  ITB  pops as buying volume picks up as well 

Toll Brothers  TOL  has not quite broken out yet  Even when it does  the 200DMA looms overhead as downtrend resistance 
Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  provided the other big move  The stock gapped down at the open for a 10 2  loss  Buyers took over from there with a bold move to completely close the gap  This move is another example of the eagerness of buyers to grab  bargains   the move represents an underlying preference to buy over sell in the current market  Before I turned cautiously bullish on the market  I had targeted SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  for a short given all the bad news from retailers this past earnings cycle  RL reminded me that sentiment may have already turned for the better in the sector 
Ralph Lauren posts a very impressive post earnings recovery 

The SPDR S P Retail ETF  XRT  has steadily recovered since last month s low  XRT has almost filled the losses from the Macy s Inc  NYSE M  debacle 

Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  has started to fill its post earnings gap down

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  rose 18 points  0 1   to 17 938  the S P 500 Index added 3 points  0 1   to 2 112  while the Nasdaq Composite was 7 points  0 1   lower at 4 962  In moderate volume  851 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 7 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq  WTI crude oil rose  0 67 to  50 36 per barrel  wholesale gasoline was unchanged at  1 59 per gallon  while the Bloomberg gold spot price fell  1 59 to  1 243 85 per ounce  Elsewhere  the Dollar Index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was nearly unchanged at 93 85 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc   NYSE VRX  25  reported 1Q earnings per share  EPS  ex items of  1 27  below the  1 36 FactSet estimate  as revenues rose 9 0  year over year  y y  to  2 4 billion  roughly in line with forecasts  VRX cut its full year guidance as the company noted significant disruption that it has faced and challenges that are needed to be worked through in certain business operations  such as its U S  dermatology unit  Shares tumbled nearly 15  
FedEx Corp   NYSE FDX  165  announced a 60  increase of its quarterly dividend to  0 40 per share  payable July 1  2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 16  2016  FDX was higher 
Biogen Inc  NASDAQ BIIB    BIIB  253  was sharply lower after the company s experimental treatment for multiple sclerosis missed the primary endpoint in a study 
Ralph Lauren Corp   NYSE RL  94  was lower after the company announced a restructuring plan  including store closures and job cuts  after forecasting a larger than expected drop in revenues for the current year  Shares have come well off of the worst levels of the day 
1Q productivity and labor costs revised higher  consumer credit expands modestly 
Final 1Q nonfarm productivity    was revised to a 0 6  decline on an annualized basis  from the preliminary 1 0  drop  matching the Bloomberg expectation  4Q productivity was unrevised at a 1 7  decline  Also  unit labor costs were adjusted to a 4 5  rise  from the 4 1  increase initially reported  and compared to forecasts calling for a revision to a 4 0  gain  Unit labor costs rose by an upwardly revised 5 4  in 4Q 
Consumer credit  released in the final hour of trading  showed consumer borrowing expanded by  13 4 billion during April  short of the  18 0 billion forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg  while March s figure was adjusted downward to a level of  28 4 billion from the originally reported  29 7 billion  Non revolving debt  which includes student loans and loans for vehicles and mobile homes  rose  11 8 billion  while revolving debt  which includes credit cards  rose by  1 6 billion 
Treasuries finished higher  with the yields on the 2 year and 10 Year notes  as well as the 30 Year bond  all declining 2 basis points  bps  to 0 78   1 72  and 2 54   respectively  Bond yields rose modestly yesterday as the global markets digested the speech by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen  Yellen spoke following Friday s much softer than expected May nonfarm payroll report  and she made no mention of a time frame for the next rate increase 
However  she noted that she continues to think the fed funds rate will probably need to rise gradually over time and in light of the recent employment report   my colleagues and I will be wrestling with  new questions about the economic outlook that have been raised  Yellen added that her overall assessment is that the current stance of monetary policy is generally appropriate  in that it is providing support to the economy and will help return inflation to 2 0  
Items on tomorrow s  include the JOLTS Job Openings report  a measure of unmet demand for labor  expected to show 5 68 million jobs were available to be filled in April  down slightly from the 5 78 million posted in the prior month  as well as MBA Mortgage Applications 
Europe and Asia higher following Fed comments and data 
European equities traded higher  with oil   gas issues strengthening on the continued rally in crude oil prices  and as the global markets showed some optimism following yesterday s speech from Fed Chair Yellen  who provided a relatively upbeat economic outlook but did not provide a time frame for the Central Bank s next rate hike  Some economic data in the region likely helped the mood  with eurozone 1Q GDP being revised higher to a 0 6  quarter over quarter pace of growth from the preliminary rate of 0 5  and an acceleration from the 0 4  expansion seen in 4Q 
Also  German industrial production rose more than expected in April  Concerns about the possibility that the U K  could vote to leave the European Union  EU   known as a Brexit  were eased after recent polls showed support for it to remain in the EU  The British pound rallied and the euro was little changed versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region were mostly lower 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly higher  with the global markets reacting positively to yesterday s comments from U S  Fed Chief Yellen  while the yen weakened to boost Japanese stocks and the recent rally in commodity markets helped sentiment  Also  traders digested monetary policy decisions out of India and Australia  Mainland Chinese equities and those listed in Hong Kong advanced amid strength in real estate developers and energy issues  as well as lingering speculation of an imminent announcement of a link between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen exchanges  South Korean stocks rose nicely after being closed yesterday for a holiday  and Australia s market moved higher  with oil   gas and basic materials issues showing solid strength  while the Australian dollar rallied in the wake of the Reserve Bank of Australia s decision to keep its monetary policy stance unchanged 
Finally  Indian equities finished higher  with banking stocks gaining ground  after the Reserve Bank of India  RBI  left its benchmark interest rates unchanged  The RBI s decision comes amid uncertainty regarding the future of the nation s central bank Governor Rajan as his tenure is up for renewal in September and he has come under political fire from a key member of the nation s ruling party

Fed chief Janet Yellen on Monday called last week s U S  jobs numbers disappointing and opted not to repeat her message that U S  interest rates could rise again in the coming months  That was balanced  however  by her cautioning against attaching too much significance to the payrolls data in isolation and as she pointed to other more upbeat signals for the economy and indicated rate hikes this year would still be appropriate 
On Friday  when the jobs report came in at a very weak 38 000 jobs added  the markets were down slightly  Clearly the news from the jobs report had the effect of taking a June rate hike off the table  In the past  the markets would have rallied on that kind of news  but it made for terrible optics  and so we had to wait for Fed chair Yellen to not say anything  And besides  the markets had already priced in no rate hike in June  So  what s going on here 
The S P 500 has gone 42 trading days without a decline of 1  or more  That s the longest stretch without a big drop since a 66 day period that ended in July 2014  according to FactSet  The U S  stock market hasn t dropped by 1  or more since April 7  During one particularly scary stretch in mid February  the S P 500 suffered three plunges of 1  or more on separate occasions in just five days  This slow steady advance leaves the market in extremely overbought territory 
Economic data remains weak  we just wrapped up another horrible earnings season  valuations remain expensive  we are moving into a seasonally weak time period  the yield curve is flattening  volume is weak 
Meanwhile  the bullish case for this market is tenuous at best  It might be bullish   if the Fed keeps rates unchanged  if the economy bounces back in the second half  we ve already given up on a second quarter bounce   if earnings improve  which is plausible given how low the bar is now set   if oil trades higher  even though higher oil prices will surely lead to higher supplies   if the dollar doesn t firm up again  if there is no Brexit  and if the markets continue to ignore the data 
You get the idea  Still  it is possible to take out the old highs on the S P  even without a bullish case  If that happens I would still be left wondering what is pushing the bullish case  other than a herd mentality that is not sustainable  Today  stocks moved to an 11 month high and then faltered on weak volume 
Productivity remains a key weakness of the economy and is especially evident during the low output of the first quarter  American workers were less productive again in the first quarter  The Labor Department productivity declined at an annual rate of 0 6 percent in the first quarter after a 1 7 percent drop in the fourth quarter 
The government first estimated that productivity fell at a 1 percent rate  Not only did hours exceed output  compensation rose at the same time  up 3 9 percent to lift unit labor costs by 4 5 percent  even faster than the 4 1 percent gain first reported  Though there seems to still be a belief that wage growth remains sluggish  in reality  wages have finally begun to move higher in earnest  The anecdotal and survey evidence has been pointing to rising wages for a while  but the data were slow to fall into line  Now they have 
CoreLogic s Home Price Index  HPI  shows that home prices in the USA are up 6 2   year over year  reported up 1 8   month over month   Last month s 6 7   year over year gain was revised downward to 5 5    CoreLogic HPI is used in the Federal Reserve s Flow of Funds to calculate the values of residential real estate 
Consumer credit growth cooled off a bit in April from a torrid pace in March  according to the latest government estimates  Credit growth rose  13 4 billion in April  or at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 5   the Federal Reserve said Tuesday  Economists had expected a gain of  18 billion in April consumer credit  This is down from a revised  28 4 billion  or 9 6  pace in March  That was the largest dollar gain in consumer credit on record  The Fed said credit card debt rose at a 2 1  rate in April  down from 13 3  in the prior month  which was the largest gain February 2001 
Non revolving debt  mainly car and student loans  which has powered credit growth in recent years  expanded at a 5 4  rate in April  below the 8 2  gain in March  As a result of the gain in April  total outstanding consumer credit reached an all time peak of  3 6 trillion

117833,339348,RL,Key Retail Earnings For May 12  KSS  RL,opinion,"As  big names in the retail industry are beginning to report their results  Yesterday saw department store bellwether Macy s  Inc    NYSE M   report mixed first quarter earnings  and as a result  slashed its fiscal 2016 guidance  with shares seeing their biggest drop since 2008  The company s weak results and downbeat comments in its earnings release caused a selloff among other apparel makers  mall owners  luxury brands  and department store competitors 
Let s take a look at the retail brands that reported today 
Kohl s Corp    NYSE KSS  
The specialty department store chain  disappointing first quarter results  Earnings per share came in at  0 31  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 36 per share by 13 9  and falling a sharp 50  year over year  Net sales of  3 792 billion also fell behind our consensus estimate of  4 124 by 3 7  due to a challenging sales environment Comps declined 3 9  in Q1 in comparison to the preceding quarter s growth of 0 4  and year ago growth of 1 4   This may suggest that Kohl s strategic initiative   Greatness Agenda   has failed to deliver promised results  The initiative  which started back in the first quarter of fiscal 2014  was intended to increase transactions per store and sales 
Kohl s remains cautious about its fiscal 2016 outlook  and has plans to close 18 stores because of uncertainty in the retail space as well as conservative spending by U S  consumers 
Ralph Lauren Corp    NYSE RL

Ralph Lauren s results offer a bit if optimism that the retailer is headed in the right direction as new CEO Stefan Larsson reorganizes the company  the company is on a mission to cut  110 million in annual costs as well as remodel stores and reduce its product count to keep inventory low  Ralph Lauren also announced that its board had authorized  200 million in stock buybacks in addition to the  100 million in cash it had available at the end of the reported quarter ",2016-05-11,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/key-retail-earnings-for-may-12:-kss,-rl-200129627",200129627
117834,339349,RL,Bear Of The Day  Ralph Lauren  RL ,opinion,"I first wrote about Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  as the Bear of the Day almost 2 years ago in June of 2014 as its declining earnings momentum earned it a spot in the cellar of the Zacks Rank 

Since then  the stock completed a multi year head and shoulders top in December of 2014 just below  190 and has proceeded to trend down  severely underperforming the stock market and other apparel companies 

RL shares have spent the past few months bouncing off of 5 year lows in the low  80s  Here s what I wrote two years ago about the warnings before this collapse  as I observed a decline from  190 to  150 over a year period from the middle of 2013   

The steady decline in shares of Ralph Lauren has had a single  constant precedent in 2014  steadily declining EPS estimates  Followers of the Zacks Rank know this because the stock has earned either a  4 Sell or  5 Strong Sell Rank consistently all year  

I doubt that RL branded fashion has lost much appeal among its affluent devotees  But maybe some competition from Michael Kors  KORS  has nibbled away at the franchise 

Earnings Trend Dictates Price Trend

This is a perfect example of why it s so important to use the Zacks Rank to identify earnings momentum of both good stocks and bad ones 

Here s the Zacks proprietary Price   Consensus chart which plots the changes in annual earnings estimates against the stock price and quite graphically describes the investing situation for RL in the past few years   


You can see that 2017 estimates have turned up a bit recently  with the full year consensus rising in the past 30 days from  6 73 to  6 90  But during the same period  current year EPS was knocked down from  6 46 to  6 34  To me  the outlook remains cloudy 

Bottom line  Ralph Lauren will endure as a preferred brand and business  but before you invest in the company s shares  be sure to check the Zacks Rank 

Until the earnings estimates stop going down and start going back up  don t put these shares in your closet  The Rank will let you know when the turnaround is coming

117835,339350,RL,Facebook  Ralph Lauren  Zoe s Kitchen  Darden Restaurants  And Habit Restaurants Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   May 31  2016    highlights Facebook  NASDAQ FB     as the Bull of the Day and  Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL     as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Zoe s Kitchen  Inc        Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI   Inc      and Habit Restaurants  Inc     

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  

  

Facebook    looks poised for new highs in June after consolidating under  120 this month following another strong quarterly report 

My colleague Eric Dutram chose FB for his  in early April before the company beat on the top and bottom lines and here s what he observed   

Facebook remains in a class by itself for investors  as it is the only one of the four  FANG stocks  with a strong double digit stock performance  roughly  in Q1  and it is now easily leading the group over the past six months as well  

But some concerns are now starting to appear over FB and their prospects  A few are worried about user post levels and publisher interest in the Instant Article program  and the stock is selling off as a result  

However  are these really reasons to be worried about FB shares  or does this present a great entry point for Facebook ahead of the next leg up  I think that Facebook still represents a great growth story  and if you look to recent estimates and some of its metrics  I think you ll agree that FB is a buy at these levels  

I agreed with Eric back then and I bought FB shares for my Zacks Follow The Money portfolio right before their April 27 report  I m glad I did  as that strong quarter and outlook prompted analysts to raise earnings estimates significantly in the past 30 days  moving the full year 2016 consensus from  2 41 to  2 80  representing 88  EPS growth 

2017 profit projections rose from  3 37 to  3 81  for a very respectable 36  advance in year over year growth 

Why Facebook is Must Own at New Highs

I made a video blog last week titled  following another blow out quarter from Ulta Beauty  Facebook joined ULTA as one of the three and here s what I had to say   

This story can be summed up fairly easy  Facebook is must own for all kinds and sizes of fund managers because it has access to potentially billions of customers who use its platform every day and it is making significant progress on monetizing those eyeballs and clicks with mobile advertising and other initiatives

Zoe s Kitchen  ZOES  Q1 Earnings  Surprise in Store 

Zoe s Kitchen  Inc       is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 31  after the market closes  Last quarter  it posted a positive earnings surprise of 50   bringing the trailing four quarter average to 97 92   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 

Factors to Consider

Zoe s Kitchen began trading in Apr 2014  This fast casual restaurant specializing in Mediterranean cuisine has posted better than expected revenues and earnings in all the four quarters reported so far 

Comps improved in all the previous quarters backed by improved traffic and an increase in product mix  We expect the trend to continue in the to be reported quarter as well  given the company s efforts to develop new menu items and marketing and promotional campaigns to promote these items 

Further  Zoe s Kitchen s various cost savings initiatives  including savings in food costs through waste reduction  efficiency initiatives in supply chain and lowering labor costs  are likely to boost first quarter earnings 

However  challenges persist in the restaurant industry  Like other food chains  increasing labor costs remain a concern for Zoe s Kitchen too  These factors are likely to have an impact on the first quarter results 

Earnings Whispers

Our proven model does not conclusively show that Zoe s Kitchen is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 

Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 4 cents  Hence  the difference is 0 00  

Zacks Rank  Zoe s Kitchen s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  increases the predictive power of the ESP  However  we need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise 

Note that the Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 

Stocks to Consider

Some stocks in the broader retail sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are 

Darden Restaurants  Inc      with an Earnings ESP of  0 93  and a Zacks Rank  3 

The Habit Restaurants  Inc      with an Earnings ESP of  10 00  and a Zacks Rank  3

117837,339352,RL,Productivity And Unit Labor Costs Data Weak,opinion,"This morning prior to the opening bell  the final read on Q1 Productivity and Unit Labor Costs came in at  0 6 percent   in line with expectations and unchanged from the last quarter  which was revised from  1 0 percent  Unit Labor Costs were up 4 5 percent  revised up from 4 1 percent expected 

Productivity falling to a negative is not a good thing for GDP numbers   and we know Janet Yellen and the rest of the FOMC are paying attention to figures like these   as low productivity is what has been keeping the U S  economy at very sluggish growth overall  A year ago  this figure was  0 8  followed by 2 quarters in a row of positive results  We may be looking at cyclical activity here  and if we are  the year over year comparisons are actually an improvement 

For Yellen s part  she said she remains optimistic about the overall economy and warns investors against overreacting to it  Although tools available to the Fed in order to assist a growing economy are limited  there may be more up the collective sleeve of the decision makers than simply raising interest rates a quarter of a percent  eventually   But the fact of the matter today is we now have more data pointing to stagnant U S  growth 

Should the upcoming General Election have anything to do with this  one measure of doubt now seems to be extinguished  Hillary Clinton is now widely considered to be the frontrunner of the Democratic Party  the battle for the White House now appears to clearly be Secretary Clinton versus real estate mogul reality TV star Donald Trump  Whether this allows anyone a sigh of relief is another matter  but the removal of doubt ought to have some positive affect on the markets in the relative near term

117875,339390,RL,Michael Kors Hit 2 Year Low  What Next ,opinion,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE KORS  has managed to become a successful mid tier to higher end retailer while many other competitors are struggling  I chose to highlight this company for two reasons  First  the stock is reacted quite badly yesterday after announcing its Q4 earnings  A biggest loser on Wednesday was Michael Kors  Shares of the lifestyle brand company lost nearly a quarter of their value after reporting earnings as investors did not like the company s guidance  Management detailed a significant hit to results from currencies  something many companies are detailing with right now  The fall put shares at a 2 year low  as seen in the chart below  but today I ll detail why this may present a buying opportunity For the fourth quarter  revenues were in line with expectations at  1 08 billion  but the company missed on the bottom line by a penny  Investors were most disappointed with the following guidance  and I ve bolded analyst estimates    Q1 revenues of  930  950 million vs   1 09 billion     Q1 EPS of  0 74 to  0 78 vs   1 03     Full year revenues of  4 7  4 8 billion vs   5 05 billion     Full year EPS of  4 40 to  4 50 vs   4 70 In Q1  the company expects a  60 million hit to revenues and  0 07 hit to EPS from currencies  For the full year  ending March 2016  the impact is expected to be  200 million and  0 20  On a constant currency basis  the company is still looking for revenue growth in the low to mid teens  and a low single digit comparable store sales increase  Management also stated on the conference call that it expects to see double digit top and bottom line growth in fiscal 2017 as it continues its worldwide expansion plans Due to the lower than expected forecast  we are going to see analysts estimates come down over the next couple of weeks  However  the company is still showing growth  and after the stock s huge plunge  the valuation looks quite attractive  In the chart below  I ve detailed where Michael Kors  forward valuation stands against peers Coach Inc  NYSE COH   Ralph Lauren  NYSE NYSE RL   and Kate Spade   Co  NYSE KATE   for their respective fiscal periods After Wednesday s substantial fall  KORS shares trade for just over 10 3 times the EPS midpoint of its fiscal 2016 guidance  The other names above average more than 21 5 times  and if we pulled Kate Spade s figure closer to the timeline of the other three  the average would be closer to 25 times  At 14 times the low end of Michael Kors  guidance   4 40 a share   a very fair valuation in my opinion  we would have a price target of  58  implying more than 30  upside from Wednesday s close  One item that will certainly help shares is the company s buyback  and we got a big update on that from the company 

 We remain confident in our long term growth outlook and free cash flow generation  and are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional  500 million of the company s ordinary shares and has extended the program through May 2017  This increases the initial repurchase authorization to  1 5 billion  of which  1 billion is available to us for future repurchase over the next two years Michael Kors finished Wednesday s session with a market cap below  9 2 billion  Even if your account for some executive compensation  you re still talking about the company being able to repurchase more than 10  of its outstanding shares over the next two years  I think that the buyback will allow the company to beat its EPS numbers because the share count will come down quickly 
The company will certainly be buying shares after this drop  as CEO John Idol provided the following statement on the conference call  We believe as a management team  and as a company  that our stock price is significantly undervalued  Management expects a 200 million diluted share count for the fiscal 2016 period  but the company might be able to get under that number in Q1 if it buys back enough stock  That leaves three more quarters to get the share count further down  so I wouldn t be surprised if we see a diluted share count in the 195 200 million range for the year  At the bottom end of that range  you re looking at about a  0 10 or so boost to EPS  which could help get the name closer to what analysts were originally looking for  

In the end  Michael Kors shares fell to a two year low on Wednesday as investors shrugged off the company s results and guidance  While currencies will certainly hurt  I think the valuation of this stock is too low to ignore  Management believes that shares are extremely undervalued  and a billion dollar buyback will be very powerful over the next two years  I made the case today for a stock that s worth more than  60  providing a lot of upside from current levels     Support    43 11     40 56     35 48   Resistance     47 79    51 13   55 62",2015-05-28,Ashish K Nayak,https://www.investing.com/analysis/michael-kors-hit-2-year-low:-what-next-253188,253188

117877,339392,RL,The Gold Update  Gold Lifts Off  Again     ,opinion,"Prior to Friday s report on our StateSide September Slump in payrolls growth  Gold s performance since having achieved  lift off   two missives ago  has rather been that of a vehicle from Kim Jong Un s toy box  a rocket which after launch and serpentining upward for a bit  has yet again fizzled to sink mere meters offshore into the Sea of Japan  So similar has been Gold s track these past two weeks  a somewhat awkward post lift off toppling over to back from whence it came  and then some    until yesterday  More on that in a moment  But first   
That blur which just passed you was September   Twas fast  non  Thus  with not just another month in the books  but indeed another quarter  here are our BEGOS Markets Standings through three quarters of 2015 to date  plus October s first two trading days  And to see the Swiss franc still topping the performance stack  with the mighty economic engines of Oil and Copper both again  see right hand column as well  perilously pressured   tis quite amazing that Gold is not significantly higher  nor the S P 500 significantly lower   Yes  the Doggie Dollar Index is  5 9   and were it a BEGOS Market   twould be leading the pack  but  presently at 96 040   twas also at that level back in March  during which month Gold was trading up in the 1200s    

   which begs the case that  today at 1138  Gold ought well be bought to match such Dollar Index equivalent   But then again  we know that Gold plays no currency favourites  thank goodness   Moreover  we ve now clear evidence that there are those who are not sitting on their hands to see who buys first  For with respect to Gold having lifted off again yesterday    to its second best daily percentage gain of the year   2 2      we re beginning to see what was a hallmark of the yellow metal s performance through much of this millennium  until 2012  which differentiated Gold from other major markets  its tendency to rise faster than it falls  To be sure  price remains well down and many a trendline study still is negative  depending from where one measures  But when it comes to upside rocket shots  we ve not seen a display such as is next depicted in recent memory  Follows is a graphic of Gold  each bar or  candle  being four hours in duration  as charted from mid September through yesterday s settle  Therein  we ve selected four rocket shots  Each one of them is more substantive in buying  green  thrust than are any of the selling  red  thrusts  The upside surges are strong  the downside  chicken weak hands sellers   on balance  wimpy  And as we saw yesterday  when a week s worth of losses are recovered in what was less than 30 minutes  it may best to cover one s eyes  for there are a lot of naked traders now running about who ve just had their Shorts hoovered 

 Course the catalyst  as has been our conjecture  is an awaking cognizance to the inevitable recurrence of Quantitative Easing   Twill be fascinating to see the extent to which such notion begins to play into the FinMedia  let alone into the FedHeads  In September a year ago  non farm payroll creation was 248 000  this September  twas 142 000  a slip of  106 000   The last time year over year payroll growth for the month of September slipped by at least that much was in 2008  in the Black Swan s wake come 2009   twas an even worse year over year September reading  Here s the Economic Barometer 

Still for Gold  its lovely lift offs of late notwithstanding  we below see that the year over year dashed trendline remains down across the weekly bars  But the fresh new parabolic Long trend is intact  and  tis worth noting as well that the last three weeks  rightmost bars  have all finished near their highs  ideally targeting at least 1170  just above August s peak  in this trend s up stint 

Now to our nearer term graphics  starting with this two panel display for Gold of its daily bars for the last three months on the left and the 10 day Market Profile on the right  The baby blue dots notched a nice lurch to the upside on yesterday s splendid spike in reinforcing the consistency of the 21 day linear regression uptrend  Trading supports show stark in the profile at 1133 and 1114  the overhead resistors as noted at 1146 and 1154 

Next we ve the same graphics pairing for Sister Silver  albeit her  Baby Blues  have been under some duress given her precious metal pinstripes being unraveled a bit by Cousin Copper s insistence that  in sympathy to him  she don her industrial metal jacket  Fortunately for her  as is Gold  Silver is a currency 

 But mmb  by that logic  copper s a currency too  Just look at the penny    
Oh come now  Squire  An ounce of Silver today costs  15 24  whereas an ounce of Copper goes for a whopping 15   The white metal is presently valued at better than 100 times that of the red metal  What s in your piggy bank   I know  don t tell me  a bunch of those two tone 500 Italian Lira jobs that at the Euro conversion were worth about 25  apiece  Well you might as well hang onto them should the Euro fail  
Speaking of which  inflation in the EuroZone has returned to being in the red  which as repeatedly gets written  has  fueled expectations the European Central Bank will expand or extend its asset purchase program   whilst at the other end of the Chunnel  employment in the United Kingdom fell for the first time in more than two years  Best start storing your crumpets over there 
Meanwhile  by journeying through the center of the earth  we arrive in Asia to find factory layoffs on the increase toward countering the marked slowing in demand both there and abroad  whilst eyes in China turn to their People s Bank for an interest rate reduction  But India s not waiting around  their Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram  Rupee  Rajan having just overseen a 50 basis point cut in an attempt to revive investment for the private sector 
Then there s our own Federal Open Market Committee  If we thought September was a blur  the FOMC members issue their next policy statement in just three weeks  time from this Wednesday  Following the jobs jolt we received yesterday  surely the Fed shan t raise  And with time  should we indeed see the FOMC morph from rate squeeze to QE   twill only be marvy for Gold in at least getting out of the red as displayed here in the defined Gold Structure of weekly bars since the All Time High from four years  and forever  ago 

Finally  from the  One Who Tracks Goldman Sachs Dept    did any of you notice their one week whirl a around from initially citing a year end high for the S P of 2100 to having just revised that estimate down to 2000  Do I hear 1700    Tis been a long wait for those of us sittin  on the bid at 880      But after all  given the downgrade this past week by Vetr  whatever that is  for shares of Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  from  strong buy  to  buy   this may well be a very bearish sign for the stock market  indeed a bursting of the bubble for the suit set out there  We may get a strong hint of such over the next several weeks  for  drum roll please   Q3 Earnings Season is about to begin  Hopefully your piggy bank isn t loaded with garbage  but rather with Gold ",2015-10-06,Mark Mead Baillie,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-gold-update:""gold-lifts-off-(again...)""-267182",267182
117878,339393,RL,The Affluent Market Is Finally Fading  And Fast,opinion,"About 30 years ago  I was able to predict the U S  would see a major generational spending peak in 2007  all from my demographic indicator  the Generational Spending Wave 
On a 46 year lag from the time they were born  that s when the peak number of baby boomers would peak in spending for the average household 
After that  they would slow in spending  ultimately sending the economy over a  demographic cliff   Remember  70  of the economy relies on consumer spending  When it slows  everything falls with it 
This first demographic cliff happened right on cue  and it helped carry the world into a financial crisis that we ve still never really recovered from despite unprecedented government stimulus 
But now  there is a second demographic cliff that I ve been forecasting which appears to be happening in spades  and globally   not just in the U S  and China 
While the peak number of baby boomers peaked in spending in 2007  the more affluent   the top 10  to 20    didn t peak until late last year  2015  In other words  up until now their spending has still been driving the economy  Going forward  that will be less and less the case 
This group peaked eight years later simply because they tend to go to school longer and have kids later  They peak on about a 54 year lag  not 46 like the peak number of boomers 
Don t underestimate this group  We re talking about the spending of the top 10  to 20  during a period of the highest income and wealth inequality since 1928 to 1929  They account for around 50  of income and spending  That gives them much more weight  And that means that as they cut back their spending as they re already starting to  it ll carve out a hole in the economy that ll really kick off this global crash 
Look at the S P Global Luxury Index  which gives you an indication as to how this group is spending 

This index peaked in mid 2015 and has fallen 26  as of February 11  It s down much more than the broad S P 500  down about 15  at worst recently from its high in May 2015 
This is not a coincidence  This is basically an index for affluent spending  and it peaked in the same year this group peaked 
The index includes iconic brans like Nike  N NKE   Estee Lauder  Mercedes  Moet Vuitton  BMW  Carnival Cruises  L CCL  and VF Corporation  N VFC   But there are many leading brands that have also seen their stocks collapse in recent months or years 
Nordstrom  N JWN   a brand we all know  is down 36  since last March 
Ralph Lauren  N RL  has crashed 46  since last January 
Sotheby s  N BID  is off 48  since June 
Tiffany   Co  N TIF   is down 32  since August 
Williams Sonoma  N WSM  is off 44   also since August 
And Louis Vuitton  24  since October 
Clearly  the affluent sector is falling  They have benefited the most from zero interest rate policies and this artificial bubble and  recovery   but it s now starting to break down 
This is another monumental change in demographic trends and the final death knell for the economy  If the Fed thought it could fight the demographic decline and debt crisis since 2007 with endless QE and stimulus  I want to see them fight this trend  There s no way  Game over 
And guess who will lose the most wealth in this next  larger crash  The very group I m talking about  The top 0 1   1   10   and 20   because they own almost all of the financial assets that have been favored in this bubble period with endless QE and zero interest rates  Worse  it ll be years before they see another great boom   not until late 2022 forward  And it won t be like the one we saw from 1983 to 2000 
Now is the time to protect your wealth on this final  desperate rally before stocks see a more serious crash in the year to follow ",2016-02-28,Harry Dent,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-affluent-market-is-finally-fading…-and-fast-200119700,200119700
117879,339394,RL,Why I Just Doubled Down On Gap Inc Stock,opinion,"Let me begin this post by explaining that I am a long term investor  not a trader  I am well aware that averaging down on a stock is not an optimal strategy for someone who is trend following  duh  or following any technical analysis school of thought 
Some people chastise me for  sending good money after bad  or not cutting my losses  However  I m a firm believer that if you reasons for buying a stock haven t changed after a sudden downward price move  you should either hang tight or buy more 
With that being said  it s been a wild week for me  I was buying up shares of Gap Inc  NYSE GPS  in January  The stock hit my radar because it was near four year lows  about  23 24 per share  and offered a juicy near 4  dividend 
I bought some shares and figured I would check back in a few weeks and possibly buy some more  I was shocked to check back in March and see the stock up over 20   I really know how to pick them  The stock peaked at over  30  but since then has dropped back to the price at which I started buying 
What is an investor to do  Buy more  One of my favorite quotes is from Bill Miller of Legg Mason lore  which says   Lowest average cost wins   My investment philosophy can be summed up as follows   The most disciplined person who gets the most dividends with the lowest average cost wins  
So I looked at GPS stock again   has anything changed  Do other investors see something I don t see 
Gap has been doom and gloom for about a year now  Investors are losing faith and Old Navy s president left in October to lead Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL   Sales at Banana Republic were down 14  in March and sales at Old Navy were down 6   The company is now feeling the pressure to perform  and pressure makes diamonds out of coal 
The general public believes that Gap s target younger demographic base wants nothing to do with the brand nowadays  I disagree  Every generation has the fashion conscious and budget conscious  Investors shouldn t paint with such a broad brush  as concerns about younger shoppers leaving Gap in droves seem dramatic  Those who shop at H M  ST HMb versus Old Navy or Banana Republic are completely different people 
I like to buy at points of maximum pessimism  While I see article after article about Gap being downgraded or suffering bad news  I scrutinize it even harder 
Of course  I don t just go with my gut or buy what I like   I have to look at the numbers  Gap has an operating margin of over 10  and a net margin of over 6   well above its retail peers  If Gap really wanted to  they could advertise even more aggressive sales to spur revenue and try to capture  or recapture  I guess  some brand loyalty supposedly lost on the younger generation 
The P E is sitting around 10 and the dividend yield is now close to 4   Numbers like these should encourage investors to at least give the stock a peek  The dividend has grown 22 50  over the past three years  They ve been paying dividends since 1976 and have raised their dividend for 11 consecutive years 
If the price decreases  I ll buy some more  I looked at Gap s insider buys sells and found that from March 2013 to March 2015  when the stock was peaking  insiders were selling left and right  In that two year time frame  there wasn t a single insider buy  Not one  However  as the stock started declining  insiders have made some purchases  John  William  and Robert Fisher  directors owners  bought over  13 000 000 worth of stock in August  In November  Arthur Peck  CEO  bought 37 150 shares at a trade price of  26 99  Seeing some insiders finally buy some Gap stock makes me feel better 
I ll have to keep my eyes and ears open  Hopefully I m not catching a falling knife 
Disclosure  I am currently long GPS stock ",2016-04-13,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-i-just-doubled-down-on-gps-stock-200124901,200124901

The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Ralph Lauren to report  1 64 EPS and  1 832B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 12 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 66 EPS and  1 830B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Ralph Lauren to beat EPS estimates from Wall Street by 2c per share but also miss revenue expectations by  2 million 
Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Ralph Lauren s EPS and revenue 5 times and once respectively  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a smaller than usual differential between the expectations of Wall Street and Estimize 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  1 58 to  1 72 EPS and from  1 789B to  1 850B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a small to moderate range of estimates on Ralph Lauren compared to previous quarters 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrow distribution of estimates signals more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings 

Throughout the quarter the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from  1 80 to  1 64 while the Estimize consensus also dropped from  1 67 to  1 66  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus rose early in the period before flattening out and ending the period at  1 832B while the Estimize consensus decreased before rising from a low of  1 823B to  1 830B   Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and the directionality of analyst revisions are often a leading indicator  Members ofthe Estimize community are revising their revisions upward going into the report which is often a bullish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects  1 65 EPS and  1 835B in revenue  turbinecity was the Estimize Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked 3rd overall among over 4 450 contributing analysts  This season alone turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 61  and 51  of the time respectively throughout 1021 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity is expecting Ralph Lauren to beat the Wall Street consensus by a small margin on both EPS and revenue but fail to live up to the Estimize community s consensus on earnings  
Friday morning contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting Ralph Lauren to miss Wall Street s revenue expectations by a negligable margin while beating earnings expectations by 2 cents per share  This quarter another period of solid earnings growth is expected from Ralph Lauren  however Michael Kors Holdings  KORS  is expected to steal the show again in high end fashion retail
