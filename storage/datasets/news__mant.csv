20874,242389,MANT,Spending cuts fuel government contractor MA,news,"By Mike Stone and Andrea Shalal
NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    Companies that provide the U S  government with services ranging from air traffic management and data analytics to janitors and trainers for military dolphins are increasingly trying to find buyers for those businesses as cuts in public spending erode profit margins 
Showing growing impatience with a declining sector   Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  said earlier this week that it plans to sell or spin off information technology and services businesses that generate  6 billion a year in revenue 
L 3 Communications Holdings Inc  N LLL   BAE Systems Plc  L BAES   Vencore Inc  SRA International Inc and Novetta Solutions are among the companies that have been running auctions in recent months to sell either their government services units or themselves  people familiar with the matter have told Reuters 
Representatives for L 3  BAE and SRA declined to comment  Vencore and Novetta did not immediately return a request for comment 
Underpinning these asset sales is a belief that only size can offset a decline in margins caused by the need to compete for fewer and less well paying government contracts  Buyers also see some hope that government spending cuts may be leveling off 
 There is a major portfolio consolidation under way in the professional services market   said Jim McAleese  a Virginia based defense consultant   It is being driven by scale  You have to have revenues of at least  3 billion to  4 billion to be cost competitive in the market  
Congress set up the automatic budget cuts in 2011  known as  sequesters   with the burden falling equally on military and domestic programs  to force politicians to agree on more targeted savings 
As a result  the market for government contract services peaked at  338 billion in fiscal 2010 and fell each of the next three years before edging slightly higher to  281 billion in fiscal 2014  according to the Professional Services Council  a Washington based trade group 
Though some sectors are growing  such as cybersecurity and intelligence  more commoditized services  such as facilities management and construction  are becoming more competitive and less lucrative 
Industry executives said Lockheed had long prided itself on being the No  1 provider of IT services to the federal government  but its product lines were a far larger focal point now  particularly given the increased focus of shareholders on profitability   
 It s all about the margins now   said one executive who was not authorized to speak publicly  Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told analysts on Monday that Lockheed s decision to announce the strategic review simultaneously with the  9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft  the largest maker of military helicopters  should quell concerns raised by other industry players about the company s size and its ability to exercise  undue influence  in the market 
The market for lower margin government services  however  is highly fragmented  This means it is unlikely any of the companies seeking to gain scale through acquisitions will become big enough to pose antitrust concerns  industry experts said 
 
POTENTIAL BUYERS
Potential buyers for the government service assets or companies for sale include  Leidos Holdings  Inc  N LDOS    CACI International Inc   N CACI    ManTech International  Corp  O MANT   Science Applications International Corp  N SAIC   and  Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp   N BAH   according to industry sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authored to speak to the media 
Representatives for Booz and SAIC declined to comment while representatives for CACI  ManTech  Leidos did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
Private equity firms are also looking to cash out on their services businesses because valuations are recovering as government spending begins to stabilize 
Government services provider SRA International  for example  owned by private equity firm Providence Equity Partners LLC  is pursuing a sale process  Reuters reported in June  That sale could fetch as much as  2 billion  people previously told Reuters 
To be sure  not all auctions for the assets have proved successful  Computer Sciences Corp  N CSC  is now being split into two parts  one focused on commercial services work and a second unit focused on the government services sector  after an effort to sell the government services unit didn t work out 
General Dynamics Corp  N GD  and  Northrop Grumman  Corp  N NOC  also have services businesses that have struggled  but they are not expected to sell those units at this time  the sources said  Both companies declined to comment 
 Boeing Co   N BA  has already sold off some of its cybersecurity business  and is unlikely to take further action in the short term  while  Raytheon Co   N RTN  is still digesting its recent  1 9 billion acquisition of WebSense  the sources said 
Boeing and Raytheon representatives declined to comment ",2015-07-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/spending-cuts-fuel-government-contractor-m-amp;a-352324,352324

which claimed around 60 lives  the Trump administration is weighing its military options against Syria  In case the United States decides to launch military actions against Syria it is likely to receive support from France s president Emmanuel Macron and Britain s prime minister Theresa May Several other countries are willing to support the United States in its move against the Syrian government of President Assad  The Trump government s likely air strikes will not be limited to Syria but will also be aimed at its major supporters  Russia and Iran  In this context  Russia has already warned the United States of retaliatory actions  With both United States and Russia likely to conduct military actions against each other related to Syria  defense stocks seem to be a lucrative investment choice What Happened In Douma On Apr 7  Douma  a rebel held western Syrian city near Damascus witnessed a serious attack when chemical bombs were dropped on the region  Following the attack  around 60 people including women and children lost their lives  while more than 1 000 were injured  President Trump slammed this attack calling its  heinous  and  atrocious  and said that the United States has  a lot of options militarily  to answer to this Last April  Syria s Shayrat airbase  which acted as a launch pad for a poisonous gas attack on the city of Khan Sheikoun  was attacked and neutralized by the United States  The Trump administration along with its ally countries are now thinking of conducting a similar or even higher scale of attack on Al Dumayr air base  which acted as the launching point for Apr 7 s supposed chemical assault on Douma Trump Condemns Douma Chemical AttackOn Apr 12  the President Trump warned Russia  a key supporter of Syria s Assad government to  get ready  for the chemical attack on the city of Douma  Meanwhile  both Syria and Russia responded to Trump s tweet  Syria s Foreign Ministry issued a statement  calling this a  reckless escalation   Maria Zakharova  spokesperson of Russia s Foreign Ministry said smart missiles should be directed toward terrorists and not a  legal government   which has carried out its fight against  international terrorism for several years on its territory  Earlier  Trump called Syria s move an attack on humanity and said that Syria supported by Iran s ground forces and Russia s air transportation will  pay a price   In fact  President Trump canceled his first visit to South America and instead chose to carefully watch  the American response to Syria   per a White House statement Russia in No Mood to Sit BackAdditionally  on Apr 11  in a UN Security Council meeting  Russia clearly said that in case the United States conducts any missile strike on Russia or even Syria  it will answer back with similar moves  Vladimir Putin led country will answer United States  action with similar moves  In the meeting  Vasily Nebenzia  the representative of Vladimir Putin led Russia to the United Nations  requested the United States to  refrain from the plans  being developing at present  He warned that if the United States carries out any  illegal military adventure   it will have to  bear responsibility  for that Separately  Alexander Zasypkin  Russia s ambassador to Lebanon reportedly said that if the United States conducts any air strike   the missiles will be downed  and  the sources from which the missiles were fired  will also be eliminated  In this fight between two permanent members of the UN  the United States and Russia  the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  OPCW  will position a team  shortly  in Syria to evaluate whether banned chemical weapons were used in the Douma attack 5 Best Defense StocksBoth the United States and Russia have given clear signals of military actions against one another  which have brought the spotlight back on companies that are involved in the defense industry  In this context  we can say that Syria s attack on Douma city has clearly shifted focus on companies involved in the manufacture and processing of defense equipment We have selected five stocks that are expected to gain following these developments  These five stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see  ManTech International Corporation is a provider of technologies and solutions for mission critical national

20929,242444,MANT,Cybersecurity Stocks Gain As Mondelez Loses Sales To Petya,opinion,Cybersecurity stocks were seen soaring on Jul 7  after Mondelez International  Inc    NASDAQ MDLZ   revealed that its second quarter 2017 revenues were hit by the global ransomware attack   Petya   which created global havoc in late June  The food and beverage company noted that its shipping and invoicing were disrupted during the last four days of June due to the computer virus The company estimates that second quarter revenue growth would be down 3   as a result of this issue  Additionally  the company expects to incur incremental one time costs related to the attack in the second and third quarter of 2017 Also  in a few of the markets  the company permanently lost some of its revenues due to holiday feature timing  Even so  it anticipates recognizing the bulk of these delayed shipments in third quarter results What Was Petya Ransomware AttackIt should be noted that the Petya ransomware attack shocked the world in late June which halted daily work at several companies and government offices across the globe The malicious software reportedly seized control of computers and encrypted files with a password which only hackers had access to After that  victims were asked to pay ransom in order to regain control of their systems  The hackers demanded ransom in bitcoin It is to be noted that Mondelez is one of the companies which has been adversely affected by the latest attack  Companies like FedEx   NYSE FDX   and Merck   Co    NYSE MRK   had also reported that the attack may have a material impact on their financial performances  Starting from Ukraine  the Petya cyber attack has spread to over 60 countries across the Europe  Asia Pacific and the U S Petya ransomware attack came just a month after the  which locked up more than 200 000 computers  paralyzing factories  hospitals  shops and schools in over 150 countries  in May Cybersecurity Stocks SoaredThe recent cyber attacks proved that government or private   most organizations across the whole world lack proper security measures But believe it or not  there does appear to be a positive side to this episode   A cyber attack is good news for cyber security companies  because it increases the chances of security related purchases by the companies and governments  Hence  investors flock to these shares  shooting up share prices Mondelez s Friday revelation gave a fresh boost to cybersecurity stocks  with major players in the space  such as Barracuda   NYSE CUDA    FireEye   NASDAQ FEYE    Palo Alto Networks   NYSE PANW   and Symantec   NASDAQ SYMC   rising 5 5   4 5   2 7  and 2 5   respectively We expect to see this upswing in share prices of the Cybersecurity stocks to continue during today s trading session as well Computer and Technology Sector 5YR   ReturnBottom LineThe silver lining to this whole episode will be rise in demand for security related products among companies and governments  in our opinion  We believe that this could bring cybersecurity stocks back into the limelight  which witnessed a dismal run in 2015  Though cybersecurity stocks seem to be recovering since Apr 2016  most stocks are still trading very low to their all time highs It should be noted that the financial well being  brand image and reputation of enterprises  and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats  Consequently  cybersecurity has become a mission critical  high profile requirement Clearly  cases of such attacks drive the need to beef up cyber safety measures  in turn increasing demand for the services offered by cybersecurity companies Furthermore  with rapid technological advancement  organizations are increasingly adopting the  bring your own device   BYOD  policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime anywhere access  This trend  in turn  calls for stricter data security measures In addition  various independent research firms forecast strong demand ahead  According to a Markets and Markets report  worldwide cybersecurity spending will reach  101 billion in 2018 and  170 billion by 2020  Gartner had earlier mentioned that IT security spending peaked to  75 billion in 2015 Considering the aforementioned factors  it makes sense to invest in this hot industry group as cybersecurity players are likely to witness sturdy growth

21005,242520,MANT,Invest In These 5 Cybersecurity Stocks For Better Returns,opinion,"The ever evolving technology sector has truly transformed our lives but not without some hiccups  That s because cybercrime  which includes destruction of data  identity theft  spying and other illegal activities  poses a threat  Enterprises and government agencies are frequently targeted by hackers  and therefore have to adopt strict cyber security measures 
Over the past few years  high profile business houses and government agencies have reported a significant rise in data breaches which  in turn  prompt them to impose tighter security measures 
The latest was a massive ransomware attack on May 12  which halted daily work at several companies  government offices and even hospitals across the globe  According to a report from cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc    the attack  which persisted throughout the whole weekend  affected over 200 000 computers in at least 150 countries across the Americas  Europe  Russia and Asia over the following weekend 
Known as WannaCrypt or WannaCry  the malicious software reportedly seizes the control of computers and encrypted files with a password which only hackers have access to  After that  victims were asked to pay ransoms in order to regain control of their systems  The hackers demanded ransom in bitcoin 
The latest cyberattack proved that  whether government or private enterprise  most organizations around the world lack proper security measures 
Per the predictions of CSO  a provider of news  analysis and research on a broad range of security and risk management topics  cybercrime damages may cost the world a whopping  6 trillion annually by 2021  double from  3 trillion in 2015 
According to a joint report of Identity Theft Resource Center  ITRC  and CyberScout  1 093 data breaches had been recorded in 2016  which was 40  higher than 780 reported in 2015 
Scope of Cyber Security Industry
The long list of data breaches puts the Internet security market in focus  as companies are beginning to realize the necessity of beefing up cyber safety measures 
Moreover  with rapid technological advancement  more organizations are adopting the  bring your own device   BYOD  policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime  anywhere access  This trend  on the other hand  has made it necessary for companies to enforce stricter data security measures 
From being a niche industry a decade ago  cyber security has grown into a very important segment in the IT space  Various independent research firms forecast strong demand ahead  According to a Markets and Markets report  worldwide cybersecurity spending will reach  90 billion in 2017   101 billion in 2018 and  170 billion by 2020  Gartner had earlier mentioned that IT security spending peaked to above  83 billion in 2016 
It should also be noted that cyber security companies are witnessing high single digit growth  while overall IT spending is anticipated to grow just 2 7  year over year to  3 5 trillion in 2017  according to research firm Gartner 
This indicates that business houses and government agencies would rather compromise on other IT expenses than security measures  which  we believe  will enhance long term prospects for cyber security providers 
Five Stocks That Can Change How We Protect Our Data
Though billions of dollars and data are lost due to cyber crime  there does appear to be a positive side to it  Cyber security companies stand to gain from data breach as the chances of security related purchase increase
