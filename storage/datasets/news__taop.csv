1541,223056,TAOP,China Information Technology Development Limited   Nothing New To Offer ,opinion,"China Information Technology Development Limited  NASDAQ CNIT  has moved to NEUTRAL from UNDERVALUED
It has a Fundamental Analysis Score of 9 and a CapitalCube Implied Price of HKD 0 15
Relative Valuation
China Information Technology Development Limited is currently neutrally valued  as its previous close of HKD 0 14 lies within the CapitalCube estimate range of HKD 0 13 to HKD 0 16  Over the last 52 week period  China Information Technology Development Limited has fluctuated between HKD 0 11 and HKD 0 21 

Company Overview
Relative underperformance over the last year is in contrast with the more recent outperformance 
China Information Technology Development Limited s current Price Book of 3 04 is about median in its peer group 
8178 HK s earnings and EBITDA are both negative which suggest that P E or Price EBITDA are not meaningful to make this analysis between operating advantage  ROE  and growth expectations  as suggested by P E or P EBITDA  
8178 HK s relatively low net margins and poor asset turns suggest a problematic operating strategy 
Compared with its chosen peers  the company s annual revenues and earnings change at a slower rate  implying a lack of strategic focus and or lack of execution success 
8178 HK s return on assets currently and over the past five years has trailed the peer median and suggests the company might be operationally challenged relative to its peers 
The company s median gross margin and relatively low pre tax margin suggest high operating costs versus peers 
8178 HK s earnings and EBITDA are both negative which suggest that P E or Price EBITDA are not meaningful for an analysis between historical growth  using annualized three year revenue growth  and investor growth expectations  as suggested by P E or Price EBITDA   
The company s relatively low level of capital investment and below peer median returns on capital suggest that the company is in maintenance mode 
8178 HK s operating performance may not allow it to raise additional debt 
Investment Outlook
China Information Technology Development Limited has a fundamental score of 9 and has a relative valuation of NEUTRAL 
China Information Technology Development Limited lies at the bottom left quadrant of CapitalCube s Value   Price Matrix  We call this space a Value Trap  At this level  China Information Technology Development Limited is potentially undervalued  since it trades lower than its CapitalCube Implied price of 0 15  However  its fundamental analysis score is also on the lower side at 9  begging the question whether the low price is on account of the weaker fundamentals 

Drivers of Valuation
8178 HK s earnings and EBITDA are both negative 
8178 HK s earnings and EBITDA are both negative which suggest that P E or Price EBITDA are not meaningful to make this analysis between operating advantage  ROE  and growth expectations  as suggested by P E or P EBITDA

2028,223543,TAOP,Forget Alibaba  Buy These 5 Chinese Stocks Instead For 2019,opinion,Trade wars are considered headwinds for companies as these erode profit margins and affect the overall economy  Thus  the rising trade war between the United States and China has impacted Alibaba Group Holding Limited   NYSE BABA   Despite Alibaba s strong first half of 2018  the China based e commerce giant was fettered by this trade war  in turn increasing expenses and slowing economy in the second half of 2018 Alibaba s stock has risen more than 100  over the past three years  But unfortunately  this U S  China trade war has taken a toll on Alibaba  hitting its share price largely This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has been lagging the S P 500 Index and the industry it belongs to over the past year Shares of Alibaba have plunged 22 5  on a year to date basis compared with the S P 500 s decline of 12  and the broader sector s fall of 13 9   What s Giving Alibaba a Tough Time Revenues  which had been expanding over the past three years  continued its momentum in the first half of 2018 but started their downward journey in later half of 2018  The bottom line also remained under pressure in 2018 Lackluster results were an outcome of the company s heavy spending in new areas of core online retail business  with investments in supermarkets  stores  new artificial intelligence  digital entertainment  along with cloud computing businesses  Not only this  Alibaba s expansion efforts outside China also remain a major culprit behind its dip in profitability China s biggest e commerce firm warned that profits will continue to be impacted by investments in new businesses  partly due to the consolidation of Koubei and expenses related to its newly created local services unit Moreover  U S  China trade tensions and other political worries have continued to weigh on Alibaba s domestic as well as international growth  and have caused the company s shares to retreat so far this year In addition to all these  Alibaba cuts a sorry figure on the earnings front as well  In the past 60 days  six analysts have downwardly revised earnings estimates for fiscal 2019  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved south to stand at  5 20 Given the headwinds faced by the company  we believe that the stock will remain under pressure in the coming quarters as well Will the Stock Regain Momentum Although results show that increased spending on a number of growth initiatives on retail and cloud computing taken by management are slowly taking off  we must wait and see the positive effects of the same in the underwriting results Alibaba s cloud computing has significant growth opportunities  driven by robust product portfolio  strengthening IoT capabilities and key offerings  Given the growing position of the company s cloud business in China and aggressive international expansion strategies  we believe that cloud computing will be one of the major growth drivers in the long run The online giant is also well poised to benefit from the growing demand for videos across its platform  The company has been flexing its video content muscles with numerous licensing deals  These deals are another sign that Alibaba is willing to spend plenty of cash on its entertainment and media units  which management has identified as key growth drivers outside of core e commerce business Coming to the numbers  Alibaba s cloud business grew 90  year over year to 5 67 billion RMB   825 million   and media and entertainment was up 24  to 5 94 billion RMB   865 million in the last reported quarter While these measures seem impressive  the same may take a while before they start paying off completely  Hence it is advisable to steer clear of Alibaba as of now
