163692,385208,FDX,FedEx Hopes Its 3 Big Investments Will Pay Off,news,"In order to adapt to the rise in e commerce deliveries and tap into growing global e commerce demand  FedEx  NYSE FDX  management has made some costly decisions over the past several months  These decisions have included investments in a residential delivery system  seven day delivery service  and the purchase of TNT Express 
While the company invests in these areas  this shipping company has seen its financial figures under stress  which has led to some concern from investors  FedEx s second quarter fiscal 2020 unadjusted earnings fell to  560 million  or  2 13 per share  compared to  935 million  or  3 51 per share  the same quarter a year before    a total of  1 21 loss per share  
Of course  a few external factors are also at work to dampen earnings  Weak global economic conditions  Amazon s holiday season ban on using FedEx for shipping  only recently lifted   and the later timing of the Thanksgiving holiday all played a part in lowering FedEx s bottom line 

To better understand FedEx s 3 recent investments and their effects on the business overall  let s take a closer look at each 
1  Residential delivery system
Put simply  e commerce has changed the way people shop  and therefore how delivery services operate  According to Statista com  e commerce sales totaled  3 53 trillion in 2019  and that number is expected to keep growing in the years ahead  For a company like FedEx  embracing this transformation is essential to remaining relevant  
But while shipping companies must make changes to accommodate modern buying habits  this isn t always good for business  Residential deliveries generally cost more and are less profitable than business to business deliveries  
Over the last year  FedEx has grown its Ground network to adapt to increased e commerce deliveries    and that s led to lower operating margins and profits  According to FedEx s fiscal 2020 second quarter report  its operating margin dropped from 5 5  to 2 2   and profits fell 40   
But these drops seem to be temporary  FedEx management expects its Ground network to see an increase in its marginal profits within this year   In the fourth fiscal quarter  we forecast FedEx Ground margin  percentages  will again be in the teens   FedEx founder and Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said during the latest earnings call on December 17  Later in that call  Alan Graf  executive vice president and chief financial officer  shared that the company s  year over year adjusted operating profit comparison should improve in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2  
Investors should watch the next earnings report  slated for March 17  for signs of progress in this area 
2  Seven day delivery service
The pressure to match Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  rapid delivery time has many delivery services upping their game    and FedEx is no different  FedEx officially switched from six days a week of delivery to a full seven day delivery service in January 2020  
However  that extra delivery day  coupled with the loss of Amazon volume and the shift in holiday sales to the third quarter  led to a 60  margin decline for the company when compared to the same quarter the year before   Clearly  we didn t do the greatest job of forecasting our cost   Smith admitted during the latest earnings call 
While the initial cost of Sunday deliveries was high  the company stands to gain a lot once the program stabilizes  FedEx rolled out its seven day delivery service a few weeks early to compensate for increased deliveries during the winter holiday  During the second weekend in December 2019  management saw signs of the program s early success 
  W e delivered over 14 million packages on Saturday and Sunday  We weren t even delivering any packages on the weekend a couple of years ago   Smith explained on the December investor call 
Beyond delivering more packages  the seven day service will also speed up some of FedEx s regular shipping routes by one and two full transit days  Compared to UPS ground service  FedEx is already faster by at least one day in 25  of its shipping routes  Quick shipping routes are especially valuable for shippers and consumers of perishable goods and healthcare items  which provides FedEx with a favorable advantage against its competitors 
3  Acquisition of TNT Express
In 2016  FedEx purchased Dutch delivery company TNT Express for  4 8 billion to boost its international presence and cut network costs  
Unfortunately  the merger is taking longer than predicted  Much of this delay is due to a 2017 cyberattack on TNT s network  which significantly affected its operations and communications systems  Rebounding from this attack has cost the TNT division around  300 million  
Going forward  FedEx believes the amount of business it will gain through this integration  TNT currently ships around one million packages daily  will outshine these setbacks  As FedEx grows its intra European parcel business  the company will benefit from a lower pickup and delivery cost 
 We remain confident in the long term strategic value of the FedEx Express TNT Express combination   said FedEx s President and Chief Operating Officer Rajesh Subramaniam in a press release 
What will happen to FedEx 
In the short term  FedEx s numbers don t look great  and the company has continued to lower its 2020 earnings outlook  The shipping giant expects to earn between  10 25 and  11 50 per share on an adjusted basis for the year  compared to its previous range of  11 to  13 per share 
That said  investors may not need to panic just yet  Most of FedEx s profit loss derived from these so called  home improvement  efforts  and these negative effects should be temporary 
As noted  FedEx has already seen some success from its seven day delivery service  However  the benefits of growing its Ground network and integrating with TNT remain to be seen  Investors should pay close attention to both the third and fourth quarter earnings calls  to see if FedEx forecasted its Ground margins correctly  Shareholders should also watch what happens once the TNT integration is complete during the first fiscal quarter of 2022  
If management s predictions prove correct  then now may turn out to have been a great time to acquire FedEx stock  But if its predictions are wrong  then FedEx s share price will sink to even deeper lows  Much is at stake for the company while these upgrades play out    so investors should expect the recent volatility to continue in the next several months ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppqc7,2073661

163694,385210,FDX,Air cargo carriers say China demand weak despite drastic freight capacity cuts on passenger planes,news,"By Ilona Wissenbach and Joyce Lee
FRANKFURT SEOUL  Reuters    Major air cargo carriers said they have no immediate plans to add China flights to replace the capacity lost amid steep cuts to passenger travel due to the coronavirus  as many factories have remained shut down after the Lunar New Year 
Aviation data firm OAG said there would be more than 25 000 fewer flights operated to  from and within China this week compared with two weeks ago  with 30 airlines halting services 
About half of the air cargo carried globally is in the belly of passenger jets rather than in dedicated freighters  and the flight cuts have made the Chinese market more dependent on freight haulers 
But a spokesman for Germany s Lufthansa Cargo  DE LHAG  said it had reduced its flying schedule  in part to allow pilots to spend the night in Novosibirsk  Russia  rather than in China  Demand from China to Germany fell because of the production shutdown  the spokesman said 
The Lunar New Year holiday has been effectively extended by 10 days in many parts of China  including powerhouse regions such as Shandong province and the cities of Suzhou and Shanghai 
The shutdown represents a fresh challenge to an air freight market that was already weak before the coronavirus epidemic  Global demand fell year on year for 13 consecutive months through November 2019 amid slowing economic growth and the U S  China trade war  according to the International Air Transport Association  IATA  
 If you re ordering people to stay in their houses it s difficult to keep factories running   Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said   Many supply chains are essentially halted  so there s nothing to transport  
Air cargo represents less than 1  of global trade by tonnage  But that amounts to about  6 trillion worth of goods every year   more than 35  of global trade by value  according to data from  Boeing Co   N BA   the biggest manufacturer of freighters 
 Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd  KS 003490  said a fall in Chinese events and meetings due to the coronavirus and related storage and transportation shortages had led to a decline in fresh food shipments  such as lobster and salmon 
 On the other hand  Chinese transport and request of medical supplies such as masks and cleaning agents is increasing   the airline said in a statement 
A spokeswoman at Japanese airline ANA Holdings Inc  T 9202  also reported rising demand for medical supplies such as surgical masks although shipments of other goods had been delayed 
Once most Chinese factories resume production  dedicated cargo carriers like  United Parcel  Service Inc  N UPS   FedEx Corp  N FDX  and DHL are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of any surge in demand  said Helane Becker  an analyst at Cowen 
 Obviously the lack of belly space means everything goes on main deck   she said  in reference to how cargo is carried in passenger planes compared with freighter aircraft ",2020-02-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/air-cargo-carriers-say-china-demand-weak-despite-drastic-freight-capacity-cuts-on-passenger-planes-2076220,2076220
163695,385211,FDX,FedEx to bring Express  Ground operations closer together,news,"FedEx  NYSE FDX  jumped 4 7  in today s trade after announcing plans to start handing off some of its Express packages to its Ground  division for last mile delivery 
The company says it will redirect slower residential Express packages to the Ground division once they get near  their destination 
It will begin rolling out the plan in Greensboro  N C   and include other markets in phases throughout the rest of the year 
The premium Express business and less costly Ground business have  been operated as separate networks  a strategy that CEO Fred Smith has defended  but analysts have questioned the costs as FedEx profits have come under pressure in  recent years ",2020-02-07,Seeking Alpha,https://invst.ly/psmos,2079715
163696,385212,FDX,Why Shares of FedEx Were Up Today,news,"What happened
Shares of FedEx  NYSE FDX  gained nearly 5  on Friday after the shipping giant announced a plan to streamline its operations by having its FedEx Ground division deliver FedEx Express packages  It s a small move  but an important step for a company that has been spending a lot of money in recent years with the promise of that spending eventually translating into greater efficiency and lower operating costs 
So what
FedEx said Friday that beginning in March  Express packages will be delivered by Ground if they are residential deliveries in which Ground can meet the service requirements  The coordination  which will begin in Greensboro  N C   and will roll out at other markets throughout the year  should mean fewer trucks on the road and better utilization of assets 

 This move makes residential deliveries more efficient by putting the right package in the right network at the right cost to serve our customers   COO Raj Subramaniam said in a statement   We continue to flex our network to stay ahead of e commerce growth  and that includes adjustments to better handle the demand for residential deliveries while lowering our cost to serve  
Shares of FedEx underperformed the S P 500 by more than 30 percentage points in 2019 as the company sparred with one time customer Amazon com and struggled to deliver for investors  The company was forced to manage weaker than expected global volumes during a period when it was also spending more domestically to build out its capacity and manage growing e commerce shipments 
Now what
The move by FedEx to have two of its divisions coordinate better might seem minor  but it speaks to the complexity of the logistics supply chain and how difficult it can be to shift operations  The stock s reaction is probably an indication of how frustrated investors have been with the slow transition 
FedEx reported  5 5 billion in capex in 2019 and expects to spend another  5 9 billion in 2020  but it also expects 2020 to be the year when some of that spending begins to pay off in the form of new services  including seven day a week residential delivery and improved freight delivery  Investors have taken a wait and see approach to the stock  Friday s announcement was viewed by markets as one small step in the right direction ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psn0m,2079735

163720,385236,FDX,Better Buy  XPO Logistics vs  FedEx,news,"Transportation and shipping stocks can sometimes be viewed as boring compared to volatile high fliers in tech and healthcare  But of late  holders of XPO Logistics  NYSE XPO  and FedEx  NYSE FDX  have experienced no shortage of drama  with both stocks underperforming the market over the past 18 months 
Some of that weakness was due to company specific issues  and some due to difficult macroeconomic issues and the emergence of new competition to deliver e commerce packages  Both companies now face the challenge of restoring their once pristine reputations on Wall Street  and proving the recent past was an anomaly and not the new normal 

XPO and FDX vs  the S P 500 data by YCharts
So which stock is more likely to return to its previous highs  
XPO takes a U turn
It has been a tumultuous 18 months for shares of XPO Logistics  a one time high flier that lost nearly half of its value in the second half of 2018 before recovering much of what was lost in 2019  The drop followed criticism from a short seller and the unexpected loss of a major customer  believed to be Amazon com  and XPO spent most of 2019 trying to prove that the worst is behind it 
XPO was built around acquisitions  with CEO and roll up specialist Bradley Jacobs using mergers and acquisitions to transform a small freight brokerage business into a shipping giant  in the process generating a 3 000  stock return over a 10 year period ending in 2018  But on Jan  16  Jacobs surprised investors by reversing course  announcing a strategic review exploring the sale of one or more business units 

In a statement announcing the move  Jacobs said he believes XPO suffers from a conglomerate discount 
 We continue to trade at well below the sum of our parts and at a significant discount to our pure play peers   Jacobs said   That s why we believe the best way to continue to maximize shareholder value is to explore our options  while remaining intensely committed to the satisfaction of our customers and employees  
XPO said it does not intend to part with its North American less than truckload unit  a major generator of EBITDA  Beyond that  we don t know much about the plans  The company will likely find interest in units including XPO s North American freight brokerage and contract logistics operations  as well as its European businesses  but there is no guarantee any deals will be signed 
Prior to the breakup talk  Jacobs had been emphasizing XPO s tech prowess  including tools to help retailers better compete against Amazon s vast delivery network and tech that helps match drivers and shippers to bring down costs and alleviate empty cargo holds  XPO has a lot of intriguing assets  and it is easy to envision a strong  streamlined XPO coming out of this process  It is just hard to know exactly what that XPO will look like at this moment 
Is FedEx on the mend 
While XPO had an up and down 2019  FedEx s year just kept going from bad to worse  The company underperformed the S P 500 by more than 30 percentage points for the year  bogged down by trade wars  economic weakness  and its own issues with Amazon 
Last March  FedEx warned of  unprecedented  operational challenges  and reported a series of quarterly earnings misses and guidance cuts due to weaker than expected volumes  At the same time  it was increasing spending to integrate its  4 9 billion purchase of TNT Express  which was designed to grow its international exposure but ended up saddling FedEx with excess capacity in a slow growth market  It is also spending to build out its distribution network to allow for year round weekend deliveries 

The company today trades at just 0 56 times sales  even below XPO s paltry 0 61x multiple  and 13 8 times expected earnings compared to XPO s 19 8x multiple  CEO Fred Smith has tried to argue the worst will soon be over for FedEx  as the company completes the TNT acquisition and the headwind of spending to add U S  capacity turns into a tailwind of better utilization as FedEx delivers packages on weekends 
The market remains skeptical  in part because Amazon has targeted FedEx  The online retail giant in December temporarily restricted third party sellers on its platform from delivering Prime eligible packages through FedEx  With Amazon moving much of its logistics operations in house  FedEx s e commerce strategy  similar to XPO s  has to be built around serving Amazon s rivals  That s a large and growing business  but there are also a lot of companies vying for that business 
Hopefully FedEx will get a boost from a thawing in trade tensions between the U S  and China  but the coronavirus outbreak if nothing else figures to delay a pickup in shipping volumes  and could prolong FedEx s weakness  The company has a powerful network and a valid argument that the market is currently undervaluing the business  But investors could need to stay patient for another few quarters before benefiting from a potential recovery 
And the better buy is   
I own both XPO Logistics and FedEx  with no intention of selling either stock  A month ago  I would have recommended XPO as the better buy because I see XPO s potential for growth as having more upside than FedEx s turnaround story 
But XPO s recent announcements have created significant uncertainty about what the company will look like a year from now  and created new risks of management distraction and potential divestiture issues 
I trust Jacobs to deliver for XPO shareholders  and intend to hold my shares through the current strategic review  But until more is known about XPO s long term plans  it is hard to recommend the stock for those seeking a long term investment 
FedEx shares come with their own risks  but I believe the company is on the upswing and the shares will appreciate over time 
These are two interesting transportation stocks to keep on your radar for different reasons  and for those who can stomach volatility  XPO offers more risk but potentially higher rewards  But at this moment  for most investors  FedEx is the better buy ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/poy5t,2071706
163747,385263,FDX,LPGA kicks off season of record purses but disparity remains,news," Reuters    The LPGA Tour season kicks off on Thursday  launching a year which will see the world s best women golfers compete for  75 million in prize money    a record but still a pittance compared to what their male counterparts will play for on the PGA Tour 
The LPGA purses    an average of more than  2 million per event over the 33 official money tournaments    are nothing to scoff at  even if they are not comparable to the men 
Total prize money on the PGA Tour will be more than  400 million  including bonus money for the season long FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup points race 
LPGA commissioner Mike Whan has long been sanguine about the disparity  which he says reflects the higher television ratings for men s golf in the United States 
And LPGA player Pernilla Lindberg says the women s circuit nevertheless can only focus on their own product 
 We can only focus on what we re doing and we re increasing our purses but as we re increasing them  the guys are still running away from us   Lindberg  a member of the LPGA Player Board  said in a telephone interview on Tuesday 
 We re doing our part trying to catch up but they re moving further ahead which in one way is sad but I m happy with the purses we  have  and we re for sure going in the right direction 
 It is such a good time to be part of the women s game  It s going to be my 11th year on the LPGA Tour and I feel each and every year it s getting better  
Swede Lindberg is part of an elite 26 woman field at the Tournament of Champions at the Four Seasons Club in Orlando this week 
The field is restricted to winners over the last two years  and Lindberg qualified with her victory in the ANA Inspiration major early in 2018 
Her form took a dip last year as she made only 12 cuts in 24 starts and earned barely  100 000  hardly enough to cover expenses 
She will need to improve sharply this season in order to be one of the two Swedes who likely will qualify for the Tokyo Olympics 
 These next five or six months are going to determine everything   said Lindberg  who has slipped to 160th in the Rolex world rankings 
 A few of us are up for those two spots  I feel I m in a good position  For sure it s a bit goal this year and something that motivates me  
Lindberg thought her ANA Inspiration victory would lead to ever bigger things  but found out that golf does not always work that way 
 Last year there was a lot of searching   she said   When I didn t feel good over the ball I got frustrated and started searching for different things all the time 
 I thought I had things figured out but fell into some old tendencies with my swing again

163767,385283,FDX,Continued Turbulence Makes It Hard for FedEx to Deliver for Investors in 2020,news,"With the busy holiday shopping season now complete  companies in the retail sector    which are often highly dependent on year end sales for their bottom lines    will be coming under more scrutiny to see how well they did  Airfreight firms also benefit directly from the e commerce frenzy during the last few weeks of the year and will be under added scrutiny as well as we head into January  
 Despite the expected robust consumer spending on e commerce this season    and the added shipping revenue that invariably generates    FedEx  NYSE FDX  is still face headwinds and has some investors worried as no near term solution is in sight  The second quarter earnings report that came out in mid December outlined a series of underlying market factors that are pressuring the company  Even though the stock price has recovered somewhat from its 52 week low just after the report  FedEx will be facing strong headwinds during 2020 and questions are growing about how much more recovery will come 

A second quarter to forget
By any metric  second quarter results were a train wreck for FedEx  In the face of buoyant consumer spending on e commerce  quarterly revenue fell by  500 million year over year to  17 32 billion  Net income fell to  560 million  down from  935 million in the same quarter last year  Operating margins collapsed to 3 2  from 6 6  the previous year  Similarly  earnings per share also nosedived to  2 13  down from  3 51  Analysts had expected  2 76 per share  A laundry list of reasons was given for the quarterly downturn 

Weak global trade
Increased costs from expanded service offerings
The loss of business from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN 
A more competitive pricing environment shifting clients to lower priced  and lower margin  ground services
The late Thanksgiving date this year resulting in a shortened holiday season

The brutal competition in this highly transparent  commodified sector has put FedEx between a rock and a hard place  It is having to increase spending on infrastructure improvements  but its also being driven hard to cut costs  
Outlook for 2020
Bad news on earnings calls is not necessarily new for FedEx  Following the company s first quarter report in September  the share price also dropped sharply  down 12 9  on the day after the announcement   For the first quarter  net income  operating margin  and earnings per share all also fell well below analyst estimates   
 Fiscal 2020 is a year of continued significant challenges and changes for FedEx  particularly in the quarter just ended due to the compressed shipping season   said CEO Frederick W  Smith on the recent December earnings call   We have significantly enhanced our e commerce capabilities with strategic initiatives  including year round seven day FedEx Ground delivery  enhanced large package capabilities  and the insourcing of FedEx SmartPost packages   
The CEO explained that the company is making the changes it thinks are needed to address the issues  but those changes have yet to be reflected in the earnings reports  Smith added that the firm is focused on growing margins in foreign markets through cost cutting  as well as leveraging more synergies from TNT Express  the European delivery service it acquired in 2016   He said he expects those gains to show up in 2021 reports   
Despite his efforts to put a positive spin on what was a disastrous quarter  Smith s comments did little to calm investors  That s because there is not much sign of a turnaround in market conditions for the embattled large cap logistics firm  
Challenges from all sides
FedEx is taking on several issues all at once  For one  FedEx Express  a high margin operation that accounts for 52  of the company s top line sales  is losing revenue as more customers switch to its discount option FedEx Ground  While FedEx Ground was the one bright spot for the second quarter  with revenues increasing by 3   it was at the expense of the other  more profitable segment 
Then there are the concerns that continue to grow regarding the impact the U S  China trade war is having on operations as well as slowing economic conditions in the key Asia Pacific markets where FedEx operates  
One of the biggest issues is that  despite estimates that the air freight industry is expected to grow at a 10  yearly rate through 2026  market competition is becoming more fierce and keeping tight pressure on pricing and margins  UPS remains the dominant firm in the air freight sector  But also adding to the pricing pressure and competition is upstart Amazon  Once FedEx s largest client  Amazon is relying more and more on its own in house logistics capability  Amazon Logistics now completes about half of Amazon deliveries  For 2019  Amazon expects this 50  share to account for some 2 5 billion packages delivered through its own service  
Facing all these underlying market factors  the operating margin for the second quarter fell from 7 4  to 3 9   Management has also lowered earnings guidance several times and offered little in terms of concrete plans to cut costs effectively  All signs that the company doesn t have a good answer for what ails it 
Flat Outlook for FedEx Stock
In the long run  underlying market conditions may improve and cost cutting should help margins  but many analysts are not waiting for that to happen and have already downgraded FedEx stock  Analyst Scott Schneeberger at Oppenheimer only expects  moderate improvement  in results over the second half of 2020  
 Although FedEx may have reached a trough and should progressively  albeit gradually  climb itself out  we believe the company s  show me  status is likely to persist multiple quarters until it demonstrates enhanced certainty of a return toward historical Express Ground segment margin levels   Schneeberger wrote in a December research report  The analyst is not counting on FedEx management actually delivering tangible results from is cost cutting efforts anytime soon  
In the first earnings season of 2020  the stock will likely bounce for many retail related companies after announcing improved sales during the 2019 holiday shopping season  Much of this spending will have been directed through e commerce channels and  indirectly also resulted in added revenue for logistics operators  While evidence of strong consumer spending in 2019 on retail and e commerce should help the airfreight sector  FedEx will likely be left behind  Until management can account for competition and deliver on cost cutting and restore profits margins  FedEx stock is not worth picking up as an investor ",2020-01-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pd5s0,2051984
163768,385284,FDX,Why Shares of FedEx Failed to Deliver in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of FedEx  NYSE FDX  lost 6 27  in 2019  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  underperforming the S P 500 index by more than 30 percentage points  The troubles started in March  when the company cut full year guidance due to trade wars and economic weakness  and things only got worse as the year went on 

FDX vs  S P 500 data by YCharts
So what
FedEx was among the first    and loudest    in the corporate world to sound the alarm on tariffs and issues like Brexit that plagued shipping stocks throughout the year  On a March call with investors  CEO Fred Smith said the operational challenges the company was facing were  in some cases unprecedented   The results only got worse in September  when FedEx reported weak first quarter results and said full fiscal year earnings would come in well below consensus 
The company was forced to manage weaker than expected volumes during a period when it was also spending more domestically as it worked to implement year round weekend deliveries  It also had to weather increased competition with one time customer Amazon com  which in December restricted third party sellers on its platform from delivering Prime eligible packages through FedEx 

FedEx had to juggle all of these challenges while still integrating its  4 9 billion purchase of TNT Express  a deal designed to build its European network  but which in the short term saddled the company with excess capacity in a slow growth market  The company announced a number of steps to try to cut costs and streamline operations  including plans to eliminate its entire McDonell Douglas DC 10 10 fleet by the end of fiscal 2021  but in lowering guidance conceded a turnaround would take time 
Now what
FedEx shares  if nothing else  are inexpensive  trading at just 0 60 times sales and less than 13 times expected earnings  Although Amazon s increasing presence in the shipping and logistics business is a growing threat in the overall e commerce market  large Amazon competitors seem more likely to continue to do business with FedEx instead of handing over shipments  and with them customer data  to Amazon 
As 2020 progresses  FedEx s capital intensive investment in its ground delivery operation should turn from a headwind to a tailwind as the start up costs wind down and the company begins to enjoy better utilization of its assets via seven day a week delivery  Any thawing of trade tensions between the U S  and China could also be a positive catalyst 
It s too early to say how long it will take FedEx to recover  but for the patient investor  I believe now is a good time to buy in ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfl5m,2055380
163769,385285,FDX, Dinged up  Koepka ready to test injured knee in Abu Dhabi,news," Reuters    After three months rehabilitating an  excruciating  left knee injury  world number one Brooks Koepka returns to competition at this week s Abu Dhabi Championship still not completely recovered but keen to test the state of the joint 
Koepka has not played since slipping on concrete during the PGA Tour s C J  Cup in South Korea in October  and says his recovery is still a work in progress 
 It doesn t feel the same as my right   the four time major champion  speaking of his left knee  told reporters on Tuesday 
 It probably won t for a while  but it does feel stable  which leaving Korea and all the way up to about a month and a half ago  it didn t feel stable 
 I ve had problems with it since March  Dealt with it the whole year     I had stem cell done on my knee and it felt fine and then in Korea  just slipped  re tore it and the kneecap had moved into the fat pad  which was excruciating  
Koepka subsequently missed the Presidents Cup and did not start practising again until around Christmas time  His appearance this week was not a certainty until quite recently 
Yet he says that playing hurt    he was also out for three months with a wrist injury two years ago    is nothing new and he will not make excuses 
 I don t want to say this was kind of up in the air  but we weren t 100 percent on it too long ago   he said 
 But I don t think anybody s ever operating at 100 percent  Everybody s dinged up a little bit  Nobody wants to hear an excuse so     just get on with it and go play  I mean  I won with it  so I don t see any issue with it  
Koepka had the best record in majors last year  winning the PGA Championship  finishing second at the Masters and U S  Open and fourth at the British Open 
However  he was snubbed by his peers who voted Rory McIlroy as the PGA Tour Player of the Year after the Northern Irishman won the season long FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup points race despite a disappointing campaign in the majors 
McIlroy said recently he thought he was the best player in the world  on my day  and Koepka did not bite on Tuesday when given a chance to talk up the rivalry

The Communist Party backed Global Times said in a tweet early Tuesday that the list was being sped up in response to a bill sponsored by Republican Senator Marco Rubio requiring measures against Chinese officials involved in alleged abuses of Uighur Muslims in the far west region of Xinjiang  Beijing has threatened to publish such a list of companies since May  after the U S  placed restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co 
A response from China on the Xinjiang issue that hits U S  companies would add another obstacle as the two countries struggle to finalize a phase one deal to de escalate the trade war  On Monday  U S  President Donald Trump said that legislation signed last week censuring China over the protests in Hong Kong had already complicated the talks 
Global Times Editor in Chief Hu Xijin went further on Twitter  saying that U S  officials may face visa restrictions and U S  passport holders could be banned from entering the province  China stands accused of incarcerating as many as a million Uighurs as part of an anti terrorism campaign  actions it describes as voluntary re education 
China hasn t specified which companies would be affected by the blacklist  though courier firm FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   has been under particular scrutiny this year  A re escalation of trade tensions also places more focus on a Dec  15 deadline for Trump to add yet more tariffs on Chinese imports 
The U S  House of Representatives is expected to vote Tuesday on the Xinjiang bill  which was passed by the Senate in September  The vote comes shortly after Trump signed into law a bill that supports pro democracy protesters in Hong Kong by placing the city s special trading status under annual review and threatening sanctions on officials who undermine its semi autonomy from Beijing 
That legislation  along with a bill that bans the export of crowd control devices to Hong Kong police  led China to threaten sanctions on some human rights organizations and halt U S  naval visits to the city ",2019-12-02,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/china-hints-us-blacklist-imminent-in-threat-to-trade-talks-2032154,2032154

Elliott s crew made repairs  beating the time limit under NASCAR s damaged vehicle policy by roughly 10 seconds  Elliott completed 312 of 334 laps and finished 32nd    a result that left him 78 points below the current cut line for the Championship 4 Round of the playoffs 
In other words  Elliott must win next Sunday at ISM Raceway in Phoenix if he wants to race for the series title at Homestead Miami Speedway  There is no other option 
 I made a mistake  got loose and crashed   Elliott said   I really hate that  the wreck  happened  Obviously  it s not good and not what you re looking for  It s just my mistake and there s really no excuse for it  It s just all eyes on Phoenix 
 Obviously  today was very self inflicted  I made a mistake that there s really no excuse for  and that s what you get  You make mistakes  you put yourself in a bad position  and that was all on me today  I hate that it happened  but it did  and we ll just go on to Phoenix and try to get a win out there

 It was a long night   Blaney acknowledged   We struggled really bad all night with track position  and then I felt like  even when we got a little bit of it  we still weren t very good 
 We tried a lot of things tonight  and they didn t really work  Unfortunately  we didn t really get many stage points and the 4  Kevin Harvick  winning didn t help our cause  but we have to run better than that  anyway  
Nor did it help Blaney s cause that Ryan Newman  a driver notoriously difficult to pass  held him up during a green flag run and blocked Blaney s run off Turn 2 
 Ryan is Ryan and he is going to race hard   Blaney said   I was mad that I had a massive run up top and he just turned right and it made me jump out of the gas and get tight and hit the fence 
 That s what I was mad about  I was fine with the racing before that  but when someone has a big run like that it s like   c mon   
That incident likely didn t change Blaney s situation heading for ISM Raceway at Phoenix 
 Gotta win   Blaney said   Hopefully  we go do that  
DENNY HAMLIN GOES FROM FAVORITE TO LONG SHOT IN ONE WILD RIDE
The weekend was going well for Denny Hamlin    up until the Lap 80 
Hamlin came to Texas Motor Speedway second in the playoff standings and qualified third for the second race of the Round of 8 
But on Lap 80  while racing for position in the top 10  the driver of the No  11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota turned sideways in Turn 4 and slid through the infield grass  damaging the splitter on his Camry 
Hamlin lost two laps on pit road while his crew repaired the car  Slowed by the damage  he finished 28th  six laps down 
The real damage  however  came in the standings  A five time winner this year  Hamlin dropped to fifth in the standings  20 points behind Logano  That s a huge deficit with one race left to determine the Championship 4 drivers 
Now a season that Hamlin characterized as his best to date depends on a stellar performance at ISM Raceway in Phoenix 
 Just got up in that stuff  traction compound  before it was really broke in   Hamlin said   Just lost control  That s all there is to it  Proud of the whole FedEx  NYSE FDX  team for putting their best effort forward so we could be there at the end  Did the best we could  and we ll go to Phoenix and try to win 
 The car and the effort will be there  that s for sure  There s no doubt in my mind that we can go there and win  In these circumstances  I like the challenge  We re going to go out there and give it our best shot and put our best foot forward and see if we can t get a win next week

163851,385367,FDX,UPS liable for shipping contraband cigarettes in New York  damages reduced  court,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    A federal appeals court found  United Parcel  Service Inc  N UPS  liable to New York state and New York City for shipping hundreds of thousands of cartons of untaxed cigarettes  but reduced its payout for damages and unpaid taxes to about  97 6 million from  247 million 
The 2nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan agreed with a trial judge that UPS violated a federal anti cigarette trafficking law and New York s public health law by shipping the contraband cigarettes  which often came from Indian reservations 
In a 115 page decision  Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch wrote that UPS also violated its October 2005 Assurance of Discontinuance with the state not to ship cigarettes to consumers and unlicensed dealers  and that shielding it from liability  would thwart the AOD s purpose  
But the court also said the trial judge imposed excessive civil penalties  and should not have halved what Atlanta based UPS owed for unpaid state and local excise taxes 
Civil penalties were lowered to  78 8 million from  237 6 million  while the tax payout doubled to  18 8 million from  9 4 million  New York state would receive about  58 8 million overall  and New York City about  38 8 million 
The vote was 2 1  The dissenting judge  Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs  would have set aside more of the payout  New York state and New York City originally sought more than  872 million 
UPS said in a statement that it may appeal  but was pleased that the  unwarranted damages  award was reduced significantly 
James Johnson  New York City s corporation counsel  in a statement said the decision was a  big win  for New Yorkers  and  sent a powerful message to companies  Do not illegally transport untaxed cigarettes  it will cost you  
The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
State and city officials had accused UPS of having since 2010 shipped more than 683 000 cartons of untaxed  contraband  cigarettes to unlicensed wholesalers  unlicensed retailers and residences  often from smoke shops on Indian reservations 
Both sides had appealed from parts of the May 2017 award by U S  District Judge Katherine Forrest  which followed a non jury trial  Forrest is now in private practice 
In January  UPS rival FedEx Corp  N FDX  agreed to pay  35 4 million to settle three lawsuits by New York state and New York City over the shipment of untaxed cigarettes

163869,385385,FDX,American Business Scrambled to Beat Big Wave of China Tariffs,news," Bloomberg     Another reminder arrived this week of how President Donald Trump s trade war is driving business decisions 
U S  imports of consumer and capital goods jumped by the most all year in August  while other  major categories eased  You ll recall that Trump announced 10  tariffs on an additional  300 billion in Chinese items at the start of that month  which likely left companies scrambling to boost shipments of exactly those goods to save some money before getting hit with higher prices starting Sept  1 
While the goods trade data release didn t include merchandise shipments or break down regions  some assumptions can be made because this has happened several times before  when Trump announced or threatened levies on China  and his brief flirtation with levies on Mexico in June  That s been the ongoing game for U S  firms  and executives have pointed to the trade uncertainty as a risk to business growth  in the  case of FedEx  NYSE FDX  for example  and to the economy 
Washington s trade war with Beijing has created supply chain headaches for U S  firms that rely on Chinese imports  at the same time capital spending slows in response to weaker global growth  As a result  manufacturing has gone from a bright spot to  a soft one 
The tariffs are also obscuring the true picture of  economic growth  Boosts in exports and inventories tend to provide temporary strength to quarterly gross domestic product  while emptying warehouses weigh on GDP   a phenomenon that in the past year has bounced the data around  The higher prices have also filtered through somewhat into inflation  and the consumer outlook

163870,385386,FDX,Koepka healthy again after stem cell treatment but game rusty,news," Reuters    Brooks Koepka is healthy again but his game was ailing as he shot a mediocre one under par 70 in his first start of the new PGA Tour season at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in Las Vegas on Thursday 
A day after revealing he had undergone stem cell treatment on a troublesome left knee  Koepka was far from his best at TPC Summerlin  trailing early Canadian leader Nick Taylor by seven strokes 
The 29 year old world No  1  whose rust was evident  ran up five birdies and four bogeys 
Koepka said stem cells were injected into his knee the day after the Tour Championship in late August
 Finally feel 100   which is nice  and hopefully stay that way for the rest of the season   he said   I d been battling it there for the last four months of that season 
 My patella tendon was partially torn     I also had a wrist injury   
Those concerns did not stop Koepka from a magnificent season in the majors  He won the PGA Championship  was runner up at the Masters and U S  Open  and fourth at the British Open 
Makes one wonder what he can do in 2020 if he can put in some time on the range 
 Last year I didn t practise at all   said the American   I finally feel good enough where I can actually practise and feel prepared coming into golf tournaments  I ll be practising this year  
Koepka  an especially dangerous competitor when he has a chip on his shoulder  was controversially beaten for PGA Tour Player of the Year in a vote by his peers 
Never mind his major record  Koepka was bested by season long FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup winner Rory McIlroy  The tour did not reveal the vote totals 
Koepka shrugged off the snub  making a comparison with the NBA s dominant player of the past decade 
 LeBron  James  has only won four MVPs  most valuable player awards  and I m pretty sure he s been the best player for more than just four years   Koepka said 
 I don t play for awards  I just play to win  win trophies  win tournaments  
While Koepka left some money on the table on Thursday  Canadian Taylor struck with six birdies  as well as an eagle at the short par four 14th  where his 315 yard tee shot stopped five feet from the cup

163872,385388,FDX,New Kind of Recession Threat Presents Problem for Powell and Fed,news," Bloomberg     This won t be your father s recession    if indeed the U S  ends up tumbling into one 
Traditionally  U S  downturns are home grown and household led  triggered by spikes in interest rates and fueled by the unwinding of financial and economic excesses  None of that is arguably at work this time  at least for now 
Instead  what s making investors nervous about a recession is a global  geopolitical shock to business sentiment that s prompting U S  companies to curb spending amid uncertainties from the U S  China trade war to Britain s potential pullout from the European Union 
 The global economy continues to soften and we are taking steps to cut capacity    FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said in a Sept  17 conference call  The slowdown is being  driven by increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty   
That poses problems for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his fellow policy makers as they decide whether to cut interest rates later this month for the third time this year 
The unusual nature of the forces at play    and the fact that many of them are geopolitical and emanate from abroad    makes it more difficult for policy makers to decide how far to go in easing credit 
There s even a question of how effective rate cuts will be in an economy where business executives fear such dire developments as the breakup of global supply chains 
Powell is expected to deliver his latest thinking on the outlook when he speaks to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver at 2 30 p m  U S  East Coast time on Tuesday  He said last week that despite some risks  the U S  economy is in a  good place    and that the Fed s job is  to keep it there   
Break or Bounce 
If business pessimism turns out to be overdone  there s even a chance the economy could snap back as companies rev up outlays and monetary stimulus kicks in with greater force 
 The scenarios are quite extreme    JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co  chief economist Bruce Kasman said   Either we bend and then break or we bend and then bounce   
A study by IHS Markit s Macroeconomic Advisers calculated that gross domestic product could be boosted by roughly 0 5  if uncertainty over trade policy ultimately dissipates 
Negotiators from the U S  and China are scheduled to meet on Thursday for the first high level talks since July  though hopes of a breakthrough are not high 
What Bloomberg s Economists Say
Bloomberg s model puts the chance of a downturn in the next 12 months at about 25    That is a warning sign  but not yet a panic signal  The chances of a recession are higher than they were at the start of the year  They are lower than they were over the summer  and before previous downturns     Eliza Winger  Yelena Shulyatyeva and Andrew Husby 
Moody s Analytics Inc  chief economist Mark Zandi said a recession is all but inevitable if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs on virtually all U S  imports from China by the end of this year 
Such a move would probably rock financial markets and hurt the economy  said Matthew Luzzetti  chief U S  economist for  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  Securities  In the event that happened  he said the odds of a downturn would rise to 50 50 
Some other analysts are not as pessimistic  Former International Monetary Fund chief economist Maury Obstfeld said a ratcheting up of tariffs on China would likely lead to slower growth  but not a recession 
 I just don t see what would set off a broad contraction in activity    said Obstfeld  who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics 
That s because many of the traditional drivers of downturns seem to missing in action 
Inflation isn t high and rising  If anything  it s too low  at least as far as the Fed is concerned The central bank isn t raising interest rates  It s lowering them Stock prices are elevated  but arguably not in bubble territory given the low level of rates And households are not over leveraged and generally are in good financial shape  The consumer right now in the U S   at least in terms of our business  is doing really well   Hugh Johnston  chief financial officer for PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  Inc  said in a recent interview 
 You have a lot of trouble identifying what the trigger would be for a recession in the U S   especially a deep one    said Andrew Hollenhorst  chief U S  economist for  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C    That makes us feel a little less concerned   
He put the chances of a recession over the next 12 months at about 30  
Veteran forecaster Allen Sinai said the current situation reminds him of the lead up to the 1990 91 recession  Companies back then responded to a profit squeeze from rising wages by cutting back spending and hiring 
This time it is slowing sales abroad that could prompt U S  companies to pull back  said Sinai  president of Decision Economics Inc 
He said the lesson from the earlier period is that the Fed needs to respond aggressively and preemptively to the danger of a recession 
The trouble is that the outlook is far from clear 
Some risks  like Brexit  have yet to materialize  Others  like the U S  China tit for tat tariffs  have soured business sentiment but only recently begun to crimp output 
 We are having a hard time judging how large this geopolitical shock is    said JPMorgan s Kasman  who reckons that the odds of a recession over the next 12 months are 35  to 40  ",2019-10-08,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/new-kind-of-recession-threat-presents-problem-for-powell-and-fed-1993228,1993228

Griffin  a self described son of hippies who was named after a spiritual master  shed tears of happiness upon sinking a six foot par putt to clinch his breakthrough victory at Golf Club of Houston 
 I felt eerily calm  I don t know why   he said in a greenside interview after carding three under par 69 to edge fellow Americans Scott Harrington and Mark Hubbard by one stroke 
Griffin  31  is no spring chicken but was making only his 33rd start on the PGA Tour 
He finished at 14 under 274 and now leads the early FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup points list and has the job security that comes with a two year exemption 
 I just knew if I make bogey I have a job out here next year   he said of the final hole  where his first putt from 60 feet drifted well beyond the cup  leaving a testing one coming back for the win 
 I m just so relieved it s over  I played really solid  I m so proud of the way I hung in there

163911,385427,FDX,Economic Calendar   Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,news,"Investing com   Oil prices will react when markets open after an attack on a key Saudi production facility  amid uncertainty over how much global supply will be disrupted  Investors are also bracing for another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve this week  as well as a flurry of rate decisions from other world central banks 
Here s what you need to know to start your week 
Oil set to jump after Saudi attack
Saturday s attacks on key Saudi Arabia processing plants will test the world s ability to handle a supply crisis as it faces the temporary loss of more than 5  of global supply from the world s biggest crude exporter 
The U S  has blamed Iran for the attack  which will cut Saudi production by about 5 7 million barrels per day  bpd   more than half of the kingdom s output  according to a statement from state run Saudi Aramco 
Crude prices could spike by several dollars per barrel when markets open Sunday night as a prolonged outage could prompt the U S  and other countries to release crude from their strategic petroleum reserves to boost commercial stocks globally 
 Oil prices will jump on this attack  and if the disruption to Saudi production is prolonged  an SPR release     seems likely and sensible   said Jason Bordoff  founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York 
Fed set to cut rates again
The Fed is widely expected to lower interest rates again at the conclusion of its two day policy meeting on Wednesday  in order to offset risks to the U S  economy from trade tensions between Beijing and Washington  Brexit and a broad global slowdown 
Investors are pricing in a 78 5  chance of a quarter point rate cut  according to Investing com  The Fed cut rates for the first time in over a decade in July 
 We think the Fed will come down in favor of cutting rates 25bp again in what will be described as an insurance move against the headwinds facing the economy   analysts at ING wrote in a note   Moreover  a Fed rate cut will help to mitigate upward pressure on the U S  dollar given policy loosening seen from the likes of the ECB  
Central bank  Super Thursday 
Thursday brings policy meetings in Japan  the U K   Norway and Switzerland in the wake of Wednesday s Fed decision and last week s stimulus package from the European Central Bank 
The Bank of Japan is expected to keep interest rates unchanged unless the Fed decision jolts markets and triggers a spike in the yen 
Switzerland  with a  0 75  interest rate  is quiet so far on the prospect of emulating ECB easing but will be concerned at the franc s surge to two year highs versus the euro 
The Bank of England is not expected to make any changes  but its rate statement will be closely watched for any concerns over the economic fallout from Brexit 
The central bank of Norway could hike again  but with easing gathering steam all around  it is very likely to mark the end of its tightening cycle 
Trade hopes
Junior U S  and Chinese officials meet in the coming week ahead of planned talks between senior trade negotiators in early October and investors will be on the lookout for any indications that relations between the two sides are thawing 
Beijing exempted some agricultural products from additional tariffs on U S  goods last week and President Donald Trump postponed a tariff increase on certain Chinese goods by two weeks 
Economic data from China on Monday  including reports on industrial production  retail sales and fixed asset investment will provide some insight into how the world s second largest economy is bearing up amid the protracted trade war

163944,385460,FDX,Exclusive  U S  officials fear ransomware attack against 2020 election,news," The September 26th story corrects the name of the institute to OSET from ESET in paragraph 15 
By Christopher Bing
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  government plans to launch a program in roughly one month that narrowly focuses on protecting voter registration databases and systems ahead of the 2020 presidential election 
These systems  which are widely used to validate the eligibility of voters before they cast ballots  were compromised in 2016 by Russian hackers seeking to collect information  Intelligence officials are concerned that foreign hackers in 2020 not only will target the databases but attempt to manipulate  disrupt or destroy the data  according to current and former U S  officials 
 We assess these systems as high risk   said a senior U S  official  because they are one of the few pieces of election technology regularly connected to the Internet 
The Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency  or CISA  a division of the Homeland Security Department  fears the databases could be targeted by ransomware  a type of virus that has crippled city computer networks across the United States  including recently in Texas  Baltimore and Atlanta 
 Recent history has shown that state and county governments and those who support them are targets for ransomware attacks   said Christopher Krebs  CISA s director   That is why we are working alongside election officials and their private sector partners to help protect their databases and respond to possible ransomware attacks  
A ransomware attack typically locks an infected computer system until payment  usually in the form of cryptocurrency  is sent to the hacker 
The effort to counter ransomware style cyberattacks aimed at the election runs parallel to a larger intelligence community directive to determine the most likely vectors of digital attack in the November 2020 election  according to current and former U S  officials 
 It is imperative that states and municipalities limit the availability of information about electoral systems or administrative processes and secure their websites and databases that could be exploited   the FBI said in a statement  supporting the Homeland Security initiative 
CISA s program will reach out to state election officials to prepare for such a ransomware scenario  It will provide educational material  remote computer penetration testing  and vulnerability scans as well as a list of recommendations on how to prevent and recover from ransomware 
These guidelines  however  will not offer advice on whether a state should ultimately pay or refuse to pay ransom to a hacker if one of its systems is already infected 
 Our thought is we don t want the states to have to be in that situation   said a Homeland Security official   We re focused on preventing it from happening  
Over the last two years  cyber criminals and nation state hacking groups have used ransomware to extort victims and create chaos  In one incident in 2017  which has since been attributed to Russian hackers  a ransomware virus was used to mask a data deletion technique  rendering victim computers totally unusable 
That attack  dubbed  NotPetya   went on to damage global corporations  including FedEx  NYSE FDX  and Maersk  which had offices in Ukraine where the malware first spread 
The threat is concerning because of its potential impact on voting results  experts say 
 A pre election undetected attack could tamper with voter lists  creating huge confusion and delays  disenfranchisement  and at large enough scale could compromise the validity of the election   said John Sebes  chief technology officer of the OSET Institute  an election technology policy think tank 
The databases are also  particularly susceptible to this kind of attack because local jurisdictions and states actively add  remove  and change the data year round   said Maurice Turner  a senior technologist with the Center for Democracy and Technology   If the malicious actor doesn t provide the key  the data is lost forever unless the victim has a recent backup  
Nationwide  the local governments that store and update voter registration data are typically ill equipped to defend themselves against elite hackers 
State election officials told Reuters they have improved their cyber defenses since 2016  including in some cases preparing backups for voter registration databases in case of an attack  But there is no common standard for how often local governments should create backups  said a senior Homeland Security official

163945,385461,FDX,China s Social Credit Tool to Monitor Companies Sparks Alarm,news," Bloomberg     China s new tool to monitor companies will be the most comprehensive system created by any government and could put some companies out of business  according to the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China 
The so called corporate social credit system for companies will use real time monitoring and processing to collect and interpret data  helping to immediately detect actions that raise or lower a company s score  the EU Chamber of Commerce said in a report on Wednesday  Keeping on its good side will raise compliance costs and could impact companies  earnings  it said 
 It is no exaggeration to say that the Corporate SCS will be the most comprehensive system created by any government to impose a self regulating marketplace   the report said   Nor is it inconceivable that the Corporate SCS could mean life or death for individual companies  
Under the system  the behavior of companies will be assessed through topic specific regulatory ratings  A good rating will lead to rewards and a negative performance will mean sanctions  China is also piloting a parallel social credit system for individuals  which critics say is heavy handed and intrusive and supporters say will make for a more considerate and law abiding society 
There is no guarantee  however  that the ratings won t be used at some point to target specific companies with greater scrutiny  the chamber said  The system that China wants to fully implement by next year is seen by some as a way to keep an eye on foreign firms as the country eases investment restrictions in some industries 
 The vision of the Corporate SCS as an automated regulatory system does not lend itself to discriminatory practices against foreign companies   the report said   However  this may be an overly optimistic interpretation  as the system does have the potential for discriminatory use towards international companies  
The ongoing U S  China trade war has raised questions about the system s application with the People s Daily saying Tuesday that U S  shouldn t misjudge China s will to retaliate  The country has already launched an investigation of U S  delivery company FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   rebuffing its claims that it mistakenly rerouted some Huawei Technologies Co  packages to the U S 
The case has stoked concerns that Beijing is starting to crack down on U S  companies    a Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  venture was recently fined    in retaliation for Washington placing curbs on Huawei 
 Overall  targeting specific companies is not what the system is designed for  The envisioned level of automation makes it in principle more fair for foreign companies   said Bj rn Conrad  one of the lead authors of the report and the chief executive officer of Sinolytics    a Berlin based consultancy specialized on China   However  it is still possible to use the system against them

163946,385462,FDX,McIlroy no fan of compacted majors schedule,news," Reuters    Rory McIlroy is not a fan of golf s new compacted major schedule and fears it might make the sport irrelevant to fans for much of the year  the world number two said on Wednesday 
The majors came thick and fast this year  played in a 101 day window from April to July  starting with the Masters and ending with the British Open 
The PGA Championship s move from August to May meant that players barely had a chance to catch their breath between one major and the next 
 I d like to see them spaced out the way tennis does it   McIlroy told the BBC on the eve of the European Masters in the Swiss Alps 
  Tennis  have the Australian Open in January and the U S  Open is going on now 
 They have a nine month window of relevancy  You want to stay relevant for as long as possible throughout the year and I don t know by spacing the  golf  majors so close together that that s the right thing to do  
McIlroy says his victory at the Tour Championship in Atlanta on Sunday  where he earned  15 million by winning the season long FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup points race  helped  soften the blow  of not winning a major in 2019 
 The money s nice     but the satisfaction of winning the Fedex Cup and beating the guys that I beat down the stretch  that s what makes me happy   he told the European Tour 
 I feel I m in a very privileged position where that money isn t going to change my life in any way 
 It s more about the competitiveness and getting myself back in a position where I feel I can be the best golfer in the world again  
BODY OF WORK
McIlroy urged golf followers to consider a wider body of work than just the majors when assessing a player s season 
The Northern Irishman has won four majors  but it has been five years and counting since his most recent triumph 
 We play 25 tournaments a year   he said   If the narrative becomes majors are the only important thing in golf  that s a dangerous narrative to run with because then fans are not going to care about the other 48 weeks of the year  
McIlroy has a busy slate of tournaments over the next two months 
He will play in England and Scotland next month before heading to Asia in October for the Zozo Championship in Japan and the WGC HSBC Champions in China 
McIlroy only flirted with contention at one major this year  the U S  Open where he tied for ninth  Most disappointing of all was missing the cut at the British Open in his homeland at Royal Portrush 
 I think the golf I ve played this year  if I keep playing like this my chances will come and I ll win more majors     and hopefully all this noise will go away   he said ",2019-08-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/mcilroy-no-fan-of-compacted-majors-schedule-1965909,1965909
163947,385463,FDX,Golf  McIlroy falters late as Romero regains lead in Swiss Alps,news," Reuters    Rory McIlroy said his recent exertions had caught up with him after a sloppy bogey  bogey finish left him three strokes behind leader Andres Romero in the third round at the European Masters in the Swiss Alps on Saturday 
McIlroy hit a poor fairway bunker shot over the green at the 17th hole and then  from another fairway bunker at the par four 18th  found a greenside pond at Crans sur Sierre Golf Club 
He had to sink an eight foot putt to avoid dropping more than one shot in Crans Montana 
 I felt a little flat out there  a little tired  maybe it just all caught up with me   the Northern Irishman said after a one under par 69 that left him equal fifth 
McIlroy has had to adjust to a six hour time change from last week  and also come down from the emotional high that accompanied his victory and FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup title at the Tour Championship in Atlanta on Sunday 
 Looking forward to getting into bed early tonight and getting a good night s sleep   he said   Still  a good front nine tomorrow and I ll still be in it  
Along with his two closing bogeys  McIlroy also recorded a poor bogey at the par five 14th  made all the more disappointing by a 400 yard plus drive that rolled nearly 100 yards after landing on a downhill section of the fairway 
But left with only a flick into the green  he pushed his subsequent wedge into a pond 
As McIlroy faltered  Romero did quite the opposite  rolling in a long eagle at the 14th  part of a four hole stretch he played in five under 
The Argentine carded 66 to set the pace at 14 under 196  one stroke ahead of Australian Wade Ormsby  67   while Englishman Tommy Fleetwood  68  and Malaysian Gavin Green  69  were two behind with one round left 
Romero  coming off a 61 on Friday  endured a poor start to the third round  with a bogey at the second hole and a double at the fifth  but a birdie at the next settled his nerves 
 After a lot of pressure at the beginning I m happy with the way I reacted   said the two times European Tour winner ",2019-08-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/golf-mcilroy-falters-late-as-romero-regains-lead-in-swiss-alps-1967857,1967857
163948,385464,FDX,Golf  Soderberg slays McIlroy to win European Masters in playoff,news," Reuters    Sebastian Soderberg was thrilled to play Sunday s final round of the European Masters with Rory McIlroy but he did not let the occasion overwhelm him as he won the title following a five way playoff in the Swiss Alps 
The Swede sank his winning birdie putt from about 10 feet at the first extra hole and then watched as McIlroy and Finland s Kalle Samooja both missed from shorter distances at Crans sur Sierre in Crans Montana 
Soderberg looked to have frittered away victory earlier when he three putted from short range at the 17th hole in regulation 
But he regrouped to par the last hole to card four under par 66 and then clinched his first European Tour triumph at the same hole in the playoff 
In his 50th European Tour appearance  Soderberg finished at 14 under 266 along with McIlroy  67   Samooja  67   Italian Lorenzo Gagli  67  and Argentine Andres Romero  70  
Earlier  Soderberg had jumped to the front with five consecutive birdies but he felt he was  crumbling  after frittering away his lead at the 17th hole 
 I thought it was exciting enough to just come out here and play with Rory   the 28 year old said in a greenside interview 
 I was shaking the last few holes  I m very proud of myself to play good when I feel like I m shaking  though  I was way more calm in the playoff than in the last few holes  
McIlroy  a week after winning the Tour Championship and the FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup on the PGA Tour  could not quite close the deal though he rallied late with five birdies in a six hole stretch 
 Too many mistakes   he said of a week that included 14 bogeys 
 I made enough birdies  but I just didn t quite have it over the weekend 
 This is my seventh event in eight weeks  I think playing so much  sometimes mental errors creep in here and there  
McIlroy sank a curling 18 foot birdie putt at the 17th to tie for the lead  but then carved his five wood tee shot way right into the pines at the par four 18th 
His ball ended up near a stone plaque which marks the spot from where Seve Ballesteros made a stunning birdie to win the same event in 1993 after firing his recovery shot over a wall 
But McIlroy took the safer route and punched out sideways to the fairway  from where he almost holed out from 120 yards  before tapping in for par 
The playoff was halted for several minutes after Gagli s tee shot struck the head of a spectator who required medical assistance 
Perhaps distracted  the Italian subsequently hit his second shot into a greenside pond ",2019-09-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/golf-soderberg-slays-mcilroy-to-win-european-masters-in-playoff-1968039,1968039
163949,385465,FDX,New PGA Tour season starts with dust yet to settle on old one,news," Reuters    It is only 16 days since Rory McIlroy was crowned FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup champion but players are already gearing up for the new U S  PGA Tour season with the opening event  the Greenbrier Classic  kicking off in West Virginia on Thursday 
With the calendar even more crowded thanks to the golf event at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics  the Classic will be the first of 49 official FedEx Cup events  of which 11 will be played between now and late November as part of the so called  wraparound  season 
World number 10 Bryson DeChambeau heads the field in West Virginia  while the spotlight will also be on 2018 U S  amateur champion Viktor Hovland as the Norwegian makes his debut as a Tour member after a series of impressive results since turning pro in June 
The event will be followed by four more in the United States before the Tour crosses the Pacific for a three event Asian swing with tournaments in South Korea  China and the new Zozo Championship in Japan  which replaces Kuala Lumpur s CIMB Classic on the calendar 
McIlroy and Tiger Woods are among a host of top names already signed up to play in Japan 
The top American and International players will be active until just before Christmas due to the Dec  12 15 Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne in Australia  and after a short break the 2020 campaign will roll on at a relentless pace 
From late February through late August there is a top event pretty much every other week  with the July 30 Aug  2 Olympic golf competition jammed in just two weeks after the British Open  and two weeks before the start of the FedEx Cup playoffs 
DRIVER TESTING
The new season will also mark the introduction of random testing of players  drivers to ensure they are legal 
The game s international governing body  the R A  tested drivers at the British Open in July and found Xander Schauffele s to be non conforming  but the PGA Tour until now has not tested 
Yet to be unveiled by the Tour is a new pace of play policy  which is being reviewed following complaints about slow play and after a video of DeChambeau taking more than two minutes to line up a putt at a tournament in August went viral

163950,385466,FDX,Equipment expert gives insight into McIlroy dominance,news,"By Andrew Both
 Reuters    Rory McIlroy s equipment guru has explained how a new driver  a different ball and a new model of putter helped the Northern Irishman return to top form and win the 2019 PGA Tour Player of the Year award 
The richly talented McIlroy  a four times major champion and on and off world number one  played well in 2018  but word circulated in golf circles that he was not completely happy with his equipment 
So late last year he made some changes and suitably armed  his form in 2019 was perhaps the best of his career  at least outside the majors  where he flirted with being in contention at the U S  Open but was a non factor in the other three 
Yet he still racked up three victories  all in big tournaments  and clinched the season long FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup and a  15 million bonus 
 Last year Rory s driving wasn t up to par for him   TaylorMade vice president of tour operations Keith Sbarbaro told Reuters as he offered a glimpse into his relationship with the player 
 His driver was set up to go really far and it did  But it didn t have enough control  
Sbarbaro thought a switch to a ball with slightly more spin would help McIlroy  who has played TaylorMade equipment since signing a contract in 2017 that is worth  100 million over 10 years  according to some estimates 
 He wanted a bit more spin on his wedges but I loved it because it gave him more spin on his driver also   Sbarbaro said 
 I thought it was a win win going to the  different  ball  I just wanted him to get more spin on his driver 
 He obviously had way more control  led the tour in strokes gained driving and  was second  in distance  so he didn t really give up much  On Trackman  measuring device  he was probably giving up three or four yards  
MODEL OF CONSISTENCY Strokes gained is a complex statistical measure of how much advantage a player gets over the field in various aspects of the game  McIlroy was head and shoulders above anyone else in this measurement  off the tee  in the 2018 19 season 
Yet while outstanding driving was not a huge surprise for a player who has nearly always excelled with the big stick  McIlroy s putting was more of a revelation 
He ranked 24th in strokes gained putting  after being a middling 97th in 2018  an improvement Sbarbaro describes as  huge  
Sbarbaro explained how McIlroy came to use the putter  a Spider X model that has a thick line down the crown to help with alignment 
 From the time he picked it up at our photo shoot he was pretty much in love with it   he said 
 The biggest comment his first putt was   wow  this is so easy to line up  I ve been struggling lining the putter up   
Finally happy with his tools  McIlroy won the Players Championship  Canadian Open and Tour Championship in 2019  and was a model of consistency with 11 other top 10 finishes 
All of this convinced enough of his peers that he deserved their vote for Player of the Year  which was announced on Wednesday 
Sbarbaro cannot predict the future  but is confident McIlroy has at least found compatible tools as he seeks to break a major drought that stretches back to 2014 
 I don t see him changing anything soon   he said ",2019-09-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/equipment-expert-gives-insight-into-mcilroy-dominance-1976347,1976347

The feat helped the South Korean to a four under 66 that left him four shots behind American leader Robby Shelton in White Sulphur Springs 
Im s four iron from 223 yards at the par three 15th landed a couple of yards in front of the hole and trickled in for his second ace of the year  making him the first since Tiger Woods to notch two on the U S  tour before the age of 22 
Woods s ace in his first professional start in Milwaukee in 1996 is part of sporting folklore  He added another at Phoenix the following year 
Im s budding career has not generated the buzz that surrounded Woods s start  but the 21 year old is quietly impressing his peers 
He finished 19th in the FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup standings in the season that ended last month and was the only rookie to make it to the Tour Championship 
Leader Shelton  meanwhile  described his nine birdie effort at the Old White TPC as a  steady Eddie  performance  It was good enough to earn him a two stroke lead over a group of five including defending champion Kevin Na 
Shelton  in his first U S  tour start in two years and 15th overall  had to stave off nerves 
 Last night it was tough to sleep  I ve been waiting for this moment all season   he said

Amid tense Sino U S  relations  Memphis based FedEx is facing scrutiny in China on suspicion it illegally held back more than 100 Huawei packages after Washington in May placed the Chinese telecoms giant on a blacklist that effectively blocks U S  firms from doing business with it 
Police in the Jin an district of Fuzhou  the capital of Fujian  said on Weibo on Sunday that an unidentified sporting goods company had received the parcel sent from a U S  customer via FedEx 
 Inside was a gun   the Jin an police said on their official micro blogging platform similar to Twitter   At the present time  the Fuzhou police have already impounded the gun and started an investigation into the case  
A spokeswoman for FedEx  which has apologized for multiple incidents of Huawei packages being diverted  said that the company had notified authorities about the shipment on June 14  without providing further details 
 We take this matter seriously  and will continue to fully cooperate   she said in an e mail

163980,385496,FDX,Golf  McIlroy questions staggered scoring at Tour Championship,news," Reuters    Rory McIlroy is unconvinced by the new staggered start to be used at this week s season ending Tour Championship in Atlanta and questioned on Wednesday whether it could affect the tournament s prestige 
The PGA Tour has instigated the scoring system  based on accumulated points  so that top seed Justin Thomas starts the event at 10 under par  with the second seed at eight under  and so on  down to even par for the 26th to 30th ranked players in the elite field 
This has been done so that  for the first time  the winner of the season long FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup points race and the winner of the Tour Championship are guaranteed to be one and the same person 
Last year  with no staggered start  Tiger Woods won the Tour Championship but Justin Rose won the FedEx Cup  The Englishman almost anonymously collected a  10 million bonus as Woods justifiably earned the headlines for ending his five year victory drought 
Woods did not qualify to defend his title this week 
 You can shoot the best score of the week and not win the golf tournament   McIlroy told reporters at East Lake 
 If that happens to someone it s going to be hard for them to wrap their head around  
The four times major champion added   If the FedEx Cup really wants to have this legacy in the game  like some of these other championships do  is people starting the tournament on different numbers the best way to do it  
The Northern Irishman is also unconvinced that the tournament s relentless focus on the first prize of  15 million is helping the event s prestige 
Network TV golf coverage in the United States for the past couple of weeks has breathlessly discussed the game s biggest payout ever 
 I don t think the money needs to be front and center  because I don t think that s what the fans care about   McIlroy said 
 Players might care about it  and we want to be rewarded and paid for what we do  but at the same time  competitively  it s not about that  It s about trying to win golf tournaments 
 Who knows what the winner wins at the Masters  I don t know because that s not what it s about  
Woods received  2 07 million for his famous victory at Augusta National in April 
Fifth seed McIlroy  who will start at five under par  has PGA Tour career prize money of nearly  50 million  not to mention earnings on other tours and in sponsorship deals 
Among this week s participants  Dustin Johnson leads career earnings with  61 million  while tour rookie Im Sung jae is last with just under  3 million 
 If the FedEx Cup wants to create a legacy that lasts longer it doesn t need to be about the money  it should be about the prestige of winning an event that you ll be remembered for   McIlroy said ",2019-08-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/golf-mcilroy-questions-staggered-scoring-at-tour-championship-1960756,1960756

Woods traded a pair of birdies and bogeys over his first nine holes at Medinah Country Club outside of Chicago to make the turn in even par for the second round  He then reeled off three birdies over the next six holes and was in prime position in the fairway on the par 4 16th hole

The telling statistic was successfully scrambling in just one of five attempts while also needing 30 putts to get around Medinah s No  3 course

164032,385548,FDX,Exclusive  China s Huawei seeks compensation from Flex over withheld goods,news,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG  Reuters    Huawei Technologies said it was seeking compensation from its contract manufacturer Flex Ltd  O FLEX  for illegally withholding some 400 million yuan   57 million  worth of its goods in the wake of a U S  trade ban on the Chinese firm 
Huawei spokesman Guo Fulin did not comment on the amount  but a person with direct knowledge of the matter said the company had sent a lawyer s letter to Flex on Monday demanding  hundreds of millions of yuan  in damages for lost income  wasted materials  equipment replacements and other costs 
In the letter  Huawei says Flex s Chinese unit  disregarded Chinese law  by refusing to return production equipment  raw materials and half made products belonging to Huawei worth around 400 million yuan at its Zhuhai factory  for nearly two months  after Washington banned Huawei in May  the source said 
Headquartered in California  Flex is among the world s largest electronic manufacturers and competes against Taiwan s Foxconn Technology  TW 2354  in providing contract services for Huawei products such as smartphones and 5G base stations 
The Huawei Flex situation marks the latest fallout from Washington s trade sanctions against Huawei that has caused much disruption and confusion in the global tech supply chain 
The ban forbids U S  firms  or non U S  firms with more than 25  American components in their products  from doing business with Huawei  Washington subsequently gave a three month reprieve until Aug  19 and suggested it could relax the limit by allowing some suppliers to apply for export licenses 
A Flex spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday that the company was preparing a statement and could not immediately comment 
Flex has previously said it was  actively working  with Huawei  to find a mutually agreeable way forward  after their partnership had  recently been impacted by unforeseen challenges resulting from the US China trade situation  
Huawei had in July estimated the worth of the goods seized by Flex at some 700 million yuan  Of this  according to a source  400 million yuan worth of goods were being held in China and the rest outside 
It is unclear how much Huawei goods is still with Flex  but Huawei sources say the firm has retrieved most of the goods via third parties  adding to its costs 
Flex said on Monday the  market situation and customer need  was impacting some of its jobs in China  where it employs more than 50 000 workers  According to local media reports  the firm could be cutting 10 000 jobs in the country as a result of losing Huawei as a customer 
Huawei spokesman Guo declined to say whether the Chinese telecommunications giant had cut ties with Flex 
Like Flex  U S  courier FedEx  N FDX  too has been caught up in a row stemming from the ban on Huawei after it was found to have withheld or diverted Huawei packages  leading to a Chinese government investigation

164053,385569,FDX,Electronics maker Flex  seized   100 million of Huawei goods in China  Global Times,news,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG  Reuters    Electronics manufacturer Flex held up goods worth some 700 million yuan   101 85 million  of its Chinese client Huawei Technologies for more than a month after Washington put Huawei on a trade blacklist  China s Global Times reported on Thursday 
Flex kept the Huawei  HWT UL  assets in its factory in the southern city of Zhuhai after Washington added Huawei to an Entity List on May 16 that prohibits U S  firms from doing business with it  according to the report 
Flex  which is dual headquartered in the United States and Singapore and manufactures smartphone and 5G base stations for Huawei  did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside U S  business hours and did not answer calls to its Zhuhai office 
Guo Fulin  president of international media affairs at Huawei  told Reuters the company has retrieved some 400 million yuan of goods after negotiations with Flex last month and is still trying to get back the rest 
 We cannot understand why their Chinese factory seized our goods  This is an over interpretation of the ban   he said 
The Chinese newspaper said Flex has been removed from Huawei s supply chain due to the incident that had  angered Huawei   but Guo declined to comment on that 
In May  Huawei was added to the Entity List on national security grounds which barred it from buying U S  goods and services  According to a Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  estimate   Huawei contributed nearly 2 5 billion yuan  or 5 percent of Flex s total revenue in the third quarter of 2018 
While Washington has given Huawei a temporary reprieve from the ban and U S  President Donald Trump signaled he could be relaxing the curbs  it has already rattled the global technology supply chain tied to Huawei s  105 billion business that spans telecom equipment and smartphones 
The ban has also caused confusion among global companies and even academic bodies as the restrictions on their engagement with Huawei were unclear  U S  delivery firm FedEx  NYSE FDX  sued the American government last month after the company s mishandling of Huawei packages caused a public uproar in China ",2019-07-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/electronics-maker-flex-seized-100-million-of-huawei-goods-in-china-global-times-1934233,1934233
164054,385570,FDX,China Rejects FedEx s Defense for Rerouted Huawei Packages,news," Bloomberg     China rebuffed FedEx Corp  s  NYSE FDX  claims that it mistakenly rerouted some Huawei Technologies Co  packages to the U S  and warned that authorities found other violations by the American delivery firm  raising concern the company could face repercussions from Beijing 
 It is not true that its wrong transfer of Huawei parcels were operational errors   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a briefing in Beijing on Friday   During our investigation we also found out other FedEx activities in violation of the law so we will continue to have in depth investigations on it  
The case has stoked concerns that Beijing is starting to crack down on U S  companies    a Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  venture was recently fined    in retaliation for Washington placing curbs on Huawei  The moves come amid the broader backdrop of the U S  China trade war  which has seen relations between the two superpowers deteriorate and prompted some companies to shift production out of China 
The official Xinhua news agency said earlier in a Weibo posting that FedEx is suspected of holding up more than 100 inbound deliveries involving the Chinese telecommunications giant  FedEx said it s following up on China s findings and that it will continue to cooperate with authorities  Huawei declined to comment 
China has been preparing to add FedEx to a blacklist of so called unreliable entities  people familiar with the matter have said  When China first announced in May its plans to create the list  it said it would target firms that damage the interests of domestic companies but didn t name any specific firms 
Diverted Packages
The Memphis  Tennessee based courier first drew the ire of Chinese officials after Huawei said that documents it asked to be shipped from Japan to China were instead diverted to the U S  without authorization  In a separate incident in June  FedEx said it rejected a package containing a Huawei phone being sent to the U S  from the U K  by mistake  Chinese authorities are continuing their probe of FedEx  according to Xinhua 
FedEx shares slipped 0 1  to  175 87 in New York on Thursday  The stock has gained 9  this year 
In its statement  FedEx said the shipments in question were rerouted because the company was trying to comply with  unclear  orders from the U S  Commerce Department that have complicated operations  That s why it sued the U S  government  FedEx added 
The company recently sued the commerce department to block enforcement of tougher restrictions on exports and imports  saying the curbs force it  to police the contents  of millions of packages  In response  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business that FedEx is misinterpreting the rules because the U S  isn t asking companies to be a policeman   just asking them not to conspire  
The company doesn t break out its China earnings but in September  it said that package deliveries between the U S  and China represented 2  of total sales  which would be about  1 3 billion based on 2018 revenue

164056,385572,FDX,In Shanghai  China Uses Jazz Age Glamor to Get Trade Talks Going,news," Bloomberg     Chinese trade negotiators will host their U S  counterparts at a landmark of jazz era Shanghai on the city s riverside Bund  re opening trade talks with a marked change of atmosphere after an almost three month hiatus 
U S  delegates including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are set to attend a dinner at the Fairmont Peace Hotel on Tuesday evening  according to people familiar with the matter 
The 1920s art deco structure is among the most celebrated buildings on the Shanghai riverside  and has seen guests including Charlie Chaplin and Noel Coward when it was known as the Cathay Hotel  It played a brief role as municipal offices after the founding of the People s Republic 
Expectations for a breakthrough in the trade talks remain low  The two sides are further apart than they were three months ago  when negotiations broke down and each side blamed the other for derailing attempts to reach a deal  China is pushing for compromise in the talks  with state media underlining this week that the U S  should meet it  halfway  
Further Apart
Since the initial tariffs in June last year  both Washington and Beijing have further raised and expanded the duties  The conflict between the world s two largest economies has also spread  dragging in companies such as Huawei Technologies Co  and FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX    farmers in the Midwest  factory workers across Asia  and the World Trade Organization 
The U S  delegation will stay at a separate hotel on the Bund before official trade talks at the Xijiao State Guest Hotel on Wednesday  the people said  The  guest house  is a leafy compound of luxury reception buildings and accommodation in the west of the city 
A spokesman for the USTR couldn t immediately confirm the plans  The Commerce Ministry didn t immediately respond to request for comment on the arrangements  A spokesperson for the Fairmont Peace Hotel declined to comment on the arrangements 
Complicated History
Shanghai is arguably China s commercial capital and its busiest port  The Peace Hotel s setting in the former International Settlement  which the U S  helped manage during a period of foreign interference that the Communist Party has vowed never to repeat  is also freighted with the complicated history of America s relationship with China 
On Tuesday  an editorial in the state owned China Daily argued that the city was an  auspicious  venue to re start the talks  and referenced the visit by former U S  President Richard Nixon there in 1972 in the course of the diplomatic thaw between the communist and capitalist states 
Among other things  the document established a working compromise on the issue of Taiwan  with the U S  saying it  does not challenge  the belief that both sides are part of  one China  
Taoran Notes  a blog run by the state owned Economic Daily newspaper  has even suggested that the city could be the location for future rounds of negotiations 
 It may be just a coincidence that this round of talks is being held in Shanghai  where 47 years ago  the two sides signed the Shanghai Communique that laid the foundation for the normalization of bilateral relations   according to the editorial   The differences that existed then between the two countries after decades of estrangement were definitely much greater than they are today  ",2019-07-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/in-shanghai-china-uses-jazzage-glamor-to-get-trade-talks-going-1938433,1938433

GREENSBORO  North Carolina  Reuters    A  10 million bonus pool for the top PGA Tour players over the regular season has not been enough to attract any of the top seven to this week s Wyndham Championship 
Tournament sponsor Wyndham put up the money in the hope of luring some of the big box office attractions to a tournament that suffers due to its time slot immediately preceding the PGA Tour playoffs 
Hence  most of the big names are skipping this week s regular season finale after playing the British Open and WGC St  Jude Invitational the previous two weeks 
Brooks Koepka locked up the  2 million Wyndham Rewards first prize with his St  Jude win on Sunday 
Paul Casey  who at number eight on the FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup Wyndham Rewards points list is the highest ranked player in action this week  said he understood why most of his peers opted to skip the tournament ahead of the three event FedEx Cup playoffs 
 I would like to have seen more players here but     the ultimate prize we re trying to win  is  the FedEx Cup   the Englishman said at Sedgefield Country Club on Wednesday 
 Guys are doing whatever is necessary to get themselves in the perfect position for that  I thought probably one or two guys would be here but I can t answer for them  and I shouldn t  
A win on Sunday and would lift Casey from eighth to fourth in the Wyndham standings and would also earn him a  1 1 million bonus 
But considering he would have played six weeks in a row by time the Tour Championship rolls around late next month  Casey admitted that the situation was not ideal 
 It s a challenge   said Casey  who thinks he has only four or five years left to realistically challenge at the top level 
 I m 42  so it s not great     but I love playing golf so why not take this opportunity 
 The form I ve got and my opportunities are not going to be there forever  I m one of only a handful of guys who s still doing this at this level in the 40s  
The field is not completely devoid of star power 
Three times major winner Jordan Spieth will be in action as he tries to play his way back into form  The American is 67th on the FedEx Cup points list after a sporadic campaign 
World No  17 Webb Simpson and No  24 Patrick Reed are also playing 
Reed and Spieth had a magnificent duel here six years ago  when the former won a playoff after threading a miracle shot through the trees to set up birdie at the first extra hole

GREENSBORO  North Carolina  Reuters    Former world number one Jordan Spieth is confident he will soon be back on top form and believes this week s Wyndham Championship will offer a chance to gauge the quality of his game 
Spieth  67th on the PGA Tour s FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup points list  is one of the few big names in the field as most of the top ranked players opted to skip the event to get some time off after a busy few weeks 
The American hopes his decision to play will pay off 
 I m really pumped to play here  The only time I ve played here I really enjoyed it   the Texan said at Sedgefield Country Club  referring to the 2013 event that he lost in a playoff to Patrick Reed 
 I m trying to play tournaments that are maybe good fits for my game  This course just stands the test of time  It doesn t favor any  type of  player  
Spieth has 11 PGA Tour victories  including three majors  but has not won since the 2017 British Open at Royal Birkdale 
He tied for 12th at the WGC St  Jude Invitational last week  despite taking two triple bogeys during the first round and two doubles in the final round 
 This year s just been inconsistent for me   he said   I m not a patient person  so it s been really difficult  It s not a lack of work ethic 
 It might be frustrating for the rest of the season  but soon enough I ll be back to the level that I want to be at  that I ve been at before  and that is the ultimate goal  
Spieth  26  thinks Sedgefield will provide a good indication about the state of his game

164059,385575,FDX,How each candidate performed in the second Democratic debate,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The kick off of the second round of Democratic presidential debates on Tuesday featured a clash of liberal and moderate agendas  highlighting sharp divisions within the party over how to beat Republican Donald Trump in the November 2020 election  The race s two progressive front runners  Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren  went toe to toe with eight lower tier  more moderate rivals over key issues including healthcare  immigration and trade  Ten other White House hopefuls will face off on Wednesday in Detroit on the second night of the back to back debates  At center stage will be a rematch between front runner Joe Biden and rival Kamala Harris  whose explosive confrontations over race in last month s debate produced the 2020 Democratic primary contest s most contentious moment to date  Here is a look at how the candidates did on the first night of debate  STEVE BULLOCK The Montana governor was a newbie to the debate stage  having entered the race too late to qualify for the first round in Miami  He quickly attempted to make an impression by labeling progressives  proposals  wish list economics   Bullock accused liberal front runner Bernie Sanders  in particular  of proposing policies made for  press releases  rather than being realistic reforms  He reminded viewers how difficult it had been to pass the Affordable Care Act  President Barack Obama s signature healthcare achievement  which Sanders and fellow liberal Elizabeth Warren would junk in favor of a single payer  Medicare for All  system   It used to be just Republicans who wanted to repeal and replace   Bullock said   Now  many Democrats do as well   PETE BUTTIGIEG As he did in the first debate  the mayor of South Bend  Indiana  and fundraising dynamo showed a steadiness on stage and a good command of policy  He received one of the biggest ovations of the evening when he implored the candidates to dismiss Republican criticism of their proposals   Look  if it s true that if we embrace a far left agenda they re going to say we re a bunch of crazy socialists  If we embrace a conservative agenda  you know what they re going to do  They re going to say we re a bunch of crazy socialists  So let s just stand up for the right policy  go out there and defend it   It was a strong line  cannily crafted so Buttigieg did not have to pick a side in the emerging battle between moderates and progressives  Even better for Buttigieg  a former Trump White House aide  Mercedes Schlapp  replied on Twitter   Yes  PeteButtigieg  you are all crazy socialists   JOHN DELANEY The first Democrat to declare a candidacy for president was unknown to most voters  but the former member of the U S  House of Representatives finally landed time in the spotlight on Tuesday night  Given multiple chances to spar directly with Warren and Sanders over their sweeping policies ranging from healthcare to immigration and trade  Delaney took on the role of the loudest critic of their  impossible  ideas   I think Democrats win when we run on real solutions  not impossible promises  when we run on things that are workable  not fairy tale economics   Delaney said  Ultimately  the limelight may not do much to guarantee him a spot in the September debate  The Democratic National Committee has set higher funding and polling requirements to qualify  and Delaney has been stuck at the bottom of opinion surveys  JOHN HICKENLOOPER The former Colorado governor did not have the kind of breakout moment he needed to bolster his faltering campaign but still produced one of the night s best punch lines when he assailed Sanders over socialism  Asked by moderators if the self proclaimed Democratic socialist is  too extreme  to win the White House  Hickenlooper said embracing his radical agenda would doom the party in the general election next year   This notion that you re going to take private insurance away from 180 million Americans    or the Green New Deal  make sure that every American is guaranteed a government job that they want  that is a disaster at the ballot box   Hickenlooper said   You might as well FedEx  NYSE FDX  the election to Donald Trump   AMY KLOBUCHAR Like many of the moderates with her on stage Tuesday night  Klobuchar kicked off the debate by signaling she would make the case for why a pragmatic  middle of the road approach was better than progressive ideals  saying her candidacy was about  bold ideas  but they are grounded in reality   Unlike her fellow moderates  the three term senator from Minnesota chose to direct her fire at Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  When CNN moderator Jake Tapper asked Klobuchar who on the stage was making promises to get elected  Klobuchar demurred from naming names   Everyone wants to get elected  but my point is this  I think when we have a guy in the White House who has now told over 10 000 lies  that we better be very straightforward with the American people        BETO O ROURKE Former U S  Representative Beto O Rourke s performance again did little to boost a campaign struggling to live up to the high expectations for his White House bid set by his surprisingly strong  though ultimately unsuccessful  quest in 2018 to oust Republican U S  Senator Ted Cruz in their home state of Texas  Despite producing some solid opening lines  he neither had a breakout moment needed to revive his campaign nor was at the center of the conversation even as lesser known rivals like Delaney clashed head to head with top tier candidates   In the face of cruelty and fear from a lawless president  we will choose to be the nation that stands up for the human rights of everyone  for the rule of law for everyone and a democracy that serves everyone   O Rourke said at the beginning of the debate  O Rourke s campaign said he has qualified for the third debate series in September  when the Democratic Party has established more stringent criteria  But his performance on Tuesday will likely do little to restart his flagging fundraising or reverse his downward slide in opinion polls  BERNIE SANDERS After a somewhat quiet debate performance last month  the Vermont senator came back to his true form   unapologetic and irascible in the face of attacks from rivals trying to ding his progressive armor  Sanders  who has held onto his second place standing in most opinion polls competing neck and neck with friend and fellow liberal Warren  delivered a full throated defense of his progressive policies  Most notably among them was the Medicare for All health plan that came under fire from the more centrist candidates assembled on the stage   I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas  Republicans are not afraid of big ideas   he said   Sanders  along with Warren  is seeking to gain ground against former Vice President Joe Biden  who currently leads the Democratic field  TIM RYAN The moderate congressman from Ohio failed to secure a breakthrough in the debate  and his most memorable moment may have been telling Sanders not to shout   You don t have to yell   Ryan admonished after Sanders vigorously defended his plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions  In another war of words with the rival  Ryan took a jab at Sanders when the Vermont senator said polls have him beating Trump in the 2020 election   Well  I would just say Hillary Clinton was winning in the polls  too   Ryan said  bringing back the painful memory of the Democratic candidate who unexpectedly lost to Trump in 2016      Ryan  polling below 1  among the two dozen Democratic candidates  put forth a modest goal in his closing remarks  saying   I hope tonight  at some level  I captured your imagination    ELIZABETH WARREN Under attack from moderate rivals over her liberal policy positions  U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren swung back and accused her opponents of sounding like Republicans  As Delaney accused Sanders of trying to take private insurance away with his Medicare for All proposal  Warren interjected in the debate to defend her friend   We are the Democrats  We are not about trying to take away healthcare from anyone  That s what the Republicans are trying to do   she said   And we should stop using Republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that healthcare   Nothing seemed to slow her down rest of the night   I don t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for the president of the United States just to talk about what we really can t do and shouldn t fight for   Warren said to applause  MARIANNE WILLIAMSON Self help guru Marianne Williamson has been a long shot to win the Democratic nomination  but her faithful following for her spiritual guidance books have helped her qualify for the debates  And on Tuesday  she received one of the loudest applause lines when she pointed to the water crisis in the majority black city of Flint  Michigan  an hour north of Detroit where the debate was taking place  to highlight racial and economic injustice in the country   I lived in Grosse Pointe  What happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe   she said  referring to the affluent  majority white area adjacent to Detroit   Flint is just the tip of the iceberg    We have communities  particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country  who are suffering from environmental injustice   Like last month s debate performance  she again produced a viral moment when she warned of Trump s  dark psychic force     If you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country  then I m afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days   she said  
Williamson  who has one of the smallest campaigns and is spending nearly all the money she brings in from donors  will need to find a way to capitalize on the moment if she wants to qualify for the third debate in September in Houston ",2019-07-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/how-each-candidate-performed-in-the-second-democratic-debate-1941118,1941118
164086,385602,FDX,U S  aims to restart China trade talks  will not accept conditions on tariff use,news,"By Jeff Mason WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States hopes to re launch trade talks with China after President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping meet in Japan on Saturday  but Washington will not accept any conditions around the U S  use of tariffs in the dispute  a senior administration official said on Tuesday  Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on another  325 billion of goods  covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States   including consumer products such as cellphones  computers and clothing   if the meeting with Xi produces no progress in resolving a host of U S  complaints around the way China does business  The two sides could agree not to impose new tariffs as a goodwill gesture to get negotiations going  the official said  but he said it was unclear if that would happen  The United States was not willing to come to the Xi meeting with concessions  said the official  who spoke on the condition of anonymity  Washington wants Beijing to come back the table with the promises it withdrew before talks broke down  he said  China has shown no softening in its position and said on Monday that both sides should make compromises in the trade talks and that a trade deal has to be beneficial for both countries  The back and forth set up what could prove to be a tricky meeting between Trump and Xi at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Osaka  The session will be the first time they have met since trade talks between the world s two largest economies broke down in May  when the United States accused China of reneging on reform pledges it made  Chinese Vice Premier Liu He  who has led trade talks for Beijing  held a phone conversation with his counterparts  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  on Monday  according to China s Ministry of Commerce  The three men are helping to pave the way for talks between the leaders later this week   Expectations for that meeting so far appear to be low  The best case scenario would be a resumption of official talks  which could ease fears in financial markets that the already long trade dispute might continue indefinitely  The fears have pummeled global markets and hurt the world economy   Trump advisers have said no trade deal is expected at the meeting but they hope to create a path forward for talks  Once negotiations resume  they could take months or even years to complete  the senior Trump administration official said  with some parts agreed early and others needing more time   A resumption of negotiations could put that threat of further tariffs on hold  at least for now  But if Trump sees no progress and decides to raise tariffs  the relationship between the world s two largest economies would deteriorate further    I think if they go with the tariffs  the trade talks are dead  Period   said one person familiar with the talks   The United States has made clear it wants China to go back to the position it held in a draft trade agreement that was nearly completed before Beijing balked at some of its terms  particularly requirements to change its laws on key issues   Beijing wants the United States to lift tariffs  while Washington wants China to change a series of practices including on intellectual property and requirements that U S  companies share their technology with Chinese companies in order to do business there   As part of the trade war  Washington has already imposed 25  tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese goods  ranging from semi conductors to furniture  that are imported to the United States  PRESSURE BUILDING  The president has spoken optimistically about the chances of a deal   The administration official said rounds of meetings between top trade officials from both countries likely would begin again after the G20 summit  He noted that although the vice premier still led China s trade delegation  new names had been added to the list who could be hard liners   The official said Trump and Xi were unlikely to get into the fine details of the draft trade pact  although the case of Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co may come up during talks   Pressure on Huawei  which the U S  government has labeled a security threat  has increased in recent days   About a dozen rural U S  telecom carriers that depend on Huawei for network gear are in discussions with its biggest rivals  Ericsson  BS ERICAs  and Nokia  HE NOKIA   to replace their Chinese equipment  sources familiar with the matter said   And the U S  based research arm of Huawei  Futurewei Technologies Inc  has moved to separate its operations from its corporate parent since the U S government in May put Huawei on a trade blacklist  according to two people familiar with the matter   Trump has indicated a willingness to include the Huawei issue in a trade deal  despite the national security implications cited by his advisers about the company  Meanwhile  U S  parcel delivery firm FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX  on Monday sued the U S  government  saying it should not be held liable if it inadvertently shipped products that violated a Trump administration ban on exports to some Chinese companies   
The move came after FedEx reignited Chinese ire over its business practices when a package containing a Huawei phone sent to the United States was returned last week to its sender in Britain  in what FedEx said was an  operational error  ",2019-06-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/goal-of-trumpxi-meeting-at-g20-is-to-reopen-trade-talks-us-official-1907209,1907209
164087,385603,FDX,Hold Your Breath  Trump s Got Three High Stakes Meetings at One Summit,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump has trade at the top of his Group of 20 agenda  yet key issues including Iran  North Korea and next year s presidential election will vie for his attention and create opportunities for summit pitfalls 
In addition to a meeting with his Chinese counterpart that will be the centerpiece of his trip to Japan this week  Trump will also meet with the leaders of Russia and Turkey    two men who have outmaneuvered him in the past  The summit will unfold on Friday and Saturday as tensions between the U S  and Iran continue to escalate 
Before returning to Washington  Trump will visit South Korea  a trip marked by intrigue over whether he ll visit the Demilitarized Zone marking the border with North Korea  He ll also have to navigate extensive news coverage of the two nights of debates featuring the Democrats seeking to deny him another term 
Together  the events present a series of opportunities for Trump to advance American priorities and perhaps his own re election interests  But they also carry risk  as Trump has demonstrated he s just as likely to wind up with little to show for his effort but damaged international relations and embarrassing missteps 
The U S  president touches down in Osaka on Thursday  the same day that Iran has said it would breach the cap on its enriched uranium stockpile  a major test of the 2015 nuclear deal  Trump on Monday signed an executive order imposing new sanctions on Iran s supreme leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  and eight senior military commanders 
He plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin  even after scratching an official meeting at last November s G 20 to punish the Kremlin for a naval clash in the Black Sea in which Russia forces captured 22 Ukrainian sailors  The sailors have yet to be returned 
Putin and Trump are expected to focus on regional security  arms control and improving relations between the two countries  a U S  official said  The two leaders are expected to discuss Iran and Syria 
Trump s last extended encounter with Putin was last July in Helsinki  where the two leaders held a news conference at which the president sided with the Russian leader in questioning U S  intelligence officials  conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 election  Trump was castigated by lawmakers in both parties back home 
Erdogan Talks
He ll also meet in Osaka with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  with whom Trump maintains warm relations despite Erdogan s turn toward autocracy and increasing friction between their governments  The U S  is preparing sanctions on Turkey if it goes ahead with the purchase of a Russian anti aircraft missile system 
In December  Trump issued a snap order to withdraw American military forces from Syria after a phone conversation with Erdogan in which the Turkish leader apparently talked him into the decision 
But Trump s highest profile meeting will focus on a growing trade dispute with China  He likely to talk to China s Xi Jinping on Saturday  the final day of the two day summit  according to a U S  official  They may agree to reopen trade talks  though no deal is expected from the summit  according to a senior administration official 
The U S  is willing to suspend the next round of tariffs threatened by Trump on an additional  300 billion of Chinese imports while Beijing and Washington prepare to resume negotiations  people familiar with the plans said  A decision  which is still under consideration  could be announced after Trump and Xi meet 
Trade negotiations broke off last month after the U S  accused China s leaders of reneging on provisions of a tentative agreement  and Beijing said the U S  had raised its demands  Trump raised tariffs on about  200 billion of Chinese imports to 25   and said he would expand the tariffs to cover essentially everything China exports to the U S  unless the country s leaders reversed course 
The U S  aggravated the trade dispute by targeting a Chinese telecommunications company  Huawei Technologies Co   and now China is examining a similar move against a U S  shipping company  FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   The U S  blacklisted Huawei  saying it poses a national security threat  China is considering adding Memphis based FedEx to a blacklist of firms that the government says damage the interests of domestic companies  people familiar with the matter said 
 We re The Sheriff 
Michael Green  the Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former National Security Council aide to President George W  Bush  said the typical strategy heading into a meeting with a leader like Xi is to first rally with allies at a summit such as the G 20 
 You build as much momentum as you can so that when you have your bilateral summit with Xi Jinping you re speaking with the rest of the world kind of behind you   Green said  But  we re not doing that   under Trump  Green said   What we re doing is we re saying loudly that  we re the sheriff  and there s a bad guy at the end of the street  and we re going to get him  and we re calling a posse together which will be Japan and Europe  and then we re shooting at them  by threatening auto tariffs 
 The president will go into this summit with Xi Jinping alone  Alone  And it s not an enviable position  
Trump s travel also overlaps with the first set of Democratic presidential debates back in the U S  The event  featuring 20 of the Democratic hopefuls over two nights  is likely to be heavy on criticism of the president and threatens to take away the spotlight from his activities  unless he can use the G 20 stage   and Twitter   to wrest control of the story  The president has mused about the possibility he would live tweet his debate impressions from abroad 
As Trump prepared to leave for the G 20  his son in law Jared Kushner and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin were leading a U S  delegation to Bahrain to try to build support among Persian Gulf nations for a  50 billion economic plan to entice Palestinians to agree to a political peace plan with Israel  And Trump s national security adviser  John Bolton  an Iran hawk  traveled to Israel for a summit with Russian and Israeli national security officials to discuss Iran s reach in Syria 
Saudi Controversy
Trump also plans to meet with Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about regional stability  a U S  official said  The talks will come less than a week after the Senate voted to block arms sales to the kingdom  Republicans and Democrats have demanded greater scrutiny of Saudi Arabia over the military campaign it s leading in Yemen s civil war and over the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi last fall 
Trump is also expected to meet other world leaders at the summit  including  Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan  Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia  and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India

164169,385685,FDX,Trump Plays Good Cop on Huawei After Pompeo s Threats,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump adopted a conciliatory tone this week toward Europe s approach to Huawei Technologies Co   the Chinese telecom giant the U S  has demanded its allies abandon over security concerns 
The Trump administration has engaged in a combative global campaign for months to keep Huawei products out of future 5G broadband networks  including threats to curb intelligence sharing with allies if they don t comply  The U S  alleges that China could use Huawei equipment for spying  a charge the company s executives have repeatedly denied 
Trump had the opportunity during meetings with leaders of the U K  and Ireland this week to badger them about Huawei and amplify his administration s threats  He s instead taken a more cooperative approach 
 We deal very closely with    as you know    with your intelligence and your security and we re working on that together  And I know you re concerned like we re concerned  we re all concerned about it   Trump told Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Wednesday at Shannon Airport   We re working on it together very much with not only Europe but with Ireland  
After a meeting with U K  Prime Minister Theresa May a day earlier  he dismissed the idea of cutting Britain off from U S  intelligence gathering 
 No Limitations 
 We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences   Trump said in a joint news conference with May   I see absolutely no limitations  We ve never had limitations  This is a truly great ally and partner  and we ll have no problem with that  
Asked directly whether he was prepared to curb information sharing if Britain placed no restrictions on Huawei  Trump answered   no  
 Because we re going to have  absolutely  an agreement on Hauwei and everything else   he added 
Trump is expected to meet with French President Emanuel Macron on Thursday 
 Bad Cop  Pompeo
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo  who joined Trump in the U K   has essentially played  bad cop  in Europe  Prior to Trump s trip  Pompeo said during a visit to Germany that the U S  may have to change its  behavior  regarding intelligence sharing 
It echoed a warning Pompeo made in April to NATO allies 
 We ve made clear that if the risk exceeds the threshold for the United States  we simply won t be able to share that information any longer   he told reporters after meeting with counterparts from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Washington 
May s spokeswoman told reporters earlier Tuesday that the government is still reviewing its policy on Huawei and will make a decision based on  hard headed technical assessments  
Trump has been less understanding toward China and Huawei itself  His administration is seeking to choke off company s access to vital U S  components  requiring its American vendors to seek U S  government permission to do business with the company 
The issue has become entangled in Trump s trade war with China  particularly after the U S  president suggested the company s fate could be addressed in a deal to resolve economic disputes 
China has recently taken recent punitive actions toward U S  companies including FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   and Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  that analysts have regarded as retribution for Trump s trade policy and his administration s moves against Huawei

March e mini contracts on the S P 500 Index slid as much as 1 1 percent  reversing a 0 5 percent gain  Futures on the Nasdaq 100 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1 percent 
Key Insights

The S P 500 fell 1 5 percent on Wednesday  breaking its February intraday low as markets revolted from what they saw as a less dovish than hoped Fed rate increase  The central bank trimmed its outlook for hikes and cited softening global economic conditions 
The drop pushed the benchmark gauge s 14 day relative strength index into oversold territory  It s a technical signal that may indicate it will soon be time to buy U S  stocks 
The Fed s warning on softening global economic conditions echoed that of FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX    which on Tuesday cut its profit forecast amid a slowdown in global trade in recent months  with leading indicators pointing to an ongoing deceleration in the near term  The weaker outlook stoked concerns that the world economy is slowing amid rising trade tensions  especially between the U S  and China

164329,385845,FDX,Emerging Markets Are Fed Up With FedEx and the Fed,news," Bloomberg Opinion     FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   failed to deliver  as did the Federal Reserve 
The two broad factors that shape emerging market investing   global growth and the path of U S  rates   aren t playing out well  
On Wednesday  FedEx shares plunged 12 percent  the most in a decade  as the company  cut its earnings outlook just three months after raising it  CEO Fred Smith is putting the blame squarely on politicians  saying that the U S  trade war  China s  mercantilism  and Brexit are all sinking the global economic outlook  
Yet FedEx is merely mirroring concerns that have dogged global markets since October  when the International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth outlook set only six months earlier  
Following on FedEx s heels was the Fed s December rate decision  arguably its most important of 2018  which showed that Chairman Jerome Powell is no dove  While the central bank trimmed the number of rate hikes it foresees next year to two from three  it continued to refer to  further gradual increases  in its statement  a phrase that banks such as  HSBC Holdings  Plc  LON HSBA  had expected it to  drop entirely   The Fed also seems on course to continue reducing the size of its balance sheet by  50 billion a year  
Compare Powell now to his predecessor Janet Yellen in 2015  In the September meeting that followed China s shock 2 percent currency devaluation  she dropped the idea of a rate hike that month  citing turmoil in  recent global economic and financial developments   Financial conditions in the U S  back then were about as tight as they are now  yet Powell isn t budging  
Neither circumstance is good news for emerging markets  As I argued recently  the two broad factors that shape emerging market investing are strong global economic growth  which tends to lift export oriented nations such as China and South Korea  and the Fed s interest rate policies  which tend to move younger markets such as Indonesia and India  
What can emerging markets do to buffer themselves against these global headwinds  
Not much  But they can try to be nimble and align with the Fed s meeting schedule  as Bank Indonesia did  The central bank will follow the Fed s footsteps and deliver its rate decision today  just as it has done in March and September  Those emerging market central bankers who follow suit can thus raise rates if Powell remains a hawk  or pause and even reverse course when he stops  
Such agility is important because global winds are blowing fast   a headwind can quickly turn into a tailwind   After all  if FedEx  a global courier with a  42 billion market cap  and the venerable IMF can shift their views within a matter of months  why can t Powell  
Disinflation is also invading the world again  In the U S   as a softer oil price sets in  consumer inflation expectations may have peaked  limiting Powell s ability to hike rates in the future 
Elsewhere  China s producer prices have already fallen into deflation on a month to month basis  Even in high yielding nations such as Indonesia and India  inflation is stuck below 3 percent  It s no surprise  then  that government bonds around the world are staging a bull run as investors once again price this in 
It s not inconceivable that sometime in 2019  Bank Indonesia could reverse course  having raised rates by 1 75 percentage points already this year  The central bank needs to watch the Fed carefully  so as not to disturb foreign investors who hold about 40 percent of the country s government bonds  
Right now  the messages from FedEx and the Fed aren t boding well for emerging markets  What they need to do is align themselves with the world s largest central bank and play nimble ",2018-12-20,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/emerging-markets-are-fed-up-with-fedex-and-the-fed-1727134,1727134

164427,385943,FDX,Mounting costs add to worries about 2019 U S  profit growth,news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK  Reuters    Rising costs for companies are worrying investors already concerned about a step down in U S  corporate profit growth next year as Wall Street s focus turns away from 2018 s tax fueled earnings boost  Investors are on edge after a recent sharp pullback in U S  equities  including the biggest daily drop in the Dow and S P 500 since Feb  8 on Wednesday  A spike in U S  bond yields has renewed worries about rising interest rates and higher borrowing costs for companies and consumers   Third quarter reports will start pouring in this week from JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co and others  with investors and analysts likely looking for outlooks on higher labor costs  a stronger dollar and the impact of tariffs on raw materials prices    It s going to come down to earnings  The big concern isn t really what third quarter earnings numbers are  but really what the outlook for the fourth quarter and first quarters are   said Oliver Pursche  vice chairman and chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York  Even with Wednesday s selloff  the S P 500 remains up 4 2 percent for the year  Strong earnings had helped stocks bounce back from steep drops in February and March and have kept investors largely optimistic about market valuations  Analysts are projecting year over year profit growth of 21 4 percent for the third quarter  according to I B E S data from Refinitiv  in part reflecting the sweeping tax overhaul approved by Congress late last year  But this year s earnings growth  estimated at 23 1 percent  is likely the peak for the profit cycle  with growth forecast to slow to 10 3 percent in 2019 as the comparison period reflects a full year of lower corporate tax rates   Cost pressures for companies are mounting  Lori Calvasina  RBC Capital Markets head of U S  equity strategy  wrote in a note on Tuesday  adding that more than a third of S P 500 companies have seen full year margin expectations shrink since June  Calvasina said she s been factoring in  back half deceleration  in 2018 margins and also a stronger dollar  but expects those issues have not been  fully baked into bottom up consensus estimates yet    She and other strategists pointed to wage inflation as a key risk to profit margins  while companies already have cited worries about costs related to tariffs and the strengthening dollar  In Friday s jobs report  the unemployment rate fell to near a 49 year low  suggesting the labor market has tightened further  But wages rose steadily  pointing to moderate inflation pressures  The U S  dollar index is up about 3 7 percent for the year so far and is now trading above year ago levels  That could weigh on earnings from U S  multinational companies   Tensions between the United States and China  which already have imposed tariffs on each other s good  have meanwhile fueled concerns about higher costs for companies    What we re going to see is more of a focus on costs given that we ve heard a lot rumblings  on that front  said Kristina Hooper  chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York   As tariffs proliferate  this becomes a bigger issue  It s cost of goods  Second  it s wage costs  We re not seeing it really borne out in the jobs data yet  but from my perspective  there have to be industries that are feeling and experiencing an increase in wage costs   FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX  last month cited employee compensation and other expenses as it reported quarterly earnings that missed Wall Street expectations   To be sure  even a moderated pace of profit growth next year could still be considered good  given the huge boost from corporate tax cuts in 2018

Partners   NYSE APAM   as the Bull of the Day  FedEx   NYSE FDX   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP    Valero Energy   NYSE VLO   and Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  With the market pushing up to new all time highs every day  most stocks are getting in on the action  They say a high tide rises all the ships in the harbor and that is certainly the case with stocks  Eventually  the market will get tested  When it does  you want to make sure you are invested in stocks with the strongest earnings  Strong earnings will help the cream rise to the top One top stock to take a look at is today s Bull of the Day  Artisan Partners  Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc  is publicly owned investment manager  It provides its services to pension and profit sharing plans  trusts  endowments  foundations  charitable organizations  government entities  private funds and non U S  funds  as well as mutual funds  non U S  funds and collective trusts  It manages separate client focused equity and fixed income portfolios  The firm invests in the public equity and fixed income markets across the globe  It invests in growth and value stocks of companies across all market capitalization  For fixed income component of its portfolio the firm invests in non investment grade corporate bonds and secured and unsecured loans The stock is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The reason for the favorable rank lies in the series of earnings estimate revisions coming in to the upside for the stock  Over the last sixty days  three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year  That bullish behavior have pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate from  2 77 to  2 98  That has helped underpin a move higher in the stock It makes sense for a company in the investment management business to see increased earnings estimates  As the market goes higher  fees increase  which help these stocks make more money  The Financial   Investment Management industry is in the Top 6  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The market is in full on beast mode right now  Stocks are rocketing to new highs every day and it feels like you can do no wrong  Eventually  this too shall pass  The market is going to become more discriminatory when things get rough  When the going gets tough  you are going to want to have stocks with strong earnings trends  Prices may reverse quickly  but earnings trends tend to stay in place for extended periods of time  Today s Bear of the Day is a stock you may believe has a strong earnings trend but the fact is  it does not I m talking about Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  FedEx  FedEx Corporation provides transportation  e commerce  and business services worldwide  The company s FedEx Express segment offers shipping services for delivery of packages and freight  Its FedEx Ground segment provides business and residential money back guaranteed ground package delivery services  and consolidates and delivers low weight and less time sensitive business to consumer packages  The company s FedEx Freight segment offers less than truckload and other freight delivery services  As of May 31  2019  it operated approximately 28 000 vehicles and 373 service centers  I was surprised to see that over the last sixty days  twelve analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the current year while ten have followed suit for the next year  That s pushed down our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from  12 07 to  10 84 while next year s number is off from  13 75 to  12 41 These negative earnings estimate revisions came well before the coronavirus scare  Several companies have since come out and warned about profits being harmed by the scare  That s surely going to make a negative impact on FedEx as well The Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo industry ranks in the Top 44  of our Zacks Industry Rank  There is only one Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in the industry currently Oil Gets Lift from EIA Supply Data  Back Above  50Oil prices rose  1 14  or 2 3   to  50 75 a barrel on Thursday  recovering slightly from the steep sell off fueled by fears that the coronavirus outbreak in China would have a severe impact on oil demand U S  Crude Benchmark Falls into a Bear MarketThe commodity collapsed into a bear market earlier in the week  having plunged more than 20  from its 52 week high of  63 27 on Jan 6  In fact  the health scare  which has killed over 500 people so far and infected in excess of 28 000  was enough to send oil prices sliding below the psychologically important  50 a barrel for the first time in more than a year Overall  the latest round of energy market selling comes amid heightened worries of the mysterious illness playing out like the 2003 SARS epidemic  Although it is quite difficult at this stage to assess the possible implications  according to Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   the deadly virus could lower oil demand by up to 260 000 barrels per day if it impacts passenger traffic due to travel restrictions The EIA ReliefIt s the U S  Energy Department s latest inventory release that sent the market higher yesterday  The report revealed decrease in gasoline and distillate supplies  which more than offset the impact of higher than expected rise in crude stocks  Ahead of the EIA publication  oil prices had already been gaining strength on unconfirmed reports about the development of coronavirus vaccines that might stem the outbreak of the deadly strain  Crude price was also supported by indications that the OPEC  group is preparing deeper output cuts to stem the decline Let s review the EIA s Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Jan 31 Crude Oil The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 3 4 million barrels  compared to the 3 million barrels increase that energy analysts had expected  Tepid refinery activity drove the stockpile build with the world s biggest oil consumer even as U S  production dropped from record levels  This puts the total domestic stocks at 435 million barrels   2 7  below the year ago figure and 2  lower than the five year average The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma  the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange  was up 1 1 million barrels to 36 7 million barrels The crude supply cover was up from 25 9 days in the previous week to 26 5 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 26 6 days Turning to products  and it is a fairly bullish story Gasoline  Gasoline supplies fell after increasing for 12 straight weeks  The fuel s small drop  91 000 barrels to be precise  is attributable to higher demand  Analysts had forecast 1 9 million barrels climb  At 261 1 million barrels  the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 1 2  above the year earlier level and exceeds the five year average range by 4  Distillate Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  were down for a third consecutive week  The 1 5 million barrels decrease could be attributed to

164466,385982,FDX,Tiger s back on the prowl with Ryder Cup in his sights,news,"By Mitch Phillips PARIS  Reuters    The spiraling interest in the Ryder Cup means the biennial golf showpiece hardly needs hyping up but the stunning return to form of Tiger Woods  culminating in his first tournament victory for five years on Sunday  has undoubtedly added some extra French frisson to the event starting in Paris on Friday  Europe s top player Justin Rose finished in a share of fourth at the PGA Tour Championship to scoop the  10 million FedEx  NYSE FDX  prize but all eyes were on Woods  who has overcome four back surgeries and very public personal drama to return to the top of the game  A year ago he could barely walk  let along swing a club and few if any thought he would ever get close to the form that saw him bestride the game for so long  Yet here he is  if not quite back to his best  then certainly back to a level capable of going toe to toe with anyone else in the game   My body was a wreck  I was beyond playing  I couldn t walk  I couldn t lay down without feeling the pain in my back and leg   Woods said on Sunday looking back to his situation before he underwent spinal fusion surgery in April 2017   It s been an unbelievable season from beginning to end and I appreciate it much more now than 20 years ago   He now heads to Paris as part of a U S  team seeking to win overseas for the first time since 1993   Although his ranking was so low he needed a captain s pick to make the team  his recent surge in form and confidence means that he will undoubtedly be one of the focal points of Jim Furyk s team and the man the fans at the Le Golf National will want to follow  POOR RECORD The irony  however  is that Woods  Ryder Cup record is awful  In seven appearances he has been on the winning team once  and that was back in 1999  Though his singles record is strong  in foursomes and fourballs he has won nine  lost 16 and halved one  When it is taken into account that most of these matches took place when he was far and away the best golfer in the game and winning majors for fun  it is a shocking  but not that perplexing record  During his prime years Woods was a focused  solitary figure  able to communicate with fellow players or the media only through a fixed smile veneer that gave nothing away and invited nobody in  Now 42 and having hit rock bottom in his personal and professional life  he is said to be a different person than when he won his 14th and last major 10 years ago  Finding a partner for Woods was always a challenge for successive U S  captains for various reasons but this time  with Woods back after missing the previous two editions  there is likely to be a longer queue with their hand up than in previous years   I believe this time Tiger Woods will be a definite asset   Europe s 2014 winning captain Paul McGinley said at the weekend   His competitiveness is growing week by week and his rapport with fellow team members will be stronger   Current captain Thomas Bjorn  who had some memorable battles with Woods as a player  also welcomed his return   For such a big event you want big personalities  big profiles    I m excited about seeing Tiger back in the fold

164467,385983,FDX,NFL notebook  Garoppolo tore ACL  MRI confirms,news,"An MRI confirmed San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee on Sunday and is out for the season  the team announced Monday  Coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters following the 49ers  Sunday loss to the Kansas City Chiefs that the team feared Garoppolo had torn his ACL  C J  Beathard  a 2017 third round pick who went 1 4 as a starter last season  will be the team s starter moving forward  The 49ers are also bringing in former Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage for a visit  per an ESPN report  Garoppolo was carted to the locker room after his left knee buckled on a third and 20 scramble with the 49ers down by 14 points late in the fourth quarter  He could have stepped out of bounds but instead cut upfield  planting his left leg just before taking a big hit from Chiefs cornerback Steven Nelson    Baker Mayfield is the starting quarterback of the Cleveland Browns  coach Hue Jackson announced to reporters following practice  The proclamation confirmed what already seemed to be a foregone conclusion after Mayfield replaced an injured Tyrod Taylor last Thursday against the New York Jets and led the Browns  1 1 1  to a come from behind win    the team s first in 635 days   I informed the group this morning that we re going to start Baker Mayfield  and Tyrod will be the backup if healthy   Jackson said    Rookie Josh Rosen was named the Arizona Cardinals  starting quarterback  with coach Steve Wilks sending veteran Sam Bradford to the bench   Josh plays with a lot of confidence   Wilks told reporters   I think he gives us an opportunity to be able to be successful   Rosen  the No  10 overall pick  relieved Bradford late in the team s 16 14 loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday  He got two chances in the final five minutes to move the Cardinals into range for a game winning field goal  but was unable to do so   I think he handled it well   Wilks said    The New York Jets reached out to the Pittsburgh Steelers regarding holdout running back Le Veon Bell  according to multiple reports  The exchange was merely a  preliminary conversation  with no trade offer  per multiple reports  ESPN reported Sunday that the Steelers are listening to offers for Bell  who has yet to report to the team or sign his franchise tender after getting tagged for the second consecutive offseason  Bell ended his 2017 holdout before the regular season  but it remains unclear if or when he ll join the Steelers this season    The Los Angeles Rams will be without starting cornerbacks Marcus Peters and Aqib Talib for a few weeks  NFL Network reported  According to the report  Peters will miss two to four weeks with a strained right calf  and Talib is out four to six weeks with a high ankle sprain  The report added that initial tests showed no structural damage for Peters  and that he will have an MRI exam to confirm  Peters went down in the first half against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday and could not put any weight on his right leg as he was carried to the sideline  He was then helped to a cart and taken to the locker room  Talib limped off with an ankle injury in the second half and did not return    San Francisco cornerback Richard Sherman is expected to miss two to three weeks with a left calf injury  NFL Network reported Sherman was relieved to hear the injury was relatively minor  He left Arrowhead Stadium in a walking boot following the loss to the Chiefs  Sherman was noticeably limping and grimaced as he left the field at halftime  The 30 year old missed the second half of last season with a torn Achilles and battled a heel injury in practice last week    New York Giants tight end Evan Engram likely will miss a few weeks with a sprained MCL in his right knee  ESPN reported the extent of the injury  but the Giants already had resigned themselves to the idea that Engram would be out for multiple games  Engram left the locker room in Houston with a brace on his right knee and said he knew immediately something was wrong with the knee    Green Bay defensive lineman Muhammad Wilkerson underwent surgery Sunday night after suffering a  significant  injury to his left ankle in the loss to the Redskins  Packers coach Mike McCarthy confirmed  Wilkerson left the field on a cart in obvious pain during the second quarter of Green Bay s 31 17 defeat  He was taken from FedEx  NYSE FDX  Field to a Washington area hospital  where he remained overnight   There was a procedure he needed before he could travel   McCarthy said  NFL Network reported that the injury is likely season ending    Atlanta safety Ricardo Allen tore his Achilles in the Falcons  Sunday game and will miss the rest of the season  The Falcons confirmed Allen s injury on Monday and will play the rest of the year without their starting safeties  Strong safety Keanu Neal sustained a season ending knee injury in Week 1 at Philadelphia  Falcons coach Dan Quinn said the team is not planning to add a starting caliber safety  which would seem to rule out signing free agent Eric Reid or trading for Seattle Seahawks safety Earl Thomas  Quinn said the team is confident in reserve Damontae Kazee at free safety and the duo of Jordan Richards and Kemal Ishmael at strong safety  Reid has previously been mentioned by Quinn as an option after Neal s injury    Miami Dolphins defensive end William Hayes is out for the season with a torn ACL in his right knee  coach Adam Gase confirmed  Hayes sustained the injury while sacking Oakland quarterback Derek Carr in the second quarter of the undefeated Dolphins  28 20 win against the Raiders on Sunday  According to Gase  Hayes got his foot  caught in the ground  while  trying not to put body weight on the quarterback   a response to the NFL s emphasis on roughing the passer penalties this season  Meanwhile  Dolphins defensive end Andre Branch will miss two to four weeks with a knee injury  according to a Miami Herald report    Minnesota Vikings running back Dalvin Cook said he is taking his hamstring injury  day to day  and believes there s a good chance he can play Thursday night against the Los Angeles Rams  Cook hurt his hamstring late in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers but told reporters afterward he was fine and wouldn t miss time  However  he didn t practice last week and was held out of the Sunday loss to the Buffalo Bills  a move described as precautionary with the short week upcoming before a Thursday game  Cook said over the weekend he would  definitely  play against the Rams  but he was listed as a non participant on Monday s practice report    Dallas Cowboys linebacker Sean Lee injured his left hamstring against the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday and could miss a few weeks  according to multiple reports  Lee entered the game with a right hamstring issue that kept him limited in practice last week after he hurt the hamstring initially in Week 2  Lee left the Sunday game early and played just 36 snaps  52 percent   with first round rookie Leighton Vander Esch stepping in and making 11 tackles on 33 snaps   He didn t feel great after the game   head coach Jason Garrett said of Lee on 105 3 The Fan in Dallas    Redskins left tackle Trent Williams is having  a very minor procedure  on his knee during the team s Week 4 bye  according to a report from 106 7 The Fan in Washington  Williams  who had knee surgery after the season  reportedly will not miss any time due to the new procedure  The Redskins  next game will be at the New Orleans Saints on Oct  8 on  Monday Night Football   Williams did not miss a snap Sunday in Washington s win over the Packers    Hall of Fame wide receiver Tommy McDonald  a star of the Philadelphia Eagles  1960 NFL championship team  died  He was 84  Drafted in the third round from Oklahoma in 1957  McDonald led the NFL in touchdown receptions in 1958 with nine  and in 1961 he led the league in touchdowns  13  and receiving yards  1 144   Following a seven year stint with Philadelphia  he played for the Cowboys  Rams  Falcons and Browns before retiring after the 1968 season  McDonald finished his career with 495 catches for 8 410 yards and 84 touchdowns in 152 games    Cincinnati defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow sustained a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during the Bengals  Sunday loss to the Carolina Panthers and will miss the rest of the season  according to an NFL Network report  Glasgow  a fourth round pick from Michigan in 2017  appeared to get his knee caught in the turf while being blocked to the ground in the fourth quarter  He had to be carted off the field  and an MRI on Monday confirmed the ACL tear  per NFL Network  Glasgow  who turns 25 on Sept  30  tallied 11 tackles in the Bengals  first three games    The Indianapolis Colts released running back Christine Michael after claiming cornerback Arthur Maulet off waivers from the New Orleans Saints  Michael had two carries for 9 yards in the opener but has not played since  He was inactive in Week 2 and did not see a snap as an active player Sunday in Philadelphia  His release is a good sign for the health of Marlon Mack  who missed Week 1 with a hamstring issue and sat out Week 3 with hamstring and foot injuries  Meanwhile  coach Frank Reich said offensive lineman Joe Haeg will miss a few weeks with an ankle injury  Haeg started at left tackle for Anthony Castonzo in Week 1 and the last two games at right tackle before getting injured Sunday    The Los Angeles Chargers promoted running back Justin Jackson from the practice squad and waived running back Detrez Newsome  A seventh round rookie out of Northwestern  Jackson missed much of the preseason with an injury and did not make it through final cuts  Coach Anthony Lynn told reporters Jackson is fully healthy and has earned a chance to contribute  Newsome is an undrafted rookie from Western Carolina who made the initial 53 man roster    The Baltimore Ravens signed center Hroniss Grasu and waived defensive back Robertson Daniel  
Grasu was a third round pick of the Chicago Bears in 2015 and started eight games as a rookie  but he missed all of 2016 with a preseason knee injury before playing in just six games  four starts  last year    Field Level Media",2018-09-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/nfl-notebook-garoppolo-tore-acl-mri-confirms-1622112,1622112

164471,385987,FDX,Europe storms back to take Ryder Cup lead,news,"Europe rallied from a 3 1 deficit after the Friday morning fourballs to sweep the afternoon foursomes and take a 5 3 lead after the first day of the 42nd Ryder Cup at Le Golf National in Paris  Team Europe had its collective back against the wall after dropping the first three matches of the day and with the anchor team of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari two down after 10 holes against the vaunted American twosome of Tiger Woods and Patrick Reed  Molinari turned the momentum by winning the next two holes  Fleetwood got hot with the putter in winning the 15th and 16th holes and the Europeans closed out the match 3 1  It proved to be far more than a glimmer of hope  The Europeans then turned their attention to the afternoon foursomes  which they won 7 1 four years ago at Gleneagles and held a distinct advantage on entering Friday  The players on the course for European captain Thomas Bjorn entered with a collective 24 14 6 Ryder Cup record in the alternate shot format  while U S  captain Jim Furyk s squad was just 7 13 8  That historical precedent held up  with Europe rolling in birdies   often only needing pars   while the wheels quickly came off for most of the U S  teams in one of the most lopsided sessions in Ryder Cup history  It was the first 4 0 losing session for the Americans since 1989   I think a big thing this week for us is resilience  but also persistence   Rory McIlroy told the Golf Channel   You have to persist  persist  persist  until it turns around for you   This morning wasn t ideal  but it was still a better start than the one we got off to at Hazeltine  two years ago   So we just needed to put our heads together and just go out there and hit good golf shots  Foursomes on a day like this  with the conditions  is a very tough format to play   Europe held multiple hole leads at the turn in all four matches  with the U S  teams struggling mightily as the winds picked up at Le Golf National  The Americans won only three combined holes on the front nine among the four pairings  Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler  who rallied to win their morning fourball match  found no rhythm against Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson  Fowler struggled with his ball striking  while Johnson missed numerous makeable putts with his new cross handed grip he debuted at last week s Tour Championship  The pair didn t win a hole until No  12  and even picking up another win on No  13 wasn t nearly enough in a 3 2 loss   I think  it s  a lot about trust   Stenson told the Golf Channel about his 5 2 Ryder Cup record playing with Rose   When you re out there playing with a good friend and someone you ve played a lot of golf with and you trust him and his golf game     you don t feel any regrets when you hit a poor shot   We team up well together   It proved a quick rebound for Rose  who lost his morning fourball match with Jon Rahm 1 up to Tony Finaue and Brooks Koepka despite being 2 up through eight holes   Obviously pairing up with Henrik this afternoon is exactly what I needed just to curb it   Rose told the Golf Channel   Had a quick chat with Rory  and he gave us a task of putting a point on the board for him to follow   Webb Simpson and Bubba Watson were out next and things started out well with wins on two of the first three holes  But their play also tapered off as McIlroy and Ian Poulter reeled off four consecutive holes to close out the front nine  The Americans closed the gap with a win on No  11  but the Europeans responded with a pair of wins  including a birdie putt by Poulter after he narrowly missed driving it into the water on No  13  A win on No  16 closed out the match 4 2 as Europe pulled even on the day for the first time at 3 3  Poulter is now 5 1 in foursomes in his Ryder Cup career   I love it  I embrace it   Poulter said when asked why he excels in the format   And when you ve got great partners to go out and play golf with    it s inspiring   For me  I just want to get on a golf course  I want to see the fans  I want to hole putts and I want to help this team   One of Furyk s more curious pairings turned out to be the biggest disappointment  Phil Mickelson did not play well in the FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup Playoffs and entered the day with a career 5 7 4 Ryder Cup record in fourball matches  But he has struck up a good friendship with Bryson DeChambeau  and Furyk decided to roll them out in the afternoon while Woods sat out a session on the opening day for the first time in his Ryder Cup career  It was never a contest against Sergio Garcia and Alex Noren  who won two of the first three holes and were 7 up at the turn and cruised to a 5 4 victory that gave Europe a 4 3 lead  It was equal opportunity misery for DeChambeau and Mickelson  appearing in his record 12th Ryder Cup  who lost most holes by failing to give themselves even good looks at par attempts  They were in danger of equaling the biggest loss in Ryder Cup history   7 6 done three previous times   until winning three holes on the back nine before running out of time  Fleetwood and Molinari again did their jobs as the anchor team for Europe in the afternoon  Paired against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas  the Europeans quickly took a 3 up lead as the 25 year old American buddies failed to card a single birdie on the front nine  Spieth particularly struggled with his ball striking  and a win by the Americans on No  11 was quickly erased by wins by the Europeans on No  13 and 14  Fleetwood and Molinari closed out the match 5 4 to complete their 2 0 day as partners   I m very  very lucky that I had Francesco next to me all day   said Fleetwood  who was making his Ryder Cup debut on the same day his son celebrated his first birthday   It s not been easy  your emotions are so up and down  But it s been a very  very special day   
 We didn t come here to win the foursomes  we came here to win something else   said Molinari   It s great  the atmosphere here this afternoon was amazing  It s time to reset  get ready for tomorrow  They re going to be upset about this afternoon  and we need to be ready for the reaction     Field Level Media",2018-09-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/europe-storms-back-to-take-ryder-cup-lead-1628222,1628222

This chart looks at FedEx  NYSE FDX  over the past 12 years  during which time it has spent the majority of the last 10 years inside of rising channel  1  
It hit the top of this channel in January of 2018 as resistance came into play  Since hitting resistance  it has lost nearly 50  of its value 
The 50  decline has it nearing the bottom of its 10 year rising channel at  3  
Just remember that until broken  the bottom of this channel comes into play as a strong support test 
If the bottom of this channel is taken out  odds increase that the 10 year FDX bull market has come to an end

	You got the feeling from yesterday s lackluster session that the bulls were getting a little tired after five straight days in the green  so its really no surprise that two of the major indices couldn t hold onto their gains through the close 
	However  the NASDAQ just keeps rolling along  The tech heavy index now has a 6 day winning streak after hanging onto an advance of 0 05   or a little more than 4 points  to 8 827 73 
	That s another closing record for the index 
	The other major indices couldn t stay on the plus side  A final hour slide pulled the Dow lower by 0 10   or nearly 28 points  to 28 239 28  Meanwhile  the S P is finding difficulty in getting over 3200  as it slipped 0 04  to 3191 14 
	The five day winning streaks for these indices are now over 
	This was the first negative session for the Dow and S P since the Phase 1 trade deal was agreed to in principle late last week  A new round of all time highs followed 
	But we haven t heard much about the deal since then  which is actually great for those investors who are tired of hearing about it and still suffering from whiplash after all the conflicting trade headlines in the runup to the agreement 
	On the other hand though  it also means that excitement over the deal has waned  And the other big market news on Wednesday was a negative one  as FedEx  NYSE FDX  dropped 10  after fiscal second quarter earnings fell short of expectations 
	However  today s late pullback hasn t impacted the market s or the editors  optimism heading forward  The indices needed to take a break after running hot for a solid week 
	There s still more than enough time in 2019 for a new round of record highs and for the S P to get past 3200 Today s Portfolio Highlights  Technology Innovators  Chip names have been very strong lately  so Brian went back to the well on Wednesday and added another stock from this space  He picked up Alpha and Omega Semiconductor  AOSL   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  power semiconductors company  The stock has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 24  over that time  AOSL also has a good valuation  no shorts and is right around its 52 week high  Read the full write up for more on this new pick  Counterstrike  Shares of Steelcase  SCS  soared more than 16  today in the wake of its strong third quarter report  which included a positive earnings surprise of 31  and a raised guidance  Jeremy decided this was a good time to sell half of the position for a 22  return in less than 2 months  He ll hold onto the rest to see how far it can go  Check out the full write up for potential targets Home Run Investor  A 32  short interest position in Surgery Partners  SGRY  has  turned this stock into a rocketship ride higher   according to Brian  This healthcare services company missed earnings estimates for seven straight quarters before finally meeting the last time out  The editor thought the shorts should ve covered right there  but they were greedy and hung on too long  Now  earnings estimates are heading higher  which has made SGRY a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Brian thinks the chart is solid and the stock is headed to  20  so he added it on Wednesday  Read the full write up for more

164501,386017,FDX,Looking For Signs Of Topping On The S P 500,opinion,"Day 3 and our sloppy shooting star scenario still plays out in the S P 500  What struck me about the chart of the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   was the volume patterns that accompanied the potential shooting star formation 
However  after great volume  better than the daily average  on December 13  15  and 16  yesterday  the volume was scant in comparison  As we have learned  shooting stars  even sloppy ones  could be a sign that the end of this rally is near 
I call this pattern sloppy because the opening and closing prices were not close enough  Nevertheless  with two highs at 320 25 and a red close  should the price decline Thursday  bears may get yet another chance to go short with a tight stop 
However  if the prices rise and hold over 320 25  than we can consider it a false signal or a consolidation pattern  where overbought conditions get resolved with time rather than with a price correction 
That is precisely why we need to check in with the Economic Modern Family  below  to see what information they offer us  However  before we go into the Family s performance  another note on junk bonds 
We said that junk bonds  via SPDR  Bloomberg  Barclays   LON BARC  High Yield Bond ETF  NYSE JNK   head into the euphoria stage around 110  Yesterday s high was 109 98  The relative strength on the daily chart is overbought at nearly 100  
Euphoria is here  And wouldn t that be just the perfect time for the shooting stars to play out  she says cynically 
As far as the Economic Modern Family  as predicted  Granny Retail  via SPDR  S P Retail ETF  NYSE XRT   played more catch up  Granny get your guns  because we need you to shoot a bullseye 
Transportation  iShares Transportation Average ETF  NYSE IYT   took a hit with the dismal earnings performance in FedEx  NYSE FDX   That s a key component of the market as it represents consumer demand  In other words  we need to see demand grow not shrink 
Biotechnology  iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  NASDAQ IBB   a leader in the current rally  took a breather  Some news about the U S  buying drugs cheaper from Canada could explain the red day 
Regional Banks failed to hang onto its early gains  Not so worrisome at this point 
Sister Semiconductors also took a breather  Whether that turns into a more significant correction remains to be seen 
The Russell 2000  iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM   gained in price  The interpretation is that investors are optimistic that the manufacturing sector will grow  That is the best sign from the Family  Clearly IWM cannot falter here 
After a euphoric move in junk bonds  a potential bearish signal in SPY  NYSE SPY  should recent lows break  and a Family that hinges hopes on supply more than on demand  Santa s sleigh carries tricks and treats 
S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   316 20 or the 10 DMA support  320 25 new all time high matched today  Watch for any selling under the last 2 day lows
Russell 2000  IWM  163 25 support and must clear hold over 165 10 to keep going did so intraday but backed off by close

164502,386018,FDX,FedEx Tanks On Earnings  Look For Even Lower Prices,opinion,"Summary 
FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  sank by 10  on Wednesday  after the company posted earnings that missed Wall Street expectations  
Based on its market cycles  we believe the stock is headed lower in the coming months 






FedEx reported earnings per share of  2 51 and total revenue of  17 3 billion  compared to analyst estimates of  2 82 and  17 6 billion  Looking forward  management lowered its estimate for earnings to between  10 25 and  11 50 per share  compared to expectations of  12 03  
CFO Alan Graf explained that   Our revised guidance reflects lower than expected revenue at each of our transportation segments and higher than expected expenses driven by continued mix shift to residential delivery services  
Our approach to stock analysis uses market cycles to project price action  Our analysis is that FDX has begun the corrective phase for its minor cycle  We believe that by March  the stock may drop to as low as  120

164504,386020,FDX,FLM All 32  Team by team NFL notes,news,"AFC East Buffalo Bills  The Bills surrendered 28 points to the Chargers in the first half on Monday  and just a field goal in the second half in their 31 20 loss  The difference  Perhaps the defensive play calling of head coach Sean McDermott  After the half  McDermott took over from defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier   I just thought we needed a spark and that s my background  Coach Frazier does really good job as well as the defensive staff  I just felt like we needed a spark   McDermott said  He added   I didn t really change all that much  honestly  I thought the defense played with a lot of energy in the second half and the guys  give the players credit  they battled   Miami Dolphins  Running back Frank Gore passed Curtis Martin to move into fourth place on the all time rushing list on Sunday  Drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft after suffering two ACL injuries in college  the 35 year old Gore has rushed for 14 112 yards and 77 touchdowns during his career with the 49ers  Colts and Dolphins   I ve been doubted my whole life  especially coming out of college with the injuries I had   said Gore  in his 14th season   People said I would be in the league for two to three years and then I would be done  I ve been blessed to keep going and also have success   Hall of Fame members Emmitt Smith  18 355 yards   Walter Payton  16 726  and Barry Sanders  15 269  are ahead of Gore on the list  New England Patriots  The silver lining in the loss on Sunday at Jacksonville was the debut of rookie running back Sony Michel  who was out all preseason with a minor knee issue  A product of Georgia  Michel was a first round draft pick by the Patriots in April s draft  Michel rushed 10 times for 34 yards and caught a 7 yard pass from Tom Brady   Once I step on the field  I m ready to go   Michel said   There s no way that I can be trying to work my way back into stuff  Once I step onto the field and the doctors say I m good to go  I m good to go   Brady said   He had a tough injury early in camp and had some opportunities today and he will learn from them  He ran hard when he had some chances   New York Jets  Team owner Woody Johnson is away from New York  serving as ambassador to the United Kingdom  In his absence  his younger brother  Christopher  is running the team  Christopher said he likes it so much that he hopes to maintain some duties when his brother s ambassadorship is done   I m having the time of my life   the younger Johnson told reporters recently   If I was having that much fun with a five win season  imagine how much fun I ll be having if we actually start killing it  I m hopeful we can do that  I m looking forward to my brother coming back in a few years  He s a great leader  but no question  I m hoping to have a larger role at that point than I had prior  I think he d welcome that   AFC North Baltimore Ravens  With the Denver Broncos up next  Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said it s fair to put a spotlight on the Baltimore offensive line  The Cincinnati Bengals gave the Ravens  front five issues in Week 2   Not systemic in terms of what type of protections we re running  We had one bad matchup  a tight end on a pass rusher     he ended up hitting Joe on what would have been a big play for us   Harbaugh said   They won some one on one battles at times  You ve got to work really hard protecting your quarterback   The Broncos have seven sacks in two games  Flacco has been sacked five times this season  Backup Lamar Jackson has been sacked once in five drop backs as a change up option  Cleveland Browns  As the Browns lost belief in wide receiver Josh Gordon  they gained confidence in rookie Antonio Callaway  who delivered in spades Sunday at New Orleans  Callaway caught a 47 yard touchdown pass with 1 16 to go and a 16 yarder to set up a potential game tying field goal in the closing seconds  He is emerging as a standout in a wide receiver group turned on its ear since adding Jarvis Landry in the offseason  In addition to Gordon  the Browns parted with former first round pick Corey Coleman   That was big time  big boy football  That s what we expect him to do   Landry said   We re going to need a lot more of him this year  just like that   Quarterback Tyrod Taylor said Callaway  knows the opportunity in front of him   Cincinnati Bengals  Even when rookie center Billy Price went down against the Ravens in Week 2  the offensive line was a glowing strength  praised endlessly by quarterback Andy Dalton and coaches in the immediate aftermath of the game  Trey Hopkins had never played center before but stepped into the game and made every line call and adjustment  Offensive tackle Bobby Hart said the Bengals were successful even against the Ravens   funky  blitz packages because they kept it simple   We stuck to the things we knew well  and we were comfortable with that we wanted to do   he said   The results were there    just running our bread and butter plays  running the things where you don t have to worry about different looks and stuff  Just getting it and going  I m proud of the guys  and I m excited moving forward   Pittsburgh Steelers  Winless entering Week 3  a veteran locker room could be the greatest asset for the Steelers going forward  A tie at Cleveland and close loss to the Chiefs on Sunday put Pittsburgh out of the win column entering the third game of the season for the first time since 2013  when they started 0 4 and finished 8 8    It s just Game 2   offensive guard Ramon Foster said   No panic at all  None of that   Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said the Steelers understand it is  look in the mirror time  heading to Tampa Bay against the 2 0 Bucs for  Monday Night Football    We ll see   Roethlisberger said   how everyone wants to respond   AFC South Houston Texans  An 0 2 start brought critics out but coach Bill O Brien was quick to point out his team hasn t even played its first home game   We realize we have to do a lot better   O Brien said   We have to play more consistently  we have to practice better  we ve got to coach better  we understand that  but we also know there s a lot ball left to be played   Cornerback Johnathan Joseph is of the mind set that one victory can serve as the wake up call   You hear a lot of hype coming out of the preseason and things like that and then you have one or two games where it doesn t fall in your favor  sometimes it crumbles a little bit   Joseph said   but we re definitely standing tall in this locker room and we re moving on to next week   Indianapolis Colts  The defense will see Carson Wentz make his return from a major knee injury when they visit the Philadelphia Eagles and safety Malik Hooker says the unit will be ready for the test   He s a great quarterback  obviously  Everybody knows that   Hooker said   But at the end of the day  football s an 11 player game and not one  so we can t just let one person beat us  We re going to get out there and do the same thing and improve on the mistakes that we had this week   Colts first year coach Frank Reich is obviously familiar with Wentz after tutoring him the past two seasons as the Eagles  quarterback coach  Jacksonville Jaguars  The offensive line suffered a big blow with left tackle Cam Robinson going down with an ACL tear in his left knee during Sunday s win over the New England Patriots but the injury presents a big opportunity for Josh Wells  The 27 year old Wells was signed as an undrafted free agent in 2014 after playing collegiately at James Madison  He has made four previous NFL starts  all last season   It s a shame what happened to Cam  and I m praying for him    I really am   Wells said   But it is an opportunity now  and it s an expectation level between the group    and a trust between the group  I need to be someone who can be counted upon and play to the best of my ability   Tennessee Titans  Marcus Mariota  elbow  is still ailing and it wouldn t be a surprise if Blaine Gabbert is the starting quarterback for the second straight game when Tennessee faces the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday  Gabbert wasn t asked to do a lot but was steady enough    13 for 20  117 yards  one touchdown    and guided the team to the game winning field in a 20 17 win over the Houston Texans   He made some great throws  and he was the player of the game offensively   Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel said   I think Blaine gave us a chance to win the game and executed two great throws on that last drive   Vrabel said the team won t rush Mariota  who is experiencing tingling sensations and having issues gripping the football  AFC West Denver Broncos  Coach Vance Joseph said Monday he wasn t pleased with how the Broncos  defense started against the Raiders on Sunday  specifically pointing to the cornerbacks playing with too much cushion  Raiders quarterback Derek Carr reached halftime having gone 18 for 19 for 158 yards  which Joseph attributed to soft underneath coverage   I thought yesterday defensively that we didn t play aggressive enough in the first half   Joseph said       We played way too cautious      Our corners have to    have to    play with great confidence all the time and obviously play press coverage   Joseph said he liked how the group responded after halftime  though Carr went 11 for 13 for 130 yards after the break  Kansas City Chiefs  Lost in the commotion of Patrick Mahomes  six touchdown day at Pittsburgh was that the youngster  who turned 23 on Monday  handled the Steelers  blitzes effectively   The thing that I think gets overlooked in this is they threw a bunch at him   coach Andy Reid told reporters   which I thought was gonna be an important thing for him to work with   Reid added that the offensive line  which allowed just one sack on the day  played a major role in handling Pittsburgh s disguised looks   The O line did a really good job of picking the stuff up and kind of kept him clean   Reid said   Even when they tried to press the receivers and throw your timing off  the O line still gave him enough time where he could still function   Los Angeles Chargers  Melvin Gordon finished with only nine carries and 28 yards  including a 20 yard TD  in Sunday s romp over the Bills  compared to 11 carries for 77 yards by Austin Ekeler  but Gordon added six receptions for 38 yards and two scores  Through two games  Gordon leads the team in receptions  15  and receiving touchdowns  two   while gaining 140 yards through the air  Coach Anthony Lynn expects that production to continue   Melvin has excellent hands  and he s a decent route runner   Lynn told reporters   We re trying to get him more involved in the passing game  and I think you re seeing that the first couple weeks   Oakland Raiders  The Raiders have tallied just two sacks through two games  but coach Jon Gruden said he doesn t have regrets about dealing defensive end Khalil Mack to the Chicago Bears   We made the trade   Gruden told reporters       I d have loved to have had him here  but he s not here  Somebody has to step up   Gruden added that the Raiders  need more and more  from defensive end Bruce Irvin  who had a sack in the opener and a QB hit and tackle for loss in Denver   I know he s giving us everything he has   Gruden continued   It s tough on him  certainly  because we do have a lot of new guys around him up front   NFC East Dallas Cowboys  Former Oklahoma quarterback Landry Jones  cut by Pittsburgh on Sept  1  worked out for the Cowboys on Monday  according to the Star Telegram  Jones  29  could be the veteran quarterback the Cowboys need to back up Dak Prescott  The current backup is Central Michigan product Cooper Rush  and coach Jason Garrett had this to say about him after their Aug  26 game against the Cardinals   There were some good things in the game and obviously there were some bad plays  He ll learn how to handle some of the situations better as he goes forward      When you re in some challenging situations  all of that gets tested  At times  I thought he handled it really well  Other times  he didn t handle it well enough   New York Giants  For a team that some thought had Super Bowl potential  the Giants played far from superbly on Sunday night in a 20 13 loss to the Cowboys  And their performance left new coach Pat Shurmur and quarterback Eli Manning looking for answers   We certainly didn t do enough in terms of offense to    we didn t score enough points  especially early   Shurmur said   And then the game gets twisted like that and you got to pass it more than you want to  Just didn t make enough plays  so here we are  we re 0 2   Manning added   We didn t execute well enough  When we did get some first downs we made  but seemed to be going backwards a few plays later  We got into some third and longs and tough situations   Philadelphia Eagles  Move over  Norm Van Brocklin  With a 12 yard pass Sunday against Tampa Bay  Nick Foles surpassed the Hall of Fame member and moved into ninth place on the Eagles  all time passing yardage list  Van Brocklin had 7 497 yards from 1958 60  Foles now has 7 741 but is a long way from No  1  Donovan McNabb with 32 873 yards  Foles likely won t hold that spot long  Third year quarterback Carson Wentz  shelved to start the season with a knee injury  is expected to start Sunday and send Foles back to the bench  In just 29 games with the Eagles  Wentz sits at No  12 on the all time list with 7 078 yards and could climb quickly   He probably will come back stronger and better than ever   Adam Dedeaux  Wentz s mechanics coach at 3DQB  told NFL com  Washington Redskins  The Redskins traditionally have one of the staunchest fan bases  but this season is off to a bad start  The home opener at FedEx  NYSE FDX  Field on Sunday saw the lowest crowd in the stadium s history  57 013  The previous low  according to Pro Football Reference  was 76 512 in 2015  The Redskins are 1 1  beating Arizona on the road in Week 1 and losing to Indianapolis 21 9 on Sunday  Team president Bruce Allen spoke about attendance late last week   I think we re going to be OK  We had a nice pep rally out here at Redskins Park night and I think we re going to be fine  You can feel the enthusiasm with our fans for this team  It is the right talent and attitude  and they re putting out an effort that we haven t seen in a while   NFC North Detroit Lions  Nevin Lawson and Teez Tabor are next in line if cornerback Darius Slay isn t cleared from a concussion in time for  Monday Night Football  with the New England Patriots  Slay s status will not be updated until Thursday  He was ushered to the sideline after taking a blow to the head in each of the first two regular season games  and left Week 2 at San Francisco following a collision with 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk  Head coach Matt Patricia signaled a possible start for Tabor when pressed about the next man up   I think Tabor does a good job every week of being ready to go  He studies  he s smart  He s a big  long guy that can go out there and obviously have a good presence  But  I m always confident that he s ready to go   Patricia said  Green Bay Packers  Linebacker Clay Matthews and head coach Mike McCarthy are seeking clarity from the NFL on what they labeled a  gray area  when it comes to enforcement of roughing the passer penalties  For the second game in a row  Matthews was penalized for roughing late in the game  including Sunday when he hit Kirk Cousins in the ribs as Cousins delivered a pass that was intercepted for what would have been a game sealing pick   I get what the goal  of player safety  is  and we re all for the goal being achieved  but at the same time  you have to make sure it s not a competitive disadvantage to the pass rusher trying to hit the quarterback   McCarthy said Monday  He also questioned the validity of a holding call on left guard Lane Taylor that wiped out a touchdown pass to tight end Jimmy Graham  Minnesota Vikings  Blair Walsh was granted several chances to save his job with the Vikings under coach Mike Zimmer  but after cutting Kai Forbath in favor of the Auburn rookie  Daniel Carlson missed his shot to endear himself to a Super Bowl hopeful  Carlson missed three field goal attempts in the Week 2 tie at Green Bay  including two in overtime   Guys are supposed to do their jobs   Zimmer said  On Monday  when Carlson was waived  Zimmer was asked to explain the decision   Did you see the game   The follow up question was whether the decision was easy  Zimmer said  Yeah  it was pretty easy   NFC South Atlanta Falcons  Coach Dan Quinn disagrees with published reports claiming running back Devonta Freeman  knee  will be sidelined two or three weeks  but was unable to say if Freeman will be available for Sunday s game against New Orleans Saints   We re not sure where that report came from  it certainly didn t come

164530,386046,FDX,FedEx  FDX  Lags Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"FedEx  FDX  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 51 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 79 per share  This compares to earnings of  4 03 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  10 04   A quarter ago  it was expected that this package delivery company would post earnings of  3 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 05  delivering a surprise of  3 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
FedEx  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo industry  posted revenues of  17 32 billion for the quarter ended November 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 40   This compares to year ago revenues of  17 82 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
FedEx shares have added about 1 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 27 3  
What s Next for FedEx 
While FedEx has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for FedEx was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 26 on  17 27 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  11 97 on  69 70 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo is currently in the bottom 19  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-12-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fedex-fdx-lags-q2-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200493279,200493279

1  Trump Readies New  200B Tariffs in China Trade War 
As a new week kicks into action  the U S  China trade spat will likely remain a key driver of sentiment 
U S  President Donald Trump is likely to announce new tariffs on about  200 billion on Chinese imports as early as today  according to a senior administration official 



The tariff level will probably be about 10   the Wall Street Journal reported  far below the 25  the administration said it was considering for this possible round of tariffs 
The WSJ later reported that China may decline to participate in proposed trade talks with the U S  later this month if the Trump administration moves forward with additional tariffs on imported Chinese goods  as Beijing won t negotiate under threat 
Officials are also considering potential retaliation steps  the report said 
U S  Sino trade war fears have been simmering for months  Neither side is showing any signs of backing down  fueling worries that world s two largest economies are spiraling towards a trade war that could shake the global economy 
2  Global Stocks Knocked Lower
Global stock markets were lower as investors took fright at news Washington was set to announce a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods in the latest escalation of their trade conflict 
In Asia  markets in the region ended deep in negative territory  led by losses in China  The Shanghai Composite fell 1 1  to close at the lowest level since November 2014  while the smaller cap Shenzhen Composite dropped 1 4  
The downbeat sentiment carried over to Europe  where the continent s major bourses were mostly lower  with most of the sectors in the red  The pan regional STOXX 600 benchmark was down 0 3  in mid morning trade  with trade sensitive autos and mining stocks the worst performing 
On Wall Street  U S  stock index futures pointed to a slightly lower open 
At 5 35AM ET  the blue chip Dow futures were down 35 points  or about 0 1   the S P 500 futures shed 4 points  or around 0 1   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a decline of 12 points  or roughly 0 2  
3  FedEx  Oracle Report Earnings
There is a late quarter lull in earnings reports  but results are still expected from a pair of notable companies today 
FedEx  NYSE FDX  is slated to report fiscal first quarter results after U S  markets close  The shipping giant is expected to report earnings of  3 83 per share on revenue of  16 88 billion  according to estimates 
Oracle  NYSE ORCL  is also scheduled to report fiscal first quarter numbers after Monday s closing bell  Analysts on Wall Street expect earnings per share of 68 cents on revenue of  9 25 billion 



4  Dollar Slides to 6 Week Low
Away from equities  the U S  dollar edged lower against its major rivals to start the week  as investors sold the greenback amid renewed fears over an escalating trade war between the world s two largest economies 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was down 0 15  at 94 35  the lowest level since the end of July 
Against the yen  the dollar was a shade lower at 111 95  but still within sight of Friday s two month high of 112 16 
The dollar has seen a surge in safe haven demand from an escalation of global trade tensions between the U S  and its major trading partners on the belief that the U S  has less to lose from the dispute 
On the data front  the Empire State Manufacturing survey is due out at 8 30AM ET 
In the bond market  U S  Treasury prices were little changed  with the benchmark 10 year yield holding at 2 995   while the Fed sensitive 2 year note stood at 2 775  
5  Brexit Talks Set to Pick Up Pace
The euro and the British pound enjoyed positive starts to the week  as markets cheered encouraging developments on terms for Britain s exit from the European Union 
The euro ticked up 0 2  to 1 1650 against the dollar  not far from a three week top of 1 1721 set on Friday 
The pound was also slightly higher at 1 3095  within sight of Friday s peak of 1 3145  which was the strongest level since July 31 
The first of three Brexit summits are set for the coming week  where European Union leaders hope to settle an agreement within the next two months over the terms of Britain s departure 
The timing of the meetings tallies with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier s suggestion that an exit deal could be struck in six to eight weeks if negotiators are realistic in their demands 
British Prime Minister Theresa May has warned rebels in her party that unless they support her potential Brexit deal with the EU then they will face a no deal

164598,386114,FDX,Manufacturing PMI Gets Even Uglier  But Is It The End Of The World ,opinion,"It was another ugly data set from the ISM manufacturing read  but it may not mean we re headed for a full blown recession 




If   then this is even uglier  Not only have the headline PMI  new orders and production contracted at their fastest pace since the great recession  employment is its lowest since 2007 and exports fell off a cliff  On the backdrop of global growth concerns  this only exacerbates these fears and resulted in the S P 500 shedding  1 2  and USD JPY printing a potential top and basically slamming risk appetite  Whilst this has seen further calls for a recession  we d want to see the service PMI read also tank before placing that bet 




ISM Manufacturing PMI data remains a firm favourite for predicting recessions  as it has done an excellent job since its inception since 1948  albeit a few false signals   Yet times are changing  Data from the world bank suggests that as of 2017  the US Services sector accounted for over 77  of GDP  Therefor Services PMI could warrant a closer look in tandem with manufacturing PMI  to better access whether the US in fact is headed towards  or already  in a recession 
Upon first inspection  a clear divergence appears between the two  services PMI remains firmly expansive whilst manufacturing is contracting at its fastest rate since 2009  So  which one is correct 




Service PMI has remained expansive since the last recession in late 2009  whilst manufacturing PMI has provided two false signals in 2012 and 2016  we ll ignore the marginal  1 month contractions around these key dates   On both occasions  service PMI remain defiantly expansive and the US did not head into recession 
However  when growth momentum for manufacturing declined between 2004   2008 and ultimately predicted a recession  service PMI weakened in tandem  essentially confirming the broad scale deterioration of the broader economy  Yet this doesn t seem apparent this time around 
That said  the spread between manufacturing service PMI is reaching levels which usually prompts mean reversion which leaves the following scenarios 
Service PMI drops to close the gapManufacturing bounces to close the gap  orThey meet somewhere in the middle Two out of those three likely end with both in expansive territory  so perhaps we re not heading to the end of the world in recessionary terms yet 









Still  a weak manufacturing PMI is clearly bad for that sector  So should come as no major surprise to see the Dow Jones Transportation falling over  2 3   The iShares Transportation Average  NYSE IYT  has been ranging between  175   200 since April  but momentum is pointing lower and prices appear to be headed for the lows  Given the bad numbers from manufacturing PMI  we d expect the index to head for and break beneath 175 over the coming week s 
Since the   FedEx  NYSE FDX  has broken out of a small  bearish pennant and the June 2016 low  The mixture of the trade war and contracting manufacturing are likely to weigh on the stock without a solid turnaround in sentiment  so we remain bearish  Over the near term we d like too 147 82 hold as resistance  although we could also use 154 57 as a more conservative approach for risk management  For now  we re waiting to see if the stock can  make its way down to the January 2016 low ",2019-10-02,Matt Simpson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/manufacturing-pmi-gets-even-uglier-but-is-it-the-end-of-the-world-200469735,200469735
164599,386115,FDX,Trump Admin Blacklists Another 28 Chinese Firms Ahead Of Trade Talks  Ambarella,opinion,"In a surprise move which probably shouldn t come as a surprise  Trump admin goes for the usual shock tactic ahead of key talks with China 
The Trump admin has added an additional 28 Chinese firms to its Entity List  which effectively restricts their ability to do business with the U S  firms  Whilst the U S  has denied that the move is related to trade talks  it s hard to imagine the move is not designed to provide the U S  with leverage  given trade talks are just 2 days away  But for what it s worth  the official reason is for Beijing s mistreatment of ethnic minorities and breach of human rights  Asked on whether a trade deal will be reached this week  a sceptical Trump said  Can something happen  I guess  maybe  Who knows  But I think it s probably unlikely  





Hangzhou HikVision and Zhejiang Dahua Technology are notable additions to the blacklist  the former is the world s largest supplier of video surveillance products  the latter  also in video surveillance  was alleged to have released a deceptive firmware update to  fix  vulnerabilities of its hardware devices  following the largest DDoS attack in history  With trading in HikVision shares now on halt  their U S  supplier Ambarella  NASDAQ AMBA  slid over  12  in after hours trading as HikVision is rumoured to account for revenue to Ambarella in the  high teens  
We ll have to wait to see where it opens in the U S  session  but whilst prices trade below the 54 04 55 50 resistance zone  further downside remains the bias A break below 50 could suggest that bears have retained control The 47 46 his is the neat bearish target near the 200 day eMA 




FedEx  NYSE FDX  warrants another look following the recent developments  Back in July  Huawei accused FedEx of unauthorised re routing of its packages which led to China investigating the US firm  just one day after announcing they will draft up an  unreliable entity list  of foreign companies  Whilst no company has been officially added to the list  one has to wonder if it is now just a matter of timing  And  technically speaking  now appears ideal with a potential swing trade setting up 
Since breaking beneath the 2016 low and out of a small bearish pennant  prices have retraced towards the resistance zone and printed a small  bearish pinbar  Whilst this may not mark the actual top  it shows a reluctance to push higher so perhaps bears can now carve out a swing high The bias remains bearish below 174 82 and we re waiting for bearish momentum to return to suggest the high is in placeWhilst this could head towards 120 over the coming weeks if sentiment allows  we can use the monthly S1 around 133 as an interim target A clear break above 147 82 invalidates the bearish bias and warns of a false break at the lows ",2019-10-08,Matt Simpson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trump-admin-blacklists-another-28-chinese-firms-ahead-of-trade-talks-ambarella-200471340,200471340

164622,386138,FDX,Whilst FedEx Sounds The Alarm For Global Trade  Can UBS Weather The Storm ,opinion,"Whilst FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  is on the brink of breaking key support   United Parcel  Service Inc  NYSE UPS  is just 4  from its YTD  Disappointing earnings and a lowered full year outlook saw FedEx plummet over  10  at market open last Tuesday  and it was the main reason behind the Dow Jones Transportation sell off whilst also triggering fresh concerns for the global economy 




We can see that FedEx  NYSE FDX  performance can be taken as a bellwether for global trade by comparing the YoY  of FedEx with YoY Trade volume  Whilst the correlation is not perfect  its still a decent enough proxy and would suggest that global trade is to drop further  and therefor  global growth and potential for further easing from central bankers  




Looking at the daily FedEx  NYSE FDX  chart  prices has been oscillating between 148   178 since June  although the 200 day average capped as resistance near the top of the range before rolling over to the low of the range  In fact  FedEx closed to a 3 year low yesterday and sits just ticks above key support 
Given the series of lower highs and pick up of bearish momentum  we re waiting for prices to break the June 2016 low to signal a resumption of the bearish trend Bearish target is around 120  just above the January low  Whilst the trend remains bearish below 176 76  we d step aside with a break above 154 57 as it warns of a corrective bounce from key support  We d then look to reassess the potential for a short trade if a new lower high is created  beneath 176 76 




Interestingly  their rival UPS isn t facing the same headwinds with the stock trading just 4  from this year s highs  Still  it s failed to retest the 125 high so there is potential for this one to roll over too  But perhaps another way to look at this is as an inter sector pairs trade  given the ratio between UPS FDX has been rising sharply 
Looking at the weekly chart  USD has outperformed FDX on a relative basis since early 2018 when the ratio broke above its bearish trendline  Given the ratio is rising rapidly  there could still be some juice left for this pair Last week s bearish elongated Doji warns of near term weakness  yet the stock continues to outperform Fedex on a relative basisPrice action on UPS broke above its bearish correction line in July and continues to print higher lows to show the trend is bullish A break above 125 assumes bullish continuation  whilst the potential for a deeper correction remains whilst it trades below 123 63",2019-09-24,Matt Simpson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whilst-fedex-sounds-the-alarm-for-global-trade-can-ubs-weather-the-storm-200467302,200467302

164643,386159,FDX,Opening Bell  U S  Futures Drop As Fed Tilts Hawkish  FedEx Plummets,opinion,"U S  futures slip on uncertainty over Fed path to lower rates
European shares  euro climb with bank stocks
Yen leaps as BoJ bucks Fed  ECB rate cuts
FedEx stock plunges as group s warning of economic slowdown heightens investor worries
Key events
Futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 dropped this morning on increased uncertainty over the Fed path to lower interest rates  while Europe s STOXX 600 climbed with the euro as bank shares rallied on the outlook interest rates may not fall by as much as previously expected 

U S  contracts were showing a different behavior  posting an early dip that retested yesterday s lows  SPX futures fell for seven out of 10 hours after investors realized the Fed may lack consensus to be as accommodative with the market as some hoped  even after the central bank implemented a widely expected 0 25  rate cut on Wednesday 
In the earlier Asian session  most regional indices climbed  with Australia s S P ASX 200   0 54   outperforming  Hong Kong s Hang Seng   1 07   was the only major index to close in the red  as civil unrest in the city continued 
The Chinese yuan dropped as traders weighed the odds of the People s Bank of China lowering borrowing costs  
Meanwhile  the Bank of Japan maintained its key rate unchanged  bucking looser monetary policy from the Fed and the ECB 

The yen jumped after the central bank s announcement  erasing yesterday s losses  with the USD JPY finding support by the 100 DMA  The currency s climb partly pared gains on the Nikkei 225  turning the equity index s session trading pattern into a shooting star  confirming the April highs  resistance 
Global Financial AffairsIn yesterday s U S  session  stocks ended little changed after a divided Fed demonstrated a murky path to lower rates  with only one FOMC member seeking a bigger rate cut and two opposing any hike at all  Intraday  the S P 500 recorded the worst drop in four weeks  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell  however  vowed to be vigilant against any signs of economic slowdown  





In bond markets  yields on 10 year Treasurys slipped for the fourth consecutive session  Technically  the yield is squeezed between the 100 and 50 DMAs upon nearing the downtrend line since November 2018  at the 2  key level 
Overall  lingering fears of a recession maintain pressure on yields 

Case in point  FedEx  NYSE FDX  stock sank on Wednesday as the company slashed its profit outlook and missed earnings expectations  blaming slowing economic growth caused by the U S  China trade dispute  The group s shares plunged about 14  to less than 1  from the Aug  27 low which in turn marked the lowest price since June 2016  Mad Money host Jim Cramer characterized FedEx guidance as the  most dispiriting call about the economy I ve heard in a very long time  
Meanwhile  the Dollar Index pared half of yesterday s gains 
The Australian dollar dropped for the second day after fresh figures showed the country s unemployment rate ticked higher in August  Technically  the AUD USD is within 1  of its Aug  7 low  the lowest since March 2009 
Up Ahead
Quarterly expiration of futures and options on indexes and stocks on Friday could add to this week s key calendar events to boost volatility

The price of the digital token also got a boost  Bitcoin jumped as much as 3 95 percent to  8 713 in early trading  rebounding from a more than three week low reached earlier Monday

164688,386204,FDX, FedEx Has High Expectations for Blockchain  Top Executives Say ,news,"FedEx  NYSE FDX  reiterated its confidence in blockchain technology on Monday at the Consensus 2018 conference  where CEO Frederick Smith said the US shipping giant was investing in distributed ledger technology  DLT  to achieve higher efficiency in its freight business  According to chief information officer Robert Carter  blockchain is a game changer  the Wall Street Journal  
Smith remarked 

 We re quite confident that  blockchain  has big  big implications in supply chain  transportation  and logistics  In the area where FedEx makes its living  this could be a big deal  

Giving cross border transactions as an example  he said they often fail or get delayed because the parties share inconsistent data  Current practices also enable criminals to commit fraud by trading illegal items or avoiding taxes 

 What blockchain has the potential to do  for the first time ever  is to make that information available to all of the parties   Smith added 

As of now  FedEx uses its own databases and systems to store detailed records of custody  Blockchain technology would allow it to track shipments beyond its systems  Moreover  it would come with several significant advantages  among them fewer errors  lower costs  and higher security 

 This is such a game changer for us because it extends those boundaries outside of our four walls   Carter stated 

FedEx is working on a technology that has been created on the Ethereum and Hyperledger platforms  Carter revealed that the company had yet to decide which ledger technologies are best for it 
Last year  we  that FedEx had become a member of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance  BiTA   an organization of executives operating in the freight and transportation industries that aims to standardize blockchain approaches

164705,386221,FDX,Earnings Preview  FedEx  FDX  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"FedEx  FDX  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on September 17  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This package delivery company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 20 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 5  
Revenues are expected to be  17 14 billion  up 0 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FedEx 
For FedEx  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FedEx will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that FedEx would post earnings of  4 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 01  delivering a surprise of  4 16  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
FedEx doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-09-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-fedex-fdx-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200463331,200463331

earnings season  which will really get underway in mid October with the bank results  is not expected to show any improvement from the tepid earnings growth trends of the first half of the year  Q3 Earnings Season PreviewNote  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  Here are the key points The Q3 earnings season  which will really get underway in mid October with the bank results  is not expected to show any improvement from the tepid earnings growth trends of the first half of the year Total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  4 7  from the same period last year on  4 3  higher revenues  This would follow  0 1  decline in Q2 and a flat showing in Q1 Q3 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for Energy   23 1    Basic Materials   20 5   and Technology   11 2    Excluding the Technology sector  total Q3 earnings would be down  2 6   Sectors with positive earnings growth in Q3 include Business Services   7 3    Transportation   6 5    Utilities   3 1   and Finance   1 7    Q3 earnings for the index would be down  6 3  on an ex Finance basis Estimates for Q3 came down as the quarter got underway  with the current  4 7  decline down from  1 3  in late June  The magnitude of negative revisions to Q3 estimates are in line with the comparable periods in other recent quarters For the small cap S P 600 index  total Q3 earnings are expected to be down   13  from the same period last year on  3 8  higher revenues  This would follow declines of  12 3  and  18 4  in 2019 Q2 and Q1  respectively The growth challenge is expected to be a 2019 affair only  with tough comparisons to last year s tax cut driven record earnings the primary contributing factor  with growth expected to resume from 2020 onwards Total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  0 4  on  2 6  higher revenues this year  which would follow the  23 1  earnings growth on  9 2  higher revenues in 2018  Growth is expected to resume in 2020  with earnings growth of  10  on  5 5  higher revenues   The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2019 P E of 18 5X and index close  as of September 10th  is  161 48  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  177 64 for 2020  P E of 16 8X   The multiples for 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year We still have about four weeks to go before the Q3 earnings season really gets going  but we will officially start tracking this reporting cycle in the next few days as companies with fiscal quarters ending in August like Oracle   NYSE ORCL    FedEx   NYSE FDX   and others coming out with quarterly results  All of these companies with fiscal quarters ending in August can count as part of the September quarter tally  In fact  we will have seen results from almost two dozen such companies by the time JPMorgan   NYSE JPM   reports results on October 15th The expectation is that the overall earnings growth picture emerging from the Q3 earnings season will not be much different from what we saw in the first two quarters of the year Total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  4 7  from the same period last year on  4 3  higher revenues  Driving this weak growth picture is tough comparisons to last year when earnings were boosted by the tax reform Estimates for Q3 came down as the quarter got underway While the revisions trend is undoubtedly negative  the magnitude of decline in Q3 earnings estimates is about in line with historical trends Earnings growth was flat in the March and June quarters  and is expected to be down  4 7  in the current period and in modestly positive territory in the last quarter of the year  My sense is that actual Q3 growth will most likely be in the vicinity of what we saw in the first half of the year and Q4 earnings growth will most likely turn negative by the time we are closing the books on the Q3 reporting cycle Media ContactZacks

164707,386223,FDX,S P 500 Earnings  FedEx This Week   A Look Into A Major Transport,opinion,"FedEx  NYSE FDX  reports their fiscal Q1  20 after the closing bell on Tuesday  September 17th  2019 
The major transport component gives investors a look into a number of major geographies  not the least of which is Europe and South East Asia and China  via FedEx Express and also a look into the U S  consumer via FedEx Ground 
FedEx  has had a number of headwinds the last 18 months  which has brought the stock down from  274 in January  18 to its close Friday  September 13th 2019 at  174 
When FedEx  reported their fiscal Q4  19 in June  19  they guided conservatively  as they usually do  for 2020 given the tariff issues  what s happened with China growth  European growth  etc  so the stock has been consolidating in this trading range between the low  150 s and  200  April  19 high  since the December  18 low at  150 94  On the June  19 call  FedEx guided to lower Express and Ground margins and said only Freight would see margin expansion in fiscal 2020 
The important thing is the stock has NOT made a new low with the lower 2020 guidance and conservative estimates around Express and Ground 
 The drone attacks on Saudi Arabia crude oil facilities is another fly in the ointment given FedEx s P L delta to crude oil prices and fuel costs  so that could be a new and interesting development covered on the conference call Tuesday night  
Companies that report between now and the end of September  early October  typically have an August 31 quarter end date  which gives readers an extra two month look into U S  economic activity  from the June  19 quarter end with the 2nd quarter earnings reports  This perspective matters

 Source for forward estimate  IBES by Refinitiv  all the other data is this blog s work 
Summary   Conclusion   Unless we start seeing major pre announcements by larger U S  S P 500 components  the pattern for the last two weeks of the quarter should be the same  as revisions dwindle and analysts await the third quarter financial results starting around October 10  2019 
The data being shown readers is being expanded to show more valuation data and earnings info  but it might be regrouped into  forward  and then  trailing  data so readers can see both data sets 
There has been a narrowing of the  forward  S P 500 earnings growth rate  comparing the forward 4 quarter estimate today  versus 52 weeks ago  which means analysts haven t gotten aggressive regarding 2020 yet  although that could change with the 4th quarter since  comp s  get easier vs Q4  18 earnings growth  which was the first quarter that the S P 500 earnings growth started to slow versus the first three quarters of 2018 
The S P 500 earnings yield of 5 7  still indicates that we have a  reasonably valued  SP 500  with any move above 6  on the earnings yield triggering a rally  The S P 500 earnings yield peaked at 7 02  on December 21  2018  No doubt this site will get the typical comments about the S P 500 PE ratio  etc  and valuation  but read below before commenting 
Here is what very few have noticed so far about 2018 and 2019 
2018  The S P 500 grew EPS in 2018 roughly 23  and the index returned  4 5 
2019  so far   S P 500 EPS is expected to grow 2   and the index is up roughly 18  20  YTD 
Average them together and S P 500 EPS growth should be roughly 12  13  and the benchmark has returned  7  8 
If we remove the TCJA impact from 2018 S P 500 earnings  S P 500 grew 14  last year  organically  and per Factset   the average earnings growth the last two years is 8  and the benchmark s average return is still 7  8  
Unfortunately  we can play and massage these numbers all day  but the point is  looking at the last two calendar years together  it s just an  average  two years ",2019-09-15,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-earnings-fedex-this-week--a-look-into-a-major-transport-200464682,200464682

164741,386257,FDX,China Weekly Letter   New Trade Talks Put Escalation Fears In The Background,opinion,"US China trade talks are set to resume in Washington in October  While we do not see scope for a big breakthrough  it may put escalation fears in the background for now  The situation is still very fluid  though  Xi Jinping mentioned the word  struggle  60 times in a speech this week  China signals more stimulus is coming in order to keep growth within the 6 0 6 5  growth range  PMI data still signal weakness but no hard landing  USD CNY is close to 7 20 but should take a break here as the People s Bank of China signals it has gone far enough and trade war fears are abating for now  Hong Kong has withdrawn the extradition bill but it is still unclear whether this will stop the crisis  Trade talks set to resume but very hard to break the deadlock
We finally got confirmation this week that the US and China will meet for new talks in Washington  They are set to take place in early October and not September as earlier planned  However  lower level officials will prepare for the meetings in September 
While there have been few signs of the two sides moving closer to a deal  there was a lift to sentiment following the news    A slightly more upbeat tone from insiders in China partly supported the positive mood  The Chinese  Global Times state media  a more nationalistic and international version of  People s Daily   referred in an editorial to the message that both sides agreed to   jointly take concrete actions to create favourable conditions for further consultations in October    A blog on Chinese social media called Taoran Notes said on Thursday that it is  very likely  there will be  new developments  in the upcoming trade talks  Taoran Notes is a blog by the state owned Economic Daily   which is seen as a channel for communicating China s stance in the trade talks 
On a less upbeat note   Chinese media reported that US company FedEx  NYSE FDX  had illegally transported certain knives to Hong Kong  China has yet to put American companies on its  unreliable entities list  but FedEx could be in danger of being among the first  The list is a direct response to the US  Entities List   which blacklisted Huawei 
Comment  While we are sceptical about a decisive breakthrough at the October talks  the planned meetings are likely to put fears of new escalation in the background for a while  This is a supportive factor risk sentiment in the short term  One thing to look out for is whether the US carries out the tariff increase from 25  to 30  on USD250bn on 1 October  It is the 70 year anniversary day of the People s Republic of China  If China can convince the US to at least delay the increase  it would be positive for financial markets  China may also wait to put US companies on its  unreliable entities list  until after the talks in October in order not to stir things up  Our baseline is still no deal on this side of the US election in November 2020  see  US China Trade   Three trade war scenarios    no deal  now baseline   8 August 
Xi Jinping mentions  struggle  60 times in speech
Chinese President Xi Jinping this week used the word  struggle  60 times in a speech summary published by Chinese state media  According to Xinhua Xi  warned of growing complexity of risks and tests which can be unthinkably challenging  stressed the long term nature of various struggles and called for the courage to fight and the mettle to win   The Chinese word for struggle is a bit more nuanced than what it seems and refers to the art of struggle and flexibility 
Comment  It is clear China is preparing for a journey of continued challenges on its path to fulfilling the  Chinese Dream  in 2049  which entails becoming a prosperous country and with that the biggest economic power in the world  surpassing the US 
Strengthening morale  standing up to external challenges and preparing the Chinese people for struggle have become centrepieces in Chinese communications this year  This suggests the leadership is laying the ground for a tough and drawn out trade war if necessary 
China signals more stimulus
This week China sent a clearer signal of new stimulus coming  The State Council stressed the need to ensure the economy grows within  a reasonable range   which is likely to refer to the target range of GDP growth for this year of 6 0 6 5   Both broad and targeted cuts in the Reserve Requirement Ratio for banks  as well as more funds to finance projects in the  real economy   are on the table  The news follows stimulus messages from the National Development and Reform Commission of more measures coming to lift consumption  PMI data this week were on balance in line with expectations  The Caixin PMI manufacturing increased and is still at a fairly decent level but the NBS PMI manufacturing stayed close to the weak levels reached in previous months 
Comment  China continues to add stimulus drip by drip to keep growth at a minimum of 6   China s stimulus aims to underpin the structural rebalancing towards high tech investments  private consumption and services while also using selective infrastructure projects to support demand  The leadership is careful not to do all out stimulus though  as it would cause problems for the future  Data continues to signal weak growth but no hard landing  We believe further stimulus will serve to avoid a sharp slowdown 
USD CNY climbs towards 7 20 but signs of stabilisation here
After USD CNY climbed close to 7 20  the CNY has stabilised somewhat  The People s Bank of China has kept the daily fixing at a stronger level below 7 10  which sends a pretty clear signal that China wants to keep a lid on USD CNY around this level 
Comment  We expect the cross to stabilise in a 7 10 7 20 range  In the medium term  the direction depends on the trade war and how much the Fed cuts rates versus the People s Bank of China  We expect USD CNY to stay around 7 20 on a 3 6M horizon  as we expect the Fed to cut more than the People s Bank of China and do not see a material further escalation of the trade war  To contain potential capital outflows  we believe China wants to stop the depreciation for now 
Hong Kong s Carrie Lam withdraws extradition bill to stop crisis
After for a long time rejecting a withdrawal of the extradition bill that sparked the protests in Hong Kong  the bill was withdrawn this week  While this meets only one of the five demands made by protesters  it has been the most important trigger  However  it is too early to tell whether it is enough to turn the crisis  Some voices say it is  too little  too late  but  at the same time  protesters might lose support from others in Hong Kong  as there is also a concern that the long drawn out protests will do irreversible damage to the economy ",2019-09-06,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-weekly-letter--new-trade-talks-put-escalation-fears-in-the-background-200462239,200462239

164772,386288,FDX,4 Transportation Stocks To Enrich Your Portfolio In 2H19,opinion,The Zacks  sector is widely diversified in nature  including airline operators  railroads  truckers  third party logistics  3PL  companies and shippers This key sector gained 7 1  in the first half of 2019  despite adversities like increase in oil prices  up 28  in the first half   inclement weather conditions in the United States  driver shortages and other labor disputes The above mentioned headwinds  notwithstanding  there are enough catalysts  which have resulted in the sector gaining in the January June period  Let s examine them in details Impressive U S  Economy Despite the trade squabble with China and other macroeconomic concerns  the U S  economy is in good shape  This is highlighted by the fact that the three major stock indexes   the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite   grew 14 4   18 1  and 21 4   respectively  in the first half of the year With the economy in such a healthy state  it is of little surprise that the transportation sector  whose fortunes are tied to macro factors like GDP growth  industrial production  construction volumes and trade  as well as consumer demand  witnessed growth in the first half of the year despite some challenges Uptick in Passenger Revenues One of the key components of the sector is airlines  Driven by factors like affordable air fares  a much improved job market and rising disposable income  airlines are witnessing robust growth in passenger revenues  which account for the bulk of top line of most carriers Adding to the enthusiasm  the industry trade organization  Airlines for America  A4A   recently announced that a record 257 4 million passengers are anticipated to take to the skies in the ongoing summer season  Jun 1 Aug 31   up 3 4  year over year Moreover  the bullish unit revenue projections from the likes of Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   and Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    for the upcoming second quarter 2019 earnings season  support the buoyant top line picture surrounding airlines   We expect passenger revenues to be strong in the second half of the year too  The bullish picture is supported by the anticipation of robust profitability for North American carriers in 2019   15 billion for 2019 compared with  14 5 billion in 2018  Prudent Cost Management Aiding RailroadsIn order to boost profits  more and more railroad companies are adopting the precision scheduled railroading model  an operating structure that reduces costs  enhances services and leads to optimal asset utilization  With increased efficiency and reduced costs  most railroads have shown consistent improvement in operating ratio  operating expense as a percentage of revenues   and hope for even better in the near future As an evidence  Norfolk Southern   NYSE NSC   expects this key metric to improve at least 100 basis points this year compared with 65 4  achieved in 2018  The lower the value of this efficiency measure  the better it is  Moreover  stocks in the railroad space are being aided by the healthy state of the U S  economy  A strong economy is supporting the bullishness of railroad operators  with more goods being transported across the country Other participants of the transportation sector are also being aided by various factors  While the surge in online shopping is a positive for package delivery companies like FedEx   NYSE FDX    factors such as low unemployment rates and healthy consumer spending act as a tailwind for Equipment   Leasing stocks  Similarly  service providers to transporters are being aided by a thriving economy Investing in Transports Prudent NowWith the U S  economy expected to remain strong in the second half of the year as well and other tailwinds like e commerce growth  we believe the transportation sector will do well in the second half of the year  Consequently  investing in stocks from the space appears to be prudent However

the S P 500 index are expected to be down  3 3  from the year earlier period on  4 0  higher revenues  This would follow the  0 2  earnings decline on  4 5  higher revenues in Q1  Previewing Q2 Earnings SeasonNote  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  Here are the key points Earnings growth is not expected to improve in the Q2 earnings season either  with the growth challenge reflecting a combination of tough comparisons and moderating economic growth Total Q2 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  3 3  from the year earlier period on  4 0  higher revenues  This would follow the  0 2  earnings decline on  4 5  higher revenues in Q1 With earnings growth in Q1 modestly in negative territory  another earnings decline this earnings season will make it two consecutive quarters of earnings declines for the S P 500 index  Estimates for Q2 have come down  but the magnitude of negative revisions remains below the comparable periods of other recent quarters  The  3 3  decline currently expected is down from flat growth in late March Q2 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with Technology  Aerospace  Basic Materials  Construction and Conglomerates as double digit decliners The Q2 reporting cycle will  unofficially  get underway with results from the big bank  but the earnings season has actually gotten underway already  with results from 22 S P 500 members already out  All of these companies have fiscal quarters ending in May  which we count as part of the Q2 tally For the small cap S P 600 index  total Q2 earnings are expected to be  9 0  below the year earlier level on  3 4  higher revenues  This compares to  18 1  decline in Q1 earnings on  4 5  higher revenues For full year 2019  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  0 7  on  2 4  higher revenues  which would follow the  23 3  earnings growth on  9 2  higher revenues in 2018  Double digit growth is expected to resume in 2020  with earnings expected to be up  10 5  that year The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2019 P E of 18 4X and index close  as of July 9th  is  162 37  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  179 52 for 2020  P E of 16 6X   The multiples for 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year Q2 Earnings Season ExpectationsThe big banks are on track to  unofficially  kick off the Q2 earnings season in the coming days  but the reporting cycle reporting cycle has actually gotten underway already The recent quarterly releases from Pepsi   NASDAQ PEP    FedEx   NYSE FDX    Nike   NYSE NKE   and others were for these companies  fiscal quarters ending in May  which we count as part of our June quarter tally  The fact is that by the time the big banks come around to report June quarter results  we will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S P 500 members already Tough comparisons to last year when growth was boosted by the tax cut legislation were all along expected to weigh on earnings growth in 2019  Moderating U S  economic growth and notable slowdowns in other major global economic regions are having a further negative impact  Uncertainty about the global trade regime and growing resort to tariffs are not helping matters either As a result  earnings were essentially flat in the first quarter of 2019 and no significant improvement is expected in the growth trajectory in the June quarter either  In fact  this trend of flat to negative growth is expected to persist through the September quarter  with current consensus estimates looking for positive growth resuming in the last quarter of the year  But Q4 is still far from away and a lot can happen between now and then Earnings growth was essentially flat in the March quarter  actually down  0 2   and the expectation is for a  3 3  decline in the June quarter  Earnings growth is expected to be in negative territory in Q3 as well  down  1 6    with positive growth expected to resume only in last quarter of the year Driving this weak growth picture is tough comparisons due to the huge boost to profitability in the year earlier period The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards  It is in the context of these lowered expectations that the modest estimate cuts to Q2 estimates appear reassuring The key issue will be if expectations for the second half of the year and beyond hold or come down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant downward adjustments to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  That said  the

164776,386292,FDX,Is The Bar Too Low For Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Earnings growth was anemic in Q1 and not much improvement is expected in Q2 either  with total earnings for the S P 500 index expected to be negative territory  The trend of modestly negative growth is expected to continue through the September quarter as well  with positive growth returning in the last quarter of the year The chart below shows earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2019 Q2 relative to what was actually achieved in the preceding four quarters and expectations for the coming three periods 
As you can see here  earnings growth is expected to be negative for three of this year s four quarters  which would qualify as an earnings recession  But we should keep in mind that these modest declines are primarily because of the very tough comparisons to last year when growth was boosted by the tax cuts  Growth is expected to resume next year  with full year 2020 earnings growth expected to be in excess of  10  following the almost  flat  reading for 2019 
The economic outlook still remains favorable  particularly for the U S  economy  though the trade issue has become a recurring theme in the earnings releases  The big banks that dominate the Q2 results at this stage appear to be experiencing the indirect effects of the trade uncertainty  JPMorgan  JPM  and Citigroup  C   explained the tepid growth in their business lending trends by citing the effects of the trade uncertainty on corporate spending trends  We had heard something similar from FedEx  FDX  earlier when it reported its May quarter results  which we count as part of the Q2 tally 
All in all  the trade issue is expected to feature across the board this earnings season

164777,386293,FDX,Is Copper Showing Us Where The Market Is Heading ,opinion,"As I keep saying a top is forming 
Stocks are tired after weeks of promises and promotions by Fed officials and the Trump administration that something BIG is coming 
At this point there is little if any real buyers  It s only by multiple interventions per day that the market hasn t broken down 
The S P 500 is forming a textbook rising wedge formation  The Fed better deliver rate cuts in a BIG way or stocks are in serious trouble 

Fed Ex  NYSE FDX  is the private largest shipping company in the U S  As such it is a great indicator for measuring real economic activity  And the broader market usually follows where FDX leads 
Based on FDX  stocks could easily fall to 2 620 if the Fed doesn t deliver some BIG rate cuts in a few weeks 

Incidentally that s where copper  another great economic indicator  suggests stocks will move as well 

Put simply  while the majority of investors are focusing on stocks hitting new highs  REAL economic indicators are telling us there s trapdoor below the market today ",2019-07-16,Phoenix Capital Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-copper-showing-us-where-the-market-is-heading-200440377,200440377
164778,386294,FDX,3 REITs To Buy Amid Q2 Earnings Season ,opinion,"The stock market s impressive run over the last several years placed high flying growth stocks  often from the technology sector  front and center  And the 2019 comeback has been driven once again by mega cap tech giants  Nonetheless  a strong portfolio needs to be well diversified  This means time is always right to consider real estate investment trusts or REITs 
REITs are companies that own  operate  or finance real estate properties that produce income  such as apartment complexes or retail locations  These companies are heavily regulated and must meet a number of qualifications to be classified as a REIT  but they do offer investors a few distinct advantages 
First  real estate can be a very profitable investment sector when certain economic conditions are present  What s more  REITs must pay at least 90  of their taxable income in dividends to shareholders  so they are a great option for income investors looking for steady payouts 
The presence of mortgage debt makes this a rate sensitive industry  But many companies offset this through strong funds from operations  FFO  growth  or they stick out from the pack with large amounts of their debt already fixed at a low rate 
Luckily our proven Zacks Rank  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  works with REITs just as it does with any other company  We prefer to use FFO as the metric of profitability here  but the trends work the same otherwise 
The strongest REITs are going to be those with improving outlooks and great Zacks Ranks  So  let s check out the REITs that our model says are impressive options right now 
1  Alexandria Real Estate Equities  Inc    NYSE ARE

Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for Alexandria s adjusted second quarter FFO to climb 4 9  to  1 72 per share on the back of 12 4  revenue expansion  which would see it hit  365 3 million  The Pasadena  California headquarter firm has also seen its fiscal 2019 and 2020 earnings estimate revision activity trend in the right direction recently to help it earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  at the moment  ARE last paid a quarterly dividend of  1 00 a share and has raised its quarterly payout in recent years  The firm also currently boasts an impressive 4  yield 
2  Camden Property Trust   NYSE CPT  
Camden Property Trust focuses mainly on ownership  management  development  redevelopment  acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities  The Houston  Texas based company  which boasts a market cap of  10 40 billion  owns and operates roughly 160 communities that total over 54 000 apartments around the U S  from Southern  NYSE SO  California to Florida  CPT stock is up 20  over the last 12 months to blow away the S P 500 s 5  climb and currently rests right below its 52 week intraday highs of  110 42 a share 
Camden  which is set to announce its Q2 2019 earnings results on Thursday  July 25  is projected to see its revenue climb 6 5  to  252 41 million and help lift its adjusted FFO by 6 7  to  1 27  Like Alexandria  CPT is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and is trading at a forward earnings multiple that is roughly in line with its industry s average at 21 4X  The firm has paid a quarterly dividend of  0 80 in 2019  up from  0 77 in 2018 and holds a yield of 2 95  right now  Camden also sports a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system 
3  Realty Income Corporation   NYSE O  
Realty Income Corporation focuses on commercial real estate leased to tenants under long term net lease agreements  The firm boasts over 5 800 real estate properties that feature some impressive names  In fact  its four largest tenants in terms of percentage of Realty Income s revenue are Walgreens   NASDAQ WBA    7 Eleven  FedEx   NYSE FDX    and Dollar General   NYSE DG    Along with its well known commercial tenants  investors might love that the firm pays a monthly dividend  On Tuesday  the company announced that its board declared the firm s 589 straight monthly dividend  which amounts to an annualized payout of  2 72 per share  Meanwhile  Realty Income s yield sits at 3 89  at the moment 
O stock has climbed over 27  in the last year and closed regular trading Wednesday at  69 92  roughly  4 below its 52 week high  The San Diego  California headquartered company s second quarter 2019 earnings due out on August 5 are projected to pop nearly 10  to reach  360 87 million  with this strong top line growth expected to continue for the full year  At the bottom end of the income statement  Realty Income is expected to see its adjusted Q2 FFO pop 1 3  to  0 81  The company has also seen its fiscal 2019 and 2020 earnings revision activity trend almost completely upward recently to help it earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

164779,386295,FDX,Why Is FedEx  FDX  Up 10 1  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for FedEx  FDX   Shares have added about 10 1  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is FedEx due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  FedEx Beats on Earnings in Q4The company s fourth quarter fiscal 2019  ended May 31  2019  adjusted earnings  excluding  12 57 from non recurring items  of  5 01 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 81  However  the bottom line declined 15 2  year over year  This downside was primarily due to a dismal performance of the company s major revenue generating segment  FedEx Express  and higher costs at the FedEx Ground unit Quarterly revenues inched up 2 8  year over year to  17 807 million but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  17 811 9 million  The top line benefited from higher revenues at the Ground and Freight segments Operating income  on an adjusted basis  decreased 7  year over year to  1 72 billion in the reported quarter due to lower freight revenues at the FedEx Express segment  high costs and other factors  Operating margin also deteriorated to 9 6  in the fiscal fourth quarter from 10 7  a year ago The company repurchased 6 6 million shares for approximately  1 5 billion during fiscal 2019 Segmental PerformanceQuarterly revenues at FedEx Express  including TNT Express  slid 1  to  9 5 billion due to weakness in global trade and industrial production  Operating income came in at  766 million  down 12  year over year  Also  operating margin dipped to 8 1  from 9  in the year ago quarter FedEx Ground revenues increased 11  year over year to  5 32 billion in the period under consideration  Operating income came in at  810 million  nearly flat year over year while operating margin contracted to 15 2  from 16 9  in the prior year quarter FedEx Freight revenues rose 5  year over year to  1 95 billion  Segmental revenues gained from higher revenue per shipment and average daily shipments  Also  the segment s operating income ascended 15  to  194 million  Moreover  operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 9 9  in the quarter under review Full Year ResultsFor fiscal 2019  the company delivered adjusted earnings of  15 52 per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  15 34  The bottom line also improved year over year  Meanwhile  revenues of  69 7 billion marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  69 71 billion   However  the top line improved substantially year over year Bearish Fiscal 2020 OutlookPersistent weakness in global trade and industrial production is likely to hamper FedEx s fiscal 2020 results  To counter the challenges posed by sluggish revenues  the company is focusing on ways to minimize costs While the company anticipates operating income to increase at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments  the same is likely to be affected at the FedEx Express segment due to macroeconomic weakness and trade related uncertainty among other things Meanwhile  adjusted earnings are estimated to decline in mid single digits  expressed as a percentage   year over year during the current fiscal year  Effective tax rate  prior to the year end MTM retirement plan accounting adjustment  is predicted in the range of 23 25   Capital expenditures are expected to be  5 9 billion in the current fiscal year compared with  5 5 billion in fiscal 2019  The company further said that total TNT Express integration expenses are projected to be approximately  1 7 billion  including  350 million expected to be incurred in fiscal 2020  through fiscal 2021

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 16   A quarter ago  it was expected that this package delivery company would post earnings of  3 10 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 03  delivering a surprise of  2 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
FedEx  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo industry  posted revenues of  17 81 billion for the quarter ended May 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 03   This compares to year ago revenues of  17 31 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
FedEx shares have lost about 0 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17 5  
What s Next for FedEx 
While FedEx has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for FedEx was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 46 on  17 42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  16 01 on  72 14 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

Key Events
Futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 tracked global stocks lower this morning after both U S  China and U S  Iran tensions reached a new peak  Increased demand for safe havens boosted gold and the yen  while sending yields on 10 year Treasurys back to 2 00  
In Europe  losses affecting almost all sectors pushed the STOXX 600 into a third day slide 
In the earlier Asian session  regional shares reversed gains on a report Iran said new U S  sanctions would mean  the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy   spurring investor search for safety 

China s Shanghai Composite dropped 0 87  ahead of the crucial Trump Xi talks  where a lot could go wrong  Complicating the matter was a move from U S  shipping company FedEx  NYSE FDX  this morning to sue the U S  Commerce Department over export restrictions on Huawei  in the wake of criticism from Chinese officials on Monday on how the U S  shipper recently mishandled product deliveries from the Chinese telecom giant 
Technically  the Chinese benchmark slipped back below the 50 DMA  while finding support above the 100 DMA as it potentially completes a rounding bottom which is itself supported by the 200 DMA 

The Chinese yuan weakened for a third day  after the USD CNY pair found support above the 50 DMA and 200 DMA amid a golden cross  This suggests a continued weakening for the yuan  which in turn could potentially exacerbate trade talks further 
For its part  Hong Kong s Hang Seng   1 15   underperformed ahead of the much anticipated meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping  which comes at a time when U S  lawmakers have been urged to consider sanctions against Hong Kong a Special Administrative Region of the Chinese state and China ruled out discussing the thorny issue at the G20 summit 
South Korea s KOSPI contained losses to 0 22   ranking second best after Australia s S P ASX 200   0 11    The Korean benchmark may soon benefit from an interest rate  cut after the yield curve inversion between the country s long term bonds and the overnight policy rate widened to an all time high 

The stronger case for a rate cut would carry an opposite downward effect on to the won  Technically  the USD KRW is nearing a dual support of the 1 150 00 price the highs of 2018 and 2019 even as the uptrend line reached these levels  The 50 DMA is on the verge of crossing over the 200 DMA  setting up a golden cross 
Meanwhile  adding to existing trade headwinds  Bloomberg revealed U S  President Donald Trump vented frustration about the six decades old defense pact with Japan  considering it unfair to the U S 
Global Financial Affairs
Yesterday  U S  equities slid away from record highs as resurfacing fears of a slowing economy offset recent signs of monetary policy easing  The Russell 2000 underperformed   1 17    falling below the 200 DMA  either on hopes of a successful U S  China trade summit or on increased caution  whereby small caps provide a risk proxy 

Meanwhile  yields extended a drop  probably more on risk off than on the path to lower interest rates  which may have already been priced in  Technically  the 10 year yield is squeezed between a potentially completed return move toward a bearish flag which would extend the downtrend and last week s lows 
In crypto news  after four attempts Bitcoin finally managed to scale above the  11 000 level  hovering at the  11 400 levels by the European midday session 

In safe haven markets  gold continued its spree to the highest levels since 2013  after completing a massive six year long   250 deep  H S bottom  setting in motion a macro uptrend 
The yen kept strengthening  having recently also benefited from the Bank of Japan s hawkish stance relative to the global easing trend and to the Fed s dovishness  Technically  the USD JPY pair extended a slide after crossing below the long term uptrend line since June 2016 as the 50 WMA curved below the 200 WMA 

Finally  oil prices dropped for a third day as ongoing concerns over falling global demand  as well as uncertainty around an extension of supply cuts by OPEC  producers  offset the U S  Iran standoff  Technically  the price found resistance by the 200 DMA  guarding the downtrend line since April 23

164858,386374,FDX,FedEx Woes Go Deeper Than China Probe  Steer Clear Of This Falling Knife,opinion,"The plunge in FedEx  NYSE FDX  shares is accelerating  They hit a three year low yesterday on the news that China is probing the world s largest package shipment company on some  wrongful  deliveries 
According to a Wall Street Journal report yesterday  changes to FedEx s internal protocols to comply with the Trump administration s crackdown on Huawei Technologies Inc  caused the delivery giant to misroute two of the Chinese company s packages to the U S  China said over the weekend it was drawing up a list of  unreliable entities  that harm the interests of local companies  a move that could potentially put FedEx business in China at risk if the trade dispute between the world s two largest economies escalates further 
With FedEx being caught up in this trade tussle  the Street view on its stock has turned more bearish  Analyst Thomas Wadewitz at UBS cut his stock price target to  136  the lowest of the 27 analysts surveyed by FactSet  He estimates that FedEx s China related business revenue is about  4 5 billion  or 6  of total sales 
FedEx stock slumped 1 3  yesterday to close at  152 34  pushing it to the lowest level since July  2016 

The selloff comes after a four week losing streak in which the stock tumbled 18  through Friday  In comparison  shares of rival United Parcel Service Inc   NYSE UPS  dropped 13  in the same period  while the Dow Jones Transportation Average lost 11  
FedEx Is Struggling on Many Fronts
While international trade  and China s threat in particular  is the latest negative catalyst pressuring FedEx  the company is facing a multitude of other troubles too  The parcel carrier had been struggling on many fronts even before the latest setback 
The weakness in global demand  especially in Europe where FedEx was betting big after its 2016 acquisition of Netherlands based parcel delivery company TNT Express  and challenges coming from growing e commerce are among the key issues weakening its growth 
In March  FedEx reported disappointing fiscal third quarter earnings  while slashing its full year outlook for the second time in three months  The company now expects a  4 5 billion increase in sales for the fiscal year that ended in May  That would be a drastic drop from its earlier forecast of  6 billion for the year  Adjusted earnings for the fiscal year will be  15 10 to  15 90 a share  down from a previous forecast of  15 50 to  16 60 
The company s 2016 acquisition of TNT is still very much a work in progress as its has failed to unlock the value that investors were hoping to see  FedEx said in March the integration costs for the acquisition are expected to exceed  1 5 billion through fiscal 2021  with the potential of further escalation  The integration challenges and the slowing European economy have raised doubts about the benefits of the TNT deal  with some analysts questioning the wisdom behind this massive undertaking 
Bottom Line
As we had recommended in our article on FedEx in December  investors should steer clear of cyclical stocks tied to global economic growth  FedEx is a macroeconomic bellwether and  unfortunately  has got caught in the crossfires of the escalating trade war  Investors shouldn t get tempted by the stock s steep decline this year as  in our view  this bearish spell hasn t run its course  Investors should avoid catching the falling knife ",2019-06-04,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fedex-woes-are-more-deeper-than-china-200428025,200428025

Regulators in the Asian country yesterday launched an  inquiry   Although Huawei or any trade related keywords were not mentioned  there s little doubt the timing isn t accidental  Clearly  China is targeting FedEx in retaliation for the Trump administration blacklisting Huawei 
The equity market concurs  The Memphis based company s stock has fallen 4 75  since Thursday 

The stock crossed below its uptrend line since the 2009 bottom for the first time in ten years  suggesting an end to the long term uptrend  However  price found support in the December lows  In other words  even if prices would continue lower  it could occur after extreme whipsawing 
In the long run  however  risk is to the downside  After crossing the long term uptrend line for the first time  and as the 50 WMA crashed through the 100 WMA  Currently  the price is speeding toward a downward curving 200 WMA  below the previous medium term trough in mid April 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders should wait for another lower peak in the medium term  which would follow a medium term trough below December s 
Moderate traders are likely to wait for a decisive downside breakout below the  150 00 mark  followed by a return move that demonstrates obvious resistance

164883,386399,FDX,Week Ahead  Expanded Trade War  Plunging Yields Will Keep Rattling Markets,opinion,"All four main U S  indices top out in the medium term
Trump escalates trade wars  targeting Mexico as well as India
VIX has its highest close since January
It looks like the first full monthly equity decline of the year  which occurred in May  could extend as June trading begins  U S  major indices the S P 500  Dow Jones  NASDAQ Composite and Russell 2000 all plummeted on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened Mexico with incremental tariffs as he opened yet another potential front in his trade war  He also stripped India of its special trade status designation which had exempted the Asian nation from billions of dollars in U S  tariffs on about 2 000 products 
Treasury yields slumped for a fourth straight day  to the lowest levels since September 2017  sealing a fourth consecutive weekly decline of 6 57  
In addition  it appears that China has stepped up its retaliation for the U S  s blacklisting of Huawei  when the Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday that China was opening an investigation into whether FedEx  NYSE FDX   had damaged the legal rights and interests of its clients  after Huawei claimed the U S  based global delivery service diverted its parcels 
Worst Declines Since Christmas Eve Rout
Last Friday s U S  stock market s weekly decline was the worst since the December 2018 Christmas Eve rout  From a technical perspective  all four major indices extended downside breakouts off tops  and each entered downtrends in the medium term  If equities fall below the December bottom  it would likely end the long term uptrend that s been in place since the 2009 bottom 

The S P 500 fell 1 32  on Friday  with all sectors but Real Estate   0 83   and Utilities   0 47   in the red  Technology   1 67   and Communication Services   1 55   led the declines 
Half of the past week s 2 62  declines occurred on Friday  for the week  every single sector participated in the losses  Energy   4 63   underperformed  tracking oil s worst week of the year  Technically  the price extended the penetration of a H S neckline as it registered the second trough to complete a descending series of peaks and troughs to just shy of two percent  falling through a second gap  as it slipped below the 100 and 200 DMA  as if they weren t there at all  The RSI fell to 30 84  the lowest since the slump in December 
On the weekly chart  the price extended a broadening pattern since January 2018  as it slumped through the 50 WMA  The index has posted higher highs and registered lower lows  since the start of 2018  forming a top  The weekly MACD s shorter MA fell through the longer MA  producing a sell signal  As well  the RSI topped out  providing a second negative divergence  as it posted its third lower trough  challenging the three rising peaks of January 2018  September 2018 and April 2019 
The Dow dropped 1 41  on Friday  extending its weekly loss to 3 01   The mega cap index also suffered two falling gaps  in which it completed a H S top  after having fallen below the 100 and the 200 DMAs  as the 100 DMA crossed below the 200 DMA 
On the weekly chart  the Dow resumed a massive H S formation  also in play since January 2018  as the price sliced through the 50 WMA  The MACD and the RSI provided similar patterns to those for the SPX  The Dow has tumbled for five straight weeks  longer than any of the other major U S  indices  Ironically  however  it outperformed  selling off  just  6 4  
The NASDAQ Composite underperformed on Friday  shedding 1 51  of value  bringing the weekly loss for the tech heavy index to 2 41   Like the S P 500 and the Dow  the NASDAQ fell through the 100 and 200 DMAs  though without gaps  as it completed a H S reversal  with all the same patterns and triggers on the weekly chart  as seen on the SPX  The NASDAQ fell for the fourth consecutive week  down 8 52 
On a daily basis  the Russell 2000   1 29   outperformed on Friday  but only slightly  It continued to defy the trade narrative in which we d expect domestically focused small caps would have a decisive advantage  The small cap benchmark underperformed during the 4 week selloff  losing 9 2  of value 

The yield on the U S  10 year Treasury note fell to 2 133  its biggest weekly descent since 2014  as traders fully priced in two rate cuts for the year amid angst over the threat of a recession  The rate fell to the lowest point since Sep  10  2017  just 10 basis points away from the Nov  8  2016 low  when the Donald Trump surprised by winning the U S  election  Technically  the yield extended last week s fall  closing below its 200 WMA 

Trader bets on further volatility increased  driving the VIX to its highest weekly close since January  Both the MACD and RSI are projecting additional uncertainty 
Trade Tiffs Escalate
President Trump s latest trade salvo  aimed at Mexico  calls for 5  duties to be levied by that country s imports beginning June 10  If Mexico doesn t stop  illegal migrants   the tariffs would rise incrementally to 25  in October  As Trump ratchets up his all out trade war against the world  China published an official document laying the blame for global trade problems squarely on Trump  after the administration blamed China for back pedaling out of negotiated agreements 
Perhaps the U S  president feels it s now or never to reverse what he views as the U S  s position of getting the short end of the trade stick and deliver big on his campaign promises  The U S  economy is currently healthy enough  as spending and income beat expectations and the Fed s preferred measure  core PCE which calculates spending minus volatile food and energy costs climbed 0 2  from the prior month and 1 6  from a year earlier following a downward 1 5  revision in March 
From a market perspective  it s certainly in Trump s interest to get a bear market out of the way  so that come the 2020 election  equities will already have bottomed and as the U S  heads to the polls will be on the rise  Since 1928 there have been 23 elections  In almost all cases  in the three month period beforehand  when the market was going up the incumbent or his party won 

The U S  dollar also fell on Friday  losing 0 41   It penetrated the upper boundary of both the large ascending triangle since November  as well as the small ascending triangle since April  found support and closed back above the large triangle and on the bottom of the small triangle  That makes the current position an ideal long entry from a risk reward perspective 

Oil plunged on Friday  dropping 5 46  as countries fell into line behind the U S  demand to stop buying Iranian oil  Japan s Iran imports dropped 42  MoM to 169 100 barrels per day in April  The escalating trade wars and implications for slowing growth further tamped down demand  Technically  the oil market extended its reversal into a downtrend in the medium term

164884,386400,FDX,Escalating Trade Feuds Keep Markets On Edge,opinion,"A new month  possibly another chance for world leaders to hit the reset button on trade talks after US stocks endured the worst May performance since 2010  The US China trade war saw constructive talks in early May quickly disappear after both sides could not agree on what was expected to be the final touches for a historic trade deal 

Over the weekend  China released a government policy paper on trade issues with the US  The white paper suggested a willingness to return to negotiations  however  it was also highly critical of the Trump administration s tactics  blaming them for the talks falling apart  China is trying to get the negotiations back on track  but they will not make the first move  They are methodically announcing their retaliatory measures and that will be what markets pay close attention to early this week  Most recently  China opened a probe against FedEx  NYSE FDX  for wrongful deliveries of items  possibly targeting packages that were supposed to arrive at Huawei 

Last week  the Treasury market rally got out of control as growth concerns raised the recessionary worries  The straw that broke back of global yields was the tariff announcement on Mexico  The southern neighbour to the US also quickly announced their retaliatory measures  in what seems to be the never ending game of tariff tag 

The Trump administration also announced on Friday that the US will end their special trade treatment for India  eliminating their designation as a developing nation  Approximately  2 000 Indian products will lose their duty free status on 5 June  The trade relationship with India has been becoming tense  especially after the US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum  India is expected to retaliate further on US farm goods 
JPY
Markets remain focused on trade updates and until we see any meaningful progress  safe havens will be bought on any dips  China is blaming the US for the breakdown in negotiations  and while they are open to resuming talks  it will be difficult to see the US move from their hard stance 

Global Recession
With last week s tariff escalation game of tag spreading across the globe  analysts are growing more concerned we could see a global recession by the middle of next year if the US impose additional tariffs on China and Mexico  In what was supposed to be a period of calm  with world leaders putting the final touches to both the US Sino deal and the USMCA  and while talks would begin to outline deals between the US and Europe  we have seen tariff escalation globally that looks to threaten the prospects of any deals being done anytime soon  The threats to global growth seem to be here to stay as markets appear convinced the new normal will be constant trade negotiations around d the world  Instead of focusing on one trade deal at a time  the US has overplayed its dominant hand and appears vulnerable to only finalising temporary solutions  The Chinese have put the ball in US hands and need to offer an olive branch before things get even uglier 
Oil
The month of May was a disaster for crude prices   the worst May performance in seven years   as the escalation of the global trade war saw the global growth outlook crumble  Oil prices have now given up the lion s share of the effects of the OPEC  production cuts  Geopolitical risks remain in place but right now demand growth is in free fall and oil remains vulnerable  The US China feud remains most critical to the global growth outlook  but the addition of trade tensions between the US and Mexico raised the slower demand picture for the Americas  WTI s selloff is now around 20  lower from the 23 April high of USD66 60  With rising expectations that OPEC will be less effective in signalling continued production cuts going forward  crude will need to rely on some positive outcomes on the trade front for prices to begin stabilising 

While expectations are low for Russia to agree on an extension of production cuts with OPEC and allies  they delivered a full month of compliance  but that was mainly due to the impact of halted shipments caused by the contamination of the Druzhba pipeline  Russia is still trying to reach an agreement with Poland regarding Druzhba supplies on Monday  which should help normalise their numbers in June 

Gold
Gold finally behaved like a safe haven last week  breaking out higher after the trade war escalation led to a code red for global growth  A devastating month for equities   the worst one since December   and other risk assets saw a global bond rally lead the way for safe haven assets  The yellow metal is once again becoming an attractive safe haven as markets anticipate the fallout caused by recent escalations with Mexico and India

164885,386401,FDX,Market Woes Continue On Trade War Escalation,opinion,"Market movers today 
A busy week already kicked off this morning with the important Chinese Caixin PMI manufacturing  It was surprisingly unchanged in May at 50 2  and with two decimals it even increased from 50 16 to 50 24  see more below   Today we also get PMI manufacturing from the US  UK  Sweden and Norway as well as US ISM manufacturing 
Later this week  we have the Euro area inflation  GDP breakdown and the important ECB meeting  on Thursday   In the US  attention will be drawn to Powell s speech on Wednesday at the  Fed listens  events and the labour market report on Friday
On top of the important data and central bank events this week  the markets have to digest the recent escalation from US president Trump against Mexico China and the general risk off sentiment
Selected market news 
Financial markets continued in risk off mode overnight  where Asian equity markets and the US S P futures declined further  US bond yields also continued lower and markets are now pricing about 50bp of rate cuts from the Fed by the end of the year  We have also changed our forecast and now look for a rate cut in July or September  see  FOMC Comment   Dovish policy signal to pave the way for an insurance cut   31 May 2019
The US China trade war continues to escalate as China took the first steps on Friday to retaliate against the US export ban on Huawei  China announced it would  create an  unreliable entities list   of foreign companies  organisations and individuals that it deems  unreliable  in terms of harming Chinese companies  During the weekend  FedEx  NYSE FDX  was  put under investigation but it was not stated that the move was related to the new list  On Sunday  China issued a  White Paper on the trade war blaming the US for the escalation and repeating that China did not want a trade war but was also not afraid of fighting one  The next key event to look out for in the trade war is the meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 meeting in late June
As if the US China trade war wasn t enough  Trump is also launching  tariffs on Mexico and he also  withdrew India s preferential trade status   leading to tariff increases  Trump s tariff actions have raised fears that he may also lift tariffs on European autos later this year
The small rise in Caixin PMI manufacturing overnight was surprising   as the official PMI manufacturing on Friday dropped sharply from 50 1 to 49 4  The truth may be somewhere in the middle  but metal markets also point to a set back in activity in May after the sudden escalation of the trade war on 5 May  We expect Chinese activity to be under continued pressure until the trade war is resolved or at least is not escalating further  Our baseline scenario is still that we get a trade deal in H2 when the pain on both sides gets too high  But uncertainty around the timing of a trade deal is clearly elevated
Scandi markets
Sweden manufacturing PMI dropped to 50 9 in April  Given worrying signs abroad and not least among European peers  it shouldn t be surprising if the PMI sank below 50 in May  The PMI data is due out at 08 30 CEST  One hour later we get retail sales for April  a first indication of how consumers fared in Q2   note they were among the weak spots in last week s GDP data for the first quarter and we expect this will continue 
Fixed income markets The global fixed income rally continued on Friday as the market digested the new tariffs on Mexico  Markets are now pricing about 50bp of rate cuts from the Fed by year end  as US 2Y yields dropped below 2  for the first time since early 2018  We have changed our Fed view and now expect the Fed to open up the possibility for rate cuts at the June meeting  The trade war escalation continued over the weekend after China released a White Paper saying that  unreasonable US demands  led to the collapse of the trade talks and as China was accused of targeting FedEx as a retaliation manoeuvre  That combined with the news that the leader of Merkel s collation partner  Andrea Nahles  has stepped down as SPD leader points to more support for Bunds today 
But this week all attention will be on the ECB on Thursday  The pressure is growing on the ECB to deliver a forceful message in light of the rapid deceleration of global growth  However  the market might be disappointed   at least temporarily  For more  see our preview here 
We also published our Government Bonds Weekly  We argue that despite the growing global growth concerns and risk off sentiment  EGB investors will continue to focus on the  hunt for carry  theme instead of the  credit weakening  theme in a situation where core but also semi core yields trade deeper and deeper into negative territory  Hence  we keep our long periphery semi core  ex  Italy  view  We are still long 10Y Spain vs France 
FX markets Risk currencies such as the commodity currencies and the Scandies remain fragile entering a week where the ECB risks disappointing if Draghi and co do not forcefully acknowledge a deteriorating outlook  see ECB Research  Walking a tightrope  The continued escalation in trade woes late last week is adding to recent disinflationary factors   and a too strong USD and too tight US monetary policy is a key driver of this globally  As we have argued recently  we need to see Fed blink and acknowledge the dovish market pricing for this trend to reverse  Today  the market may sell USD on a weak ISM manufacturing print in expectation that it will trigger a dovish shift from the Fed   and in fact it may eventually  as we now expect an insurance cut in H2 and some comfort in soft rhetoric at the mid June meeting  see FOMC comment   Dovish policy signal to pave the way for an upcoming insurance cut  This week  the Fed conference on monetary policy strategy  tools and communication may provide some hints  Powell is speaking here on Tuesday 
Meanwhile  the GBP sold off markedly against the euro intraday on Friday but reversed in the late hours  We think this suggests that  on the margin  markets are weighing the possibility of the BoE easing  in light of emerging global tail risks  against repricing the euro area credit risk and are finding both equally offsetting  We continue to expect a relatively stable EUR GBP  and notice volatility has started to drift down in the pound  albeit only marginally  Further  USD JPY appreciated strongly in the past week  with three factors supporting   1  the sharp fall in US interest rates   2  positive terms of trade shock from falling oil and  3   safe haven  flows  We have been targeting 108 short term but expect to see continued downward pressure on the cross if central banks remain on the sidelines of the risk sell off 
Finally for the SEK  last week was characterised by  1  mostly weak Swedish data   2  rising global growth concerns   3  risk off trading and  4  thin markets due to holidays  Under normal circumstances this would be a perfect cocktail for selling the SEK  but this time was different as the Swedish krona had one of its best weeks this year  It remains to be seen how much steam is left in this tentative turn in sentiment  the PMI and retail sales data  see Scandi section  will be a first test ",2019-06-03,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-woes-continue-on-trade-war-escalation-200427646,200427646
164886,386402,FDX,U S  Penchant For Tariffs Keeps Investors On Edge,opinion,"Overview  
The weekend failed to break the grip of investor worries that drive stocks and yields lower  The US Administration s penchant for tariffs is not simply aimed at China  where there is some sympathy  but the move against Mexico  dropping special privileges for India  and apparently  considered tariffs on Australia  At the same time  the threat of 25  tariff on auto imports 
Meanwhile  the recent data  including today s PMI readings  show a world economy struggling even before the escalation  Equities have continued to surrender gains seen in the January to April period  The Nikkei gapped lower to levels not seen mid January  Taiwan  India  and South Korean markets advanced  Foreign investors bought South Korean shares for the second consecutive session  Previously there were two other sessions since the end of the tariff truce between the US and China that foreigners bought Korean shares  Europe s Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is around 0 7  lower in the morning to return to levels seen in mid February  US shares are trading lower in Europe  and the S P 500 is set to gap lower again  and our 2700 2720 target is coming into view 
Bond yields in Asia Pacific rose  but European yields on falling  led by a six basis point decline in Italy  but it not doing much for Italian banks shares  which are holding just above the year s low set before the weekend  The US 10 Year yield is off four basis points to2 08   The dollar is sporting a slightly heavier profile against most of the major currencies  led by the Swiss franc and the New Zealand dollar  Among emerging markets  the greenback is mixed  Asian currencies are mostly firmer  The Turkish lira is off 0 5  and is set to end a seven day advance  The Mexican peso is softer but above the pre weekend low  The Chinese yuan slipped less than 0 1  for the second consecutive session

Investors continue to anticipate more retaliation by China  Its investigation into FedEx  NYSE FDX  for mis delivering two packages to Huawei seems like low hanging fruit but typical of China s modus operandi  Many participants continue to hold on to hope that a meeting between Trump and Xi at the end of June on the sidelines of the G20 meeting could do repeat what happened in December and re start negotiations  However  our sense that this is unlikely to happen continues to be underpinned by the fact that there has been no date set to resume negotiations and the escalation of rhetoric 
Over the weekend  South Korea reported an unexpectedly large drop in exports  The 9 4  decline compares with a median estimate in a Reuters survey for a 5 6  decline after a 2 0  decline in April  It is the sixth consecutive contraction  It illustrates the ongoing challenge for the region  It is partly the slowdown in China  where exports fell by a fifth year over year  and something industry specific with memory chips and semiconductors  South Korea s memory chip exports fell by a little more than 30  year over year  The May PMI manufacturing PMI eased to 48 4 from 50 2  The central bank shaved its growth forecast last week  2 5  vs  2 6    but a deeper cut is likely next month  The split decision to keep rates will also be re evaluated  and a rate cut in Q3 looks likely 
Other manufacturing PMI readings in Asia were mixed  Japan s May manufacturing PMI stands at 49 8  which is better than the 49 6 flash reading  but it is still off from moving back into expansion territory in April at 50 2  Taiwan s improved to 48 4 from 48 2 but has not been above 50 since last September  Malaysia s manufacturing PMI slipped to 48 4 from 49 4  though separately the government reported an unexpected increase in exports in April  the first increase since January  Australia s AiG manufacturing PMI eased to 52 7 from 54 8  China s Caixin manufacturing PMI was unchanged at 50 2  whereas official one had fallen to 49 4 from 50 1 
The dollar initially saw its recent losses extended against the yen  but buyers appeared ahead of JPY108  There are nearly a billion dollars in options struck between JPY108 00 and JPY108 15 that expire today and a  1 2 bln option at JPY108 50 that will also be cut  The Australian dollar is edging higher after closing above the 20 day moving average before the weekend for the first time since April 22  The Reserve Bank of Australia is widely expected to cut the cash rate tomorrow  but the market is pricing a very aggressive easing trajectory  and some shorts are content to lock in profits  especially given the fact that the downside momentum stalled  There is an A 500 mln option that expires today  struck at  0 6955 that is very much in play 
Europe
The eurozone manufacturing PMI was unchanged from the 47 7 flash reading  which was down slightly from the 47 9 reading in April and a little above the 47 5 low in March  The ECB  which meets later this week  cannot be pleased  German and French readings were unchanged from the flash  Italy had an upside surprise and Spain surprised on the downside  Italy s manufacturing PMI edged up to 49 7 from 49 1 in April and the lowly 47 4 reading in March  Spain s PMI fell to 50 1 from 51 8  It had bottomed in February just below 50  Separately  the UK manufacturing PMI slumped to 49 4 from 53 1  It was much weaker than expected and has not seen this level since immediately following the June 2016 referendum 
Added to the poor PMI showing  the ECB will likely receive confirmation that price pressured eased in May  The headline rate is expected to pull back from 1 7  in April to something closer to 1 3   if not a little lower  and the core rate may slip to 0 9  from 1 3   Recall the core rate bottomed in the euro area at 0 6  in 2015  The ECB s updated forecasts and details about the TLTRO  generous   are the main focus at this week s meeting 
Separately  European politics are emerging as another issue for investors  The head of the SPD in Germany resigned  There is some talk that the wing of the party that wants to leave the coalition is moving into ascendency  but given the recent electoral results  including the EU Parliament elections  the SPD would likely see substantial losses  Meanwhile  Merkel is said to be reconsidering AKK as her successor in the CDU  Italy s Prime Minister Conte is threatening that if the dueling deputy Prime Ministers cannot resolve their infighting  he will resign  Many thought it possible that League leader Salvini would engineer a political crisis to force an early election  which may be his best chance to become Prime Minister of a center right government  Lastly  we note that a Finnish coalition government appears to have been forged and this will allow it to nominate a successor to Draghi  which is thought to be a compromise candidate between the French and German contenders 
The euro rose to  1 1190 in Asia and has not managed to see it again in the European morning  Initial support is seen in the  1 1150  1 1160 area  The  1 1100 continues to be supported by optionality  There is a billion euro option there that expires today and a 1 7 bln euro option that will be cut tomorrow  With a dovish ECB expected  it is challenging to envision strong gains now  Sterling managed to extend its pre weekend recovery but stalled near  1 2660  Resistance is cited in the  1 2680  1 2700 band 
America
The surprise action against Mexico has angered some Republican Senators on both substantive grounds  hurts US companies exporting from Mexico to the US  taxes American consumers  and makes it more difficult to approve NAFTA 2 0  and procedural grounds  invoking emergency powers in a way that had not been used before and mixing trade and migration issues   It is too early to know whether the frustration is enough to begin official efforts to claw back authority that had been deferred to the executive on trade issues  Mexican and US officials will meet over the next few days and Mexican President AMLO has suggested he is prepared to make some concessions  The 5  tariff is supposed to be effective at the start of next week  It is not clear that Mexican concessions will be enough  The Trump Administration may want to see results first  But even if they are not put into place  the mere threat may be enough to give investors and companies a pause and rethink their strategies 
The US reports both the PMI and ISM manufacturing data  They look mixed  Construction spending is expected to recover after falling 0 9  in March  The wild card maybe auto sales  The median from the Bloomberg survey calls for a recovery to 16 9 mln units  seasonally adjusted annual pace  from 16 4 mln  Disappointment would have knock on effects on retail sales forecasts  but also possibly manufacturing output and inventories  Canada reports its May manufacturing PMI  It has fallen without interruption since last December and broke the 50 boom bust level in April  49 7   Mexico s manufacturing PMI was at 50 1 in April  and the May data will also be reported today 
The US dollar is straddling the CAD1 35 area now as investors await from the local market to open  There is a  700 mln option struck at CAD1 35 that expires today  Support is seen near CAD1 3480  and a break of that would help improve the Canadian dollar s technical tone  The Mexican peso is trading sideways in a tight range  Dollar support is seen near MXN19 50  previous resistance  Some of the strength in the Brazilian real seen at the end of last week may have partly reflected the unwinding of long peso short real position that had been built ",2019-06-03,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-penchant-for-tariffs-keeps-investors-on-edge-200427674,200427674
164887,386403,FDX,Opening Bell  Global Trade Wars Push Stocks To Multi Year Setback  Gold Up,opinion,"U S  futures  Europe follow Asia lower as recession warnings multiply
Yields resume drop toward 2 00
Gold strengthens on safe haven rotation
Key Events
European stocks and futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 extended a selloff this morning as a global trade war intensified in the aftermath of U S  threats  last week  to impose progressive tariffs on Mexican goods starting from June 10  China released a report over the weekend hitting back at the U S  s  unilateralism  and recent breaches in trade talks  prompting investors to return to safe haven assets such as Treasurys  the yen and gold 
The STOXX 600 doubled Friday s selloff in the first half hour of the open  with oil producers and miners leading losses  and resumed to slide into the second half hour of the session  Disappointing Eurozone manufacturing PMI added to downbeat data from Japan to re awakened the specter of a global recession as a side effect of ongoing trade tensions  From a technical perspective  the pan European index completed a Head and Shoulders pattern on Friday  mirroring indices in the U S  and Japan  Today  the price broke through the 200 DMA  the most observed indicator even for fundamental investors 
In the earlier Asian session  all regional benchmarks closed lower except for South Korea s KOSPI  which jumped 1 28  after Samsung s  KS 005930  Chairman Lee Jae yong reportedly pressed the firm s top executives to refocus resources on the core business  as demand for computer chips and smartphones fell amid the U S  Sino trade war 
Australia s S P ASX 200 underperformed   1 19    China s Shanghai Composite dropped 0 30  after the Caixin factory Purchasing Manager s Index showed a deteriorating manufacturing outlook  even as it slightly beat the 50 0 expectations  matching last month s 50 2  coming to a standstill rather than to an outright slide 
Global Financial Affairs
On Friday  U S  equities doubled weekly losses  capping the worst May performance since 2010 and the second worst May results since the 1960s  as the S P 500 erased  4 trillion 

The S P 500   1 32   reversed course in the medium term  weeks to months   from the uptrend since Christmas to a downtrend  after completing a H S pattern  which shows how the market went from being demand led to conditions where supply takes over  Also  after the H S reversal  the price fell below the key 200 DMA 
And prices don t seem to be looking up any time soon  After stepping up his bid to curtail immigration from Mexico through higher trade tariffs  Trump also opened a new tariffs front targeting India  Thanks to its status as a developing country  the Asian country had so far been exempted from heavier duties 
If all that wasn t enough  on Sunday China threatened to target FedEx  NYSE FDX  in retaliation to the U S  ban on Chinese telecom giant Huawei 
In response to heightened global trade pressure  analysts from investment banks including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley see stocks continuing their downward journey fall 
Bottom Line  The odds that shares will continue to trade in the downtrend over the next few weeks to months till they reach the December levels  below 2 500 00 are much more likely than they would go up 

Meanwhile  the rising outlook for a recession  specifically for falling interest rates  have pushed yields on 10 year Treasurys to the lowest level since September 8 2017  which is the last support defending them from a drop to the lowest since 2016 before the Trump presidential win pushed yields to their highest level since 2011  Indeed the September 8 2017 s trading developed a bullish hammer  guarding the 2 00 psychological level  We expect volatility at these levels  as opposing market narratives collide 

The yen continued to strengthen on its safe haven status though it was seen mildly lower in the late European morning session as plunging yields attract less foreign demand for U S  Treasurys  pushing the dollar lower 
Gold is back in business against a weakening dollar and a drive to safety  blowing out a H S top and establishing a short term uptrend 

In the early session  oil resumed to slide  flirting with the  53 00 level  Recession risks painted a gloomy outlook for demand  outweighing supply disruptions expected from Iranian sanctions as well as threats from the Middle Eastern oil producer and thereby extending a downtrend  The RSI hit 20 00  the lowest level since November  However  WTI stood safely in green territory by late European morning

164888,386404,FDX,Oil Market Could Collapse Further,opinion,"In May  Brent lost over 10  and is now down nearly 20  from peaks  registered in late April  On Monday  prices extended the drop  touched  60 75 for the first time since February  and clings to the  61 handle 
Risk aversion continues to dominate in the global markets  including oil  Further escalation in the US China trade tensions and Trump s aggressive stance toward Mexico make investors worry about the global economy and price in a possible recession as the situation in the global trade continues to deteriorate 
In particular  there are now reports that Chinese regulators have launched an investigation into the US delivery company FedEx  NYSE FDX  after receiving complaints from users  Besides  over the weekend  China issued a report that blamed the conflict on the Trump administration  Meanwhile  Trump threatened to impose 5  tariffs on all imports from Mexico in response to migrant surge

164889,386405,FDX,Bond Rally Resumes  Trade Talks Remain In Gridlock,opinion,"US stocks are poised to open lower after China methodically announces fresh retaliatory tariff threats  Over the weekend  China released a government policy paper that suggested a willingness to return to negotiations  while being highly critical of the Trump administration s tactics with tariffs and blaming them for talks falling apart  China also issued a warning to students of the risks of receiving US education  China plays a prominent role in education in sheer numbers and top talent  China also opened a probe against FedEx  NYSE FDX  for wrongful deliveries of items  possibly targeting packages that were supposed to arrive at Huawei  It seems China is tightening the screws on their retaliatory measures  expecting the US will cave in offering concessions and removal of additional tariffs if we see further damage to the US economy and stock market 
Last week  markets were surprised by President Trump s surprise announcement that the US will unleash tariffs on their southern neighbor  Mexico sent a delegation to the US to review immigration issues  this followed their immediate retaliatory tariff threat  Mexico Foreign Minister noted the Mexican government is following its laws on immigration  while their ambassador to the US added because of Mexico 250 000 migrants did not arrive to the US  Mexico remains committed to working with the US but are threatening the migrant situation would be much worse without their help  The US should be able to resolve the spat with Mexico  but that will likely not provide much relief to markets since China remains the key roadblock for global growth 
USD
American growth is not invulnerable to this trade war and we are starting to see dollar weakness here  The Federal Reserve is also highly expected to deliver rate cuts as Treasury yields continue to slide  The dollar is lower across its all of its major trading partners except for the British pound  The dollar index reached a fresh 2019 at the end of last week  but it seems we are in the midst of a pullback  All eyes will be on the US Manufacturing data this morning 

GBP
The  British pound was softer after the May manufacturing reading delivered its first contraction in 34 months  New orders also dropped sharply  but this followed heavy stockpiling ahead of the March 29th date that Britain was initially expected to leave the EU 
President Trump is in London for a three day visit  and while nothing of substance is expected out of his visit  it will make for entertaining optics if he meets with Boris Johnson or Nigel Farage 

Oil
Crude prices got pummeled last month  the worst May performance in seven years  as trade war escalation dealt a strong blow to global growth and safe haven demand saw Treasuries soar  driving the dollar higher  Oil prices are rallying today on mainly a slightly softer dollar and on Saudi energy minister Al Falih assured markets that OPEC   will continue to stabilize the market beyond June and that the recent selloff was unwarranted  West Texas Intermediate crude is higher by 2  and Brent crude is 1 3  higher in early trade 

Gold
Gold is breaking out higher as downbeat expectations for global growth have investors searching for safe havens  The yellow metal underperformed last month against other safe haven trades and the climb above  1 3000 an ounce is attracting many technical traders  If trade tensions continue to heighten globally and we do not see an immediate reason suddenly be optimistic on the trade front  bullion could look to attempt to reach the 2019 high of  1 349 80 an ounce

164891,386407,FDX,Special Report  Reuters buys human remains  and learns a donor s tragic story,news,"By Brian Grow and John Shiffman TOWNSEND  Tennessee  Reuters    Cody Saunders was born in 1992 with failing kidneys and a hole in his heart   When he died on his 24th birthday  he had endured 66 surgeries and more than 1 700 rounds of dialysis  his parents said  Some days  he hid the pain in upbeat selfies on Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Other days  he shared an excruciating reality  posing in a hospital bed with bandages strapped across his scarred chest   On his Facebook profile  Cody wrote that he was looking for a girlfriend who will accept  me for me    Y am I ugly   he posted on Christmas Day 2015   Cody lived with his parents in an aged motorhome at an East Tennessee campground  When he was well enough  he worked on a farm with his father  feeding cattle  putting up hay  hauling molasses in a dump truck from one barn to another  On August 2  2016  Cody died after a heart attack on his way home from dialysis  Too poor to bury or cremate him  Cody s parents donated their son s body to an organization called Restore Life USA  The facility sells donated bodies   in whole or by part   to researchers  universities  medical training facilities and others    I couldn t afford nothin  else   father Richard explained   The month after Cody died  Restore Life sold part of the young man s body  his cervical spine  The transaction required just a few email exchanges and  300  plus shipping   Whether Restore Life vetted the buyer is unclear  But if workers there had verified their customer s identity  they would have learned he was a reporter from Reuters  The news agency was seeking to determine how easy it might be to buy human body parts and whether those parts would be useful for medical research  In addition to the spine  Reuters later purchased two human heads from Restore Life  each priced at  300  The transactions demonstrate the startling ease with which human body parts may be bought and sold in the United States  Neither the sales nor the shipments violated any laws  say lawyers  professors and government officials who follow the issue closely  Although it s illegal to sell organs used for transplants  it s perfectly legal in most states to sell body parts that were donated for research or education  Buying wine over the Internet is arguably more tightly controlled  generally requiring at minimum proof of age  To comply with legal  ethical and safety considerations before the purchases  Reuters consulted with Angela McArthur  who directs the body donation program at the University of Minnesota Medical School  She took immediate custody of the spine and heads for Reuters  inspecting and storing them at the medical school   McArthur said she was troubled by how easily the body parts were acquired and by the failure of Restore Life to perform proper due diligence   It s like the Wild West   McArthur said   Anybody could have ordered these specimens and had them delivered to their home for whatever purpose they want   McArthur examined the remains and the documentation included with them to determine how useful the parts would be for medical research  Her review was based on national safety and ethics standards she helped draft for the American Association of Tissue Banks  the American Association of Clinical Anatomists and the University of Minnesota   She concluded that the medical history Restore Life provided was insufficient  and that the accompanying paperwork was sloppy and inadequate  For those reasons  the specimens did not meet standards for use at her university  she said   I haven t seen anything this egregious before   McArthur said   I worry about the future of body donation and public trust in body donation when we have situations like this    RESPECT AND DIGNITY  Contacted several months after the sales  Restore Life President James Byrd briefly explained his approach to business    Organizations like ours are what I consider accountable because  especially us  we have direct contact with the donor family   he said   And there s a certain level of respect and dignity that is involved there because we have that personal relationship with them   Byrd subsequently declined to be interviewed or answer written questions  But he emailed a statement in which he criticized Reuters for making the purchases   It s obvious your team at Thomson Reuters has no concern for those that seek help from our organization   he wrote   You only wish to hurt those that need help the most   Byrd added that Restore Life does good work by supplying body parts to researchers working to cure cancer  dementia and other diseases    We help countless people through a wide range of research working with world renowned researchers   he wrote   Whatever good Restore Life hoped to achieve by supplying these body parts  McArthur said  its poor handling of the remains  miserably failed  to serve researchers and the three donors  Cody Saunders and the unidentified man and woman whose heads Byrd sold to Reuters   McArthur said the relatives of donors  whose intentions are noble during a difficult time  deserve better from the industry   People think they are doing the right thing  and they want to fulfill their loved ones  wishes   said McArthur  who formerly chaired Minnesota s body donation commission and serves on the leadership council of the American Association of Clinical Anatomists   I know they would feel exploited to know that something like this happened   Thomas Champney  an anatomy professor at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine  also expressed alarm at the ease of the sales   Human body parts should not be bought and sold in the same manner as used refrigerators   he said  THE BROKER Byrd  50  has been in the body parts business for two decades  An East Tennessee native  the body broker recently was runner up in a stand up comedy contest called The Funniest Person in the Tri Cities  the region surrounding Kingsport  Johnson City and Bristol   Before opening Restore Life  Byrd directed a nonprofit tissue bank called American Donor Services  then located near Memphis  For several years  one of American Donor s chief orthopedic customers was a Texas firm affiliated with a company that distributed bone grafts made in part from human tissue  In 2005  according to sworn testimony in a civil lawsuit  American Donor shifted to a new chief orthopedic customer  The new buyer paid as much as  10 000 per donor  provided a  200 000 line of credit and began managing American Donor s financial affairs   Byrd left American Donor Services a short while later  worked briefly for a vascular tissue bank  and then founded Restore Life in 2008  Based in Elizabethton  Tennessee  Restore Life obtains bodies mostly from people in Tennessee  Virginia and North Carolina  In return for body donations  Restore Life offers to pick up the deceased  cremate the unused remains for free and return them to the family  In 2011  Byrd spoke publicly about Restore Life in a presentation to the commissioners in nearby Sullivan County  Officials there had grown frustrated by the increasing cost to taxpayers of cremating the indigent  According to a recording of that meeting  Byrd explained that he could help the county  He also noted that many families who donated to Restore Life did so for financial reasons  All expenses were covered  including cremation   We have become more a service for those indigent and pauper cases that can t afford a funeral   Byrd told the commissioners   It s a perfect fit for situations where families don t have the funding or sometimes where it s left to the county for funding   Restore Life s informal arrangement with Sullivan County to take indigent bodies continues today  county officials said  A few times a month  they said  the medical examiner or other officials refer pauper cases to Byrd for possible donation  At the 2011 meeting  County Attorney Dan Street said a formal arrangement with Byrd was unnecessary because officials were merely referring the indigent to him  without any endorsement implied   This company is simply going to come and take these bodies   Street told commissioners   We re simply getting out of the way and letting them do what private enterprise does best   Since it opened  Restore Life has grown almost every year  according to the latest available tax records filed with the Internal Revenue Service   Records show that Restore Life s annual revenue rose from  49 251 in 2009 to  1 1 million in 2016  Income also increased  the records show  In 2009  expenses exceeded revenue by  1 277  Last year  revenues were  187 884 higher than expenses  The tax records show the charity s net assets were  354 556 on Aug  31  2016  the last date for which records are available  Byrd lives and works in a Tennessee town where the median household income is  30 000  The nonprofit he operates paid him a salary of  113 000 last year  the tax records show   THE DONOR Angie Saunders recalls that during her pregnancy  there were no signs of trouble in her prenatal check ups or ultrasound tests  But when Cody was born on August 2  1992  he arrived in grave distress   He was moved from the county hospital to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville  where he stayed three months  He was diagnosed with VATER Syndrome  a condition involving multiple birth defects   Besides the hole in his heart and failing kidneys  Cody was born without a rectum  For the first two years of his life  Cody s parents said  they fed him through a gastrostomy tube   Cody had so many dietary restrictions   no milk  no chocolate  no tomatoes  no salt   that he settled on dry Fruit Loops as his go to meal  For dessert  he took a couple of bites from a stick of butter  Cody needed dialysis three times a week  four hours per session  Given her son s needs  his mother couldn t work much  His father told every employer upfront that his child came first   Half of his life  if it wasn t the hospital  it was dialysis   Richard said   I went through a lot of jobs   When Cody was about 9 years old  his parents said  he received a kidney transplant that transformed him  It freed him from constant dialysis  He learned to swim and had more time for school    I wouldn t say he was normal   Richard said   but at least we wasn t having to be tied down as much   The new kidney lasted a little more than five years  and when it failed  Cody was rushed by helicopter to the hospital for a monthlong stay  his parents said  Dialysis began anew  At 14  Cody won a children s art contest  The charity  American Kidney Fund  flew him to Washington  D C  On a contest questionnaire  he listed his favorite things  including gym class  coloring  and riding his bike  His favorite actor was Scooby Doo  His role models  his dad and his mom  When he grew up  Cody wrote  he hoped to work with his father  Cody left school in the 11th grade  His parents say he was reading at a second grade level  He worked on farms as often as he could with his dad  and in the winter they sold firewood  He chewed Skoal tobacco and played pool at a local club  To protect his kidneys and heart  he didn t drink alcohol  But he didn t always follow doctors  advice  He could drink a six pack of Mello Yello soda in a day  his parents said   In his final years  Cody grew sad and lonely  His parents noticed  and so did his friends on Facebook  He was weary of the pills  the dialysis  the hospitals and the constant reminders of what he could and could not do  his parents said   I think not just his body was tired  but his whole mind was done   his father said   He wasn t scared   his mother said   He was ready   Cody s heart stopped on his birthday  August 2  2016  Not long afterward  Restore Life collected his body  ORDERING A SPINE  On August 29  2016  Reuters reporter Brian Grow sent an inquiry via email to Restore Life s Byrd  At the time  the news agency knew nothing about Cody Saunders  To contact Byrd  the reporter used his real name and his Thomson Reuters email account    We are seeking pricing  including shipping costs  to procure one cervical spine specimen for purposes of a research project involving non transplant tissue   the query said  The term  non transplant tissue  refers to body parts  such as heads and spines  which cannot be transplanted into living humans  The request from the reporter provided a delivery address in Minneapolis  a few miles from the University of Minnesota s anatomy lab  The query concluded   We look forward to hearing from you   Byrd responded about an hour later   Thank you for your email  I do not believe we have worked with you in the past  How did you hear about our organization    Your firm was referred to us by an industry contact   Grow replied  Byrd asked if Grow wanted a full cervical spine   the vertebrae and tissue in the neck  just below the skull  When told yes  Byrd replied that the price would be  300  plus  150 shipping  He attached X rays  which were described as belonging to a 24 year old male  Three days later  Grow accepted the offer  Byrd replied   Thank you again for allowing us the opportunity to work with you and your organization   He added three questions  One concerned billing  and one asked to confirm that the spine should be sent frozen  not thawed  Byrd s third question was whether the specimen would be used for  medical research or medical education   In addition to determining how easy it might be to buy body parts  Reuters sought to assess the quality of the specimens and the documentation that came with them  When the reporter responded simply   It s being used for medical research   Byrd closed the deal    Thank you again  sic  the opportunity to work with you and your organization   he wrote   McArthur said the Reuters purchase was legal and ethical  No law prohibits such sales  she said  and the news agency was conducting legitimate research  Byrd  she added  broke no laws by selling the body parts  Still  she said  the three questions he asked in his email demonstrated the broker s focus on completing the sale  rather than on seeking more details about the buyer s intentions   That process can include a request by the seller for details about how the buyer intends to use the body parts for research or education  McArthur said brokers like Byrd who accept donations have an ethical responsibility   though not a legal one   to ensure that body parts will be used in a medical setting for an appropriate purpose  Reuters turned over the remains to McArthur for analysis and safekeeping  But another buyer could have done anything with the human spine and heads  she said  THE SPINE ARRIVES On September 27  2016  a FedEx  NYSE FDX  driver delivered a brown cardboard box to the Minneapolis location where Reuters had leased a mailing address  There  Grow received the package and gave it to a courier who specializes in transporting human remains  The courier drove it directly to McArthur at the medical school  McArthur immediately noticed problems  She said she found it odd that the outside of the box was not labeled with a customary warning that human remains were inside  McArthur found a pair of one page documents in the box  One contained the results of a serology test by a reputable company  certifying that the donor was free of infectious disease  The other page offered a handwritten summary  in layman s terms  of the donor s medical history   In my experience  I would have expected to see a more robust form   McArthur said  explaining that most brokers provide precise and detailed medical histories   It s very superficial   The medical summary contained neither letterhead nor contact phone number  she noted  McArthur also cited inconsistencies in the specimen identification numbers listed at the top and bottom of one of the pages  And she noticed a small discrepancy between the identification numbers listed on the paperwork and a tag attached to a plastic bag covering the spine  Precise  legible medical history and consistent donor identification systems are critical information for proper medical research  said University of California anatomical services director Brandi Schmitt  The medical history helps the researcher account for variables such as disease or trauma  Clear paperwork and accurate tagging  she said  allow researchers to track specimens in a scientific manner  To prevent mishaps that could lead to lost or misidentified body parts  Schmitt said  most hospitals and medical schools use modern tracking techniques  including computer generated metal discs or barcode tags  A label of some sort should have been directly attached to the spine itself  she said  not merely to the packaging    Misidentification is a real problem  for sure   said Schmitt  who coordinates body donation for the University of California s medical schools statewide   I don t think that a handwritten document is your most professional approach  It can lead to human error   A week after the spine arrived  Byrd responded to a follow up email from Grow  Byrd said human heads were available for  300 each  He also offered discounts on knee and foot specimens to free up  some freezer space   He wrote that his low prices for body parts reflect the company s  nonprofit public charity  status  adding   We are looking to just cover our overhead   GRIEF AND ASHES Richard and Angie Saunders said they wanted to bury Cody beside relatives in a nearby cemetery  But Richard  who struggles to read  earns only about  900 a month  Angie  who has long suffered from debilitating anxiety  cannot work or drive  A burial was simply too expensive  Friends offered to pay for cremation  which typically costs at least  695 in the region  But the Saunders said they felt uneasy about accepting charity from folks they know  So they donated Cody s body to Restore Life  At the time  Richard said he was grateful for the free cremation the firm promised  The hardship the family faced is not uncommon among donors  said Martha Thayer  chair of the mortuary science program at Arapahoe Community College in Colorado  Bereaved families are  vulnerable and are being put in the position of choosing this as an option when they don t have money   Thayer said   The only thing that s more sad than a person who can t afford to live is a person who can t afford to die   In Cody s case  a relative read a donor consent form aloud to his parents before they signed it  One paragraph says   I authorize Restore Life USA to obtain all necessary tissue and organs for research and educational purposes  I understand this gift will be used for scientific research  teaching or other conforming purposes and for use in multiple research or educational venues with for profit and or non profit organizations that Restore Life USA  in their sole discretion  deems necessary to facilitate the gift   The Saunders said they believed this meant that Restore Life would merely remove small skin samples from Cody for medical research  cremate him and then return his ashes  The Restore Life consent form for Cody didn t disclose that a donated body may be dismembered  as consent forms of most other brokers do   A few weeks after the donation  a man from Restore Life delivered an urn with Cody s ashes  Angie can t recall the man s name but said he was kind   Really nice and understanding   she said  The toll Cody s death has taken on Richard worries Angie  He won t eat more than a few bites of whatever she cooks and usually refuses to talk about their loss  Richard said Angie isn t wrong  but he noted he has reduced his smoking  from five packs a day to about three  On the rusted red and white pickup he used to ride in with his son  Richard placed a large sticker on the rear window   In Loving Memory of Cody Saunders     He was my buddy  He was my best friend   Richard said   I keep telling myself I ll get over it  I ll get over it    In a shoebox inside her motorhome  Angie Saunders keeps four photographs of Cody  In each one  he looks directly into the camera  shades perched over his ballcap  She also keeps a silver urn containing his ashes on the dashboard    I didn t get to hold Cody when he came into the world and I didn t get to hold him when he went out   she said   But he came back to me  so he s in here with me   TWO MORE SPECIMENS In January  Restore Life shipped a second package to Reuters at the same Minneapolis address  This one contained two human heads  one male  one female  As an upcoming story will detail  Reuters purchased the heads as part of its research into a case in Pennsylvania  There  a human head was found in a wooded area near Pittsburgh almost three years ago  Again  the specialist courier brought the box to McArthur s university lab  where she donned protective gear and opened it   The Styrofoam container inside the cardboard box arrived cracked along two of the outside edges  making it vulnerable to leaks and presenting a potential health risk to anyone handling it  from shippers to researchers  McArthur said  She also found problems with the paperwork for the male head   The area where tissue samples are usually listed   usually with client  sample description  sample ID  type of preservation  and the date and time of preservation   is all blank   she said   Likewise  the paperwork for the female head was unprofessionally prepared  she said  McArthur said the documents were so hard to read that she struggled to understand key information any researcher would require  including the person s medical history  After the wrapping and paperwork were removed  McArthur found that neither head had an identification tag  A tag is considered critical  McArthur said  to track identity  especially when working with multiple body parts  McArthur said that she was familiar with stories of casual sales of body parts by brokers  but the sloppiness of this shipment surprised her   I don t believe what I have just seen here should be allowed or should be legal   McArthur said   I know that it can be handled in a way that won t stifle medical education and research  We can do this the right way   A SON S FATE As is customary in the body broker industry  Restore Life did not include the names of the people who donated the body parts it sold to reporter Grow   just each person s age and date of death  Reuters could not identify the individuals whose heads were shipped  But at just 24  Cody Saunders died so young that the news agency was able to identify him after searching through obituaries in southern states   With his parents  permission and participation  Reuters hired a forensic lab to perform a DNA test  It confirmed that the cervical spine came from Cody  In late August  Grow returned to visit Richard and Angie Saunders to tell them what Reuters had learned  Restore Life had dissected their son s body and sold part of his spine  For a few moments  Cody s parents sat silently   Angie stared into the distance  Richard looked at the ground  Then Angie spoke   I thought they was just taking skin samples   she said and began to cry  Richard tried to comfort her   It s over with  honey    I didn t want no more surgeries   she said   At that time  we did not have no choice   Richard reminded her   But you have to look at it this way  Like you kept saying  if it s going to help somebody else    I know  I know   The couple said nothing more for nearly half a minute  Finally  Richard turned to Angie  This part of their lives was  done and over   he told her   Had they known Cody would be dissected  his parents said  they would not have donated his body  Cody  they felt  already had endured too many surgeries during his short life  They didn t want  or expect  anyone to  cut on him  in death  Richard said  And yet  he added   I couldn t afford to do nothing else  so I felt like that was the best option we had    Richard asked whether Restore Life used any other parts of Cody s body  The reporter said he didn t know  Brokers typically don t disclose that information  Richard said he doubted he would seek answers from Restore Life   I don t blame them   he said  But he appreciated learning what happened to Cody s remains   Because we would have never known   he said  Angie agreed   We wouldn t have had a clue   
Early this month  in keeping with the family s wishes and at Reuters  expense  Cody s spine was cremated in Minnesota  Grow delivered the ashes to the Saunders family at their home in Tennessee   Reported by Brian Grow and John Shiffman  edited by Blake Morrison ",2017-10-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/special-report-reuters-buys-human-remains-and-learns-a-donors-tragic-story-547320,547320

164911,386427,FDX,4 Transportation Sector Research Candidates ,opinion,"Introduction
As a rule  I have never been very fascinated by the Transportation Sector  This is especially true regarding airlines and air transport companies  Nevertheless  there are two airlines and two air freight carriers in the Transportation Sector that I felt comfortable featuring in this article 
However  I still admit to having trouble suggesting that anyone invest in airlines  But  with that said the two airlines I m covering in this article are considered among the best managed airlines in the world  Even then  I would be very cautious before investing in airlines despite the expected future growth that I will be illustrating later in the video associated with this article 
The operating fortunes of air freight couriers are similar in nature to the airlines  However  the big differentiator is that air freight demand is more consistent and predictable than passenger traffic  Consequently  the air freight couriers offer more appeal to me personally 
A Sector By Sector Review
This is part 18 of a series where I have conducted a simple screening looking for value over the overall market based on industry classifications and subindustry classifications reported by FactSet Research Systems  Inc 
In part 1 found here I covered the Consumer Services Sector  In part 2 found here I covered the Communication Sector  In part 3 found here I covered the Consumer Durables Sector and its many diverse subsectors  In part 4 found here I covered Consumer Nondurables  In part 5 found here I covered companies in the Consumer Services Sector  In part 6 found here I covered the Distribution Services Sector  In part 7 found here I covered the Electronic Technology Sector  In part 8 found here I covered the Energy Minerals Sector  In part 9 found here I covered the Finance Sector  In part 10 found here I covered the Health Services Sector  In part 11 found here I covered the Health Technology Sector  In part 12 found here I covered the Industrial Services Sector  In part 13 found here I covered the Non Energy Minerals Sector  In part 14 found here I covered the Process Industries Sector  In part 15 found here I covered the Producer Manufacturing Sector  In part 16 found here I covered the Retail Trade Sector  In part 17 found here I covered the Technology Services Sector

A Simple Valuation and Quality Screening Process
With this series of articles  I will be presenting a screening of companies that have become attractively valued primarily as a result of the bearish market activities experienced in 2018 from each of the above sectors  I will be applying a rather simple valuation and quality oriented screen across each of the sectors  First  I have screened for investment grade S P credit ratings of BBB  or above  Next  I have screened for low valuations based on P E ratios between 2 and 17  Finally  I have screened for long term debt to capital no greater than 70  
By keeping my screen simple  and at the same time rather broad  I will be able to identify attractively valued research candidates that I might have overlooked through a more rigorous screening process  In other words  I m looking for fresh ideas that I might have previously been overlooking  Furthermore  I want to be clear that I do not consider every candidate that I have discovered as suitable for every investor  However  I do consider them all to be attractively valued  Additionally  I also believe that every investor will be able to find companies to research that meet their own goals  objectives and risk tolerances as this series unfolds

F A S T  Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video 
In the following analyze out loud video I will be covering the 4 attractively valued research candidates in the Transportation Sector  Importantly  when I analyze out loud the 2 airlines  I will offer my personal insights into why I am not personally interested in investing in airlines 


Summary and Conclusions
In my experience  I have found it extremely difficult for transportation companies to produce a steady stream of earnings and cash flow growth  Companies operating in this sector can see their operating results affected by fuel costs  demand  labor costs and even geopolitical events  Recently  airlines and air freight couriers have benefited from lower than average per gallon prices for jet fuel  The following graphic courtesy of IndexMundi shows that there is a clear correlation between the drop in price of jet fuel since 2009 and the accelerated earnings growth of the four companies covered in this article over the same timeframe  Consequently  prospective investors should be cognizant of the cut impact that potential rising oil prices  and therefore  jet fuel prices could affect future earnings 

Nevertheless  for the time being at least  all four of the companies covered in this article appear to be attractive total return candidates  There are also some interesting opportunities for the dividend growth investor amongst this group as well  However  in the final analysis  prospective investors would need to be diligent regarding the economic factors that could hurt future operating results discussed in the previous paragraph

164915,386431,FDX,After Dramatic Sell Off  Semiconductor Sector Went Up,opinion,"Semis    SMH 
The chips stocks have been one of the most horribly hit groups during this recent sell off with the SMH falling a stunning 19 3   input bear market headline here  just since April 24  But today  they did something unusual  they went up  Yes  they even went up even as the stock market appeared to plunge into the abyss  Amazing stuff 

It seems really en vogue to price everything relative to the S P 500  so when we look at the SMH relative to the SPY  the ratio is almost back to the fourth quarter doldrums  You know  the first time we were heading to economic doom that never happened 
The message  perhaps the group  along with the rest of the market is starting to find a bottom and perhaps is even oversold 

S P 500  SPY 
Anyway  moving back to doom and gloom  The S P 500 did a few things today that I found interesting  First  it managed to hold support at the 200 day moving  check  Second  it bounced off the middle downtrend line  check 2  Third  it managed to hold support at 2 768  check 3
I m not sure alone it means much of anything  But  when you combine that with the action in the chips and it is something to at least build off 

FedEx  FDX 
Throw in a dash of FedEx  NYSE FDX   and suddenly you could say perhaps we have the makings of something 
I was starting to believe that FedEx wasn t allowed to rise anymore  but that is what it did today  Then of course when you look at FedEx relative to the SPY  you scratch your head  FedEx hasn t traded at these levels since the recession in 2008  You have to ask yourself are things really that bad 

Skyworks  SWKS 
When a stock is down by 30  inside of a month  and then it suddenly stops going down  and volume is drying up  you need to take notice  Of course  it could mean the stock is consolidating and getting ready for another leg lower  However  it could also mean that Skyworks  NASDAQ SWKS  is finding a bottom as the sellers dry up 

Alibaba  BABA 
Or you could be Alibaba  NYSE BABA   that has volume increasing despite the stock making fresh lows  That is not a good sign  It means more seller s maybe creeping in  Careful  next stop could be  141 

China s Currency

164932,386448,FDX,Previewing Bank Earnings,opinion,"Bank stocks enthusiastically participated in the post Christmas rally  but they lost steam in mid March as Treasury yields pulled back again and have recovered only about half of losses since then  The chart below shows the 6 month stock market performance of the Zacks Major Banks industry  which includes the space s leading players  relative to the S P 500 index 
 
 
JPMorgan  JPM  and Wells Fargo  WFC  kick off the Q1 earnings season for the group on Friday  April 12th  with a host of industry players following suit the following week  In all  we will get Q4 results from more than 20 companies this week  including 6 S P 500 members 
The question is whether these quarterly results can serve as a catalyst for bank stocks 
To answer that question  we need to keep in mind that the issue with these stocks has not been a lack of operating performance  but rather big picture uncertainty  On most key operating metrics  bank performance was been very strong in recent quarters and we will most likely see a repeat performance this earnings season as well 
Key parts of the market s worry list for banks include the flattening yield curve and potential for inversion that has implications for the economy s health beyond 2019  The recent change in the Fed s monetary policy stance is essentially an acknowledgment of the same late cycle narrative 
Keep in mind that banks are cyclical businesses engaged in lending and other activities like investment banking  money management  and trading that are always at the mercy of the economic cycle  Banks not only experience low demand for its services when the economic cycle turns down  but the quality of its existing assets  its loan portfolio  also goes down as its customers  credit profiles weaken 
Even if we keep aside the market s other worries like trade uncertainty  global growth and political issues  it is this late cycle worry that has been the big weight on sentiment on bank stocks  That said  it is reasonable to expect that with valuations this compressed already  strong results will give many of these stocks a short term bump  But a fundamental rerating may be not be possible till the big picture worries are put to rest 
What Are Banks Expected to Earn 
Total Q1 earnings for the Zacks Major Banks industry that includes JPMorgan  Wells Fargo and other major industry players are expected to be down  6 5  from the same period last year on  0 8  lower revenues  The decline is primarily a function of tough comparisons  with the year earlier tally reflecting one time boost from the tax cut legislation 
For the Finance sector as a whole  Major Banks industry brings in roughly 45  of the sector s total earnings   total Q1 earnings are expected to be barely in positive territory  up  0 5  on  6 4  higher revenues  The chart below puts the Finance sector s Q1 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been and where it is expected in the coming periods 
 
 
The table below presents the Finance sector earnings picture at the medium industry level 
 
 
The  Earnings Recession  Narrative
With earnings growth expectations for the first quarter of 2019 already in negative territory and estimates for 2019 Q2 moving in that direction as well  there is growing talk of an impending earnings recession 
This is coming at a time when many in the market are worried about the duration of the current economic cycle that is on track to become the longest in the nation s history later this summer  It is this backdrop that has made market participants overly sensitive to the shape of the Treasury yield curve and its cyclical implications  No doubt  the  R  word has become potent 
So how reasonable are these  earnings recession  fears 
The definition of  recession  is two or more quarters of negative growth  typically GDP growth  The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following three quarters and actual results for the preceding 5 quarters 
 
 
To be totally pedantic about it  the recession talk reflects ground reality  as you can see in the chart above  After all  earnings growth in the first two quarters of the year is on track to be negative  even though the 2019 Q2 growth pace is barely in negative territory 
We shouldn t take this recession talk too seriously  however  The reason is that the negative growth in the first half of the year is solely because of very tough comparisons  In other words  the base period for 2019 Q1 growth is 2018 Q1  when earnings received a huge boost from the tax cut legislation  The lower corporate tax rates that showed up in earnings for the first time in 2018 Q1  the base year for 2019 Q1  boosted profitability through margin expansion  As such  we are up against some tough comparisons in 2019 
The tax cut legislation didn t have a direct bearing on revenues last year and we are not seeing that much drop off in estimates for this year either  as the chart below shows  orange bars  
 
 
So  if the earnings recession is only  technical   is there nothing to worry about on the earnings front 
That s not correct as there are legitimate reasons to be wary of the earnings picture  The earnings growth trajectory would be challenged and difficult even without the issue of the aforementioned tough comparisons as the global economic growth backdrop has become less favorable and cyclical rises in transportation  logistics  payroll and other expenses are squeezing margins  As a result  analysts steadily lowered their estimates for 2019 Q1 as well as full year 2019  as you can see in the chart below 
 
 
The weak guidance from Nike  NYSE NKE   FedEx  FDX   Walgreen s  WBA  and others in this reporting cycle suggests that we will likely see a replay of what we experienced the last earnings season that pushed estimates lower  We will be keeping a close eye on how estimates for 2018 Q2 evolve as companies report Q1 results and share their outlook for Q2 and beyond 
Expectations for 2019 Q1   the Initial Earnings Report 
Total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  4  from the same period last year on  4 6  higher revenues  If actual 2019 Q1 earnings growth turns out to be negative  it will be the first earnings decline since the second quarter of 2016 
Driving the expected Q1 earnings decline is broad based margin pressures across all major sectors  with net margins for the index of 11  down from 12  in the year earlier and 11 8  in the preceding quarter  The Utilities sector is the only one that is expected to have unchanged net margins in 2019 Q1 relative to the year earlier period  with margins expected to be lower for all of the remaining 15 sectors 
Q1 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit earnings declines for 5 sectors  including Energy and Technology  For the Technology sector  Q1 earnings are expected to be down  10  from the same period last year on  3  higher revenues and 270 basis points compression in net margins 
The table below shows the summary picture for 2019 Q1  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period 
 
 
Q1 Scorecard  as of Friday  April 5th  2019 
The market will start paying attention to the start of the earnings season following the quarterly reports from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo on April 12th  But these bank earnings reports will not be the first of the Q1 earnings season  as the reporting cycle has actually gotten underway already  with results from 23 S P 500 members out  All of these early reports  which includes a few bellwethers like FedEx  FDX   Nike  NKE  and others  have fiscal quarters ending in February  which we count as part of our March quarter tally 
For the 23 S P 500 members that have reported Q1 results already  total earnings are down  10 8  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues  with 73 9  beating EPS estimates and 52 2  beating revenue estimates 
The Q1 growth for these 23 index is tracking notably below what we had seen in the recent past and positive revenue surprises appear also to be on the weak side  as the comparison charts below show 
 
 
It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this admittedly small sample of Q1 results  but it is nevertheless a weak start to the reporting season

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is FedEx due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  FedEx Misses on Earnings in Q3The company s earnings  excluding 22 cents from non recurring items  of  3 03 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 10  Moreover  the bottom line declined 18 6  on a year over year basis  This downside was primarily due to a dismal performance of the company s major revenue generating segment  FedEx Express Quarterly revenues increased 2 9  year over year to  17 01 billion but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  17 64 billion  The top line benefited from higher volumes across all transportation segments and increased yields at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments Operating income  on an adjusted basis  improved 2 1  year over year to  984 million in the reported quarter  Meanwhile  operating margin remained flat at 5 8  in third quarter fiscal 2019 Segmental PerformanceQuarterly revenues at FedEx Express  including TNT Express  slid 1  to  9 billion due to soft international revenues on sluggish macroeconomic conditions and a weak global trade  Operating income came in at  370 million  up 17  year over year  Also  operating margin inched up to 4 1  from 3 5  in the year ago quarter FedEx Ground revenues increased 9  year over year to  5 26 billion in the period under consideration  Volume growth and higher yields aided this segmental performance  Operating income came in at  577 million  down 6  year over year while operating margin contracted to 11  from 12 7  in the prior year quarter FedEx Freight revenues rose 8  year over year to  1 75 billion  Segmental revenues benefited from higher revenue per shipment and average daily shipments  Also  the segment s operating income soared 98  to  97 million  Moreover  operating margin expanded 250 basis points to 5 5  in the quarter under review OutlookFedEx now anticipates fiscal 2019 earnings per share in the range of  15 10  15 90 excluding pension adjustments  TNT Express integration expenses and certain other items  prior view was in the  15 50  16 60 band  Capital expenses are still anticipated at  5 6 billion for fiscal 2019 while effective tax rate is now expected between 22  and 23   previous view  24 25    As part of the company  cost reduction initiatives  it anticipates a pre tax charge of  450  575 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 on account of a buyout program for U S  based employees  However  this program is estimated to generate approximately  225  275 million in savings during fiscal 2020 The company expects to incur TNT Express integration expenses of more than  1 5 billion through fiscal 2021  Of the total costs  fiscal 2019 is expected to spend  435 million  lower than the earlier estimate of  450 million

164954,386470,FDX,Stocks To Decline Before They Rise At The Week s End ,opinion,"Summary 

The S P 500  SPX  fell 21 points last week to 2801  a decline of 0 7  
This occurred as the Fed pointed to slower economic growth and the yield curve confirmed something was awry 
Our projection this week is for stocks to decline for a couple of days and then rise towards the end of the week 

Stocks began the week relatively calmly  bumping around and waiting for the Fed  While the market did pop  it closed the week lower  as I pointed out in the latest Market Week show 
The Federal Reserve announced this week that was lowering its GDP forecast from 2 3  to 2 1   It also confirmed that it would not raise interest rates this year and would reduce  then end the roll off of its balance sheet  This was a surprisingly dovish Fed meeting  in the face of some very rosy economic comments from Chairman Powell 
Meanwhile  President Trump interjected that  If we didn t have somebody raising interest rates and doing quantitative tightening we would have been over 4   GDP growth    referring to the Fed s 2018 policy 
Sadly  that suggests a poor understanding of the Fed s actions over the past two decades  and how that created the challenging condition in which central banks now live 
In support of the weakening conditions  both FedEx  NYSE FDX  and Nike  NYSE NKE  pointed to grumbling in the global economy during their earnings calls  While the US economy appears to be outperforming others  it s unlikely it will remain unaffected 
Later in the week  the yield curve inverted  meaning that short term interest rates rose above long term rates  Specifically  the yield on 3 month treasuries was 2 46  compared to 2 44  for 10 year treasuries 
This is the first time this has happened since 2007 and is considered by many to be an indicator that a recession is on the horizon  This puts some fund managers in the condition of being mandated to lower risk 
Looking further at the macroeconomic picture  some indicators looked good while others pointed to cracks in the glass  For example  while the Philly Fed and existing home sales exceeded market expectations  US services PMI and German manufacturing PMI fell short 
Stepping back  our analysis of longer term market cycles indicates bearish price action over the coming 18 months  Looking at the daily chart for the S P 500  SPX   we believe the coming weeks may produce an intermediate term top 
S P 500  SPX  Daily Chart

Our approach to technical analysis uses market cycles to project price action  For this week  while our overall bias is lower  we believe this week will be choppy  More specifically  we are looking for a dip into the 2775 2790 short term support zone 
This will likely be followed by a move to the upside before the end of the week  If it follows through in this manner  we believe the latter may be an opportunity to sell  as we enter into the declining phase of the current intermediate market cycle ",2019-03-23,Steve Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/look-for-another-week-in-which-rallies-fail-as-stocks-build-an-intermediate-top-200400444,200400444

164978,386494,FDX,Special Report  Refiner Valero s secret campaign against U S  biofuels mandates,news,"By Chris Prentice
 Reuters    U S  biofuels regulations  which mandate mixing corn based ethanol into gasoline  have lately drawn together a diverse cast of political opponents 
They include an upstart gas station owners  trade group  a former Obama administration environmental adviser and billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn  who owns a refiner and served as U S  President Donald Trump s special advisor on business regulation   until he resigned Friday amid allegations of a conflict of interest 
Even the Renewable Fuels Association  RFA   a leading biofuels industry group  recently dropped its opposition to policy changes sought by this ad hoc coalition 
These players would seem to have few shared interests  but they share one key connection   close ties to  Valero Energy  Corp   N VLO   America s largest oil refiner 
As part of an extensive behind the scenes lobbying campaign  Valero played a key role in bringing these people and groups together around a policy proposal that could save the refiner hundreds of millions of dollars each year in regulatory costs  according to two former Valero executives with knowledge of the firms  lobbying strategy 
Valero is a big loser under current regulations  which require refiners to either blend biofuels into their gasoline and diesel or buy government issued credits from firms that do such mixing  After selling off much of its ethanol blending operations in cash raising deals in 2006 and 2013  Valero was forced to spend  750 million last year alone buying the credits  according to Valero s securities filings 
The policy overhaul favored by Valero would free refiners from the obligation to blend biofuels or buy credits  shifting that burden to firms further down the supply chain toward retailers 
Such a change would amount to a multi billion dollar transfer of wealth to Valero  It would also benefit Icahn s refining company  CVR Energy  N CVI   and a handful of other refiners that lack blending operations 
Top Valero officials wanted others to act as the public face of the push to upend renewable fuels policy  the former Valero executives told Reuters 
 There was an effort to line up people who would support us who were more palatable to decision makers   said one of the former executives   It s easier to support a small business than a big refining company  
In response to Reuters  inquiries  Valero stressed that it has publicly criticized current regulations  Spokeswoman Lillian Riojas called the rules harmful to  workers  small business retailers  consumers  the refining base  energy security and even the drive for more biofuels blending  
Valero has joined petitions to change the law  sued the EPA  and sent executives to challenge the policy at industry conferences  But its more extensive and less visible lobbying through proxies served a purpose   to create a perception of broader support for a change that would primarily benefit Valero and a small number of other refiners 
The push to change the so called  point of obligation  for biofuels blending is opposed by most ethanol producers and large integrated oil companies with blending facilities  They argue the shift would rope in thousands of additional companies   from gasoline retailers to shippers such as FedEx  NYSE FDX    and undermine the program by complicating enforcement 
The Trump administration has said it is considering the regulatory changes  but it has not announced a decision 
In early August  three sources familiar with the administration s biofuels policy deliberations told Reuters that the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  was preparing to reject proposals for the change  The White House declined comment and referred questions to the EPA  which did not respond to requests for comment 
Valero strategists viewed Icahn as a better public advocate to change biofuels policy despite his majority ownership of a small refinery  the two Valero executives said  That s because the famous Wall Street investor has a diverse array of business interests and unique access to Trump  a longtime friend 
 Our folks wanted to get him involved   said one of the Valero executives  who was regularly involved in company discussions on biofuels lobbying 
When Icahn wrote the EPA in August of 2016 to push for the policy change   arguing current rules create a  rigged market    representatives from Valero helped him craft the letter  the executive said 
Valero declined to comment on its role in crafting Icahn s proposal  Jesse Lynn  a lawyer for Icahn  said the billionaire  sought input from a number of people  on the letter but declined to name them 
Shortly after being elected  Trump named Icahn his special advisor on regulation  an informal role 
Icahn stepped down from the post on Friday after facing criticism that he was advising Trump on policy changes that would enrich his refining business  Icahn denied any conflicts of interest late Friday in an open letter to Trump 
 I never sought any special benefit for any company with which I have been involved  and have only expressed views that I believed would benefit the refining industry as a whole   he wrote 
The White House has said there is no conflict of interest between Icahn s refining business and his biofuels policy advocacy because he was not paid as a presidential advisor 
 REGULATORY HAIL MARY 
The Renewable Fuel Standard  RFS  was adopted in 2005 during the presidency of Republican George W  Bush as a way to bolster U S  energy independence  reduce pollution and support Midwest corn farmers  Today  about 10 percent of U S  motor fuel comes from vegetation 
The law s critics   which cover a broad ideological spectrum  from fossil fuel firms to environmentalists   argue variously that it is essentially a farming subsidy  that ethanol hurts gas mileage and does little to help the environment  and that its impact in reducing foreign oil dependence has been dwarfed by booming U S  oil production 
Jack Lipinski  chief executive of Icahn s CVR Energy  told Reuters that the current rules create a  contrived and manipulated marketplace   The law provides a windfall to major integrated oil companies   who profit from selling the credits   and unfairly punishes certain refiners for not investing in costly biofuels blending facilities  he said 
Lobbying against the mandates became more urgent for CVR and Valero in 2013  when prices for biofuels credits soared as energy firms worried about an impending increase in required biofuels blending volumes 
By then  major refiners such as  Tesoro  Corp  NYSE ANDV  and Marathon Corp  N MPC  were investing in blending facilities to lower regulatory costs 
But Valero  looking to focus on its core refining business  had been selling off its already limited blending operations as part of larger deals  It sold a pipeline and logistics unit in 2006 to raise  880 million and spun off its retail unit in 2013 in transactions that brought it  1 4 billion 
Valero has said it now has little ability to blend ethanol and biodiesel into the more than 2 million barrels of petroleum products it produces each day in the United States  As a result  the firm is forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on biofuels credits 
By 2015  Valero CEO Joseph Gorder was convinced that lobbying the EPA to change regulations was a better strategy than operating blending facilities  one of the former Valero executives told Reuters 
The second former Valero executive described the tactic as a  regulatory Hail Mary  
SIGNING UP AN OBAMA ENVIRONMENTAL ADVISOR
In 2015  Valero s external lobbying firm   Bracewell LLP  a Houston based law and government relations outfit   hired Ron Minsk  a former advisor to President Barack Obama on energy and the environment  as a consultant 
Bracewell never announced the high profile hire  made months after Minsk left the White House  and Minsk never registered as a lobbyist  according to U S  Congressional disclosures 
In February 2016  Minsk testified before Congress as an expert on biofuels regulation  citing his experience as an Obama advisor and arguing in favor of a shift in the point of obligation for blending 
Minsk did not disclose his relationship with Valero in his written testimony but acknowledged it when a lawmaker pressed him about industry ties 
 I have been retained by a law firm to consult on issues related to the RFS  and Valero Energy Corporation is one of their clients   Minsk said  referring to Bracewell 
Asked why he didn t disclose the Valero connection before testifying  Minsk told Reuters   I was sharing my own views  and not anyone else s  
Minsk also filed public comments to EPA in February 2017  urging the same policy change   again without noting his Valero connection 
Scott Segal  a Bracewell partner in Washington  said in a statement that Minsk  provides technical advice to us on a variety of topics  and that he was  certainly not testifying or writing on behalf of the firm or its clients  
 RETAILER OF THE YEAR 
Throughout 2016  Valero cultivated allies that would ultimately mobilize around the same policy proposal to the White House 
The refiner helped one of its retailers  Bill Douglass  launch a grassroots organization of small gas station owners that would argue biofuels mandates hurt their mom and pop businesses 
Douglass said he contacted all of his fuel suppliers for help in starting the organization  but only Valero provided assistance  giving him a list of its retailers to recruit 
Bracewell helped connect the fledgling Small Retailers Coalition with a website developer  the firm said  The site is devoted largely to arguing for the same regulatory changes Valero supports  Douglass also sent a letter to the EPA and spoke personally with an EPA official to urge adoption of the policy 
Bracewell was happy to help a political ally of its client Valero  Segal said 
 It should come as no surprise that groups with which we are allied  we help   Segal said  while noting the firm did not control the website s content   We share information and frankly we re glad to do it  We are not opposed to providing assistance when it s appropriate  
Valero s spokeswoman denied the company had played a significant role in setting up the SRC and declined further comment on the firm s relationship to the group 
Valero did  however  name SRC founder Douglass its  Retailer of the Year  in 2016

 TRYING TO SPLIT THE INDUSTRY 
Valero also sought to join biofuels industry groups and persuade them to back its policy position  according to the former Valero executives and three biofuels industry sources 
Valero had reason to join one of those groups  Although it lacked sufficient ethanol blending facilities  it was one of the nation s top five ethanol producers 
Still  Valero was seen as an outsider by many biofuels producers because the refiner had opposed regulations they supported  two oil and four biofuels industry sources told Reuters 
Michael McAdams  President of the Advanced Biofuels Association  said he received a phone call in May or June of 2016 from Valero s Richard Walsh   a senior vice president and corporate counsel who led the refiner s push to change biofuels policy  the former Valero executives said 
Walsh said Valero wanted to join the biofuels organization   but first wanted the chance to convince the group to support its proposed regulatory change 
 My board said   No  thank you  We can t align with you    McAdams said  adding that it seemed Valero was  trying to split  the biofuels industry  McAdams said 
Walsh did not respond to requests for comment 
NEUTRALIZING AN OPPONENT
The refiner  however  did end up joining the Washington based Renewable Fuels Association  RFA   among the most prominent biofuels producer groups and a powerful lobbying force 
The RFA had previously criticized proposals to shift the biofuels blending point of obligation  arguing it would discourage production of blends with higher ethanol content and complicate enforcement 
Valero and RFA President Bob Dinneen declined to discuss how and why Valero came to join the group but said it had nothing to do with the RFA s position on the refiner s policy priorities 
The RFA  however  ultimately did agree to drop its opposition to the policy change sought by Valero   a clear victory for the refiner 
In February  Valero representatives and Icahn held a meeting with the RFA s Dinneen  Icahn told Dinneen he believed Trump would support the refiners  biofuels policy proposal   and that the RFA should lend its political support 
Dinneen told Reuters at the time that the RFA decided not to oppose what it believed was a done deal  He also said Icahn assured the group that it could win concessions from the Trump Administration in return  including support for a different regulatory change that would encourage production of fuel blends with higher ethanol content 
Other biofuel industry groups slammed the RFA s policy shift  Fuels America  a coalition of renewable fuel and farm groups  dropped the RFA as a member of their alliance in response 
LOBBYING A LOBBYIST AT THE WHITE HOUSE
In March  Valero s Walsh  CVR s Lipinski and representatives from other refiners went to the White House to pitch their case to Trump s top aide on domestic energy policy  Michael Catanzaro  a former energy industry lobbyist 
Trump had banned former lobbyists hired by his administration from participating in issues on which they lobbied for two years   but the White House later granted Catanzaro a waiver from that rule 
Catanzaro is advising on the same issues that were recently the focus of his lobbying for clients such as Koch Industries   a diversified conglomerate with major energy assets   and groups including the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers  which petitioned the EPA for the biofuels change last year 
Catanzaro declined to comment 
Valero s Walsh invited Douglass to join the meeting to represent the Small Retailers Association  Douglass said 
As in other forums  Valero representatives let others take the lead in carrying the message  mainly Douglass and a union representative for workers at a Philadelphia refinery 

 They let me do most of the speaking   Douglass said   They let me hold the floor because I think they regard my dilemma as being more critical  ",2017-08-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/special-report-refiner-valeros-secret-campaign-against-us-biofuels-mandates-520561,520561

Given the current regulatory framework  that s been working well for decades already  there are a few challenges when introducing a new form of assets such as crypto  which basically represent programmable money and have such a wide array of versatile applications 
Much of the stuff we ve discussed here focuses on SEC  Securities and Exchange Commission  but another regulatory body opened up to the crypto community yesterday  the CFTC  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  
On an interview yesterday with BlockTV  the newest commissioner of the CFTC  Dan Berkovitz discussed the interactive process of regulating blockchains as well as some of the advantages that blockchain brings to regulators 
VanEck has been comparing crypto regulation to a baseball game  where you don t necessarily need to hit a home run  but rather a steady stream of small gains can end up winning the game

It s Fed Day
Alt Season Continues

Traditional Markets
Markets struggled through the Asian session this morning  Following some sour profit forecasts from BMW and FedEx  it seems the European session is decidedly down 
The woes of both companies are significantly tied to the current developing global trade war  FedEx mentioned the global slowdown as their number one reason for disappointing numbers  while BMW spoke more broadly but did name Brexit as a major factor of uncertainty 
Many stock indices have given back yesterday s gains  with interest 

Still  these are short term charts  and you can t have a great day every day  Long term trends remain unclear for the stock market  Many analysts believe that we re near the end of the cycle but others feel there s still room to grow  It might be prudent for now to remain selective 
Fed Up
At 1 00 PM on Wall Street the US Federal Reserve will release their economic projections  a written statement  and their interest rate decision  30 minutes later  we ll get a press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell 
As we ve been discussing  the Fed is the largest player in the global financial markets and their policy  and policy shifts  have arguably been the largest factor moving everything from stocks  commodities  bonds  forex  and possibly even crypto 
For those of you who are new  I ll sum up the last decade of Fed policy in three sentences   
From 2009 to 2017 the Fed supported markets  When they withdrew that support in 2018  the markets started to fall  Due to the markets falling  they decided to support the markets again early this year 
Now that they re on the supportive side again  stocks are somewhat stable  The current strategy they ve been emphasizing lately can be summed up in one word   
Patience
Therefore  we can probably expect the most important part of their event today to be the Economic Projections  If the economy is improving at a faster rate than they re ready for  it might force them off their patient position  Not likely  but it is a possibility that traders should be prepared for 
Alt Season Continues
The top cryptos have mostly been stable over the last week but there has been rapid fluctuation among many of the lower cap coins 
Over the last 24 hours  there have been dozens of altcoins with massive gains and massive losses  Some of the top gainers have seen more than 200  returns and some of the losers are down more than 90   Most of these coins  I ve never heard of before 
When coins have a smaller market cap  it takes less money movement to have a significant impact on their price  Given that global exchange volumes are holding above  30 billion per day  about triple what they were in mid December  it makes sense that we re seeing these type of fluctuations 

The large cap coins are being influenced as well  but the impact is a bit tamer  Yesterday s Alt season winner was Cardano  which rose 7 5  in less than three hours  Not a monstrous move in the crypto world  but still a pretty significant move

164984,386500,FDX,Are Global Corporate Earnings About To Plunge ,opinion,"FedEx   the global shipping firm   just released their quarterly report  And it gives us a decent look at the global economy 
As expected   it wasn t pretty 
In summary   management reported disappointing results over the last quarter  And provided a weak forward guidance for the upcoming quarter 
 Slowing international macroeconomic conditions  And weaker global trade growth trends continue  as seen in the year over year decline in our FedEx Express international revenue   said Alan B  Graf  Jr   FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   executive vice president and chief financial officer  
Many know I ve been bearish on global trade for the last 16 months  And I ve also written about some of the problems in China and Hong Kong  read here   and here   if you haven t yet  
But what s really worrying is the sudden collapse in South Korean exports     
I wrote an article in early March highlighting how important South Korean exports are as a macro  leading indicator   an economic factor that changes before the rest of the economy begins to go in a particular direction  
And in just the first ten days of March   South Korea s exports dropped  19 1  from a year earlier 

Now   many may remember that I wrote about the accurate correlation between South Korean Export Growth  aka SKEG  and global corporate earnings 
But if you don t remember   here s what I wrote     
 It s been historically accurate over the last 25 years  SKEG       Thus   when the SKEG moves sharply   most usually global earnings  EPS  follows closely behind it   Who would ve guessed there s a tight correlation between South Korean export growth and global earnings  
For some perspective   over the last 25 years now  the direction of the SKEG has almost perfectly preceded global earnings within a 12 month lag      

Putting it simply   if South Korean exports move up or down   global earnings follow right behind it 
I updated my SKEG chart  first published in early June 2018  to account for the drop in South Korean exports  And here s what it looks like now 

If this correlation still holds  which I expect it will    then look for a deep plunge in global corporate earnings over the next year     
This slowdown of South Korean exports tells us that the slowing in Asia   and the world economy   is getting worse 
I still maintain my global earnings recession late 2019

164986,386502,FDX,The Real End Of The Bond Market,opinion,"These things are actually quite related  though I understand how it might not appear to be that way at first  As noted earlier today  the Fed  yet again  proves it has no idea how global money markets work  They can t even get federal funds right after two technical adjustments to IOER  the joke  
But as esoteric as all that may be  recent corporate statements leave much less doubt at least as to the primary effect  Before the FOMC gave up on the boom  company bellwethers like FedEx  NYSE FDX  beat them to it 

Corporate giants doing business abroad are painting a dreary picture of the world s economy This week  top executives at FedEx  BMW  UBS and others described bleak global business conditions while discussing quarterly results  Fitch Ratings also  aggressively  cut its forecast for the year 
The head of UBS was among the latest to blame the world s backdrop for weaker than expected results  CEO Ermotti told a conference in London on Wednesday that it  one of the worst first quarter environments in recent history   Reuters reported 

Economists would do well if they would ever learn to curve  stop it with the ridiculous one year forwards and term premiums nonsense   The bond markets have been saying all along that this was the way it was going to turn out  The reason  liquidity risks  These are high  unusually high because of that one thing  The Federal Reserve has no idea what it takes to fix the broken monetary system  they can t even get the simplest part right  
QE s and bank reserves didn t accomplish a thing  In light of recent EFF and repo events  officials are turning to more bank reserves  Brilliant 

If you thought that was bad enough  things are still taking a turn for the worse  Having more and more considered a downside scenario and the growing probability for it  attention is now focused on depth and duration 
There are a couple things worth noting along those lines  in addition to the yield or eurodollar futures curves  TIPS yields  for example  are a composite of inflation perceptions balanced against the nominal environment  In other words  the 5 year TIPS yield is the 5 year UST nominal minus what the market assumes is average inflation over the duration of the instrument  since you get compensated by the US Treasury for the CPI  
That remainder can be thought of as  real  growth expectations  My interests tend toward the monetary and therefore inflationary side of TIPS  My colleague Joe Calhoun  correctly  as usual  takes the broader approach when assessing those  real  yields  too  Guess what they ve been doing all during this Fed  pause  

Growth expectations in the bond market have been collapsing  pretty much what the CEO of UBS as well as the earnings report from FedEx have been talking about  Inflation expectations must therefore rise to offset them  because nominal UST yields have run into a roadblock of sorts 

As noted before  I believe UST rates would be falling faster and farther  like in Germany or Japan  if Jay Powell had been more honest  or capable  really  in reading the economic situation  The short end is in the way  to put it mildly  More and more  however  that is proving to be less of a problem 
With the belly of the UST curve now regularly falling below EFF  the market is becoming comfortable  for lack of a better term  with this upside down situation  Risks  in other words  are being perceived as still rising and therefore overwhelming the natural tension shape of the yield curve keeping it from whole hearted collapse 
If  rather when UST yields push through the ST  boundary  then you ll likely see both inflation breakevens as well as  real  TIPS yields decline in concert  For now  the short end is holding up the nominal topside  leaving inflation breakevens to follow along with oil 
This view is corroborated by indications like swap spreads  The Fed pause never once registered in them  only the falling growth expectations  Swap spreads are  essentially  an indirect measure of balance sheet capacity especially when they are negative  The 10s are right on the boundary from falling below zero again  even the 5s were edging closer to the netherworld this week  

Economists and central bankers the world over misinterpreted Reflation  3  they really did  and a lot on purpose  They specifically talked up  globally synchronized growth  trying more so to make it happen rather than out of an honest assessment of the shape of the global economy as it really was  If this was a game of poker  the flat curve in 2017 was the bond market calling their bluff 
The FOMC meeting this week was Jay Powell showing his weak hand  again  he can t even get EFF right   What comes next is markets assessing what it means with the Fed totally out of the game  The initial inclination  falling real yields  obviously isn t a good one  And as recent corporate news projects  it s not limited to being a market driven curiosity

165030,386546,FDX,FedEx  Dividend Stock To Hold For Decades  Boost Retirement Savings,opinion,"Future retirees face a tough dilemma when trying to decide which investments will increase their retirement savings  especially at a time when the rate of return on fixed income assets  including government bonds  savings bank accounts  and other fixed term deposits  is close to zilch  But for those willing to take a little extra risk  the best bet in this market is to go for income producing stocks 
While there are many reasons to avoid the risk of investing in equities  diversifying a retirement portfolio and putting some portion of it into stocks can help give a meaningful boost to savings  And regardless of what s happening in the markets  it s always a good time to invest in good businesses which generate hefty cash flows and regularly reward stakeholders  This strategy means thinking long term and buying into businesses as a partner  not as a trader 
FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  is one such dividend stock that can be held for the next 20 or 30 years  depending on your retirement goal 
Delivery Giant Offering Long Term Value
For growth hungry investors  it s probably the worst time to buy shares of delivery giant  FedEx  The global economy is on shaky ground  Both Europe and China are showing signs of a pronounced slowdown  while the U S  is in a late stage of the growth cycle after a decade long expansion  The risks to its economy are growing 
Global delivery businesses are a proxy for the global economy and generally give early warnings on the outlook for trade and business investment  That s the reason FedEx stock has been hit hard  falling almost 30  over the last year 
However  for buy and hold investors seeking a good value stock to hang on to over the next 20 years  this pullback offers a good entry point to a company which has a huge economic moat  a term coined by Warren Buffett to define businesses with massive competitive power to defend their turfs  FedEx stock certainly fits into this category 
Trading at  177 98 at Friday s close  FedEx stock looks cheap when compared to its peers  after the significant downward correction of the past 12 months  Its price to earnings ratio of 15 68 is lower than the industry average of 25 84 

At the midpoint of management s latest guidance range  FedEx is expected to earn an adjusted net income of  16 05 per share in its fiscal year 2019  That will be a modest 5  increase compared with the  15 31 per share earnings the company reported for fiscal 2018  That gives a forward earnings multiple of 11  indicating that FedEx stock is offering good value at current levels  The company reports Q3 earnings tomorrow  with analysts expecting an EPS of  3 14 and revenue of  17 62 billion for the quarter 
But earnings growth isn t the only reason to buy shares in market leading companies  The biggest attraction of these stable businesses is that they generate regular income for a retirement portfolio and that income continues to grow over time 
Currently  FedEx pays  0 65 per share quarterly dividend with an annual yield of 1 45   This yield looks meager when compared to some high yielding stocks in the market  But we would still prefer FedEx stocks over other  riskier  names because the company has a lot of room to grow its payouts 
Since 2013  the FedEx payout has grown from an annual  0 58 a share to  2 60 per share  a jump of 348  in just five years  Despite the stunning growth  FedEx still has a lot of room to grow its dividend with a paltry 17 27  payout ratio versus an industry average of 46 91  
Bottom Line
Retirement investing is very different from buying shares for short term gains  When it comes to generating wealth for your golden years  think like a business owner  not a trader  Diversify your portfolio by adding quality income stocks that pay growing dividends  FedEx is a good candidate if you re embarking on this journey ",2019-03-18,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fedex-corp-an-attractive-dividend-stock-for-retirees-200398519,200398519

As we enter a new week  this upper price boundary remains intact  although the Fibonacci measurement of when this boundary should be taken out has changed  Last week s SPX rally from 2722 27 to 2830 73 invalidated my 76 4  Fibonacci time parameter  which signifies that the time spent in the recovery rally from the Dec  26 low was equal to 76 4  of the time spent in the Sep  21 to Dec  26 correction 
This  Fibonacci Recovery Time Resistance Zone  now shifts to the first week of April  when the time spent in the post December rally will equal 100  of the Sep  Dec  correction 
A bullish scenario for the SPX technically seems like a done deal  a slam dunk  despite SPX already having climbed 20  in just 10 weeks  That said  much of the post December advance has coincided with Fed and central bank  intervention   One look at the SPX chart we ve included shows the impressive  V Shaped Bottom  overlaid with my annotations of central bank jawboning  aided and exacerbated by algorithmic buy programs after December 26   Starting on Jan 4  with Fed Chair Powell s backpedaling on the FOMC s original plan for 3 or 4 rate hikes during 2019  it certainly appears that a steady stream of accommodative statements  jawboning  by the Fed  the PBOC  China Central Bank   and the ECB  European Central Bank  preserved  supported  and propelled SPX higher 

Indeed  exactly one week ago  after a period of 5 consecutive down days  Chairman Powell reiterated to Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes that nothing in the outlook demands an immediate policy response  and the central bank has adopted a patient  wait and see approach  Powell also commented that he does not see any reason why the economy cannot grow in a healthy manner for years to come 
With Powell s Goldilocks comments coming right as the equity futures markets reopened last Sunday evening  March 10   the e Mini S P futures rocketed out of the blocks and never looked back for the entire week  Even discouraging news about a U S  China trade deal failed to derail Fed inspired price action  While some market watchers suspected that Quadruple Witching March Futures and Options Expiration may have played a role in last week s 4  upmove  Fed Chair Powell s comments initiated the strength last Sunday night 

This week s reopen after Friday s March OPEX and index rebalancing will be interesting  but the Fed will not be a factor because all Fed Heads must remain mute ahead of Wednesday s  Mar  20  FOMC meeting  Yes  the Fed meets again this week to issue a policy statement chock full of potential market moving information  about topics such as the health of the economy  the absence of inflationary pressures  a time schedule for ending Quantitative Tightening and likely changes in the infamous Dot Plot of member rate expectations for the rest of this year and beyond  While Fed watchers and traders are parsing out this information  there is the always intriguing Powell press conference to look forward to 
Clearly  Wednesday afternoon the markets could have additional information to determine if the Powell Fed is leaning  more Dovish  than it was after its January 30 meeting  when its rate outlook flipped 180 degrees  from 3 to 4 hikes to wait and see for 2019 
While Wednesday s FOMC Meeting undoubtedly will be the focal point of investors and traders  and could lift equity prices in anticipation of a more dovish perspective from the Fed  there are other potential market catalysts 
On Tuesday  President Trump welcomes admirer and newly elected Brazilian President Bolsonaro to the White House for a chat and for a press conference that has the potential to be wild and crazy 
Also on Tuesday  after the close  FedEx  NYSE FDX  reports earnings and guidance  an economic bellwether name that has exhibited an extremely dismal performance since its 274 66 high in January 2018  Last Friday  FDX closed at 177 98 
Wednesday is Fed Day 
Finally  news  tweets and leaks about a China trade deal and the Mueller report will continue to loom large every day 
Let s strap ourselves in for a potentially volatile and technically consequential week  As for levels  all eyes on a closing level of 2832  my 76 4  Fibonacci Recovery Price Resistance Reversal Acceleration level   which if hurdled points to 2880 next  and could trigger potential for upside continuation and acceleration that leads to a retest of last September s all time highs heading into early April

165032,386548,FDX,FedEx Shares Gain Despite Pre Earnings Bear Note,opinion,"Shipping name FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  is up 1 6  at  180 91 in afternoon trading  despite earlier receiving a pre earnings price target cut to  230 from  235 at Raymond James  The company s fiscal third quarter earnings report is due out after the market closes this Tuesday  March 19    and ahead of the event  the options market is pricing in an ambitious post earnings move for FDX stock 
FedEx shares have been on a long term downtrend  and staged a bear gap last month following a surprise executive departure  The shares have struggled to find purchase above the  180 mark  and they re now staring up at their descending 80 day moving average    which has been stiff resistance since late September 

Moving onto FDX s earnings history  the stock has traded lower the day after its quarterly report in each of the past four quarters  Over the past two years  the shares have swung an average of 3 9  the day after earnings  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in an 8 5  move for Wednesday s trading    more than double the normal post earnings move for FDX 
And options traders seem to be betting on another downside move for FedEx after this week s results  FDX holds a Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  of 0 90  which ranks in the 75th percentile of its annual range  In other words  near term options traders have rarely been more put biased in the past year  In fact  total put open interest on FDX stands at 85 772 contracts  per Trade Alert    in the 94th annual percentile 
But circling back to analyst sentiment  the majority of brokerage firms covering FDX still sport  buy  or  strong buy  ratings  Plus  the average 12 month price target of  221 40 comes in at a 21  premium to current levels  This split sentiment configuration sets the stage for another potentially dramatic earnings reaction out of the stock ",2019-03-19,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fedex-shares-gain-despite-preearnings-bear-note-200398900,200398900

165048,386564,FDX,Analysts Estimate FedEx  FDX  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects FedEx  FDX  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended February 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on March 19  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This package delivery company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 10 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 7  
Revenues are expected to be  17 68 billion  up 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 22  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FedEx 
For FedEx  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 70  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FedEx will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that FedEx would post earnings of  4 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 03  delivering a surprise of  0 49  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
FedEx doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-03-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-fedex-fdx-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200396901,200396901

Lehigh Valley International Airport on Tuesday  ninety minutes from the bustle of New York City  loaded with crates of goods during the peak holiday shopping season  It s one of 40 jets leased by Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  for a new cargo service to meet delivery demand from the retail giant s customers  Exclusive payload data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials around the country show that Prime Air planes are flying nearly full  but with lightweight loads  taking away valued business from FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX  and  United Parcel  Service Inc  NYSE UPS   Expanding into transportation  from trucks to planes  is one of Amazon s most important endeavors as it strives to lure new customers with fast shipping while keeping costs under control  The world s largest online retailer is sending more packages  more often  and later in the day to serve its estimated 35 million to more than 50 million U S  members of Amazon Prime  a service that promises two day shipping for  99 per year   Bulky boxes with goods once purchased in stores  like toilet paper  are a revenue driver at UPS and FedEx  That s in part because they now are charging customers increasingly by boxes  volume rather than weight  Shipping its own big  light packages is helping Amazon dodge those rising fees  To date  Amazon has only said it leased the planes to speed up shipping and to backstop cargo partners during the holiday season  FedEx and UPS have delivered items late for Christmas in recent years   Our own delivery efforts are needed to supplement that capacity rather than replace it   Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman told Reuters  She declined to comment on eluding cargo airline fees  Amazon s planes fly to at least 10 airports across the United States  supplying its warehouses nearby  Officials at four airports said Amazon s flights are operating near capacity but landing with lower than average weight    meaning it is placing low density shipments inside the jets   For graphic click   Amazon aircraft on a monthly basis handled only between 37 percent and 52 percent of their maximum loads by weight  according to an analysis of cargo  capacity and landing data from the four airports  with supplementary information from tracking website FlightAware com  By contrast  FedEx and UPS were at 53 percent and 56 percent capacity  respectively  according to U S  Transportation Department data for the year ended September 2016  excluding weight carried for free   You re dealing with cargo that s big in dimensions  but in pure weight it s light   said an airport ramp manager in California  Airports in Tampa and Charlotte reported similar payload data for the carriers contracted by Amazon  but they did not specify whether the flights were full by volume or whether they were operated on Amazon s behalf  A seventh airport outside Chicago said the planes were not full  though daily flights only started in October 2016  and Amazon likely is learning the market  transport experts said  The remaining airports did not comment  FedEx declined to comment  Steve Gaut  vice president of public relations at UPS  declined to comment on Amazon s airline but said customers commonly handle parts of their logistics in house  Reuters could not determine the extent to which  if any  Prime Air had an effect on the bottom lines of FedEx or UPS to date  Reuters could also not determine how much Amazon has spent on aircraft leases so far  key to whether the fleet has cut its costs overall  The payload figures Reuters reviewed do not include November or December  when contractor ABX Air  a unit of Air Transport Services Group Inc  paused flights for Amazon after a pilot strike  FLYING LATER Flight data shows another way that Amazon is departing from cargo companies  road map in an attempt of its top goal  rapid delivery  Using FlightAware com and similar websites  Reuters tracked the schedules of Amazon contractors and verified with airports which flights were on behalf of the retailer  Many of the company s eastbound flights leave the states of Washington and California unusually late at night  its flight from Stockton to Wilmington  Ohio departs close to 2 00 AM Pacific Time  10 00 GMT   for instance  FedEx instead schedules most eastbound service no later than 9 00 PM  5 00 GMT  to ensure arrival at its Memphis  Tennessee hub in time for sorting packages overnight  The difference is that cargo airlines stop at airport hubs so they can fill up planes easily with boxes from many origins  Amazon does this much less  But flying without a stopover is faster  helping Amazon cut shipping times from Prime s two day standard  to a day or even hours  Scheduling later departures has an advantage  too   Most people have a tendency to order packages when they re home  from work  said Brian Clancy  managing director of advisory firm Logistics Capital   Strategy LLC  Amazon is  waiting for the orders   Amazon also saves time by flying to remote locations like Lehigh Valley  which are near cities and its warehouses but have little traffic  Expectations are for Amazon to stretch well beyond Lehigh

165091,386607,FDX,Tracking The Transports,opinion,"The Dow Jones Transportation Index took a shot to the face when FedEx  NYSE FDX  announced a slow down in December  But this was a secondary punch  It had already started to move lower off of a September high  Like the rest of the market  it was already following an easier path lower  Now that it is moving higher is the drop over 
Looking at the technicals a case can be made for either direction  The chart below shows the Index completing an extended AB CD pattern in September that started off of the 2012 low  Extended because the CD leg is longer than the AB leg  This usually leads to a retracement and it has retraced over 38 2  of the pattern 

This would be a good place for a reversal to happen  It also has seen the RSI momentum indicator hit the oversold level and reverse  This is the same spot the RSI bottomed and then price reversed in 2016 and 2011  At the bottom of the chart the MACD is also at an extreme low level that was followed by a reversal in 2009  2011 and 2016 
On the other side of the story is the intermediate trend  For the short term this is just a counter trend bounce  Yes all reversals start this way but they do not all have to continue  The 2 legs lower off of the September high  with the bounces  can be seen as the first 4 waves of an impulse wave to the downside with the 5th wave still to come  A similar 3rd leg would reach the 61 8  retracement of the pattern  This is a common reversal area 
So which is it  a reversal or a pause before another leg lower

165095,386611,FDX,U S  Rep  Brady to push free trade deals with Trump administration,news,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said on Monday he will continue to promote the benefits of free trade agreements with President elect Donald Trump  including those offered under the Obama administration s Asian free trade deal 
Brady  a Republican  who described himself as a  champion of free trade   told a trade and politics forum that Trump will have to set his own priorities for trade  but these should include moves that pave the way for more U S  exports 
 I hope that he allows us to make the case that to grow our economy  it s just not enough to buy American  We have to sell American all through out the world   U S  Rep  Brady from Texas said   These trade agreements  done right  strictly enforced  level that playing field  
Trump said during a grueling campaign that he would scrap President Barack Obama s 12 country Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  trade deal  renegotiate the U S Canada Mexico North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  and take a much tougher trade stance with China  labeling it a currency manipulator on his first day in office 
Obama had hoped for a vote on TPP in the weeks following the election  but Republican leaders in Congress have torpedoed this effort  leaving TPP s fate up to Trump  who has repeatedly called the deal a  disaster  
Brady said he thought the deal could eventually be resurrected if some provisions were fixed  including clearer protections for biologic drugs patents and financial services  But Trump needs time to set his trade policy priorities  take steps to accelerate economic growth and assess the role of exports in U S  job creation 
Brady said he will emphasize that the Asia Pacific market is a critical one for U S  exporters that will be home to half the world s middle class consumers by the end of this decade and the United States needs to have equal access to its competitors 
 If we withdraw or abandon that field completely  we lose and China wins in a major way  so my advice to him will be to not to withdraw  from TPP  but to renegotiate   Brady said   Take the areas that he has real challenges with  make it better  
U S  Trade Representative Michael Froman at the same forum sponsored by Politico and FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   said that the TPP could not move forward before Trump takes office in January without congressional leaders supporting it 
Asked if TPP was dead  Froman said   I think I prefer the word purgatory  
But Froman said that USTR would continue to work on broad trade agreements to end tariffs on environmental goods as well as a separate deal liberalizing services trade ",2016-11-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/u.s.-rep.-brady-to-push-free-trade-deals-with-trump-administration-440708,440708

Addison   United Parcel  Service Inc  N UPS  engineers design custom boxes for retailers as part of a joint effort to tackle a vexing issue  the high cost of delivering e commerce packages   Online retail sales are expected to reach  392 5 billion this year  according to research firm eMarketer  but with U S  consumers now demanding free shipping on most packages  shippers and retailers are facing a squeeze   Shippers  margins are falling or stagnating  despite steady price increases  because homes are roughly three times as expensive to deliver to as business addresses  And retailers cannot pass along the cost  because they must offer free shipping in order to compete  The shared solution  design new  space saving packages that can help improve package density on delivery trucks  This cuts costs for retailers and raises margins for shippers   Up to 60 percent of requests handled by UPS s package laboratory are for smaller packages to cut shipping rates  the company told Reuters   In most cases we are able to get retailers a better rate   says Quint Marini  who runs the lab  The average rate reduction is around 20 percent  he said  Main rival FedEx Corp  N FDX  has a similar facility in Memphis  The UPS lab puts new packaging through rigorous tests  piling weights on boxes  then simulating the jolts of a delivery truck traversing a bumpy road  On a recent morning  the load was too much for a box containing a furniture shipment  spilling weights over the floor as it collapsed    If the box can t hold the weights  we ll have to fail this one   said Jonathon McWherter  a UPS engineer conducting the test   RATES UP  MARGINS NOT  The stakes are growing  E commerce shipments accounted for 46 percent of UPS s total volume last year  up from 36 percent in 2009  UPS expects the e commerce share to hit 51 percent by 2019   To counter rising costs  UPS and FedEx have raised package rates by between 4 9 percent and 5 9 percent annually since 2009  They also have levied surcharges on retailers for residential addresses and rural deliveries   Rates for a 5 pound  2 3 kg  box traveling up to 1 400 miles  2250 km  by UPS Ground or FedEx Home Delivery have nearly doubled since 2006  to  14 18  according to SJ Consulting Group  Despite the increases  profit margins at UPS and FedEx s U S  domestic business have stagnated or declined in recent years  in part because they have invested billions of dollars to handle rising volumes    See a graphic of UPS and FedEx s rates and margins here   UPS and FedEx have sought new ways to cut costs  such as dropping batches of packages at urban retailers  where customers can retrieve them  Now they are focusing more on packaging  charging a fee for design services while also levying what they call  dimensional weight  surcharges for boxes that take up too much room in relation their weight   Retailers are hemmed in by their need to match Amazon com Inc  O AMZN   The world s largest online retailer offers free shipping to customers who pay a  99 annual fee to join its Amazon Prime program   a revenue stream most retailers have not been able to replicate    Amazon has forced everybody into free shipping   said John Haber  head of logistics consultancy Spend Management Experts   Amine Khechfe  co founder of Endicia  which provides shipping services to e commerce companies  said retailers are squeezed   They ve got the pressures of free shipping  which isn t really free  and their costs are going up   he said   CONSUMERS DON T CARE WHAT IT COSTS  Many retailers have responded by procuring  on demand  packaging machines  which custom tailor shipping boxes  Hanko Kiessner  CEO of Packsize International  which makes such machines and the software that drives them  estimates 16 percent of U S  retailers are using on demand machines  and predicts a majority will do so within three years   Packaging  is now front and center and a glaring opportunity for improvement   Kiessner said  Packsize also collaborates on projects with UPS  Office supply retailer  Staples Inc   O SPLS  said it has cut the weight of corrugated cardboard it uses in packaging by 65 percent  but declined to detail the cost savings  Car accessory and electronics retailer Crutchfield Corp has saved several million dollars with on demand packaging since August 2014  chief fulfillment officer Chris Groseclose said   Companies like Monster Moto have worked with the UPS lab  The mini bike maker has cut shipping costs up to 50 percent on bikes that sell for between  249 to  749  said CEO Alex Keechle   That was a real expense to us  and because of free shipping  we had to eat it   he said  SJ Consulting founder Satish Jindel said retailers need to seek cost savings while also finding ways to pass on costs  such as minimum orders or membership fees

The market is concerned that the Fed s hawkish monetary policy could cause a US global economic slowdown in the coming days on higher borrowing costs coupled with lingering Trump trade war and European as well as US political jitters  The Eurozone EPS growth for 2018 is now being slashed to around 4 4  from earlier peak of 10  
The US market tumbled further late Wednesday on more hawkish talks by Fed s Chair Powell  commenting that the Fed will not alter its B S tapering pace in any way  As highly expected  the US Fed has hiked Wednesday unanimously its benchmark interest rate by  0 25  to  2 50  but predicted 2 more hikes in 2019 in its latest Dec dot plots against 3 hikes in the Sep dot plots

The export heavy European market was also dragged by higher EUR GBP local currency on broad weakness in the USD despite Wednesday s less dovish than expected hike by the Fed  The primary reason behind USD weakness was the US stock market plunge  risk aversion   the concern of a slowing US economy amid higher borrowing costs and increasing bond yield flattening inversion  lack of year end USD demand as a funding hedging currency and an unexpected hike by Swedish central bank  Risk Bank  form  0 50  to  0 25

Italy 40
On Thursday  Italy s FTSE MIB 40 stumbled  1 93  on renewed worries about its fiscal discipline and finances as the EC has approved the budget deficit projection of 2 04  for 2019  On Wednesday  Italian bank stocks rallied and Italian Bund yield tumbled on Italian budget truce after the EC decided against launching a disciplinary procedure against Italy over its budget and said that concessions by Italy on its budget meant the country didn t warrant triggering the excessive deficit procedure  The EC s deputy budget commissioner Dombrovskis said the agreement that had been reached would lead to an expected budget deficit next year of 2 04  compared with 2 4  of Italy s original plans 
Actually  the figure of 2 04  budget deficit is almost at mid point of the EC s target of 1 6  and Italy s ambition of 2 4   The EU EC does not want another Brexit from Italy  Italexit  and Italy is also not in a position for an exit out of the EU or face consistently higher Bund yields spreads 
Further on Italian budget drama  EC s Dombrovskis warned that the budget deal with Italy envisaging no structural deficit change is the  borderline  and Italy s 2019 GDP forecast has been revised down to  1 0  
Italy s PM Conte said   Italy safeguarded the structure of its budget  didn t give up the contents and citizen s wage  pension reform will launch at the time that was originally planned  while the number of people affected by both measures will not change  The solution reached with the EU is good for Italy  satisfactory for the EU   Conte also assured about no Italexit and said that calling into question Italy s place within the EU is not and never will be a goal for his government and he urged the EC during budget talks that his government has to safeguard social stability in Italy 
Italy s Salvini said   The EU accord will not lead to any fall in investments  government capex  in 2019 21 periods and it s now Rome s turn to look at the EU budget  will not accept any cuts to fishing  agricultural spending  
Italy s Di Maio assured political stability in Italy and said he  doesn t see clouds in the horizon for the ruling coalition  the government will press and there won t be a reshuffle  The government in January will start constitutional reform with aim of cutting a number of MPs and costs  
The Italian cabinet undersecretary and a top League official Giorgetti said   Rome sought the budget deal with the EC when it realized it could avoid sanctions while keeping the budget s two key measures  And the 2  budget deficit compromise was decent because the EC had wanted 1 6   
When Giorgetti was asked about the government promise to the EC to raise taxes in future years if needed  he was non committal and said  everyone lives for today   But Giorgetti also assured that even if League makes big gains at EU election  it will not ask for more ministers or an early election  Giorgetti also pointed out that the Italian FM Tria was  constantly acting as a brake  in government budget negotiations with the EC  while others accelerated 
Overall  it now seems that although there is some budget truce between the EC and Italy for 2019 budget deficit target projection  the EC will watch the actual implementation carefully and we could see more  war of words  and  games of chickens  for this Italian budget  Like Italy  the 2019 France budget will also be keenly watched

165122,386638,FDX,5 Transports That Could Sustain The Winning Streak In 2019,opinion,The year 2018 has been an unhappy one for transportation stocks  Transports  barring a few bright spots  have been plagued by various headwinds including high costs  weather related disruptions and political upheavals at various points of the year Due to multiple headwinds  the Zacks  sector  which includes airlines  railroads  shippers and truckers among others  has shed 23 4  value on a year to date basis  The sector s performance is worse than that of the Zacks S P 500 composite  which has declined 12  YTD Price PerformanceLet s delve into the details as to why the sector took a beating this year Oil Prices High for Majority of 2018It is a well documented fact that costs associated with oil are considered major inputs for any transportation company  A rise in oil price leads to a sharp increase in operating expenses of the sector participants  which in turn implies that the health of these stocks is inversely related to fuel cost Oil prices had displayed an uptrend till early October  increasing more than 20   The surge in oil prices was the primary reason behind the bottom lines of most transports contracting in each of the three quarters of 2018 Oil Rout Fails to Boost Transports In a stunning reversal  oil prices have been declining steadily since then and the commodity has plunged more than 40  on fears of supply glut and economic headwinds  Currently  it is hovering around  45 a barrel Even though oil price decline is favorable for transports  stock prices of sector participants have remained subdued even in the low oil price scenario  Transports have been victims of factors like U S  China trade war  Fed rate hike  Brexit related uncertainty and fears of global economic slowdown which have prevented them from taking advantage of a decline in one of their major input costs Fears of a global trade slowdown were reflected in the bearish fiscal 2019 guidance provided by one of the major players in the sector   FedEx Corporation   NYSE FDX     while releasing its second quarter fiscal 2019  ended Nov 30  2018  results Oil price volatility apart  high labor costs limited bottom line growth of transports in 2018  Technical glitches  labor strife  driver shortages and foul weather have also hurt profitability of sector participants in 2018 Not All Brickbats  Some Roses TooDespite the presence of the above mentioned headwinds  the sector did have some positives this year  For instance  freight activity has been robust in the United States this year as highlighted by the fact that the Cass Freight Shipments Index has expanded on a year over year basis in each of the  first 11 months of 2018 Additionally  the current tax law  which came into effect late last year  is a huge positive for transports  Lower tax related outflow enabled them to undertake shareholder friendly activities this year  As an evidence  the likes of Norfolk Southern Corporation   NYSE NSC   hiked dividend payouts this year  Moreover  strong demand for air travel had been a boon for airlines What s in Store for 2019 We expect oil prices to remain volatile in 2019  However  factors like strong travel demand and an impressive freight scenario should work in favor of transports in the coming year  Reduced tax ratesshould continue to boostcash flow  Huge savings

165131,386647,FDX,NY authorities seek  872 million fine on UPS for cigarette shipments,news,"By Nathan Layne  Reuters    New York city and state authorities urged a federal judge on Wednesday to impose a fine of  872 million against  United Parcel  Service  NYSE UPS  for allegedly delivering untaxed cigarettes from smoke shops on Indian reservations  The closing arguments came in a lawsuit over whether UPS illegally shipped more than 683 000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes  mostly from reservation smoke shops  The lawsuit is part of a broader effort by the state to combat smuggling of cigarettes from lower tax areas  UPS has denied the allegations  It said in a statement the company is  vigorously  fighting the case and believes the state and city are overreaching and attempting to levy  outrageous penalties  without justification   John Oleske  a lawyer for the state  told U S  District Judge Katherine Forrest that a stiff penalty was justified because UPS acted with  an entitled sense of disregard  for the law in failing to vet shipments from entities on the reservations with a history of dealing in contraband   Oleske also argued that a large fine was needed to act as a deterrent for a company that had  4 84 billion in net profit last year   The state and city have brought a similar lawsuit against UPS rival FedEx Corp  N FDX  that is pending   Lawyers for UPS are scheduled to make closing arguments later on Wednesday  Forrest questioned the state s and city s arguments  including how to reconcile evidence that the bulk of some shipments were cigars instead of cigarettes   She also asked whether the authorities were not  double counting  by seeking damages for violations of both a 2005 agreement between the state and UPS governing its compliance with cigarette deliveries and a 2010 law creating new regulations for carriers of cigarettes    The law allows for the stacking of all of these penalties for all of these violations   Oleske said  arguing the judge should also appoint a monitor to police UPS s compliance    The court should stack and max out all those penalties    According to the lawsuit  the deliveries to residences  unlicensed wholesalers and unlicensed retailers were made despite a 2005 agreement between UPS and New York in which the company agreed to stop cigarette shipments to consumers and unlicensed dealers

165149,386665,FDX,Oil Adds To Fed Intrigue,opinion,"The collapse in oil prices resumed on Tuesday with prices now down 40  since October and 13  over the past three trading days  The New Zealand dollar was the top performer while the Canadian dollar lagged  The Fed decision looms  A new Premium trade ahead of the Fed decision was issued before the close of the NY session  The image below is the statement from the September rate hike  noting possible changes as a means of dovishness 

We highlighted the fall below  50 in WTI as a key technical support breakdown  noting that it left little support until  42 05  It appears to be headed in that direction in a hurry with prices down  4 Tuesday to  45 91 as global growth fears mount  The market is voting that OPEC hasn t done enough and U S  inventories unexpectedly grew in the API report late Tuesday 
Risk trades in the currency market made some minor headway Tuesday but there was still plenty to be disappointed about  The S P 500 had been comfortably higher but finished flat  After the close  FedEx  NYSE FDX  cut its profit forecast on slower global growth and that rattled sentiment  They pointed to soft business outside of the US and weakness in Europe in particular 
The drop in oil is an added wrinkle for the Fed and may help to give them cover for an immediate pause or a dovish signal such as the reference to inflation mentioned in the image above  With Wednesday s decision looming the odds of a hike are down to just 64   setting this up as one of the most uncertain meetings in two years  Through 2019  there s only a 35  chance of another hike 
What the vanilla pricing doesn t show is tail risk  The market is understandably jittery right now and the modest pricing for Fed hikes in 2019 doesn t capture the risk   however minor   that the Fed could stubbornly continue to forecast and signal hikes 
At the same time  the Fed is limited in exactly how it can send signals  There will be no line in the statement saying  we re going to pause  and the Fed will want to retain some flexibility if markets rebound  The drop in oil is certainly deflationary and the Fed could argue that it also puts downward pressure on inflation expectations  This and trade worries could tilt the balance of risks to the negative side  A number of dissents in favor of no hike would also send a dovish message  as could the dot plot or something in Powell s press conference 
If the decides to immediately pause  it s not entirely clear that risk trades will jump  If the Fed isn t careful about the wording  the message could be interpreted as the Fed seeing a quicker slowdown in the economy 
Keep a close watch on gold  It s testing the December high and a surprise pause or dovish message would send it higher  There is also a strong seasonal tailwind early in the year ",2018-12-19,Ashraf Laidi,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-adds-to-fed-intrigue-200369445,200369445
165151,386667,FDX,FOMC Day  S P 500 Must Hold February  18 Low Of 2 532,opinion,"The S P 500 must hold 2 532 or the February 9th  2018 low today and the rest of the week 
What s interesting is that as the S P 500 has toyed with this level this week  the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond  NYSE AGG  or the bond market equivalent of the S P 500  is bumping against its 200 day moving average 

Here is a good chart from Gary Morrow  who contributes to the  This Week on Wall Street  blog  Morrow is an excellent technician    garysmorrow  
The point is   like the S P 500 hovering around 2 532   the Aggregate is at a key technical level as well as we await the single most important FOMC announcement since   well   maybe  December  15 
Summary   Conclusion  ON FedEx s conference call last night  the remainder of 2019 guidance was not good  Brexit and whatever is happening with Italy has clearly slowed Europe  China s growth appears to be slowing as well as trade talks are taking their toll  and this will eventually come home to roost in slowing US GDP  FedEx  NYSE FDX  refused to give revenue guidance for the last two quarters of fiscal  19  which ends in May for the freight giant  Maybe they were talking calendar  19 too  It sounded too like the US Christmas season is robust  but the majority of the weakness was non US 
So what does the Fed FOMC do today  
The S P 500 s trading action is like December of 2000  back then though it was Jack Welch at GE  which was still an industrial titan  declaring that Greenspan was behind the curve 
Per a couple of headlines whose source I can t recall  this is supposedly the worst December return for the S P 500 since the Great Depression 
That s not good 
My own guess is   and take this with a considerable amount of salt   is that the FOMC raises 25 bp s to 2 50  fed funds and then Jay Powell prostrates himself before the business media and business community and says  no more for now  
The fact is there is very little inflation almost 10 years into a US economic recovery 
The Johnson Redbook said that retail sales rose 7 1  y y  thank you  HoranCapitalAdv  yesterday  jobless claims fell sharply last week  a sign of economic strength  and the Services Purchasing Mgr s Survey  80  of the US economy  is still strong 
The US is seeing decent  non inflationary growth

165152,386668,FDX,FedEx Stock Is In Free Fall  Is There A Bottom ,opinion,"FedEx  NYSE FDX  stock is plunging sharply after the company slashed profit targets and announced broad cost cutting measures  The share price is down almost 41  from its all time high of  273 66 reached in January  when everything looked so rosy  What happened 
Many experts would argue that the market finally realized that FedEx is not what it once was  The company s fundamentals have been deteriorating in recent years  debt has been piling on and free cash flow has turned negative 
It is not a secret that market prices can move in the opposite direction of the fundamentals for a considerable amounts of time  FedEx is the latest example  However  knowing this did not help investors prepare for the imminent bearish reversal in the stock  The Elliott Wave Principle did  as proven by the chart below  published in mid 2017 
 While FedEx stock was trading above  215 a share in June 2017  its weekly chart revealed a troubling picture  The uptrend from the 2009 bottom had taken the shape of a five wave impulse  whose wave  5  was approaching to its end 
The Wave theory states that a three wave correction follows every impulse  so it made sense to expect a major decline as soon as wave  5  ends  In addition  the company s performance has been worsening  so caution was advised not only from the technical  but from the fundamental point of view  as well  The two methods of analysis do not always reach the same conclusion  but when they do  it is worth paying attention 
Picking tops is never worth the risk and FedEx is just another example of that fact  The bulls managed to keep the uptrend alive for another  60 per share until they reached the vicinity of  275 in January  2018  However  they could not defy gravity forever and eventually made way for the bears  who cut the stock price almost in half in less than 12 months  In the end  investors who ignored the Elliott Wave warnings and kept buying only increased their losses 
The bad news is FDX s woes are unlikely to go away any time soon  The support of wave  4  near  120 a share looks like a reasonable target for wave A of the larger A B C zigzag correction we believe is now in progress  Given the bad shape of the company and the bigger picture Elliott Wave outlook  we would not be surprised if this bear market erases all of the post 2009 gains 
In conclusion  it looks like there is still no bottom in sight for FedEx stock  Long term bearish targets near  40 a share are plausible  which means the company can lose another 75  of its market cap from current levels  FDX may be down by 40  already  but it remains a very dangerous possession

165153,386669,FDX,S P 500  So Much For A Santa Rally,opinion,"The last few months have been hard on stock market bulls  to put it lightly 
Only three short months ago  the S P 500 was trading up by 10  on the year  on track for its 10th straight positive year on a total return basis  Now  the index is trading down by nearly 8  on the year  excluding dividends  and down a staggering 16  from the late September high  In fact  the S P 500 has shed 11 5  of its value over just the last 12 trading days alone 
What s Changed 
Certain politically motivated analysts will no doubt point out that the market s latest drop kicked off on the same day President Trump tweeted that he was a  tariff man   and it s certainly true that global trade tensions are taking a toll on global economic growth  Of course  other analysts  and surely the president himself  will highlight that stocks are down nearly 5  from Wednesday afternoon s Federal Reserve meeting  where Fed Chairman Powell raised interest rates and refused to consider tweaking the central bank s balance sheet program 
At the end of the day  though  earnings are what drives the stock market and as the tailwind from last year s massive tax cut bill fades  expectations for earnings growth are coming down as the post GFC economic recovery reaches its 10th year  As the earnings mavens at FactSet note   estimated earnings for the fourth quarter have fallen by 3 2  since September 30  This percentage decline is larger than the 5 year average   3 1   for a quarter   Perhaps more importantly for forward looking traders  analysts have been slashing their growth expectations for 2019  with expectations of just 5 6  annualized earnings growth through the first three quarters of next year

As the above graphic shows  these expectations are down sharply from analysts  expectations in October  and concerningly  they show no sign of forming a meaningful bottom yet  While the few companies that have reported Q4 earnings so far have seen generally decent results  with the notable exception of concerning results out of FedEx  NYSE FDX   markets will have to wait for the new year before growing more optimistic on an earnings based stabilization in stocks 
S P 500 Technicals
The chart of the S P 500 shows how damaging the recent drop has been for US stocks  Two weeks ago  bulls could argue that the index hadn t yet made a meaningful  lower low  and was holding above the support levels from the first half of the year  Now  however  the index has sliced through all of those support levels  clearing the way for a further drop toward the Q3 2017 lows in the 2400 2420 region  Below there  bears may target the lows around 2300 or the mid 2250s 
The RSI indicator shows that prices are in oversold territory  raising the prospect of a possible bounce in the coming days  but with the MACD trending lower below both its signal line and the  0  level  the trend remains definitively bearish  In the short term  bears will likely look to sell any bounces back toward the 2500 level  with bulls on the defensive unless the S P 500 can climb back above 2600

165155,386671,FDX,Is The State of FedEx Indicative of An Imminent Recession,opinion,"What FedEx  NYSE FDX  Had to Say in Their Most Recent Earnings ReportFedEx released its quarterly earnings this past Monday alongside forecasts for 2019 s fiscal year  Those forecasts reflected a far weaker company than analysts previously anticipated 
  2019 earnings guidance fell into a range of  15 50    16 60  which is down from the  17 20 to  17 80 predicted last quarter  Analysts were in the middle range of FedEx s original forecast at  17 33 per share   Top and bottom lines were more positive  with FedEx reporting earnings of  4 03 a share  which was better than the  3 94 predicted by analysts   The company also beat revenue expectations  reporting  17 8 billion  safely above the  17 75 billion predicted by analysts 
If you re just looking at those numbers  things don t look so bad  but the earnings report as a whole is what has people concerned  In addition  the company s blaming its problems on the trade war  and that time line just doesn t add up  Especially after their significant drop on Wednesday 
FedEx s Status As An Economic Bellwether Sparks Fear 
As if that news wasn t bad enough  what really has market analysts concerned is how fast those projected numbers for 2019 changed  In the span of a single quarter  a mere 3 months ago  FedEx was anticipating global growth and had to turn around this quarter and report an entirely different anticipated fiscal year  That means that the economy has slowed to such a significant degree that FedEx felt the need to dramatically revise their forecast 
Per the company Morgan Stanley s analyst Ravi Shanker  the cuts are  jarring  and that a  severe global recession  could lead to an  ongoing deceleration in global trade near term  
He continued on to say   We recognize that global growth has slowed but we are very surprised by the magnitude of the headwind  which is what might be seen in a severe recession  We believe global growth concerns are also likely to get worse before they get better next year  which could mean more of a drag on FY20 EPS  
Certainly the trade war hasn t helped matters  but it can t be blamed entirely for FedEx s dramatic change in fortune  Economic growth is slowing at a rate far greater than anyone anticipated 
Despite All That  Technical Indicators  and Fundamentals  Are Looking UpFedEx shares have plummeted this past month  crashing down through the  182 89 support and leveling out at around  165 per share  This has nullified more than two years of investor gains 

That support was set back in 2017 and FedEx s fall below it has left the company in dire straits  setting investors to panic  That being said  with prices as low as they are  there are still indications that a bounce back is in sight just in time for Christmas ",2018-12-20,Bill Poulos,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-state-of-fedex-indicative-of-an-imminent-recession-200369986,200369986

165159,386675,FDX,Wall Street rallies after Fed stands pat on rates,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf
 Reuters    Wall Street racked up gains on Wednesday after the U S  Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged  for now leaving intact the low rate environment that has helped underpin the bull market 
The Nasdaq closed at a record high 
The central bank strongly signaled it could still tighten monetary policy by the end of this year as the labor market improved further 
Earlier on Wednesday  global markets reacted to the Bank of Japan s abrupt shift to targeting interest rates on government bonds to achieve its elusive inflation target 
Traders generally had not expected the Fed to raise rates  with bets before the meeting of only an 18 percent chance of a hike  according to the CME FedWatch website 
 There was just a little bit of doubt in everybody s mind that maybe they would go ahead and raise rates now and that got cleared up     people felt free to put some money into equities   said Peter Tuz  president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville  Virginia 
 Couple that with the BOJ lower for longer news story from earlier today and the equity market is doing well   Tuz said 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 163 74 points  or 0 9 percent  to 18 293 7  the S P 500 gained 23 36 points  or 1 09 percent  to 2 163 12 and the Nasdaq Composite added 53 83 points  or 1 03 percent  to 5 295 18 
All 11 major S P sectors finished in positive territory  Energy shares were the best performing sector  up 2 1 percent  as oil prices rose 
Concerns over whether the Fed would raise rates prompted a return of volatility to the stock market in recent weeks after two months of calm  For the year  the benchmark S P 500 is up 5 8 percent 
The Fed has held its target rate for overnight lending between banks in a range of 0 25 percent to 0 50 percent since December  when it raised borrowing costs for the first time in nearly a decade 
 We are in a pretty good environment for stocks with low interest rates and companies beginning to show signs of life although the earnings aren t as robust as we d like to see   said Alan Rechtschaffen  portfolio manager at UBS in New York   When you are comparing things to the low interest rates we have  things can look attractive that wouldn t look attractive in a normal interest rate environment  
Fed Chair Janet Yellen  speaking after the central bank s latest policy statement  said U S  growth was looking stronger and rate increases would be needed to keep the economy from overheating and fuelling high inflation 
After the Fed s statement  traders were betting on a 63 percent chance of a December rate increase  up from 58 percent just before the statement  according to the FedWatch website 
 The body language makes it sound like they re warming people up for December   said Stephen Massocca  chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management in San Francisco

165160,386676,FDX,Volkswagen faces bumpy road in challenge to  micro union ,news,"By Daniel Wiessner and Bernie Woodall  Reuters    Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  has joined other large companies and a chorus of business groups and Republican lawmakers in challenging a union strategy of organizing splinter groups of workers  but experts say recent court decisions approving the tactic suggest it is here to stay  The German automaker s U S  subsidiary earlier this month brought a case in a Washington  D C  based federal appeals court seeking to overturn a vote by a group of skilled trade workers at its Chattanooga  Tennessee  assembly plant to join the United Auto Workers  UAW    The dispute is a high profile test of whether unions  which have struggled to reverse a long slide in private sector membership  can seek new members by targeting smaller groups  rather than organizing whole plants or companies as in the past   Every appeals court to consider a case under a standard backed by the National Labor Relations Board  NLRB  has sided with unions  including five this year  Those cases have involved fragrance and cosmetic department workers at a Macy s store and FedEx  NYSE FDX  drivers whose unions exclude the people who load their trucks  among others   Companies and business groups say that what they derisively call  micro unions  threaten to balkanize workplaces and pit groups of workers against each other  They say the standard used to approve the units tilts too far in favor of unions   This makes it almost inevitable that any union target will eventually be organized   said David French  the vice president of the National Retail Federation  which has warned that smaller bargaining units could be particularly harmful to retailers  With court losses piling up  the business lobby is backing a stalled effort by Republicans in Congress to reinstate a previous  more business friendly standard for scrutinizing proposed units of workers  COMMUNITY OF INTEREST The concept of organizing small bargaining groups within a larger operation is not new  but got a lift from the NLRB in a 2011 case involving a unit of certified nursing assistants at an Alabama nursing home   Under the standard set by the agency in that case  employers that want to block a  micro union  must show workers excluded from a unit share an  overwhelming community of interest  with those who unionized  and so were unfairly left out  In some cases  unions may have avoided including those workers because a majority of workers oppose unionizing  The UAW in 2014 lost a close vote to unionize more than 1 300 employees across Volkswagen s Chattanooga plant before winning last year by focusing on 150 skilled trade workers  Volkswagen spokesman Scott Neal Wilson said the company has a  longstanding belief in the right of all of our employees to decide the question of union representation as one group   The company declined to further discuss its case  In filings with the NLRB  the automaker argued that the agency s standard for reviewing bargaining units was vague and difficult to apply on a case by case basis  Volkswagen urged the board to abandon or at least clarify the standard  saying it was so broad it could  be manipulated to fit virtually any unit the union seeks   If the Volkswagen unit stands  it could provide a path to organize Nissan and Mercedes workers in Mississippi and Alabama  where the union has struggled for decades  UAW President Dennis Williams said in an interview  Local union chapters are best situated to decide what tactic works at a particular plant  Williams said  but what has become clear is that the law supports the UAW s ability to split up workers   You can do that in skilled trades  you can do that in production  you can do that in technical  you can do that in engineering   he said  Nearly a dozen labor lawyers  union officials and legal experts told Reuters that Volkswagen is likely to lose its closely watched case in light of the recent appeals court decisions  They also noted that the D C  Circuit has a growing reputation for deferring to federal agencies  And the court  which will likely consider Volkswagen s appeal next year  has indirectly backed the idea of small bargaining units  In 2008  three years before the NLRB laid out its new standard  the court approved a unit of stagehands for the Blue Man Group that excluded some of their coworkers  using strikingly similar language to that later adopted by the board    Volkswagen s chances are extremely slim   said Charlotte Garden  a professor and labor law expert at Seattle University School of Law  POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT Meanwhile  business interests are trying to get Congress to change the law  A number of trade groups are backing a bill by Republicans in the U S  House and Senate that would reinstate a previous standard  The bill has stalled  as Republicans are unlikely to be able to override a presidential veto  but could win new momentum if the party makes significant gains in November elections  Just because courts have sided with the NLRB doesn t mean  micro unions  are a good idea  said Phillip Wilson  president of the Labor Relations Institute  a right to work advocacy group  If an employer is planning layoffs  for example  a larger unit with more members may not put up a fight if it can ensure most of the pink slips go to workers in other  smaller units   It hurts the members and it also can be very disruptive to the company   Wilson said  Courts that have signed off on smaller bargaining units have ruled federal law favors unions  proposed bargaining units as long as they are appropriate  Ensuring workplace peace is not a requirement of the law  said William Gould  a professor at Stanford Law School who was the NLRB s chairman under President Bill Clinton   To the extent that you balkanize the workforce  you have the potential for more conflict   he said   But that simply does not determine whether a unit is appropriate

165184,386700,FDX,FedEx Warns Of Global Slowdown  Expect More Warnings,opinion,"After hours  FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  warned of a global slowdown and slashed its global forecast 
FedEx still insists the economy is solid  but it slashed its forecast due to a Global Trade Slowdown 

FedEx Corp on Tuesday slashed its 2019 forecast after Europe s economy weakened and the U S  trade row exacerbated a slowdown in China  sending shares in the package delivery company tumbling more than 6 percent after the closing bell 
 Global trade has slowed in recent months and leading indicators point to ongoing deceleration   said FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf 
FedEx  which is in the throes of a record setting winter holiday shipping season  launched a new cost cutting campaign after its Express revenues took a hit  On Dec  7  FedEx announced that the CEO of its Express unit was retiring at year end 
Memphis  Tennessee based FedEx cut its fiscal 2019 earnings forecast to  15 50 to  16 60 per share from  17 20 to  17 80 per share   before year end mark to market retirement plan accounting adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration expenses 
The new forecast assumes moderate U S  domestic economic growth and no further weakening in international economic conditions  FedEx said 

Forecast Assumes No Further Weakening
Yeah right 
The economy is anything but solid 
Earning s Forecast
The FedEx Earnings Forecast is amusing  Nasdaq has not yet adjusted its model to reality 
Rest assured more warnings are coming 
Forward PEs based on lofty estimates may look attractive  but they aren t 
Expect more warnings  everywhere  piece by piece as FedEx is doing now

165185,386701,FDX,Opening Bell  Futures  Euro Stocks Bounce Ahead Of Fed  Oil Selloff Eases,opinion,"US futures  European shares rebound after Asian weakness
Oil selloff eases
US stock rebound fails as bears push back bulls
VIX hits highest close since February

Key Events
Hopes that a dovish Fed would infuse confidence in growth boosted futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 as well as European shares  which edged higher this morning  after a mixed Asian session  The oil selloff  which had sent shockwaves across global markets  also eased 
The STOXX Europe 600 climbed 0 28  at the open  with banks and pharmaceutical companies leading the gains  after a three day rout sent prices to a near two year low and shaved 12 06 percent of value off the pan European benchmark  Bulls temporarily found resistance as bears increased supply  paring gains to 0 15 percent  but the index then resumed its climb to about 0 46 percent in the late European morning 
The pharmaceutical sector was boosted by a 5 7  jump in GlaxoSmithKline  LON GSK   after the British multinational drug maker announced a joint venture with Pfizer s  NYSE PFE  consumer health division as well as plans to split into two businesses  one dedicated to prescription drugs and vaccines  the other arm focused on over the counter products 
During the earlier Asian session  most regional stocks ended lower  after disappointing Japanese trade data added to traders  defensiveness ahead of the Federal Reserve s interest rate decision  Falling energy shares  fueled by oil price jitters also contributed to the selling  Japan s Nikkei slipped 0 60 percent lower  China s Shanghai Composite tumbled 1 05   weighed down by a rout in healthcare stocks due to concerns of a new drug procurement policy  Also  Softbank s  T 9984  telecom unit slid 15 percent below the price of its IPO the world s second largest after Alibaba s  NYSE BABA foray into the public market an underwhelming debut 
Global Financial Affairs

Yesterday  US stocks failed an attempt to rally from a 14 month low on increased volatility  ending the session mostly unchanged  The S P 500 closed flat    0 01   after a 0 55  higher opening in line with upbeat futures trading and intraday swings between a 1 1 percent advance and a 0 68 percent drop 
However  bulls may focus on the fact that yesterday s failed rally was not part of the preceding three day selloff  which was driven by fears over the end of economic expansion in the US  due to rising rates  the ongoing US China trade war and a slowing global economy  Rather  yesterday s decline was due to slumping oil prices  which dragged Energy shares 2 36 percent lower  Losses in the second worst performing sector  Consumer Staples  were more contained   1 18   
It s important to note that oil prices are not falling in a vacuum  They are part of a broader narrative that pivots around expectations of an economic slowdown  which would reduce demand for black gold 
In general  a failed rally is a negative indicator  It reveals that even when bulls attempted to stage an offensive  bears didn t yield to pressure but instead fought back 

In another indication of pessimism  the VIX closed at the highest level since February 
To make things worse  logistics giant FedEx  NYSE FDX  provided softer guidance due to global trade headwinds  The company s stock sank 6 percent in the aftermarket and was trading around the same level in the premarket despite beating expectations of  3 94 earnings per share   4 03  and of  17 75 billion revenue   17 8 billions   The global delivery service joined the many other companies whose executives lowered forward guidance on concerns over the effect of the ongoing US China trade war 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0 35 percent  The NASDAQ Composite outperformed climbing 0 45  and the Russell 2000 eked out a 0 03 percent gain 

Investors  however  were primarily focusing on bond markets ahead of today s expected fourth rate hike of the year  The yield on 10 year Treasuries opened lower  at 2 8 percent  but soon rebounded to 2 819  slightly above yesterday s 2 818 close  Last week bonds completed a top  whose span goes back to February 
Italian bonds jumped on speculation the European Commission will agree to a budget deal  The yield on benchmark Japanese notes slipped to near 0 percent before posting a rapid turnaround as the surge in demand triggered a margin call 
The dollar fell for a third day against most major currencies 

Speculation that risk sentiment is improving helped oil prices rebound from a third day selloff over worries of oversupply and an end to global growth 
Overall  today s Fed meeting seems to be having an unusually large impact on markets  most probably due to its crucial timing  equity markets are on the verge of a top as fears mount over an economic slowdown  US President Donald Trump s continued campaign against the Fed s tightening path probably exacerbates the impact of any decision 
Up Ahead

The Fed wraps up its final policy meeting of 2018 today  The rate decision will be followed by a press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell 
The Bank of Japan s monetary policy decision is due on Thursday  followed by a briefing from Governor Haruhiko Kuroda  A Bank of England decision is also coming up on Thursday

165212,386728,FDX,Will S P 500 Earnings Roll Over  Or Will The S P 500 Rally From Here  ,opinion,"That is the whole dynamic in one simple sentence 
2019 S P 500 earnings expectations have been expecting slower growth for some time but now that expected earnings growth for next year has been reduced to 8  
Transports look ugly  made more so by the action in XPO  NYSE XPO   the trucking firm  FedEx  NYSE FDX  and UPS are through their 200 week moving averages  which is typically a good place to buy a beaten down sector   Just started building a position in FDX this week  
During the 2015   2016 correction there were more than a few similarities to today s correction 
1   China weakness and a devalued yuan and strong dollar were seem through the summer  fall of 2015 
2   Crude oil was still in the process of correction from its 2014 peak near  90  ultimately ending up bottoming at  28 in Feb 16 
3   Banks and Transports were ugly then  as they are now  Transports saw no benefit from the drop in crude then or now 
4   The big difference between the two corrections is that Tech stayed relatively strong and didn t correct until January  16 and then came apart in the 5 week period just prior to the Feb  16 market bottom 
FedEx reports next week  and here is what worries me a little  or a lot   Hopefully Seeking Alpha doesn t mind but I wrote this FedEx earnings preview last weekend and just since publication of this article on Monday  December 10th  here is how FDX s EPS estimates have changed 
2021   22 76 to  22 57
2020   20 16 to  20 04
2019   17 40 to  17 36
It doesn t look like much but the numbers are coming down in front of the release  for a company that is a pretty effective  tell  for the US economy  Still as the article details  the stock is probably undervalued coming into earnings and unless estimates fall off a cliff  the price discounts a lot of issues with the sector 
Summary   conclusion  The very bearish AAII sentiment data released this morning is preventing too many changes from made right now  The action in the Industrial and Transport sectors   not to mention the banks   is downright depressing  As was written on this blog this weekend  the SP 500 earnings data   when looking at both Q4  18 and 2019   has been pretty stable  Maybe that changes shortly  I still think this is a normal correction in an ongoing bull market

165215,386731,FDX,Bears Prowling  New Lows For 2018 As Concerns Roll Into New Week,opinion," Monday Market Close  Meet the new week  Same as the old week 
A sell off that rolled into the weekend picked up pace Monday  taking all the major U S  indices to 2  losses for the second straight session and setting a new 2018 closing low for the S P 500 Index  SPX   The storyline didn t change much from Friday  with investors still apparently squeamish about slowing overseas economic prospects and chances of a rate hike from the Fed later this week 
Though the SPX remains a long way from entering an official bear market  down 20  from the high   it is down 13  from the year s closing peak  and all of the FAANG stocks that helped drive momentum earlier this year are in bear territory 
If you like slasher movies  this might be the market for you  with bleeding in every sector  Even so called  defensive  neighborhoods like utilities took a dive on Monday  There s also a mess in the commodity pits  where crude crumbled to close below  50 a barrel for the first time in over a year  Another industrial commodity  copper  fell too 
Meanwhile  volatility spiked close to 15  as measured by the VIX  which rose back toward levels near 25 seen during the October sell off 
What s Going On 
One frustrating thing about the current market is its unpredictability  On a day when 10 year yields fell back toward 2 85  from last week s highs above 2 91   you d think that dividend stocks like utilities might be having a banner session  But nope  They were down more than 3   among the worst performers of the day  And even though bonds saw some buyers as risk averse action continued to dominate  Treasuries have barely budged in the last week 
At the same time  a few of the biggest banks were flat to even up slightly Monday  and financials were one of the best performing sectors  Normally when rates are down  people sell financials  But not so much on Monday 
This is a conundrum  The rules seem out of whack  and day to day that can make it very difficult to figure out what s happening in this market  Things that would normally go down amid current fundamentals hold steady  and things that normally would go up get slammed 
Orderly March Downward
As ugly as things have gotten  the selling still seems orderly  What does that mean  It means there s probably no sign of a real panic  which would likely be the case if we saw aggressive selling of stocks and buying of risk off products like bonds  gold  and the VIX  This hasn t been a true  dump  of stocks  and there hasn t been a major spike in volatility 
What might be happening is that many investors who bought the dip the first time the market went down back in October didn t benefit  and now they re apparently not so willing to buy the next dip  It looks like many investors are willing to own stocks for now  but the question is whether at some point they start to throw up their hands and panic 
Also  there s some technical stuff to consider keeping in mind  The SPX managed to close just a touch under the psychological 2600 mark last week  but then fell through technical support below that at 2570 by late Monday  That set up a test of 2530  just under the intraday low for the year of 2532 posted back in February 
By late Monday  the SPX had fallen below 2532 to set a new low for the year before swinging up slightly to end the day  Some analysts say there might be a gap in support below 2530 that extends down to near the 2400 level  which is a long way to fall  Such a drop would put the SPX within a couple of percentage points of falling into bear territory for the first time since the 2008 09 economic crisis  That means 2530 could remain the level to watch when trading starts Tuesday 
Aiming Low 
With the SPX down close to 5  for the year and facing a possible annual loss for the first time since 2015  the question might be whether the market is baking in too negative a forward outlook  Here s why  In 2015  as the SPX fell just under 1  for the full year  earnings were also on the decline 
In what analysts then called an  earnings recession   quarterly S P 500 earnings fell the final three quarters of 2015  with a worse than 3  year over year performance in Q4  Things are a lot different now  The market is falling  but earnings have generally been impressive all year  They ve risen more than 20  the last two quarters  and many analysts still expect mid teens growth for Q4  Looking into 2019  the picture weakens  but it s still not an earnings  recession  if current estimates of mid to high single digit earnings growth don t fall 
However  as an analyst on CNBC noted Monday  the SPX is behaving now as if there s not going to be any earnings growth at all next year  The forward 12 month price to earnings ratio now stands at about 15  according to Factset  barely above the 10 year average  which includes the depths of the 2008 09 economic crisis   and down from 18 or higher earlier this year  So either the market is right and earnings next year have farther to fall  or the market is aiming too low  meaning you could argue the SPX is underpriced at current levels  This is a debate that s not going to be decided anytime soon  but could make for interesting viewing as the new year rolls in 
Data and Fed Watch
From a U S  data perspective  things continue to look pretty good  though Monday s Empire Manufacturing number for December came in well under expectations  Some of the interest rate sensitive sectors like cars and housing continue to come under pressure  but wages and job growth still look strong even while inflation remains manageable  The only thing is  jobs and wages are sometimes seen by economists as trailing indicators  meaning they can be the last statistics to go up in a rising economy 
There are a couple of things particularly relevant to this week that investors might want to keep in mind  First  there s earnings from a bunch of companies  including Oracle  NYSE ORCL   FedEx  NYSE FDX   and Nike  NYSE NKE   There s also quadruple witching on Friday  marking the simultaneous expiry of stock index futures  stock index options  stock options   single stock futures  This can result in volatility as traders unwind positions 
Also  many hedge funds and traders are measured this week in terms of bonuses  so they may be unloading any positions they have that are still up for the year 
All of this pales in comparison to the Fed meeting that starts Tuesday and ends Wednesday  As the sell off advanced Monday  chances of a hike fell to just below 70   from 76  to start the week  according to the futures market  Those are still relatively high odds  but the Fed could be coming under pressure to delay  An op ed today in The Wall Street Journal co written by Kevin Warsh  a former member of the Fed s Board of Governors  warned the Fed to take note of slowing overseas economic growth  softening credit markets  and falling commodity prices  It was titled   Fed Tightening  Not Now  

Figure 1  Technical Points to Ponder  The breakout to the downside has many chart watchers eyeing possible levels of technical support  Today s low in the S P 500 Index  SPX  of 2530 eclipsed the February low of 2532  but a bit of end of day support kept the SPX from a settlement at a new low  Looking beyond that level to the downside  some point to the night of the 2016 election  when a head fake break down to 2083 turned to breakout rally that seemed to be a one way train until it derailed in February 2018  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results

165233,386749,FDX,FDX Vs  UPS  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo stocks are likely familiar with FedEx  FDX  and United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
FedEx has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while United Parcel Service has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that FDX s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
FDX currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 11  while UPS has a forward P E of 14 44  We also note that FDX has a PEG ratio of 0 87  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  UPS currently has a PEG ratio of 1 56 
Another notable valuation metric for FDX is its P B ratio of 2 65  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  UPS has a P B of 28 69 
Based on these metrics and many more  FDX holds a Value grade of B  while UPS has a Value grade of C 
FDX has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than UPS  so it seems like value investors will conclude that FDX is the superior option right now ",2018-12-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fdx-vs-ups-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200367045,200367045
165234,386750,FDX,FedEx  FDX  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects FedEx  FDX  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This package delivery company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  27 4  
Revenues are expected to be  17 75 billion  up 8 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 88  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FedEx 
For FedEx  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 82  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FedEx will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that FedEx would post earnings of  3 78 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 46  delivering a surprise of  8 47  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
FedEx doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fedex-fdx-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200367090,200367090

165248,386764,FDX,Department of Justice drops charges vs  FedEx in online pharmacy case,news,"Investing com    FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  announced on Friday afternoon that the U S  Department of Justice has dismissed all remaining criminal charges pending against the company  signifying the conclusion of a two year internet pharmacy case  
The announcement provides vindication for the major shipping company  which maintained its innocence through a two year ordeal in which FedEx faced up to  1 6 billion in fines for money laundering and conspiracy related to its assistance with drug deliveries for rogue online pharmacies  As part of the charges  FedEx was accused of accepting payments from several pharmacies when several senior managers from the company allegedly knew that the pharmacies supplied drugs to their customers without prescriptions  At a pre trial hearing in late May  U S  district judge Charles Breyer expressed skepticism that prosecutors had sufficient proof that FedEx intended for the drugs to be distributed illegally  
Lawyers for FedEx argued that it was the government s burden to inform the company which pharmacies had acted illegally  
 FedEx is and has always been innocent   said Patrick Fitzgerald  Senior Vice President  Marketing and Communications  FedEx  in a statement   The case should never have been brought  The government should take a very hard look at how they made the tremendously poor decision to file these charges  Many companies would not have had the courage or the resources to defend themselves against false charges  The power of the government was greatly misused when the case was initiated  but the government s integrity was redeemed by the decision to dismiss the charges today  
In 2013  UPS agreed to forfeit  40 million to the Justice Department for payments the company received from online pharmacies shipping illegal prescriptions  Two major pharmacy chains  CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  NASDAQ WBA  have also paid settlements amounting to  150 million combined in recent years to resolve charges that they sold prescriptions which did not have an actual therapeutic use  
FedEx remains committed to its long standing cooperation with law enforcement authorities to prevent misuse of its transportation networks  the company said in a statement

165267,386783,FDX,A post Fed Dow turns positive for 2016 as dollar sinks,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks traded broadly higher on Thursday and the Dow managed to achieve gains for 2016 a day after the Fed decided to make no move on rates and showed a dovish stance for the removal of accommodative policy even as oil continued its rally  with West Texas breaking  40  and while the dollar sank against major currency rivals 
At 16 35GMT or 12 35ET  the Dow 30 rose 140 points  or 0 81   while the S P 500 advanced 14 points  or 0 67   and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite gained 10 points  or 0 22  
Despite the evident weakness in the greenback as the dollar slipped to 5 month lows and GBP USD was on track to tally its largest one day gain since October 2009  stock markets seemed reluctant to react strongly to the dovish stance taken by the Fed which cut its forecast for the number of rate hikes this year in half to just two as market participants continued to weigh what the future holds for U S  monetary policy 
Fed fund futures predicted that the next hike won t take place until September  even as  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  noted that the possibility of an interest rate increase in June had shrunk to  well below 50   compared to the more than 50  chance before the meeting 
These experts adjusted their forecast because they believe that core PCE will fall mid year and thus made a call for just one rate hike in 2016  in December 
JP Morgan ratcheted down its expectations from three hikes to two  Having originally called for a hike in June  September and December  they were now looking for one in July and another in December 
However  the reasoning for the switch from June to July pointed to the fact that they don t expect the move to be made before the June 23 referendum in the U K  on its membership in the European Union 
In Thursday s U S  macro news  market participants digested labor market indicators with weekly jobless claims rising less than expected and the January Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showing more available employment than analysts had forecast 
Meanwhile  the Philadelphia Fed survey for March showed that manufacturing activity in the region registered an unexpected expansion 
Additionally  the Conference Board said that February leading indicators tallied a lower increase than forecast as housing prices  stock prices  consumer expectations and new orders continued to show signs of weakness 
Lastly  the current account deficit narrowed in the fourth quarter  according to data released by the Commerce Department 
Meanwhile  oil prices continued to climb to more than 3 month highs with West Texas breaking through  40 a barrel for the first time since December as the rally in black gold continued after bullish weekly supply data  an agreement by global oil producers to meet next month to discuss an output freeze and a broadly weaker U S  dollar as a result of a surprisingly dovish Fed all contributed to strong gains 
Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 4 03   to trade at  40 01 a barrel by 16 38GMT  or 11 38AM ET  while Brent oil advanced 2 85  to  41 49 
Of note on news involving Dow components  shares of  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT  managed to stay afloat  rising 1 4   despite lowering its forecasts for its first quarter earnings  The blue chip heavy equipment maker did reiterate its full year forecast

165294,386810,FDX,Online holiday package tsunami swamping U S  apartment buildings,news,"By Ian Simpson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    As the holiday shopping season peaks  U S  apartment complexes are being flooded with packages  from HD televisions to children s scooters  inundating lobbies and forcing building managers to take measures to extremes 
With online shopping expected to reach a record this year  overwhelmed property managers are starting to put a cap on the size of the boxes they will accept  installing storage lockers or banning deliveries outright 
Online purchases have spiked during this holiday season  with Americans buying  3 07 billion of goods on  Cyber Monday   the first workday after the Thanksgiving holiday  a 16 percent increase year on year  according to the Adobe Digital Index Report 
The Boston House  a 1950s era apartment building in Washington that saw package deliveries grow from a couple of dozen to hundreds a week in a few years  has limited the size of boxes  said Liz Cullison  the building s general manager 
 The packages got larger and larger and larger   Cullison said   That all overflowed out into the lobby  Now the lobby is overrun with packages  
Apartment buildings and complexes  home to about one in eight Americans  are being buffeted by the surge in online U S  retail sales  which rose on an adjusted basis to  87 5 billion in the third quarter  up 15 percent from a year earlier  according to the Commerce Department 
Apartment managers  are looking at the future  and they are only seeing more packages   said Rick Haughey  vice president of industry technology initiatives at the National Multifamily Housing Council  an industry group 
 You ve got old systems in place that don t really reflect the structural changes that we ve seen in retail   he said 
HOLIDAY VOLUME
The number of U S  packages shipped is soaring in tandem with online sales   United Parcel  Service Inc  N UPS   FedEx Corp  N FDX  and the U S  Postal Service all estimate an increase in the low double digits this year  in part because of one extra day in the holiday season between Thanksgiving and Christmas 
UPS is forecasting 630 million deliveries during the holiday season  up 43 percent from 2010  Deliveries for all carriers are expected to peak around Dec  21  four days before Christmas 
Boston House  where staff were already coping with deliveries of beds  furniture and other bulky items  reached its breaking point when a tenant who was moving across the country had his possessions delivered by UPS  with 40 of the carrier s biggest boxes piling up in the lobby  Cullison said

165299,386815,FDX,U S  futures show cautious trade ahead of Fed,news,"Investing com   U S  futures pointed to a flat open on Wednesday as equities stateside appeared to prefer to maintain a holding pattern before the Federal Reserve s March rate decision and the following press conference from the U S  central bank s chief Janet Yellen  even as investors prepared to digest a slew of economic data and kept an eye on the rebound in oil prices 
The blue chip Dow futures inched up 7 points  or 0 04   by 10 58GMT  or 6 58AM ET  the S P 500 futures edged forward only a quarter point  or 0 01   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 3 points  or 0 06  
Markets do not expect changes to the federal funds rate  FFR  at this meeting with most experts suggesting that June could be the first opportunity for a hike 
However  close attention will be paid to the economic forecasts and  especially  the dot plot that shows Fed members  forecasts for the future path of interest rates 
The FOMC statement will center attention as investors scour the document for language changes  only to be replaced in the headlines by remarks from the Fed chief herself who will further clarify the central bank s position on the economy  unemployment and the path of interest rates 
With futures on FFR placing the probability of a rate move at Wednesday s meeting at only 2   the key for markets will be the Fed s wording coming off the debate between Fed hawks who are worried that hikes could fall behind the curve on controlling inflation and doves who remain concerned about downside risks to the still fragile U S  economy 
Indeed  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  warned on Tuesday that the danger from the meeting was precisely that comments could turn out to be more hawkish than markets expected  They recommended taking long positions in the dollar based on that strategy 
Even though the Fed meeting and press conference will undoubtedly eclipse the day s events  the U S  will release a slew of data on Wednesday 
The highlight will be on February inflation data due at 12 30GMT  or 8 30AM ET  The consensus forecast is that the report will show consumer price inflation fell 0 2  last month  while core CPI is forecast to rise 0 2  
At the same time  the U S  will also publish data on February building permits and housing starts  followed by a report on industrial production for February at 13 15GMT  or 9 15AM ET 
Meanwhile  crude bounced back from its recent 2 day rout after OPEC and non OPEC producers agreed to hold their next meeting on a plan to freeze output levels in Doha  Qatar on April 17  even without the attendance of Iran 
After markets closed Tuesday  the American Petroleum Institute  an industry group  said that U S  oil inventories rose by just 1 5 million barrels in the week ended March 11  its lowest increase in four weeks and well below forecasts for a gain of 3 4 million barrels 
Furthermore  traders waited on Wednesday for the U S  Energy Information Administration to release its weekly report on oil supplies at 14 30GMT  or 10 30AM ET  amid expectations for a gain of 3 4 million barrels

165300,386816,FDX,Wall Street waits for the Fed and Yellen as inflation creeps up,news,"Investing com   Wall Street was on edge with stocks straddling the flat line after a slew of mixed data was published stateside  oil staged a rebound and market participants appeared content to sit on the fence while waiting for the Federal Reserve s  Fed  policy decision and the press conference from the U S  central bank s chief Janet Yellen 
At 15 45GMT or 11 45AM ET  the Dow 30 rose 11 points or 0 06   while the S P 500 inched up 2 points or 0 10  and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite gained 13 points or 0 27  
In a data packed date  special note was taken of U S  inflation data for February 
Although headline inflation fell in line with market expectations  the core CPI  which excludes food and energy and is thus generally considered by the Fed to be a better gauge of longer term inflationary pressure  rose more than expected 
Year on year  the core CPI increased by 2 3   a fact that could give fuel to the Fed hawks  argument that the U S  central bank should not wait too long to resume tightening monetary policy 
In any case  market participants will likely wait to make big moves until the release of the FOMC statement at 18 00GMT  or 14 00ET  published simultaneously with updated economic projections from Fed members  including the dot plot that shows Fed members  forecasts for the future path of interest rates 
Although no change in interest rates is expected at this meeting  the former will be sifted through with a fine toothed comb to detect any minute change in the language  especially with regard to the balance of risks  while the latter will be closely watched to determine the outlook for the economy  prices and Fed expectations for the next rate hike 
30 minutes after the release  market attention will shift to the tone of the press conference with Janet Yellen as investors look for indications for the future path of monetary policy 
With regard to the rest of Wednesday s macro data  February housing starts jumped a more than expected 5 2   but building permits  considered a leading indicator for the real estate market  slumped 3 1   dampening optimism for the housing recovery 
February industrial production produced a sour note with a bigger than forecast decline  although manufacturing output managed to edge up slightly more than consensus had estimated 
Meanwhile  crude bounced back from its recent 2 day rout after OPEC and non OPEC producers agreed to hold their next meeting on a plan to freeze output levels in Doha  Qatar on April 17  even without the attendance of Iran 
Oil prices later pushed even higher after bullish weekly stockpile data  The U S  Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 1 3 million barrels in the week ended March 11  Market analysts  expected a crude stock rise of 3 4 million barrels 
The report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 0 7 million barrels  compared to expectations for a drop of 2 4 million barrels  while distillate stockpiles fell by 1 1 million barrels 
After markets closed Tuesday  the American Petroleum Institute  an industry group  said that U S  oil inventories rose by just 1 5 million barrels in the week ended March 11  its lowest increase in four weeks and well below forecasts for a gain of 3 4 million barrels

Gold left the recently seen range around  1 300 and fell below  1 280  which some analysts attribute to the strength in the Dollar and also expectations that the Fed would further increase interest rates  Oil was under significant pressure after the US announced tariffs on Chinese imports  which China vowed to counter by tariffs on an equivalent value of US goods including crude oil 
US equity indices were also under pressure following the announcement of tariffs and fears of further escalations  which could affect the global trade and especially export oriented companies

165341,386857,FDX,FedEx Stock Options See Rare Surge Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"FedEx Reports Earnings After The Close On Tuesday  June 19
It s near the end of earnings season  but delivery giant FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  is slated to unveil its fiscal fourth quarter results after tomorrow s close  Ahead of the event  FDX stock is seeing a rare pop in options volume  with calls and puts crossing at around two times what s typically seen at this point in the day 
Specifically  4 392 calls and 3 462 puts have changed hands on FDX so far  Most active is the July 270 call  where the majority of the contracts have crossed at the ask price  With implied volatility higher  this would suggest new positions are being purchased here  but considering a number of July 270 calls have been sold to open in recent months    per data from the major options exchanges and Trade Alert    speculators may be buying to close the positions ahead of earnings 
More broadly  FedEx s options pits have been relatively quiet  Just 49 118 calls and 45 465 puts are currently open on the stock  with total open interest ranking in the 4th percentile of its annual range  That July 270 call is home to peak open interest  followed by the July 260 and 250 calls  Data points to buy to open activity at the 260 strike and sell to open action at the 250 strike  meaning it s possible some traders were initiating a long call spread ahead of earnings 
Whatever the reason  FDX call options are currently pricing in much higher volatility expectations than their put counterparts  This is based on the stock s 30 day implied volatility skew of 6 4   which ranks in the 10th annual percentile 
Historically speaking  FedEx stock tends to perform well after earnings  with the shares closing higher in the session subsequent to the company s results in five of the last eight quarters  On average  the stock has swung 3 2  the day after earnings looking back two years  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a larger 5 6  swing 
Looking at the charts  FedEx shares have been climbing higher since taking a familiar bounce off its 200 day moving average in late March    up more than 15  at  264 24  This trendline was perched near  230 at the time  a region that caught the stock s pullback from its Jan  18 record high of  274 66  and coincides with FDX s late November bull gap  Plus  the equity is now trading above a short term ceiling around  256  which is a 61 8  Fibonacci retracement of that early 2018 sell off ",2018-06-18,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fedex-stock-options-see-rare-surge-ahead-of-earnings-200325879,200325879

The PEG ratio is defined as   Price Earnings  Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median P E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable  Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness  Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or  3 offer the best upside potential  Here are five out of 16 stocks that qualified the screening Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc   NASDAQ JAZZ    This is an international biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patients  lives by identifying  developing and commercializing meaningful products that address unmet medical needs  The stock can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank  2 and a Value Score of B  Apart from a discounted PEG and P E  the stock also has an impressive long term expected growth rate of 16 7  Nutrisystem  Inc    NASDAQ NTRI    The company is a prominent name in the field of weight loss industry  The company offers weight loss programs that consist primarily of a pre packaged food program  digital tools  and counseling  Apart from a Zacks Rank  2 and a Value Score of A  the company also has an impressive growth rate of 17 5  for the next five years ACCO Brands Corporation   NYSE ACCO    This is one of the world s largest designers  marketers and manufacturers of branded academic  consumer and business products  The company has an impressive current year growth rate of 14 3   The stock has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  FedEx Corporation   NYSE FDX    The company provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation  e commerce and business services  Apart from a discounted PEG and P E  the stock has a Value Score of B and holds a Zacks Rank  2 Sykes Enterprises  Incorporated   NASDAQ SYKE    The company provides multi channel demand generation and global customer engagement services  It provides differentiated full lifecycle customer engagement solutions and services globally  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has a Value Score of A  It also has an impressive long term expected earnings growth rate of 13 2  Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test  It can all be done with the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software The Research Wizard is a great place to begin  It s easy to use  Everything is in plain language  And it s very intuitive  Start your Research Wizard trial today  And the next time you read an economic report  open up the Research Wizard  plug your finds in  and see what gems come out  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material  An affiliated investment advisory firm may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material  Disclosure  Performance information for Zacks  portfolios and strategies are available at   Zacks Restaurant Recommendations  Inaddition to dining at these special places  you can feast on their stock shares  A Zacks Special Report spotlights 5 recent IPOs to watch plus 2 stocks that offer immediate promise in a booming sector ",2018-06-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-best-bargain-peg-stocks-that-value-investors-love-200325393,200325393

165396,386912,FDX,FedEx Corporation  High Confidence Technical Chart Setup,opinion,"Ralph Elliott referred to three important aspects of price movement in his theory  pattern  ratio  and time  His analysis of mathematical properties of waves and patterns eventually led him to conclude that  The Fibonacci Summation Series is the basis of The Wave Principal   Numbers from the Fibonacci sequence surface repeatedly in Elliott wave structures 
While using Elliott Wave Analysis to assess opportunities  we look for consistent adherence to the chart pattern that is simultaneous to price reacting at key Fibonacci levels of support and resistance  Over time  solid adherence to these levels provides high confidence  low risk to reward entries into positions for investors  When it comes to high confidence  FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  is as pretty as it gets  and is one we are monitoring for our subscribers to gain an attractive entry in the coming 30 days 
In my recent article  Buy in May and Go Away   S P 500 Targets and Timing  I point out the S P 500 is setting up for a final drop to complete its Miner degree wave 4 into the 2 480 2 490 region  or possibly a larger triangle or running flat that finds support in the 2 552 area  and that investors should prepare their wish list of individual stocks they want to own now  in order to be prepared when the flush comes  While putting together your list  be sure to ad FDX  as it s a picture perfect match to our S P 500 price perspective 
In simple terms  we are looking for an entry into FDX in the  215    221 region for a move up to  353 during the Miner degree wave 5  That s 64  of upside during a period we expect a 28  increase in the S P 500  and one we expect will take no more than 6   12 months to realize as both FDX and the S P conclude their Intermediate Degree wave  3  
Now  let s take a look at why FedEx Corp is such a good setup  by referring to the weekly chart  Off the 2009 low  in textbook fashion wave  1  of the Intermediate Degree has hit the  382 extension  then the  3  hit the 1 0 extension  and wave 3 of Miner Degree hit the 1 382  In the use of Fibonacci extensions  these are what we would refer to as  perfect hits   Over time   as the chart pattern and Fibonacci extensions adhere   we gain greater confidence  What most commonly follows next is a  382 retracement of Miner Degree wave 3  where in the case of FDX  would beget a price movement to the  215 region  followed by a move to  353  at the 1 618 extension to complete Miner Degree wave 5 

So  in conclusion  we will be closely monitoring FedEx Corp for our subscribers  and looking for an entry that allows a tight risk to reward  with an expectation of a move higher that will outperform the S P by more than double the percentage return

165416,386932,FDX,FedEx Vs  UPS  Which Shipping Stock Is The Better Value Buy ,opinion,"Shares of both FedEx   NYSE FDX   and United Parcel Service   NYSE UPS   have fallen victim to the latest market wide sell off  However  this recent downturn isn t likely to scare off many value investors  and it might actually make stocks like these two shipping and delivery powers look even more attractive 
FedEx and UPS have long dominated the industry that they helped revolutionize  which is now set to grow based on the expansion of e commerce and increased demand for extremely fast shipping  The companies do face competition from Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and others  but the two legacy giants offer both stability and value  which look even more attractive amid this newly volatile market 
FedEx and UPS also seem to attract similar buy and hold investors  With that said  these same investors likely understand the value of a diverse portfolio  This means they might only want to pick one of these two shipping stocks 
So which of these stocks is the better buy right now  Let s take a closer look 
Valuation
Traditional value investors love to look at the price to earnings ratio to determine great buying opportunities  After all  buying a stock makes one a partial owner of that company  so investors are inherently interested in profitability 
Here is a look at the Forward P E trend for FDX and UPS over the last year 
One of the first things to note here is that UPS consistently traded at a premium to FDX over the last year  But this changed in early February  when investors can see FDX jump above its counterpart  This quick transition suggests that investors have reason to believe that FedEx is worthy of a premium over UPS going forward  where they previously thought UPS deserved to be the more expensive stock 
Still  investors who are on the hunt for value should consider both of these stocks  as they are trading relatively in line with the  Transportation   Air Freight Market  industry s average Forward P E of 13 8 
Performance
Value investors should also be interested in a stock s recent price performance  For instance  if a stock has sold off significantly  its lower valuation might speak to a greater problem that has forced investors to flee 
Check out how FDX and UPS have performed since this time last year 
As we can see  FedEx outpaced UPS for almost a full year  Then  in early February  we notice a huge divergence in share price  where UPS plummets while FDX dips  FedEx was also able to recover amid the recent downturn  while UPS currently rests near a 52 week low  These moves also help to explain why investors quickly became willing to pay a slight premium for FDX

   This transaction allows us to quickly broaden our portfolio of international transportation solutions to take advantage of market trends     especially the continuing growth of global e commerce     Frederick W  Smith  chairman and CEO of FedEx said in a statement announcing the acquisition

Two years ago  UPS ditched its attempt to acquire TNT Express for  7 billion after European antitrust regulators objected to a deal that would have made UPS and  Deutsche Post  AG  XETRA DPWGn   ETR DPW   commonly known as DHL  with about two thirds of the European market for international parcel deliveries 
But regulators have watched TNT struggle against DHL  UPS and FedEx  and UPS   s failure to acquire TNT helped FedEx come in later at a lower bidding price  according to the Wall Street Journal

165460,386976,FDX,Will Infrastructure ETFs Get A Boost From Trump s Plan ,opinion,"The promise was for a  1 trillion infrastructure plan from Trump s campaign days but the actual plan launched lately is a  200 billion federal infrastructure plan  which comprises below mentioned areas 
1      100 billion in matching grant would go to states and cities on new   
2      50 billion rural block grant program that will be available to states based on the length of rural roads and the level of rural inhabitants 
3     Around  20 billion for  projects of national significance  meaning  projects that can lift the American spirit  that are the next century type of infrastructure as opposed to just rebuilding what we have currently  
4     Additional   20 billion in fund  that underwrite private financing of profitable infrastructure projects  
5     Plus  there s a  10 billion capital financing program that would finance the construction of federal office buildings and similar infrastructure for actual government use 
Per  on VOX com   federally funded highways are financed on the basis of an 80 20 federal state split   Trump s proposal is to reverse the 80 20 formula and call for states and cities to dole out at least  4 for every  1 in federal money they get  Some experts believe that the current formula results in  over investment in new highway projects with little transportation value   
The overall plan is supposed to lure private companies to come up of the groundwork and reconstruct America to the extent of  1 5 trillion   However   private investors are less likely to be drawn to this project 
Investors should also note that the Trump administration did not roll out a separate infrastructure proposal  rather it came with a budget package  that would also  for other programs and services  
The vox com article indicated that Republican administrations are known for proposing big initiatives that are intended to be funded by increasing budget deficits  George W  Bush s 2001 tax cuts  2003 tax cuts and Medicare expansion as well as Trump s 2017 tax cuts and his big increase in military spending have been held as examples for this Republican tendency by vox com 
Any Bright Side  
There is an initiative that would save   to guarantee that there is no another Flint  Michigan style water crisis in the coming few years  This single initiative grossed more federal funds than the entire infrastructure plan  So  water ETFs like PowerShares Water Resources   OL PHO   and First Trust ISE Water Index Fund  should benefit from this plan 
As long as infrastructure ETFs are concerned  there are less likely to get a boost as financing would be a big issue  Still  investors can keep a tab on funds like Global X U S  Infrastructure Development ETF   ProShares DJ Brookfield Global Infrastructure ETF  and SPDRS P Global Infrastructure ETF   see  here  
Transportation ETFs like iShares Transportation Average ETF  and SPDR S P Transportation  NYSE XTN  ETF  should also be closely watched  read

165461,386977,FDX,Urgent Vs  Important  Barriers To Digitization In Alternative Investing,opinion,"KPMG International and CREATE Research have jointly prepared a report about the digitization imperative for alternative investment management 
The report includes within that term both hedge funds and private equity 
Early on  its authors list eight key digital innovations that are reconstructing the industry 
Application programming interfaces  cognitive technology and machine learning  Big Data  blockchain  new digital platforms  robo advisors  robotic process automation  and social media 
All this is different from what the report calls  rising automation of the routine processes in front  middle  and back offices in order to achieve cost effective growth   That was industrialization  not digitization  and it is now rather old hat 
If a firm wants to get out ahead of digitization instead of behind swamped by it  its leadership will have to realign business models  abandon legacy systems  and reconfigure the value chain 
KPMGH CREATE hope to add something to one s understanding of this situation through a survey  To that end they have talked to 125 alternative managers located in 19 countries  with combined assets under management of  2 6 trillion 
A Need To Future Proof
They found that the scale of the ongoing shake up is well understood  Only 2  of respondents saw a  business as usual  scenario playing out over the next 10 years  Roughly one third  35   expect marginal changes  But 53  anticipate  partial  disruption and the remaining 10  anticipate  total  disruption 
Business as usual would involve a continued game of second guessing central bankers  But as one interviewee put it   When central banks take away the proverbial punchbowl  asset valuations may well nosedive  We need to future proof our business against big market moving events  
As to the sources of disruption  there is some disagreement  The largest group maintains that disruption will come as a byproduct of collaborations  as  incumbents collaborate with potential external rivals   This 44  of the surveyed managers include many medium and small sized managers  KPMG CREATE observes that they may be thinking this way because they  want to stay in the driving seat   Another 34  think that internal innovation will be the main source of disruption  as AI managers  get on the front foot and digitize their businesses in order to pre empt competitive threats   This view comes from larger managers  who may be the ones in the best position to get off to that front foot 
A smaller but not negligible group  22   see the main source of disruption as incursion into the field by  current internet titans and FinTech start ups  making use of their digital savvy and brand names  The incumbents will  on this view  face quite soon the same threat that FedEx and UPS now face from Amazon 
Who Is In What Stage  
The survey asked the participants what  stage  they were in with regard to the adoption of the eight innovations listed above  close to decision making  implementation  neither  Their answers indicated a greater familiarity with social media than with any of the other items on the list  The resulting bar graph is as below 

The survey respondents expressed various opinions about the factors that are slowing down the transformation of the industry 
Techie barriers include legacy IT systems  the opaque nature of some of the proposed innovations  and cyber security 
In the special world of real estate investments   digitization is a nascent phenomenon  tied up with the  internet of things   But it isn t ignored   Real estate firms are using advisers to help them navigate around the issue  
Fear of the Unknown
Business related barriers to digitization include the  regulatory overdrive in the wake of the 2008 crisis that has amplified headline risk  low risk appetite in corporate culture   and the innovator s dilemma  namely  why disrupt the business model if the profit markets are healthy  
Later  the authors take a more psychological  even emotion centered  view of the subject of innovation  There are two fears at work  pulling AI managers in opposite directions  One is the  fear of the unknown   the other is the fear of being left behind 
One interviewee told the survey takers   Digitization only gains traction when our bosses take interest in it  They tend to let the urgent get in the way of the important  
The report concludes that managers will get beyond stasis  they will embrace the future  when they come to understand that innovation itself isn t a magic bullet  Execution is ",2018-02-16,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/urgent-vs-important-barriers-to-digitization-in-alternative-investing-200291224,200291224
165462,386978,FDX,What The Markets Have In Common With The Film  Casablanca  ,opinion,"Technical expert Michael Ballanger discusses current market fluctuations and the gold and silver markets 

As I watched Wednesday s CPI  inflation  number reported by the Commerce Department  I was immediately reminded of that classic scene from legendary WWII flick  Casablanca   where Claude Rains  playing police Captain Renault  PA RENA   shuts down Humphrey Bogart s casino nightclub with the immortal words   I shocked SHOCKED to find out that gambling is going on in here   The croupier hands him a wad of bills  Your winnings  sir  to which he says   Oh thank you very much  Now everyone out of here  
Well  I was shocked SHOCKED  I tell you to see that the U S  inflation numbers came in a tad  hot   After all  the Fed has added some  5 trillion in additional  assets  to its balance sheet since 2008 and encouraged its foreign central bank cousins to do the same  which they have done with even greater enthusiasm  The movement toward serial currency trashing has had us all awaiting the inevitable return of 1970s style inflation  but thanks to the creative accounting and fictitious reporting  inflation is seen as  tame  by mostly everyone but especially the financial media and  bond badeers  
The U S  debt to GDP ratio has been increasing every year since 1980 with only a brief respite during the tech boom of the late  90s  and that has been a global theme of commonality as fiscal recklessness became the clarion call for Baby Boomers the world over  Nearly 10 years of financial repression has finally lifted as bond yields are rising to levels never quite seen by the legions of Millennials now trading for their livelihoods 

The expansion of the Fed balance sheet has long been a source of fascination for me as I could never understand how any entity owned by its members  which are banks that are required to keep a minimum of reserves on hand and must report financial positions  could be allowed to buy trillions of dollars of toxic paper from its members in order for those members to avoid bankruptcy and then report those noxious purchases as  assets  that remain on the books at book value  If they were threatening to sink the member banks  how can they be booked at face value or par 
Should the Fed not report them as  non performing loans   leaving a large hole in that balance sheet  Should the Fed  which is not a part of the U S  government  not be audited  as are its members   owners    Why can the Fed buy  sell  and short  think volatility and gold  infinite amounts of anything and everything without ever getting a margin call  Are you not shocked SHOCKED that the Captain Renault of bond vigilante ism isn t closing down that casino 

Stocks caught an enormous bid this past week after the ice water wake up call of the previous week  but as I wrote about in last week s   you would have to be a complete fool to think that there would not be a  response  from 33 Liberty  NY Fed  and from the various serial interveners around the world  The volatility we saw last week spooked the politico banker elite to the extent that we immediately witnessed dramatic moves to suppress the sudden and violent short covering in the VIX derivatives attached to equity market volatility 
The 1 500 point swings in the Dow Jones were moved upon quickly  and by Monday afternoon  the  Buy the Dippers  had absorbed literally all of the panicky supply and voila  The Dow Jones now resides some 1 500 points off the lows and about 1 500 points from the all time high  You see  everyone now agrees that one must never  ever underestimate the replacement power of stocks in a  hyper  inflationary spiral  So a  hot CPI  is bullish as hell  right 


Platitudes aside  I want to put to rest any notions that I have changed my opinion in any way on gold and silver looking out to the balance of 2018  Just to review  in late January I posted the chart shown below and made the case that no matter what the bloggers will tell you  the miners have a history of getting sold when the RSI moves above 70  The high for the December January rally for Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares  NYSE NUGT  was  37 96  the sell point for me was  35 80  The low print last Friday was  21 40  my entry was  23 80 
One week ago  I was a buyer of the leveraged Junior Miner ETF  NYSE JNUG  at  13 35  20   and watched it crater to  11 34  creating all sorts of problems for canine pets  adoring spouses  FedEx  NYSE FDX  delivery personnel  and call center employees  In dealing with issues related to  poor trading   I often times get caught up in semi violent mood swings resulting in harsh responses to challenges such as overly bound  impossible to open FedEx packages and overly polite  impossible to understand bank support staff 
Owing these emotional whipsaws to my way too early JNUG entry  all around me had to suffer until the past couple of days  because today NUGT closed at  28 91 and the JNUG at  15 91  Needless to say  calm has now returned to the household as the miners are hitting on all cylinders  the metals are again firming up  and Fido has returned from under the toolshed 

I eagerly anticipate results from Stakeholder Gold Corp  s  V SRC  Goldstorm project  where the first hole in a 10 hole project has been drilled to an elevation of just above the water table at 6 000 feet  above sea level   Fingers and toes are crossed but since the shares have now pulled back from the  13M to  8M of market cap last week during the meltdown  there is no longer any speculative anticipation built into the share price  The company is spending   2 5M over the next three years to earn 100   so there is a lot of drilling ahead  And with such a big land position tied on Seabridge Gold Inc  s  TO SEA  SG SEA  Snowstorm Project  2018 will be an active exploration year for the area 
As this is being finished  gold is trading up through  1 360 again  but once again silver is lagging  taking the silver gold ratio to 80 71  Hard to believe that in 2001  I was buying silver in the  4 00 range at the same ratio to gold 10 years later  it was at  50

165486,387002,FDX,Ditch These 5 REIT Duds  Grab This Bargain Priced Pair Instead,opinion,"Real estate investment trusts  REITs  are one of the market s best sources of high yield  But they can also be one of its searing sources of heartburn 
For your sanity s sake  and for the good of your retirement savings  avoid the five high yielding REITs I m going to warn you about today  Then reinvest that money into the sure fire 8  yielders I ll highlight after that 
REITs are set up  by design  to be income powerhouses  That s the deal  They get to evade Uncle Sam  and in return  they have to funnel the lion s share of their profits to shareholders  But a mandate only goes so far   if a REIT has less cash to redistribute  simple math says you and I suffer 
My latest warning tale comes from up north  where Boardwalk REIT  TO BEI u    an apartment owner across Alberta  Ontario and Quebec  among other provinces   pulled the rug out from underneath its shareholders 
Boardwalk was a safe bet for some time  making more than 150 consecutive monthly distributions since its 2004 IPO  However  the company s profitability suffered amid a nearly two year economic downturn in Alberta  and its funds from operations  FFO  dipped so far that they weren t keeping up with the dividend payments 
Investors who had been paying attention were already heading for the exits 
Boardwalk s Troubles Were No Secret
But buy and holders thinking Boardwalk was safe had their illusion dashed in November 2017 by a 56  cut to that monthly dividend 
A not so gentle reminder that not every REIT dividend is safe  It pays to be persnickety  That means cutting out losers like the five 5  11  yielders below   and going all in on the two quality 8  yielders that follow 
AGNC Investment Corp  NASDAQ AGNC Dividend Yield  11 6 
AGNC Investment Corp   AGNC  is one of the largest and most established mortgage real estate investment trusts  mREITs   It invests primarily in agency mortgage backed securities  which are issued by government sponsored groups such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac  It usually finances these through  repurchase agreements   which are short term secured loans 
To its credit  AGNC performed decently in 2017  The company ran off roughly 11  price gains  and combined with its substantial dividend  delivered nearly 24  in total returns 
That s still no better than the Dow s 28  plus in total returns  but it s a performance no investor would cry about 
But did things really get all that better over the past year 
The company recently reported its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results  and AGNC ended the year with  769 million in net interest income   down 17  year over year from 2016 s  927 million  which itself was off 18  from 2015 s  1 14 billion in NII  Net interest margin for the quarter of 1 35  was off 67 basis points from the year ago quarter  too  and in fact remained below 2  in every quarter of 2017 
Meanwhile  the company continues to crank up its tangible net book value  at risk  leverage ratio to 8 1   up from 7 7 when I    And for all its success in 2017  shares actually are off 9  since my update   That s a level of leverage that far outpaces most of its competition  Worse  that leverage was in part jacked up to help finance AGNC s purchase of its external manager  American Capital Mortgage Management 
By the way  to better finance the deal  AGNC clipped its monthly dividend from 20 cents per share to 18 cents   a move that came not far removed from another payout reduction in 2015 
AGNC performed admirably across the whole of 2017  but shares are headed back to a drab reality 
AGNC s NII Keeps Shrinking  Will the Dividend Keep Following 
Vereit Inc  NYSE VER Dividend Yield  8 
Back in October 2014  a REIT by the name of American Realty Capital was pummeled after the company revealed that it had previously released financial statements exaggerating its FFO and downplaying its red ink on the bottom line 
This led to investigations by both the FBI and SEC  and an eventual rebranding to a new name  VEREIT  VER   in mid 2015 
VEREIT  of course  does the same thing American Realty Capital did   it s just hoping to do it a little more honestly  VEREIT is a net lease  single tenant REIT whose real estate houses restaurants  manufacturers  grocers and companies across other industries  Tenants include Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  NASDAQ WBA   Dollar General Corporation  NYSE DG  and FedEx  NYSE FDX   but most notably  the company has a large 6 8  of its portfolio dedicated to struggling Red Lobster restaurants   a position that it has been selling back to Golden Gate Capital for a couple of years 
The company does have a couple things going for it  including chipping away at its debt and  in the third quarter  upping its adjusted FFO guidance  Still  the company is building an impressive streak of quarterly AFFO share declines  including a 4  dip in Q3 that was fueled by an 8  top line retreat  Most worrying of all is that   remaining at 13 75 cents quarterly in perpetuity 
Shares have dipped by about 15  over the past year  and currently is mired in a strong downtrend along with the rest of the REIT community as interest rates climb higher  Thus  a dead cat bounce could be in the offing  but don t believe in any short term recovery unless it s accompanied by a lot more in the way of operational improvement 
Alexanders Inc  NYSE ALX Dividend Yield  5 3 
I panned small New York City based Alexander s  ALX    so it s about time for a check in  How s it going  Alex 
Ouch  Not Good 
A refresher  Alexander s once was a prominent NYC department store chain that thrived in the middle of last century  However  it faded from relevancy in the 1970s and 1980s before eventually being forced into bankruptcy in 1992  It reorganized as a real estate investment trust and sold off some of its properties 
From 10 000 feet  it s hard not to love any company that holds real estate in New York City   one of the most expensive rent cities on the planet  But Alexander s really hasn t done much with its portfolio  and in fact has shrunk from seven retail and office properties when I last discussed the REIT to six  Meanwhile  net income across nine months of 2017 was  62 6 million  off a little more than 3  year over year  FFO slipped a similar amount over that time 
In fact  the only real improvement to note in ALX shares over the past few months is that its price to FFO has slipped from 18 7 down to 15 5  But while the stock certainly is cheaper than it was  heed Warren Buffett s words  Price is what you pay  but value is what you get  Alexander s isn t giving investors much at the moment 
VanEck Vectors Mortgage REIT Income  NYSE MORT Dividend Yield  7 8 
iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped  NYSE REM Dividend Yield  9 9 
As I discussed with AGNC  mREITs really started to punch back over the past year or so  In fact  according to global REIT representative Nareit  their collective average 19 8  total return was the best among all REIT types in 2017 
Congratulations  but it s not all gravy 
For one  the roughly 19  returns of both the VanEck Vectors Mortgage REIT Income ETF  MORT  and iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped ETF  REM  still managed to lag the market  as the S P 500 and its measly sub 2  dividend managed to churn out a 21 8  total return 
Also  it s becoming increasingly clear that not much is going to change at the Federal Reserve as outgoing chair Janet Yellen passes the baton to Jerome Powell  Yes  the Fed kept interest rates steady in January  but Powell has no qualms with raising rates  and in fact  the market is pricing in two if not three hikes in 2018   The Federal Reserve has bumped the Fed funds rate five times since December 2015   That s becoming an increasing drag on these ETFs  which have declined 6  7  in the first month of 2018 versus continued gains for the broader market 
mREITs and the Market Have Uncoupled
And again  I can t stress this enough  Funds can  at times  be the right way to approach a sector or industry  but sometimes a group of losers can weigh down the few winners in the space  That has been the case for MORT and REM through much of their publicly traded lives 
2 Dividend Growth REITs  Up to 8 2  Yields and 25   Upside
No  if you want safe and steady REIT returns  your path lies in individual picks  with the very best 
For example  one of my favorite REITs at the moment recently raised its dividend again by 4  over last quarter s payout  This marks the 22nd consecutive quarterly dividend hike for the firm 
An Ever Rising Dividend
It pays an 9 7  yield today   but that s actually an 10 1  forward yield when you consider we re going to see four more dividend increases over the next year  And the stock is trading for less than 10 times funds from operations  FFO   Pretty cheap 
However  I expect its valuation and stock price will rise by 20  over the next 12 months as more money comes stampeding into its REIT sector   which makes right now the best time to buy and secure an 8 5  forward yield 
Same for another REIT favorite of mine  a 7 2  payer backed by an unstoppable demographic trend that will deliver growing dividends for the next 30 years 
The firm s investors have enjoyed 68  total returns over the last five years  with much of that coming back as cash dividends   And right now is actually a better time than ever to buy because its growing base of assets is generating higher and higher cash flows  powering an accelerating dividend 
An Accelerating Dividend
This stock should be owned by any serious dividend investor for three simple reasons 
It s recession proof 
It yields a fat  and secure  7 4   and
Its dividend increases are actually accelerating 
These two REITs are both  best buys  in my 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio   an 8  dividend paying portfolio that lets retirees live on secure payouts alone  And they can even enjoy price upside to boot  thanks to the bargain prices they re buying at

165489,387005,FDX,A World Where You Don t Have To Return For Returns,news,"By   

The Century 21 department store in Manhattan s Financial District is buzzing just five days after Christmas  as customers pick through merchandise looking for designer discounts  But six floors up  above the purses  shoes and dresses is a much quieter section  where customers wait in a slow moving line outside the  Guest Services  department  They walk in carrying the signature red Century 21 shopping bags  and walk out with long receipts in hand 
 A few years ago I remember these return lines being much longer  but this time wasn t so bad   says Tetyana Bakhnak  29  as she makes her way back downstairs after returning a belt she had bought for her brother as a Christmas gift  It turned out to be a few sizes too small 
 This is my only return this year  I don t make too many mistakes   says Bakhnak  who lives in New York City  She adds that she does most of her shopping online  but made a snap decision to buy the belt while walking past Century 21 in December  and misjudged the size 
Every year  consumers return about  60 billion worth of merchandise during the holiday season  about 20 percent of a year s total  according to the Wall Street Journal  which used data from Optoro  a logistics provider  While retail stores are seeing a usual jump in returns as customers exchange holiday gifts that weren t quite right  the pressure is also hitting postal companies 
United Parcel Service Inc  NYSE UPS  has been making adjustments to keep up with an ever rising demand for services as customers return an increasing number of packages by mail  In a recent survey  UPS found that 62 percent of its customers said they returned an item they bought online this year  up from just 51 percent in 2012 
 As e commerce volume increases so do returns   says UPS spokesperson Natalie Norrington   Customers are getting more comfortable with getting items online and returning them the same way  
This year  the company hired 95 000 seasonal workers to keep up with demand  Usually holiday employees work from November to December  but this year s crop of UPS workers were contracted until the middle of January  on predictions that it will be sending 4 million return packages this January  up from 3 5 million in 2013 
And UPS isn t alone  FedEx  NYSE FDX  announced on Dec  15 that it would acquire Genco  a company focused on  reverse logistics  that processes more than 600 million returned items every year  according to its website 
However  it s not all positive  Many retailers say the massive number of returns costs them  Returns to tech retailer Best Buy Co  are likely to represent about 10 percent of all revenue this year  and cost around  400 million  according to the Wall Street Journal 
But some startups have been taking advantage of the trend  The business model at Trunk Club  for instance  involves customers receiving a box of clothes they may want to purchase  and only charges them for what they don t send back within ten days

165514,387030,FDX,At 52 Week Highs  Will FedEx   UPS Continue To Rally In 2018 ,opinion,"The biggest overhaul in U S  tax code in 30 years has been a boon for package delivery giants like FedEx Corp    NYSE FDX   and United Parcel Service   NYSE UPS    The  1 5 trillion package  converted into law  Tax Cut and Jobs Act  on Dec 22  reduces corporate taxes from 35  to 21   The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to aid the above mentioned companies  We note that the effective tax rate at FedEx was 35 4  in the first half of fiscal 2018 
Riding on this momentum  shares of FedEx and UPS that dominate and define the   hit their respective 52 week high levels on Jan 3  2018  While FedEx shares scaled a 52 week high of  261 57 during the trading session  the UPS stock touched its highest point of  126 69 
Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate  the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence  which was not allowed earlier  This aspect hugely favors companies like FedEx and UPS as they invest substantially toward capital expenditure 
Naturally  their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions  This  in turn  will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases  among others 
Holiday Season   Another Catalyst
The holiday season every year presents a big opportunity to companies like FedEx and UPS to boost their revenues  It is normally considered a busy period for such companies as shipping volumes tend to surge 
As is the case every year  the companies left no stone unturned to shine brightly in the most recent holiday season  To meet the surge in demand  FedEx hired more than 50 000 seasonal workers this time  Meanwhile  UPS hired around 95 000 seasonal workers 
In fact  according to  report both these Zacks Rank  3  Hold  companies had a highly successful holiday season buoyed by strong e commerce growth  You can see 
Dividends Buybacks Attest Solid Financial Health
Financial prosperity of FedEx and UPS is reflected in the fact that both the companies have hiked their respective dividend payouts in 2017  In February  UPS raised its quarterly dividend by 6 4  to 83 cents per share   3 32 on an annualized basis  
During the first nine months of the year  the company paid approximately  2 1 billion as dividend to shareholders  It also bought back bought back 12 3 million shares for about  1 4 billion in the same period 
FedEx hiked its quarterly dividend by 25  to 50 cents a share  or  2 annually  in June  Needless to say  as investors prefer an income generating stock  a high dividend paying one is much coveted  To this end  investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments 
Price Performance
Shares of both UPS and FedEx have outperformed the S P 500 Index in the last six months  While  UPS has gained 14 3   FedEx has rallied 20   The S P 500 Index has gained only 8  in the same period 

Will the Rally Continue in 2018 
With the tax bill becoming a law in the final month of 2017  stocks like FedEx and UPS are likely to be huge beneficiaries in 2018  The new tax law is likely to boost their share prices further in the current year 
FedEx has already stated that the new tax regime is expected to boost fiscal 2018  ending May 31  2018  earnings per share in the range of  4 40 to  5 50  before mark to market year end pension accounting adjustments  primarily due to the revaluation of the company s net deferred tax liabilities  
Furthermore  FedEx and UPS are likely to continue with their shareholder friendly activities in 2018 due to the new tax law  Therefore  a hike in dividends from both the companies can be anticipated in the year    In fact  the new tax regime is a positive for not only these two companies but the other transportation players as well  Evidently  Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   and American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   announced bonuses worth  1 000 per employee  following the tax overhaul

165517,387033,FDX,FedEx sees e commerce driving record holiday season,news,"By Nick Carey CHICAGO  Reuters    Package delivery company FedEx Corp should enjoy a record holiday peak season thanks to the continued rise of online consumer sales in the United States  company officials said on Wednesday 
Executive vice president Michael Glenn said on a conference call with analysts after FedEx reported better than expected quarterly results that the company would add more than 50 000 seasonal workers to handle the anticipated spike in shipping 
Alongside its main rival United Parcel Service Inc  FedEx is considered a bellwether of U S  economic activity 
FedEx has been in an  active dialogue with our retail and E tail customers all year to understand their peak shipping needs and plan our operations accordingly   Glenn said 
UPS announced this week that it would hire up to 95 000 seasonal workers for peak season  nearly double the 55 000 it hired last year  A surge in online shopping and severe weather last Christmas caught UPS off guard  resulting in delays that angered customers 
Beyond the holiday season  FedEx expects the U S  economy to grow at a rate of 3 1 percent in 2015  The company said the global economy should also grow at a rate of 3 1 percent next year 
Constraints across America s supply chain system as the economy grows have enabled shipping and transport companies to raise prices for customers  That pricing power is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
Late Tuesday FedEx announced an across the board 4 9 percent rate increase effective early January 2015 
FedEx reported a better than expected 24 percent jump in quarterly profit Wednesday as it benefited from higher shipment volumes 
The company s net income rose to  606 million  or  2 l0 per share  in the first quarter ended Aug  31  from  489 million  or  1 53 per share  a year earlier 
Revenue increased 6 percent to  11 7 billion

The company also reaffirmed its 2015 earnings forecast of  8 50  9 00 per share  Analysts are expecting earnings of  8 84 per share

165519,387035,FDX,UPS may hike charges for major customers for holiday package surges,news,"By Nick Carey CHICAGO  Reuters    United Parcel Service Inc may charge major customers more for a surge in late  unplanned packages or turn down the business if it threatens disruptions during the peak holiday season  a top executive said on Friday  trying to avoid a repeat of last year s delivery meltdown 
UPS  N UPS  and main rival FedEx Corp  N FDX   both considered U S  economic bellwethers  are approaching their busiest time  Last year a last minute surge in online consumer promotions left an estimated 2 million express packages stranded on Christmas Eve 
 If it  a late surge  creates challenges and adds costs we would charge a premium   Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters   If it puts our service at risk  we would have to deny  the business   
Kuehn spoke after UPS  the world s largest package delivery company  posted higher than expected third quarter profit  driven by rising U S  consumer and business demand plus strong growth in Asia 
Kuehn said UPS remained concerned about U S  railroad service problems   UPS is a major rail customer   saying  they need to improve their service metrics   The major railroad have struggled this year to meet demand due to a growing economy  rising oil by rail freight and a record harvest 
The problems especially affected UPS  which has invested  500 million to boost its infrastructure to handle the coming holiday season 
Like Memphis based FedEx  UPS has worked with major retailers this year to get a clearer forecast for package volumes and online promotions to avoid a repeat of last year s debacle 
FedEx has said if a major retailer decides to offer a last minute online promotion without notifying the company  which threatens its service  the company won t be able to handle the business 
UPS reported earnings per share of  1 32  up 14 percent from  1 16 a year earlier  Analysts expected  1 28 per share 
UPS shares rose 1 1 percent to  101 57 
Atlanta based UPS confirmed its full year profit outlook  predicting earnings per share of between  4 90 to  5 00  Analyst expected  4 95 per share 
UPS said annual package shipments should increase 11 percent year over year in December 
The National Retail Federation predicted U S  holiday retail sales will rise 4 1 percent this year to  616 9 billion  Other forecasts are less rosy 
A survey of shoppers by PwC US and Strategy  projects the average household will spend  684 during the holiday season  down from  735 in 2013  although 41 percent of shoppers indicated they will spend more online than last year 
Citi Research analyst Christian Wetherbee wrote in a research note that the company s profit outlook  looks a bit soft  and is below Citi s estimate  This implied that  while holiday volume will grow 11 percent  costs may be elevated   he added 

UPS posted quarterly revenue of  14 29 billion  up 6 percent from  13 52 billion last year  slightly above analysts estimates of  14 2 billion

165520,387036,FDX,UPS CEO  Unplanned holiday surge could cost retailers,news,"By Nick Carey ATLANTA  Reuters    United Parcel Service Inc s chief executive officer said on Monday the company s closer collaboration with major retailers should bring a smooth holiday season  but he said UPS would charge customers more or even refuse packages if last minute sales by a major customer threaten the company s system 
     With the changes we ve made  I feel very comfortable about peak  season  this year   David Abney told Reuters in an interview at UPS headquarters in Atlanta 
    Imposing additional charges or refusing delivery for existing customers would be  the exception versus the rule   Abney said  The company has put in place a  control tower  system in which company experts manage the flow of packages and anticipate problems 
    Last year a late surge in pre Christmas online retail sales left an estimated 2 million express packages undelivered in the United States  UPS  the world s largest package delivery company  was badly affected by the last minute flood of packages 
FedEx Corp  the main rival of UPS  is also working with retailers to manage package volume forecasts  The Memphis based company has made it clear that if a late  unplanned holiday sale threatened to derail its system  it could decline that business 
Peak day package volumes at UPS and FedEx in the run up to Christmas have jumped 40 percent and 57 percent  respectively  since 2009 
Those volumes are roughly double the average daily number of packages the companies haul  Deloitte LLP predicts U S  e commerce sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season  and robust online growth is expected to continue 
Abney said the company s brick and mortar and e commerce retail customers are holding  Black Friday  sales earlier than normal this year and that UPS believes it is part of an effort by retailers to find ways to smooth out the pre Christmas online ordering bulge 
If a late e commerce surge raises costs for UPS this year  Abney said   We certainly in 2015 and beyond will look very closely at what we need to do  to offset those costs  including the possibility of holiday season price increases 
The actual delivery of a package is the most cost  and labor intensive part of what companies like UPS and FedEx do  Delivering to residential addresses is more expensive than to businesses  since businesses tend to receive multiple packages 
Managing those costs as e commerce continues to grow is a priority  Abney said  E commerce accounts for about 45 percent of UPS  business  and should reach 50 percent within five years 

 I think anybody that s delivering directly to consumers is certainly going to be looking at those costs   he said

165521,387037,FDX,Gasoline price drop could boost U S  holiday spending  UPS CFO,news,"By Nick Carey ATLANTA  Reuters    Lower U S  gasoline prices could boost consumer spending ahead of the holiday season  a critical period for the retail sector  a top executive at United Parcel Service Inc  N UPS  said on Tuesday 
 The impact of low fuel prices right now is it puts more discretionary dollars in consumers  pockets   Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters at the company s Atlanta headquarters 
 We do think that it is certainly not bad timing that all of the Santa Clauses around the country will maybe have a few more dollars in discretionary spending for the holidays  
Gasoline prices have recently fallen to a national average of below  3 per gallon  Kuehn said this will not affect spending on high priced goods  but an extra  20 or  30 a month can make a difference  
Any boost for retailers could be a boon for UPS and its main rival FedEx Corp  N FDX  thanks to the ever expanding Ecommerce market 
Ecommerce accounts for around 45 percent of UPS  revenue and the company expects that to rise to 50 percent within five years 
Kuehn said the world s largest package delivery company is  fairly bullish  on the U S  economy  expecting annual growth of around 3 percent over the next two years  which should drive business growth and further lift consumer spending 
Low gasoline prices will not deter UPS from continuing to invest in alternative fuel vehicles  Kuehn said  UPS currently has around 3 000 alternative fuel vehicles  predominantly natural gas  Kuehn said while it is more expensive to retrofit a truck to use natural gas  the lower cost of the fuel means the vehicles pay for themselves over the long term 
 The economics are still pretty good even at these prices   he said   We re very excited still about natural gas as a very viable replacement for traditional diesel engines for fleets  
UPS is gearing up for the holiday season  traditionally its busiest  The company fared poorly last year as a late major surge in Ecommerce packages overloaded its network  and extreme winter conditions hindered delivery 
Kuehn said UPS has focused on its top 40 retail customers  talking to them weekly to adjust shipping forecasts and embedding staff to better understand their customers  needs  He said is optimistic this year s peak season will run smoothly 

 We  UPS and major retailers  will all succeed or fail together in this effort   he said   Our interests are absolutely aligned

165545,387061,FDX,UPS To Factor Box Size Into Shipping Price,news,"By    United Parcel Service Inc  NYSE UPS  said Tuesday it will begin pricing ground shipments in the U S  and standard delivery to Canada based on box sizes in addition to weight beginning after Christmas 
UPS competitor FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  said in May it would begin factoring package size into shipping prices instead of pricing by weight alone  beginning Jan  1  2015 
The pricing change  called  dimensional weight pricing  by the industry  comes as shoppers increasingly buy items online  often with free delivery options  even for large lightweight goods like paper towels in bulk  The company said in April its delivery volume in the U S  increased by more than 4 percent  in the first quarter of this year 
UPS hopes the change will encourage customers to ship lighter items in smaller boxes  as packages have become less dense in recent years  essentially wasting space  The new pricing structure is designed to decrease fuel costs as delivery trucks will be able to stow packages with a more efficient use of space 
The company already uses dimensional weight pricing for packages shipped by its air service and by ground to Mexico  as well as for large packages shipped to Canada 

 UPS has been researching the potential expansion of dimensional weight pricing for a number of years because it enables us to more appropriately align rates with costs  which are influenced by both the size and weight of packages   UPS Chief Commercial Officer Alan Gershenhorn said in a statement 
The new pricing takes effect Dec  29  2014 after the busy holiday shopping and shipping season ",2014-06-18,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ups-to-factor-box-size-into-shipping-price-290313,290313
165546,387062,FDX,UPS and FedEx Set to Raise Prices,news,"By    UPS s decision to consider box size as well as weight when calculating the price to ship packages  following a similar move by rival FedEx last month  will likely lead to price increases for online retailers but it s not yet clear if those costs will be passed on to consumers 
Faced with an explosion in online shopping and Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN   99 a year Prime program  UPS  NYSE UPS  and FedEx  NYSE FDX  adopted the changes  to take effect after the December shopping blitz  in order to help them handle the volume of packages   If customers cut down on excess packing material  boxes won t occupy as much space on trucks  and UPS said it will also be able to reduce fuel use 
But avid e shoppers need not fret  just yet  about the shift  Even as UPS and FedEx adjust certain prices upward  retailers in the bustling e commerce market    where low shipping costs are a major draw    might be loath to make shoppers pay the price 
 I would be very surprised if very much gets passed on to customers   said Sucharita Mulpuru  a retails analyst at Forrester Research   I think that most retailers will probably just eat the margin  
In a research report last year  Forrester found that a majority of consumers  59   weigh shipping costs when they re shopping online  Low prices and low delivery costs are  the top two reasons they ll revisit an e retail site   Internet Retailer reported 
Logan Purk  an an Edward Jones analyst  told the Associated Press that firms like Amazon will pack some items like books and CDs more tightly than in the past  but  will continue generous packing for fragile items 
Purk had a slightly different opinion on whether or not online retailers would pass on price hikes  adding   Amazon can keep shipping the way they do now and maybe that cost gets passed on to consumers  
The same explosion in online shopping that s given shippers the leverage to adjust pricing has also prompted Amazon to look into alternative delivery options 
In April the Wall Street Journal reported that  Amazon is studying and testing a plan to deliver packages to their final destination themselves  That so called  last mile  delivery test is being tried in San Francisco  Los Angeles and New York  the Journal said 

UPS  which already calculates dimensional weight for packages sent by air  said that as a result of e commerce shipping  packages are less dense than they used to be  even if they still occupy valuable space   This trend causes cargo space to be less efficiently utilized  resulting in an increased cost per package  
Still  it s unclear at this stage just how much size adjusted costs will impact e commerce retailers on the whole  Companies that do more business shipping bulky items like diapers  for example  might feel the effects more   It s going to vary because not everyone is going to be affected by the pricing in the same way   Mulpuru said 
When it comes to absorbing costs  large retailers like Amazon have an advantage over smaller stores in that they can pre negotiate rates with shipping carriers  Mulpuru said  Smaller retailers  meanwhile  could opt to hedge costs by pushing options like in store pickup  she added ",2014-06-18,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/ups-and-fedex-set-to-raise-prices-290425,290425
165547,387063,FDX,FedEx faces U S  criminal charges over online pharmacies,news,"By Dan Levine SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    FedEx Corp was indicted on Thursday for shipping packages from illegal online pharmacies despite repeated warnings from U S  drug enforcement officials  according to a court filing 
The 15 count indictment  handed down by a federal grand jury in San Francisco  includes charges for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances 
In a statement  FedEx Senior Vice President Patrick Fitzgerald said the company is innocent and will plead not guilty 
 FedEx transports more than 10 million packages a day   Fitzgerald said   The privacy of our customers is essential to the core of our business  This privacy is now at risk  
Beginning in 2004  FedEx was warned  on no less than six different occasions  that illegal Internet pharmacies were using its services to distribute prescription drugs  the indictment said  Those warnings extended to senior management at the company  the filing said 

In one instance  FedEx knew the Drug Enforcement Administration shut down one pharmacy  but continued to ship packages from its affiliates 
FedEx s Fitzgerald said U S  prosecutors are asking that the company assume responsibility for the legality of millions of packages a day 
 We are a transportation company  We are not law enforcement   he said

165548,387064,FDX,UPS  Fedex get approval for express services in more Chinese cities,news,"SHANGHAI  Reuters    After years of waiting  United Parcel Service Inc  UPS   N UPS  and FedEx Corp  N FDX  have received licenses in China to extend domestic express package services to Beijing and other cities without needing joint venture partners 
The U S  companies had been waiting for permission to independently courier packages from businesses to consumers  B2C  via their entire Chinese networks  since a 2009 postal law largely restricted foreign firms to delivering packages from abroad 
The licenses increase access to a market second in size only to the United States  Thanks to online shopping  the Chinese market is growing 60 percent annually and next year could be worth 280 billion yuan   46 billion   said consultancy Deloitte 
 We now have 33 licenses   UPS President of Global Public Affairs Laura Lane told Reuters   The government just approved them in May   Lane said  referring to UPS s latest 14 licenses for cities including Beijing  Wuhan and Hefei 
 We re really looking at developing those capabilities in those 33 cities  expanding our investment   Lane said   But we haven t developed a concrete plan yet in terms of where we want to go beyond those 33 cities  
FedEx received 21 licenses in May  returning its total to the 58 it held before the 2009 law  a spokesman told Reuters  Each license permits the holder to operate B2C domestic express package services within a single city and between cities for which a license is also held 
 We have been working closely with the relevant authorities to obtain the express delivery services permits for our business   the spokesman said   So far we have received all the permits for our domestic business  
Neither company has disclosed the size of their businesses in China  where since 2009 they have mainly handled documents and packages to and from overseas  But both companies have cited China as one of their fastest growing markets 
UPS and FedEx had to reapply for licenses to offer domestic B2C services after the law changed  In 2012  the pair were granted their first five and eight respectively  FedEx was able to continue offering services by entering joint ventures with local peers 
But even at full strength  UPS and FedEx still face daunting competition in state backed China Post and large  privately run rivals such as Shentong Express and S F  Express 
Seeming willingness among private services to cut margins to win customers also constitutes a challenge  Deutsche Post AG s  DE DPWGn  DHL courier service pulled out of its money losing China domestic delivery business in 2011 citing a lack of cost advantage 
UPS s Lane said allowing greater competition would help improve standards across China s logistics industry 
 With greater competition there s always the beneficial effect of raising the professionalism and quality of services that consumers come to expect   Lane said

 NEW YORK  Sept 17  Reuters    U S  stocks were little
changed on Thursday after results from FedEx Corp tumbled and
several economic reports pointed to a fragile recovery 
 Trading was choppy a day after Wall Street hit 2009 highs
on optimism about a global recovery  Stocks have risen eight of
the last nine sessions on strong data and a pickup in merger
and acquisition activity 
 Shipping company FedEx  considered an economic bellwether 
slid 3 percent to  75 88 after it reported first quarter
earnings that fell 53 percent from the prior year  The company
also said it was planning rate increases to offset falling
surcharge revenue 
 Data on housing and Mid Atlantic business activity included
gains  but parts of the reports raised caution flags 
 In another report the number of U S  workers filing new
claims for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly last week 
  The employment trends continue to improve  but we re still
not anywhere near what our economy is capable of   said Rob
Stein  managing partner at Astor Asset Management in Chicago 
 Business activity in the Mid Atlantic states jumped more
than expected in September  advancing to its highest level
since June 2007  but indexes on orders and employment fell 
 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank data  is encouraging 
but there are lingering concerns that the employment trend in
the pipeline isn t as robust as the market might suggest  I m
expecting a consolidation   Stein said 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 27 05 points  or
0 28 percent  to 9 818 38  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index   
 added 2 32 points  or 0 22 percent  to 1 071 13  The Nasdaq
Composite Index  rose 4 32 points  or 0 2 percent  to
2 137 49 
 New U S  housing starts and permits increased to their
highest level since November  largely due to a big gain in
multifamily starts 
  Without the rally we had earlier this week  I think we d
have a lot more upside today   said Alan Lancz  president of
Alan B  Lancz   Associates in Toledo  Ohio 
  The markets are starting to discount optimism  and if the
market didn t reflect this  we d definitely have at least a
triple digit gain in the Dow  
 Weighing on the Nasdaq was Oracle Corp  which fell 2 8
percent to  21 51 a day after reporting first quarter revenue
that missed expectations 
 Discover Financial gained 4 6 percent to  16 03 after it
reported a third quarter profit that was above consensus

four different types of September equity futures and options
contracts    a convergence known as quadruple witching

165578,387094,FDX,Chart Of The Day  Are UPS Shares About To Deliver More Upside ,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
As United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  gets ready to report its latest earnings tomorrow before the market open  experts are weighing in with their best predictions  FactSet s median EPS expectation is for  1 45  while Estimize expects  1 49  versus  1 44 YoY  with a revenue of  15 62 billion according to FactSet and  15 75 for Estimize  versus  14 93 billion YoY 
3 Questions Weigh On UPS
The first question that on investors minds is whether UPS management is lowballing guidance to avoid disappointing markets and investors  UPS Chief Financial Operator Richard Peretz  that  earnings per share should be relatively flat when compared with last year  
He also claimed a stronger dollar and higher fuel prices would offset third quarter profits  Finally  he posited that a shorter quarter  by one day  should hurt profits too  This long list of preemptive reasons for poor earnings reads like an attempt to lower expectations and avoid upcoming disappointment 
Secondly  the recent acquisition of Whole Foods begs the question  what impact will this have on UPS  While the Whole Foods acquisition is expected to contribute to the bottom line next year  it s unclear what the impact will be for the remainder of this year  Piper Jaffray expects a  1 4 billion contribution for the month of September 
Finally  investors worry whether UPS will be able to handle this year s holiday peak  UPS  as well as FedEx  NYSE FDX    in 2013  for which they overcompensated in 2014  Both being understaffed initially  then being overstaffed the following year hurt profits 
Will UPS get it right this year 
The Technicals

The price has traded within a continuing flag formation  First  it formed the flag pole  between September 7 at  114  and September 18 at the high price of 118 36  The breakout on September 26 achieved about half of the flag s implicated target and fell back below the flag s top  rendering it a failure  However  the flag s bottom maintained support at that level  As if to compensate  a second  larger continuing Pennant pattern developed  with the same continuation psychology as the flag  only the pattern is much bigger with an equally bigger target 
On Friday  the price penetrated the top of the pennant  but failed to hold on to gains  forming a bearish shooting star  In the following two sessions  the price failed to penetrate the shooting star s resistance  but also managed to stay completely above the pattern  suggesting this may have been the return move 
Recently  there has been an unusually high volume of large blocks of call options  as far as into 2020  This looks like the footprints of large institutions  suggesting smart money demand is rising 
There is also one more thing to consider 

The price stopped at the December 2016 high  This could prove a catalyst for a significant jump or a reversal  depending on whether buyers overcome everyone who remembers the 15 percent fall that followed that price within the next 7 months and thinks the move may repeat itself 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would wait for further evidence of the uptrend s integrity with a peak higher than the October 2   120 80 high  then wait for a dip 
Moderate traders may wait for a close above the shooting star s  120 43 resistance  before joining in a long position 
Aggressive traders may go long now  with a stop loss beneath the  119 level 
Very aggressive traders may enter a contrarian short position  with a stop loss above the shooting star  upon a potential additional round within the pennant before a real breakout  before joining in a long position  They also may enter a long position upon the failure of this short position ",2017-10-25,Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chart-of-the-day-investors-about-to-drive-up-ups-200220863,200220863

 NEW YORK  Sept 11  Reuters    Crude fell and U S  stocks
edged lower on Friday after five days of gains  even as
encouraging U S  and Chinese data and a sliding U S  dollar
were unable to provide oil and equity markets further lift 
 The U S  dollar fell for a fifth straight session to nearly
a one year low against other major currencies as the economic
news raised recovery prospects and the low cost of borrowing in

 The dollar s sell off propelled the euro to a fresh 2009

 The safe haven dollar struggled this week as investors bet
on recovery  with investors buying commodity linked and

 By Chris Reese
 NEW YORK  Sept 11  Reuters    Improving U S  consumer
sentiment and a big drawdown in wholesale inventories on Friday
built on recent evidence that an economic recovery was picking
up speed 
 Shipping firm FedEx Corp  added to the growing sense
of economic recovery when it said profits would be higher than
it had earlier expected  citing an improving economy and fuel
prices  For details see  ID nN11440004  
 Evidence of a durable recovery is coming in from all
quarters with economic data  company earnings and big drivers
of global growth like China all signaling strength ahead 
Concerns about a frail jobs market continue to temper optimism
about the U S  recovery  however 
  We are in a recovery  but it is a weak recovery   
because the consumer is still very strained on the income
side   said Kurt Karl  head of economic research at Swiss Re in
New York 
 Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans on Friday
said the United States was  tentatively  emerging from a severe
recession   ID nN11443763 
 The Reuters University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers
said the preliminary reading of its consumer confidence index
for September rose to 70 2  the highest since June  from 65 7
in August  This was above economists  median expectation of a
reading of 67 3  according to a Reuters poll 
 Sentiment is believed to correlate closely with consumer
spending  and consumers may be tentatively loosening their
purse strings in response 
  Things look like they re looking up  but our habits have
changed permanently in many ways   said Ridie Ghezzie  a
librarian at Dartmouth College in Hanover  New Hampshire  while
browsing in the furniture section at Macy s department store in
New York 
  During the year when things were really bad  we really
stopped everything  and we ve changed our lifestyle in ways
I ve almost forgotten about now    we don t go out to dinners
much anymore   Ghezzie said 
 INVENTORIES FALL
 Inventories at U S  wholesalers in July fell to their
lowest in nearly three years  declining for the 11th month
after sharp drops in furniture and metals stocks  government
data showed  suggesting consumer demand was reviving 
 The Commerce Department said total wholesale inventories
dropped 1 4 percent to  387 2 billion  the lowest level since
September 2006  after a revised 2 1 percent decline in June 
Economists had expected a 1 0 percent drop in July from June 
 The data helped to give Wall Street stocks a brief boost 
but shares later edged lower as crude oil prices fell  U S 
Treasury bonds  seen as a safe haven investment in times of
economic uncertainty  shrugged off the data to trade higher 
 U S  import prices jumped 2 0 percent in August as the cost
of oil rose  the U S  Labor Department said  The increase 
twice what analysts had expected  was the fifth rise in the
last six months  It followed a July drop of 0 7 percent 
 Excluding petroleum  import prices increased a much milder
0 4 percent in August after falling 0 3 percent in July 
 The U S  government has pumped billions of dollars into the
economy to help lift it from the worst downturn in decades at
the same time as tax receipts have fallen considerably  leading
to record deficits that have many worried about the country s
long term fiscal health 
 The August budget deficit of  111 40 billion  while far
smaller than the  152 billion gap forecast by economists 
marked a record matching 11 straight months of deficits 
 ID nN11378259 
 A decline in outlays in August compared with a year earlier
was partly due to calendar issues  which led some federal
benefit payments to be shifted to July  August receipts also
shrank  but at a slower pace than for the full fiscal year to
date 
 In China  industrial output for August and other economic
data on Friday were a positive surprise suggesting the economy
is on a solid course but not so strong that Beijing will need
to hit the policy brakes any time soon   ID nPEK13979 
 The only weak spot in the Chinese data was trade  Exports
fell 23 4 percent from a year earlier  a sharper drop than
expected and accelerating from July s 23 percent fall as global
demand remained frail   ID nBJB000663 
 Despite some economic optimism  the head of the
International Monetary Fund  Dominique Strauss Kahn said
governments around the world should not put a stop to
supportive economic policies given the economic crisis had not
yet come to an end

165615,387131,FDX,WRAPUP 3 U S  consumer sentiment improves  inventories drop,news," Adds details on August U S  budget deficit 
   U S  consumer sentiment rises in September
   August wholesale inventories fall by more than expected
   U S  import prices spike last month with oil costs
   U S  August budget deficit smaller than expected
 By Chris Reese
 NEW YORK  Sept 11  Reuters    Improving U S  consumer
sentiment and a big drawdown in wholesale inventories on Friday
built on recent evidence that an economic recovery was picking
up speed 
 Shipping firm FedEx Corp  added to the growing sense
of economic recovery when it said profits would be higher than
it had earlier expected  citing an improving economy and fuel
prices  For details see  ID nN11440004  
 Evidence of a durable recovery is coming in from all
quarters with economic data  company earnings and big drivers
of global growth like China all signaling strength ahead 
Concerns about a frail jobs market continue to temper optimism
about the U S  recovery  however 
  We are in a recovery  but it is a weak recovery   
because the consumer is still very strained on the income
side   said Kurt Karl  head of economic research at Swiss Re in
New York 
 Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans on Friday
said the U S  was  tentatively  emerging from a severe
recession   ID nN11443763  
 The Reuters University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers
said the preliminary reading of its consumer confidence index
for September rose to 70 2  the highest since June  from 65 7
in August  This was above economists  median expectation of a
reading of 67 3  according to a Reuters poll 
  It s not really a surprise given the gains in stocks that
we ve seen and the data pointing more toward a recovery in
hand   said Kim Rupert  managing director of global fixed
income analysis at Action Economics LLC in San Francisco 
 Inventories at U S  wholesalers in July fell to their
lowest level in nearly three years  declining for the 11th
straight month after sharp drops in furniture and metals
stocks  government data showed  suggesting consumer demand was
reviving 
 The Commerce Department said total wholesale inventories
dropped 1 4 percent to  387 2 billion  the lowest level since
September 2006  after a revised 2 1 percent decline in June 
Economists had expected a 1 0 percent drop in July from June 
 The data helped to give Wall Street stocks a brief boost 
but shares later edged lower as crude oil prices fell  U S 
Treasuries shrugged off the data to trade higher 
 U S  import prices jumped 2 0 percent in August as the cost
of oil rose  the U S  Labor Department said  The increase 
twice what analysts had expected  was the fifth rise in the
last six months  It followed a July drop of 0 7 percent 
 Excluding petroleum  import prices increased a much milder
0 4 percent in August after falling 0 3 percent in July 
 U S  DEFICIT SMALLER THAN FORECAST
 The U S  government has pumped billions of dollars into the
economy to help lift it from the worst downturn in decades at
the same time as tax receipts have fallen considerably  leading
to record deficits that have many worried about the country s
long term fiscal health 
 The August budget deficit of  111 40 billion  while far
smaller than the  152 billion gap forecast by economists 
marked a record matching 11 straight months of deficits 
 ID nN11378259  
  A decline in outlays in August compared with a year
earlier was partly due to calendar issues  which led some
federal benefit payments to be shifted to July  August receipts
also shrank  but at a slower pace than for the full fiscal year
to date 
 In China  industrial output for August and other economic
data reported earlier on Friday were a positive surprise
suggesting the economy is on a solid course but not so strong
that Beijing will need to hit the policy brakes any time soon 
 ID nPEK13979  
 The only weak spot in the Chinese data was trade  Exports
fell 23 4 percent from a year earlier  a sharper drop than
expected and accelerating from July s 23 percent fall as global
demand remained frail   ID nBJB000663  
 Despite some economic optimism  the head of the
International Monetary Fund  Dominique Strauss Kahn said
governments around the world should not put a stop to
supportive economic policies given the economic crisis had not
yet come to an end 
 In an interview set to appear in Saturday s edition of
French daily Le Monde  Strauss Kahn also said that reforms
related to financial regulation were progressing too slowly

  Updates to midmorning 
 NEW YORK  Sept 11  Reuters    U S  stocks were little
changed on Friday as positive data and a rosier outlook from
FedEx supported hopes for economic recovery  but Wall Street
struggled for traction after five days of gains

shares higher after it said profits in both its current and
subsequent quarters would be higher than previously expected 
citing an improving economy and stable fuel prices  Its shares
surged 6 7 percent to  77 54 
 Data showed consumer sentiment rose in early September to
the strongest level in three months with growing expectations
the economy will improve  Investors have been looking for any
signs of life from the consumer as anemic spending remains one
of the biggest challenges facing a strong recovery 
 Surprisingly strong industrial output and other economic
data from China also underscored optimism that the global
economy is pulling out of a slump

165631,387147,FDX,Will FedEx  FDX  Prove To Be Suitable Value Investment ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put FedEx Corporation   NYSE FDX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  FedEx has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 55  This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 09 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts FedEx s current PE near its median  which stands at 17x  over the observed period  Notably  the current level is much below the highs experienced for the stock over the period  suggesting some level of undervalued trading in light of its own historical trend  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the air freight industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 18  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that FedEx has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 13   which is lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for FedEx stock in the near term too PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  FedEx has a P S ratio of about 0 91  This is much lower than the air freight industry average  which comes in at 1 4x right now  As we can see  the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P S metric  This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  FedEx currently has a Value Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes FedEx a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the EV EBITDA multiple for FedEx is just 8 19  a level that is lower than the industry average of 9 75  The EV EBITDA multiple  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  is capital structure neutral  as it takes into account the level of debt on a company s balance sheet  not just its equity Clearly  FDX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though FedEx might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives FDX a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward revisions and five downward revisions in the same time period This has had a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased 1 6  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below FedEx Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineFedEx is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 46  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock We are also impressed by the company s efforts to reward shareholders through share buybacks and dividends  In June this year  the company raised its quarterly dividend by 25  to  0 50 a share  or  2 annually  from  0 40  or  1 60 annually   We believe that the dividend hike not only highlights FedEx s commitment to create value for shareholders but also underscores the company s strong financial condition and confidence in its business prospects  Moreover  a look at past records reveals FedEx s stable dividend payment history So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting

are allowing customers to change travel plans to Mexico without
any fee or penalty after a swine flu outbreak  but they said
 on Sunday there had been no flight cancellations so far 
 AMR Corp s American Airlines  Continental Airlines Inc and
US Airways Group Inc all said they had received some inquiries
and were letting customers change travel plans 
  We have had a few calls from customers but not huge
numbers of them seeking changes or information so far   said
American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith   We are told that
authorities in Mexico are closely monitoring passengers who are
leaving as they go through security as well  
 In Detroit  cargo carrier FedEx Corp said it will adhere to
any guidelines or restrictions put in place by the U S  Centers
for Disease Control 
  We are watching this situation very closely and our first
priority is the safety of our employees and the general
public   said FedEx spokeswoman Sandra Munoz 
 Fears of a global swine flu pandemic have grown with new
infections in the United States and Canada  and millions of
Mexicans stayed indoors to avoid a virus that has killed up to
81 people  The only deaths have been in Mexico  but the flu has
spread with 20 cases in the United States  six in Canada  and
possible cases in Europe and New Zealand 
 The Centers for Disease Control has asked U S  airlines to
continue standard policies for identifying  reporting and
managing communicable diseases for passengers arriving in the
United States  No additional screening has been proposed or
required at this time  according to the trade group
representing major U S  airlines 
 The CDC has issued precautions about traveling to Mexico
but has not recommended that people avoid going there  Some
airlines have put in place flexible travel schedules or
policies that allow passengers to rebook flights

 NEW YORK  June 17  Reuters    U S  stock index futures were

inflation data for May and quarterly results from package
delivery company FedEx Corp that may shed light on the strength
of the economic recovery 
 After the recent surge in commodity prices and oil s brief

the May Consumer Price Index whether inflation pressures are
seeping into the broader economy

 FRANKFURT  June 17  Reuters    European shares fell for the
fourth straight session on Wednesday amid doubts about a return
to economic growth  which hammered commodity stocks  and with

health 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 1 9
percent to 845 76 points    its lowest close since May 15    but
remains up 1 7 percent year to date 
  We ve seen a couple of weak days but no radical sell off  
said Commerzbank Chief Strategist Hans Juergen Delp  who
attributed the downward move to a persistent discrepancy between
upbeat sentiment indicators and weak real economy data 
  The sentiment indicators have been positive but have not
been backed up by hard real economic data   he said 
  We need new impulses to kick off sustained gains but no
such impulses are in sight  
 Banks took the most points off the European benchmark index 
 Standard   Poor s lowered its ratings and revised its
outlooks on 22 U S  banks 
  Operating conditions for the industry will become less
favorable     characterized by greater volatility in financial
markets during credit cycles  and tighter regulatory

 TRIPLE WITCHING

simultaneous expiry of stock index futures  stock index options

 Technical analysts  or chartists  at UniCredit  said that
impact may have run its course by now

The largest exchange traded fund to track this index is the iShares Transportation Average ETF  NYSE IYT   with  866 million under management  IYT debuted in 2003 and is an easy way for investors to access this historic index in a transparent and low cost vehicle 
Top holdings in IYT include  FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   Norfolk Southern  NYSE NSC   and United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS   It s market cap weighted structure means that the largest three companies account for over 28  of the total portfolio makeup  Remember that IYT has just 20 holdings  albeit major corporations with a truly global footprint 
More recently the price action of IYT has begun to diverge from the broader market  IYT peaked in July and has dropped approximately 6  in a matter of weeks as many of its top components grapple with earnings season woes 

This ETF has gained just  2 55  year to date through July 30 compared to  11 48  for the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY   One potential headwind for this fund is the short term strength of crude oil prices  which tend to negatively impact logistics  airline  and shipping companies  Higher input costs lead to compressed margins and thinner earnings growth 
It s also worth noting that this same pattern has been extending towards smaller stocks in this category as well  The SPDR S P Transportation ETF  NYSE XTN  is a modified equal weighted index with a wider selection of 45 companies within its portfolio  XTN gives each of its holdings a similar distribution of capital to allow smaller stocks an equal opportunity to contribute towards performance 
This ETF has also begun what could be the early stages of a correction with a 4  drop from its July highs  That price move has erased much of its gains for the year and may lead to flared concerns about the health of the global economy if further declines unfold 

Investors who want to explore this category further can also reference the US Global Jets ETF NYSE JETS   This exchange traded fund focuses on a  within the transport industry and includes some defense companies in its portfolio as well  It offers a unique way to invest in the transportation theme for those who want specific exposure to this segment of the economy 
The Bottom Line
The recent drop in transportation stocks may simply be the result of earnings hiccups combined with a surging cost environment  However  it s worth noting that many investors closely follow these indicators due to their longevity in the global marketplace as well as their fundamental impact on the economy

165677,387193,FDX,UPS  outlook unclear  so no peak package forecast,news,"By Nick Carey
 CHICAGO  Nov 16  Reuters    United Parcel Service Inc
  the world s largest package delivery company  will not
issue a peak shipping volume forecast for the coming holiday
season  saying that the current economic environment makes it
difficult to issue an accurate projection 
  While it is a bit unusual for UPS not to make peak
projections  these are unusual times for the U S  economy  
company spokesman Norman Black said in an email to reporters 
 Black said that early indicators such as a 2 8 percent drop
in October U S  retail sales made  any projection difficult  
  UPS is well prepared behind the scenes to ensure the
highest levels of customer service and we intend to provide the
best service in the industry   he added    We re just not
comfortable making public projections this year  
 Atlanta based UPS ships an average of 15 million packages
daily  Last year the company forecast that it expected to
handle 22 million packages on its peak shipping day  which
always falls during the week leading up to Christmas 
 Like Memphis based FedEx Corp   UPS is considered a
bellwether of U S  economic activity  based on the simple
premise that in a healthy economy companies and consumers ship
and order more goods 
 FedEx has not yet issued a forecast for its peak shipping
day for this year 
 Just this past week DHL  the express delivery unit of
Deutsche Post AG   announced that it was shutting
down its U S  domestic service as of Jan  30  with the loss of
9 500 jobs 
 DHL bought Airborne Inc in 2003 with the aim of taking on
UPS and FedEx on their home turf  But after five years of an
uphill struggle against the brand recognition and dominance of
its two U S  rivals  DHL said the slowing U S  economy had made
it impossible to continue

165695,387211,FDX, FedEx  FDX  Down 6 3  Since Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for FedEx Corporation   NYSE FDX    Shares have lost about 6 3  in that time frame  underperforming the market 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Third quarter earningsFedEx Corporation s third quarter fiscal 2017  ended Feb 28  2017  earnings per share  on an adjusted basis  of  2 35 fell well short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 63  Moreover  earnings declined 6 4  on a year over year basis  Quarterly revenues climbed 18 1  year over year to  14 997 million  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  14 956 4 million While  operating income  on an adjusted basis  declined 3 4  year over year to  1 12 billion in the quarter  operating margin declined 170 basis points to 7 5  during the quarter Segmental PerformanceQuarterly revenues at FedEx Express inched up 3  to  6 78 billion driven by increased base rates and higher package volume  While  operating income declined 1 5  to  586 million in the reported quarter  segmental operating margin declined to 8 6   In addition  operating results were negatively impacted by higher fuel costs and the presence of one less operating day Revenues at the TNT Express segment came in at  1 79 billion during the quarter  Operating margin  on an adjusted basis  was 2 2  Moreover  FedEx Ground revenues increased 6  year over year to  4 69 billion in the fiscal third quarter  The rise was due to volume expansion and higher base rates aided the segmental performance during the quarter  While  operating income came in at  515 million  down 8   operating margin depreciated 160 bps to 11   Increased rent coupled with higher fuel costs and the presence of one less operating day in the quarter contributed to the lackluster segmental operating results FedEx Freight revenues grew 3  year over year to  1 49 billion  aided by higher base rates and fuel surcharges  Average daily shipments were flat on a year over year basis  The segment s operating income decreased 27  to  41 million  Operating margin was 2 7   down 120 bps  Segmental operating results were hurt by higher costs 
Fiscal 2017 View The company still expects earnings in the band of  11 85  12 35 per share  excluding TNT Express related integration expenses and other costs  Including the impact of the acquisition of TNT Express  the company expects fiscal 2017 earnings in the band of  10 80 to  11 30  old guidance   10 95  11 45 per share   The guidance assumes moderate economic growth Capital expenses  including TNT Express buyout  are now projected at  5 3 billion  old guidance  5 6 billion    The outlook was trimmed due to lower anticipated investments at its ground unit The company mentioned that the TNT Express integration process is on track  Additionally  it said that instead of being reported separately from fiscal 2018  its TNT Express segment will be included in its Express unit  Consequently  FedEx expects an operating income improvement at its Express unit in the band of  1 2 billion to  1 5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2017

At this time  FedEx s stock has a subpar Growth Score of  D   however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a  C   Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of  B  on the value side  putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregte VGM Score of  C   If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than momentum investors 
Outlook

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  declined 7 points to 20 661  the S P 500 Index rose 4 points  0 2   to 2 344  and the NASDAQ Composite gained 28 points  0 5   to 5 822  In moderate volume  899 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 8 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil ticked  0 20 lower to  48 04 per barrel and wholesale gasoline lost a penny to  1 60 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price gained  3 05 to  1 247 86 per ounce  and the dollar index  a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies  was 0 1  lower at 99 69 
After the closing bell yesterday  Nike Inc   NYSE NKE  54  reported 3Q diluted earnings per share  EPS  of  0 68  well above the  0 53 FactSet estimate  while revenues increased 5 0  year over year  y y  to  8 4 billion just shy of expectations  The company also reported that its gross margin had contracted 140 basis points to 44 5   as higher average selling prices were more than offset by higher product costs  unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of higher off price sales  Shares of NKE lost solid ground 
FedEx Corp   NYSE FDX  196  also reported after yesterday s close  announcing 3Q EPS of  2 07 per diluted share or  2 35 on an adjusted basis  falling short of the  2 62 consensus forecast  while revenues rose 18 1  y y to  15 0 billion  matching estimates  FDX noted that its operating results were impacted by the significantly negative net impact of fuel and one fewer operating day  but these factors were partially offset by the benefits from yield growth at all of the company s transportation segments  FDX traded higher

Existing home sales in February declined 3 7  month over month  m m  to a 5 48 million annual rate  compared to the Bloomberg forecast of a 5 55 million pace  February s figure was unrevised at a 5 69 million annual rate  which is the highest since February 2007  Sales of single family homes fell 3 0  m m and purchases of condominium and co op units dropped 9 2   The median existing home price was up 7 7  y y at  228 400  Housing supply came in at a 3 8 month pace at the current sales rate  and the inventory of homes for sale is down 6 4  y y  Sales in the South were higher m m  and were lower in the Northeast  Midwest and West 
National Association of Realtors  NAR  Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said 

The speed of transactions is very fast and we know that there s an inventory shortage  Buying interest remains very solid and strong but we have a bottleneck  We don t have enough inventory to satisfy that buying interest 

The MBA Mortgage Application Index fell 2 7  last week  following the previous week s 3 1  gain  The decrease came as a 3 3  decline for the Refinance Index was met with a 2 1  decrease for the Purchase Index  The average 30 year mortgage rate was unchanged from the previous week s 4 46  
Treasuries finished higher  as the yields on the 2 year and 10 year notes  as well as the 30 year bond decreased 2 bps to 1 24   2 40  and 3 02   respectively 
Helping to bolster our belief in a strengthening economy  and our bullish stance  is the increased hawkishness of the Federal Reserve and their decision to hike rates at the March Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  meeting  Additionally  the Fed signaled willingness to continue to hike rates in the coming months  which would mark the first time we would see more than one hike in a year since the financial crisis

165712,387228,FDX,Bull Of The Day  Radiant Logistics  RLGT ,opinion,"Radiant Logistics  RLGT  rallied on Friday with volume that was approaching twice the normal amount   Before the close I looked back at the last five trading days and I saw this stock up  13  for the week  but that should be no surprise for a stock that has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Growth Style Score of  A    Today  RLGT is the Bull of the Day 
Low Priced Mover
I recently published a strategy piece that talks about using a wider net to catch more winners   You can read more about that here      and I bring that up because this stock would fall in that net   It is a low priced stock that has the growth and the Zacks Rank that we are looking for 
Description
Radiant Logistics  Inc  operates as a third party logistics company  providing multi modal transportation and logistics services  
Earnings
The earnings history for RLGT isn t the greatest I have ever seen  but I love what the most recent report looked like   The company reported EPS of  0 10 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for only a penny   That 9 cent beat was good for a 900  positive earnings surprise 
The topline came in ahead of expectations by  9M or about 5  ahead of expectations   The end result of such a solid beat was the stock launching higher by 19  in the session following the release 
Estimates
I was trying to think of a good way of explaining what it looks like when you see the Zacks Consensus Estimate move from a gain to a loss to a massive gain   The best way I came up with is to show you what I see 

Now movements like this come after a big beat  but you can see that there was some negativity around this stock in February but that has all changed 
Thing is  that near term negativity wasn t present for the longer term   The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate was  0 14 in January and it kicked higher to  0 15 in February   By the end of March the number lifted to  0 20 following the early in the month earnings release   The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  0 20
Tailwinds
The trucking industry is rebounding   February and March both showed some solid growth of Class 8 truck orders   March saw 41  year over year growth and from the chart below you can see a good looking trend 

When you have the backbone of the transportation market growing like this it signals that there is some pretty healthy demand in the sector   A company like RLGT will probably benefit from this trend 
Valuation
The valuation for RLGT is pretty good once you get passed the forward PE that shows the stock trading at a small premium to the industry average   RLGT has a forward PE of 23x and that is just ahead of the 18x industry average   The price to book multiple of 2 1x is below where most value investors set a limit of about 3x   the industry average of P B multiple is an astronomical 35x   but that could be a case of bad data   The price to sales multiple for RLGT is 0 4x while the industry average is 1x   To me  this is a great valuation for a stock that looks to have excellent earnings growth along with some strong tailwinds

The ramifications of government policy change under Trump  especially fiscal policy  have the potential to be huge  Since Election Day  we ve seen the strong U S  dollar hurt gold  while the Canadian dollar and Chinese renminbi have dropped 
The question now is whether Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will put the brakes on the so called Trump rally  She asserts that Fed policy is not politically motivated  but I wonder how many people actually believe that  She s already criticized Trump s plans to tear up or at least significantly weaken Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform 
Both former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan and billionaire investor Warren Buffett have recently suggested Dodd Frank needs to go  with Greenspan telling CNBC that  Buffett  meanwhile  commented  that the U S  is  less well equipped to handle a financial crisis today than we were in 2008 
Dodd Frank has taken away the Federal Reserve s ability to act in a crisis  
Since the election  banks have seen strong inflows  as investors are betting that the financial industry could be one of the largest beneficiaries of Trump s administration 
According to   Animal spirits and higher confidence have returned  and investors are now expecting a better revenue  expense  tax  capital and regulatory profile for financials   In addition   we might have just flipped from feeling pretty late cycle right back to early cycle depending on how much we want to buy into Trump s pro growth agenda  
Americans Take Advantage of Low Inflation
Last year  lower gas prices helped American households save  700 on average  Although savings aren t likely to be as much this year  Americans managed to save in other ways namely  food and beverages 
According to the  the cost of a typical Thanksgiving meal for 10 consisting of a turkey  stuffing  sweet potatoes  cranberries  a pumpkin pie and other traditional sides fell 24 cents from last year s average to  49 87  That translates to a per person cost of just under  5  confirming that  U S  consumers benefit from an abundant high quality and affordable food supply   says AFBF Director of Market Intelligence Dr  John Newton 
As I ve said multiple times before  the U S  shale oil boom helped deliver an  oil peace dividend  to the world  which drove transportation costs and  therefore  food and beverage costs down over the past two years 


Low fuel costs also encouraged a huge number of families to hit the highway this Thanksgiving weekend  According to AAA  roughly  about 1 million more than last year  journeyed 50 miles or more from their homes  the most since 2007 
With gas prices at their second lowest level in a decade  driving remains the most popular mode of transportation  But as I previously shared with you  flying has also become more and more affordable for many Americans  This week  an estimated 27 million passengers flew on U S  airlines  an increase of 2 5 percent over last year 
Black Friday Is the New Cyber Monday
It isn t just travel that s back to pre recession levels  This year  it appears more Americans than ever before enjoying low inflation and rising wages will be spending their savings on gifts for friends and family  if estimates from the National Retail Federation  NRF  are accurate 
According to the retail trade association  as many as 137 4 million consumers planned to shop this Thanksgiving weekend  up a whopping 60 percent from last year s 135 8 million people  This includes both in store shopping as well as online shopping  which  as you might have noticed  is becoming a huge deal 
Black Friday remains the busiest shopping day  with 74 percent of consumers telling the NRF they planned to venture out into the crowds to take advantage of gotta have it bargains 
But e commerce is quickly catching up  with the internet only Cyber Monday second in sales to Black Friday  For the first time this holiday season  online purchases are expected to account for more than 10 percent of all retail sales  according to consumer research firm eMarketer   Online sales   reports   are likely to climb to  94 7 billion  representing almost 11 percent of total sales in November and December  an all time high  
The growing popularity of online shopping has prompted more and more brick and mortar retailers to push their e commerce sales earlier to Black Friday and even Thanksgiving Day  In years past  retailers waited until Cyber Monday to post digital discounts  but today they risk losing market share among shoppers who increasingly prefer making purchases off their laptop and smartphone 
One of these retailers is Walmart  NYSE WMT   which will start offering online sales two days in advance  in a bid to stay ahead of competitor Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   In a  the Arkansas based behemoth announced it has tripled its assortment of online products  from 8 million last year to more than 23 million today 
Another Record Year for Packages Delivered The rise in e commerce has had the inevitable effect of giving more business to ground and air delivery companies such as FedEx  NYSE FDX  and United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS   It s expected that  with online sales jumping 17 percent this year  the number of packages handled and shipped will jump to a record high 
According to  UPS the world s largest delivery company projects it will ship a record setting 700 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas  or 70 million more than the same time last year  FedEx hopes it can ship 10 percent more than the 325 million it delivered last year 
Meanwhile  Amazon s plans to establish its own in house transportation network have hit a setback  About 250 pilots contracted with Amazon partners Air Transport Service Group and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings went on strike Tuesday over a  longstanding labor dispute   The Jeff Bezos run retailer has been determined to deliver its own products after bad weather in 2013 delayed millions of Christmas deliveries  but it appears these efforts are off to a rough start

Strong volume growth in FedEx Ground continues to carry the slowing Express and Freight segments

Analysts at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of  2 81  16  higher than the same period last year  Revenue for the period is anticipated to jump 17  to  14 42 billion  marking it a second consecutive quarter of double digit gains  That estimate has increased 5  since FedEx s most recent report in June  Given its recent string of success  it s not surprising that FedEx consistently tops both the Estimize and Wall Street consensus 

FedEx currently reports three core financial segments  Express  Ground and Freight  At the moment  Express has been the standout performer  accounting for 40  of the company s operating income  followed by Ground and Freight  FedEx Express is the fastest and most expensive mode of delivery which makes the biggest contributions to income and margins  Ground  on the other hand  is seeing the greatest upside thanks to rising demand for e commerce purchases  For the fourth quarter  the ground segment reported revenue of 4 29 billion  20  higher than a year earlier

	It was a notion almost wholly dismissed that a September rate hike was at all possible up until the annual Fed retreat to Jackson Hole  where we began to hear a burgeoning chorus of Fed presidents coming out in favor of another quarter point raise  This  despite negative interest rates elsewhere on the globe  a meek continued recovery in the domestic markets and an upcoming General Election that appears to be tightening 
	Although Lockhart s statements this morning include that the U S  economy is  chugging along  not stalling out   he did openly wonder whether the current 25 basis point rate is still appropriate  For those paying close attention  Lockhart was already one of the FOMC members who d been on board for a rate increase at least as far back as Jackson Hole  along with Kansas City s Esther George  New York s William Dudley  and Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer 
	Eyes and ears are now finely tuned toward next week s meeting  assisted by the fact that we are still at a low ebb of economic data  Aside from this week s unique island of earnings reports   including important industry front runners like Oracle  NYSE ORCL    Nike  NYSE NKE   and FedEx  NYSE FDX     Q3 earnings season won t begin in earnest until a month from now  New jobs data  aside from weekly jobless claims  won t be forthcoming for a few more weeks  nor will new GDP reports 
	Consider this current sell off  for now  as nothing more than a near term hedge toward a  surprise  rate hike next week  though the overall climate still suggests no raise until this December at the earliest  Certainly the percentages of probability have gone up   as has the VIX  Volatility Index    but if this becomes another false alarm  expect to see a swift reversal of fortunes in the equity markets ",2016-09-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/futures-are-down-following-friday's-big-sell-off-200153085,200153085

165843,387359,FDX,These 2 Sectors Are About To Drive New Highs,opinion,"Is it all fake 
Once again  we hear rumblings about the markets  new all time highs and whether or not they re genuine 
There s an argument being made that recent highs on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are unsustainable  The belief is that unless a new all time high is also hit on the Dow Jones Transportation  there s no reason for a continued breakout 
I think that s bunk  As I ll show you  there s evidence to support the broader markets reaching new all time highs    again    before year s end 
And investors who play the trends behind these moves should profit handsomely 
Here s The Situation 
The last all time high for the Dow was August 15 at 18 722 61 
The last all time high for the Transports was back in November 2014 at 9 310 22 
Today the DJT is trading at 7 946 79  That means it s more than 14 5  below that high set nearly two years ago 
Admittedly  that s a lot of ground to cover before we see confirmation of the DJI s continued uptrend 
Year to date  Transports have lagged Industrials only slightly  Meanwhile  the retail sector   tracked below by the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF  NYSE RTH     is struggling   The retail and transport sectors are related since goods have to be shipped to stores  

Now  of the 30 components of the Transports index  six are airlines  These got rattled following Brexit and Zika  But prior to that  they were already dealing with concerns over terrorism 
Because of all that negativity  every airline that s a Dow Transports component is down double digits in 2016 

The remainder of the DJT index is railroads  trucking companies  freight shippers and plus package shippers United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  and FedEx  NYSE FDX   These businesses have all done pretty well this year 
But here s the deal  Not only is retail heading toward its best period of the year    what I call its Prime Period    but so are Transports 
Take a look at this chart  It shows the average monthly performance of the Dow Transports of the past five years 

We see that September  October  November  February and March are the best months for the index  In fact  the Dow Transports haven t fallen in October since 2009 
Now let s take a look at the average monthly performance of the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF  which holds the largest retailers in the world  Its largest holding  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  

We see a strikingly similar trend 
Both sectors    Transports and Retail    see their Prime Periods in October  with the momentum carrying over into November  Then we see a strong performance again in February and March 
It s really no surprise  Both sectors are largely dependent on consumers  And consumer spending accounts for more than 70  of U S  GDP  So when these markets enter their best periods of the year  it only makes sense that the broader markets will push higher 
Since 1993  the best month of the year for the S P 500 is October  It s the second best month of the year for the Dow Industrials 
Here s The Reality 
Despite all the negativity  gloom and auspiciousness that surrounds October for the broader markets  the Dow Jones Industrials have ended the month in the red only six times in the last 23 years 

Which brings us back to those concerns from the top of the article 
Is the Dow s uptrend over  Will we not see any more highs in 2016 
Is it all fake 
These types of questions have nagged our bull market for seven years  And the same old excuses are trotted out every time  Bears say the market s moves shouldn t be trusted because of central bank monetary policy    our sluggish economic recovery    so forth and so on 
The financial crisis of 2008 hurt a lot of investors financially  But many more were broken psychologically  Dealing with two major market crashes in less than 10 years created widespread distrust of the markets 
In response to that volatility  I did something different  That s where my Prime System ultimately came into being 
It s a short term focused  trend based trading strategy 
I don t spend my time fretting over the broader market s demise  Instead  I focus only on where I can see consistent profits over a short period of time  I move from one sector to the next during each of their Prime Periods throughout the year 
Because the truth is  There s always a bull market somewhere 
In October  it s likely to be in those two key sectors  Retail and Transports  Historically  the trend is on our side 
And I wouldn t be surprised if those sectors help push the broader markets to new all time highs

165866,387382,FDX,SPY Volume Drops  VIX Continues To Struggle,opinion,"Technical Outlook 
Massive bounce yesterday at around the 50 day moving average  and closing a shade below 2100 
Again the bears let go of another opportunity to jump start a sell off 
SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  volume dropped off yesterday and was notably below recent averages for the first time in 10 trading sessions 
VIX continues to struggle with the mid 16 s  following another test yesterday that failed and dropped VIX back down into the 14 s 
T2108    of stocks trading above their 40 day moving average  rose 7  yesterday to 53  
SPY gap from Monday s well off was filled yesterday 
Possible case can be made that there is an inverse head and shoulders pattern on SPY 30 minute chart though it is not typical of where they are usually found at 
For the bulls  need to get back above Friday s closing price 
For the bears  need to break below the double top confirmation level currently at 2030 
In general Q3 doesn t ten to be a very good quarter historically for stocks  In recent past that has also been the case  Last August  there was an extreme sell off 
Market is assuming that rate hikes are pretty much off the table for all of 2016 
My Trades 
Covered NYSE FDX yesterday at  151 19 for a 2  profit  
Added one new short position to the portfolio yesterday

In fact  transportation is not the only sector expected to post dismal numbers in the second quarter as 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to show earnings deceleration  According to the above report  total earnings for the S P 500 companies are expected to decline 6 2  and the top line is projected to contract 0 6  due to global concerns  In the event of the forecast coming true  this would be the fifth consecutive quarter of earnings deterioration for the S P 500 players

165897,387413,FDX,Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights  FedEx  Adobe  Nike And Oracle ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   June 30  2016   Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says   Another earnings decline this coming earnings season would be the 5th quarter in a row for the S P 500 index  

Tough Earnings Environment

We all know that the corporate earnings picture has been sub par for a while now  with growth in negative the last four quarters and the trend of earnings declines expected to continue in the Q2 earnings season as well  Another earnings decline this coming earnings season would be the 5th quarter in a row for the S P 500 index  This reflects not only the drag from the Energy sector and the U S  dollar s strength  but also maturation of the current earnings cycle that got underway in the fall of 2009 
	One relatively encouraging sign that emerged out of the last earnings season was that estimates for the current period  June quarter  didn t fall as much as had been the pattern in the preceding quarters  What this means is that while estimates for the June quarter fell as companies reported Q1 results  but the magnitude of negative revisions was below other recent periods  The turnaround in oil prices from the February 2016 lows and the fading impact of the dollar strength were big contributors to this favorable development 
	It will be interesting to see if we will notice a replay of this trend in the Q2 earnings season   we will be watching how estimates for the September quarter evolve as companies report their June quarter results in the coming weeks 
	Keep in mind  however  that the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already  as companies with fiscal quarters ending in May get counted as part of the June quarter tally  We have had results from 15 S P 500 members already   FedEx  NYSE FDX      Adobe     Nike  NYSE NKE      Oracle  NYSE ORCL      and many others have reported results already  Total earnings for these 15 index members are up  2 2  from the same period last year on  3 3  gains in revenues  with 60  beating EPS estimates and 53 3  coming ahead of top line expectations Estimates for Q2   Beyond
	Total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to be down  6 1  from the same period last year on  0 6  lower revenues  with earnings growth expected to be in the negative for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors  The Energy sector continues to be the big drag  but Q2 earnings growth for the index would still be in the negative even on an ex Energy basis 
	Many see the Q2 earnings season as the inflection point for corporate earnings  with the growth picture starting to improve from Q3 onwards and turning positive in the back half of the year  The proof of this narrative will become clear in the coming days as more companies report Q2 results and provide color on the evolving business picture

165913,387429,FDX,Will Q4 Earnings Be A Dampener For FedEx  FDX  Stock ,opinion,"Memphis  TN based FedEx Corporation   NYSE FDX   is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results on Jun 21  after market close 
In the third quarter  FedEx had reported better than expected earnings  However  the company s bottom line might take a hit in the fourth quarter from the escalated costs 
Our model too does not hint at an earnings beat in the first quarter  Here s why 
The possibility of FedEx beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter is rather low  This is because it lacks the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    that reflects the possibility of an earnings beat 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for FedEx is  1 84   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 6 cents lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 27 per share 
Zacks Rank  FedEx has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   However  that alone is not enough to secure an earnings beat 
Also  we caution against Sell rated stocks going into an earnings announcement  especially if the company has seen negative estimate revisions 
 Likely Factors at Play
FedEx has a mixed track record with respect to earnings  The company delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 2 05  FEDEX CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Last month  FedEx completed the acquisition of TNT Express for  4 4 billion  The buyout has significantly expanded FedEx s scale of operations  particularly in Europe  Following the completion of the deal  FedEx has strengthened its position in the lucrative e commerce business  The expansion of its capabilities has enabled FedEx to compete more effectively with rival United Parcel Service Inc    NYSE UPS   that has a substantial European presence 
Investors will keenly await updates on the integration process of the merger  We expect costs associated with deal to hurt FedEx s earnings in the fourth quarter  Moreover  FedEx s freight unit performed disappointingly in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 with segmental operating income declining 16  from the year ago figure  Focus will also be on the performance of the segment in the fourth quarter 
We are however encouraged by the company s focus on share buybacks and regular dividend payments to enhance shareholders  value  An update on the issue is expected during the fourth quarter conference call  We also expect the company to disclose its guidance for fiscal 2017 at the conference call  With so much to look forward to  we expect investor focus to remain on this key transportation player s results 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are a few transportation stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination for an earnings beat this quarter 
Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU   has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  0 92  
Grupo Aeroportuario del Pac fico  S A B  de C V    NYSE PAC   sports a Zacks Rank  1 and an Earnings ESP of  5 88  ",2016-06-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-q4-earnings-be-a-dampener-for-fedex-(fdx)-stock-200136461,200136461
165914,387430,FDX,Will FedEx Deliver Strong Earnings ,opinion,"FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX Industrials   Air Freight and Logistics   Reports June 21  After Market Closes
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  3 29 on  12 87 billion in revenue  3 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and over  50 million on the top
At the moment  the Express division has been the standout performer  accounting for 40  of the company s operating income followed by Ground and Freight
FedEx s acquisition of TNT Express  the FedEx of Europe  positions them to expand and grow their global air network
What are you expecting for  
The increasing popularity in ecommerce shopping has not only benefited online retailers like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  but delivery services as well  FedEx and United Parcel Service Inc  NYSE UPS  have seen margins and revenue expand given the recent influx of opportunities 
Despite some slowdown in the global economy  expectations are high that they will stay on track or exceed earnings expectations  FedEx  which is scheduled to report fiscal fourth quarter 2016 earnings tomorrow afternoon  is seeing strong momentum heading into its report 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  3 29 on  12 87 billion in revenue  3 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and over  50 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier this represents a 24  increase in earnings with sales expected to grow by as much as 6  
Despite strong earnings growth of late  the stock typically doesn t move during earnings season  In fact  shares of the logistics company are down nearly 6  in the past 12 months 
FedEx currently reports thee core financial segments  Express  Ground and Freight  At the moment  Express has been the standout performer accounting for 40  of the company s operating income followed by Ground and Freight 
FedEx Express is the fastest and most expensive mode of delivery which makes the biggest contributions to income and margins  This has unfortunately started to slow down as customers are shifting towards slower less expensive deliveries  Turning to Ground  FedEx is seeing strong business to consumer demand with ecommerce creating the most opportunities 
The company continues to make strategic investments to position itself as a worldwide leader in delivery services  Earlier this month FedEx acquired TNT Express  AS TNTE   in a move that aligns them to grow its extensive global air network 
TNT is essentially FedEx of Europe  so the merger should have strong synergies moving forward  New initiatives are important for maximizing profitability especially with the rapid growth in ecommerce

165940,387456,FDX,This Week s Top Trade Ideas  FedEx,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
FedEx  NYSE FDX   drove lower from a high last June  the final step a move from the December bounce to a low in January  Since then it reversed higher  driving back to that December high  This delivered a 40  return  But after consolidating for 6 weeks  it started to pull back again  Is it ready for more downside 
There are signals that it may actually be ready for another leg higher instead  The move back to December resistance and then short pullback sets up a Cup and Handle pattern  This pattern gives a target to 214 if it triggers 
The move in the stock price Friday took it back to the top of the falling channel and the 50 day SMA  Momentum indicators are supportive of a break higher out of the Handle  The RSI is moving higher after bottoming at the lower bound of the bullish zone  and the MACD is about to cross up  its own buy signal 
A move out of the channel  over 163 for Monday  would trigger the pattern  Then there would be resistance above at 168 and 172 followed by 179 and 183 before the all time high at 185 19  Support lower stands at 161 and 157 50 followed by 155 and then a gap to fill to 145  Short interest is non existent  and the company is due to report earnings next after the close June 21st 
Looking at the options chains  the biggest open interest this week is at the 162 5 Strike Call  3 times the 165 Call and 8 times anything on the Put side  June monthly options show high open interest at the 165 and 170 Call Strikes as well as the 155 Put  The June 24 Expiry chain  just past earnings is biggest at the 170 Call  but has not had long to build  The July chain is largest at the 165 Call  An upward bias 
FedEx  Ticker  FDX

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 163 with a stop at 157 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 163 and buying a June 24 Expiry 162 5 157 5 Put Spread selling the July 170 Calls  30 cents for the collar protection through earnings 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the June 165 170 Call Spread and sell the June 155 Put for a 10 cent credit 
Trade Idea 4  Buy a May 27 Expiry June Call Calendar for  1 50  Sell next week calls when May expires  and repeat weekly 
Trade Idea 5  Buy a May 27 Expiry June Call Calendar and sell a May 27 Expiry 157 5 Put for  1 10  Sell next week calls when May expires  and repeat weekly 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with Options Expiration behind and heading into the last week before the unofficial start of summer  sees equity markets treading water 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate in its uptrend while Crude Oil continues higher  perhaps with a short term pause  The US Dollar Index looks to continue higher while US Treasuries consolidate broadly in their uptrend  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue to consolidate with a downward bias and Emerging Markets look to head lower 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show continued short term confusion  with the SPY extending a long bull flag maybe too long  and the IWM and QQQ looking more like they could start a reversal higher  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

165942,387458,FDX,More Optimism Mounting In The Commodity Sector,opinion,"As the investment community realigns its thinking about the reluctance of the Fed to raise interest rates only one or even two times in 2016  the proverbial half empty glass has suddenly begun to fill of with optimistic water  once again  After five years of near disastrous results  commodities may be finally making a real comeback  The newly found optimism is not just with oil  which has inched over  49 a barrel  but also with both hard and soft commodities across the board  Whether you dig it or grow it out of the ground is not a factor  Oil  ores  precious metals  and agricultural products  from sugar to soybeans and even to fertilizers  are bouncing off bottoms and headed north 
Many analysts are so euphoric that they are claiming that commodities are offering a trading opportunity of the type that only comes along every decade or so  To these folks  it may be as easy as fishing for fish in a barrel  no pun intended  You could  of course  go long in your chosen commodity type  or  from an energy perspective  go with major producers  like BP  LON BP  or Shell  LON RDSa   Mining companies may be a bit more sluggish  but if China starts to grow  then Glencore  LON GLEN   BHP Billiton  LON BLT   and Rio Tinto  LON RIO  begin to look interesting  The safest bets  however  may reside in basic commodity currency pairs  where liquidity is key and mismanagement  as with stock companies  is not an issue  The Canadian dollar and the Norwegian krone are good targets  and the Aussie and Kiwi are next in line 
It is a bit surprising how quickly analysts have changed their tunes  especially about oil prices  The shear number of articles that tout  100 a barrel  not  50  as the next target  is astounding  The group that follows commodities had been crying in their milk for some time  viewing recent positive trends as nothing more than the effect of a weakening U S  dollar  Surely recent gains would dissipate like snow in the desert once the Fed righted itself and began to get hawkish about another rate hike  The Fed did just that last week  but commodities did not blink an eye  One never knows how much weight to assign to one Fed governor over another  but hawks on the committee seem to be pushing for a June rate hike  if only to demonstrate the resoluteness of their organization 
What is the tale of the tape  as for recent moves by the commodity sector 
What is all of the euphoria about  Commodities have been trapped in a downward spiral since 2011  Many commodities hit multi year lows during the last two quarters  but  amazingly  the vast majority of them seemed to have formed a firm bottom in February  While a subset of the analyst community attributes this good fortune to a falling USD  the dollar has only fallen in the neighborhood 4  in 2016 
Commodity prices are quoted in USD  such that there has always been an inverse correlation with the movements of the greenback  but this time around  prices for hard and soft commodities have  as a group  bounced back multiples of that 4  figure  Even currencies like the Loonie and the Norwegian Krone have appreciated in the 7 to 11  realm 
The positive news is not only about oil  The tales of the tape in a variety of markets tell the same story  To begin with  Oil did rally from a low of  26 in February to a current price of  49 today  a hefty 88  rise  What happened in other markets  Here is a brief summary of escalating price points 
Iron Ore  The steel market is humming again  as iron ore rose from  33 a ton in January to a peak of  60  only to pull back to the  50 range in May 
Copper  The bellwether of economic activity has also risen of late  from  1 94 to  2 30 a pound  settling back at  2 06 after a brief round of profit taking 
Gold  The yellow metal had been languishing around  1 046 an ounce in late 2015  only to jump to a high of  1 306 in early May  It has since pulled back to the  1 253 range 
Soybeans  Prices for the staple agricultural product have recently soared from  8 49 a bushel to  10 88 last week 
Sugar  Prices hit a long term low last August of  0 10 per pound  Since that bottom  it has formed higher highs and higher lows to rest now at 17 cents 
Volatility has returned to the world of commodity prices  and the ripple effects in this market sector are quickly spreading to complementary arenas  Fertilizer demand is up  as is demand for agricultural equipment  Companies in these industries and in mining enterprises are beginning to entice investors  As money losers for quite some time  most of the group has resorted to paying high dividends to retain loyalty amongst its various shareholders  The time is now ripe  according to the optimists  to benefit from not only high dividend income streams  but also from material equity appreciation  as well 
What has convinced analysts that a bottom has formed in commodity process 
The search for the leading indicator that would signify a true  rather than a false  bottom in commodity prices has been ongoing for some time  The following chart comes courtesy of Bloomberg and  for all intents and purposes  it has won our  Chart of the Week  contest 

Has anyone out there ever heard of the Baltic Dry Index  BDI   Per one analyst   The BDI is a measure of shipping rates for dry bulk cargos of raw materials  On February 10  it hit all time lows at 290 and by April 27 it had increased to 715   an increase of over 146  in just nine weeks  As of last Friday  the index was at the 634 level  still over 118  higher than the mid February lows  This index is an excellent measure of global shipping activity and its rise from the lows is a good indication that demand for commodities has picked up over recent months  
The chart above takes the BDI and compares it to oil prices over the past year  Both the BDI and Oil hit bottom in mid February  but the BDI has fully recovered lost ground for the year  The broadening gap between the two lines is an indication that a broader based recovery is taking place regarding general industrial and agricultural resources  a harbinger of better times to come  The BDI serves as a leading indicator for the commodity s industry  in much the same way that economists look to activity at UPS and FedEx  NYSE FDX  as a good barometer for new trends in other business sectors 
Is everyone onboard with this new way of thinking 
This question is obviously of a rhetorical nature  There will always be naysayers that try to rain on the parade of optimistic analysts  In this case  perhaps one in three are highlighting the negative sides of the equation  They first point to the U S  dollar and claim that the Fed will act in June  thereby shooting a big hole in the rally of commodities  Speculators in oil prices are also dictating the shape of the future  if one believes what is transpiring within  Commitment of Traders  reported data  While open interest information reveals that short positions still outnumber longs by nearly 12 to one  the cumulative impact of changes over the past few months  when compared to the futures market  is eye opening 

The chart actually looks as if it could support the opposing argument  but accumulated short position reversals have leveled off in this diagram  Crude futures have not  If you take the negative argument for what it is worth  then you accept that markets top out when bullish news begins to subside  These analysts believe that things will come unglued at the  50 level  Shorts will return in droves  driving the price back down to the  40 level  before it resumes its favorable long term trend 
The negative group also likes to point to natural gas  one area that supports their basic hypothesis  It  too  hit bottom in late February and early March  but  from that point forward  it has been stuck in a tight range  Seasonal issues may be the culprits with natural gas  There is usually a lull in demand in the Spring  before things heat up down the line  Speculators understand this relationship and tend to pile on the short positions  A short squeeze may be in the cards at some point  but it can be a costly proposition for longs at this stage 
What fundamentals are improving the supply side situation for oil 
The recent run up in oil prices has been impressive for one single reason   it has been a gradual stair stepping affair  no explosions  no wild gyrations  and no falling off a precipice  As analysts have noted from time to time about commodities   Commodities tend to take the stairs up and the elevator down   but where was the elevator last week  The Fed minutes came out hawkish in favor of a June rate hike  but one observer was quick to note that   Oil seems to have shrugged it off  which is a sign that market fundamentals have shifted  
What fundamentals have shifted  The word for months is that something had to happen on the supply side to end the inventoried glut now maintained at capacity in the world s storage facilities  One piece of news is that oilrigs in the U S  have stabilized at 318  a far cry from a peak of 1 600  but a good bit less than 543 this time last year  Wildfires
have cut into Canadian production  and severe political and economic problems have stalled efforts in Venezuela and Nigeria  Russia is cutting back  as well  for taxation reasons  but Iran and other OPEC countries are picking up some of the slack  Demand is also improving in the U S   China  and the rest of Asia  a sign that new fundamentals are beginning to take hold 
Concluding Remarks
Have commodities  after five dismal years  finally formed a permanent bottom and established the first leg of a positive  favorable  long term trend  There are arguments on both sides  but this is the first time where optimists on the street seem to handily outnumber opposing forces  The odds may be more like  70 30  for now  but veteran traders know from experience that it is foolhardy to predict bottoms in any market  As long as higher highs are followed by higher lows and then higher highs again  after profit taking has run its course  then perhaps we can all agree that a reversal has occurred  For the time being  be cautious  and protect against downside risk

165971,387487,FDX,4 Ways To Trade FedEx,opinion,"FedEx  NYSE FDX  fell out of a rising wedge pattern at the start of December  finally landing more than 25  lower in mid January  From that bottom the price rose to consolidation under the 100 day SMA  That built a Cup and Handle pattern and gave an upside target of 170  The stock then gapped higher and has since consolidated at the prior high  under that 170 target  In moving higher it also established a Measured Move to 184 should it break the consolidation and take off to the upside 
Momentum indicators are running hot in this stock  The RSI is in the mid 70 s  technically overbought but not extreme  The MACD is rolling over and crossing down setting up a divergence  Short interest is low under 2   so not much to fuel a flight higher  But there has been and continues to be strong accumulation in the stock  So is it set up to take off or crash land 
The options chains show open interest spread in the April monthly chain  but mostly below the current price  In the May monthly options the Put side is spread from 145 to 160 while the Call side focused from 165 to 175  but all much smaller than the April open interest  Heading to the July contract  the first that goes beyond the June earnings report  the open interest is almost entirely below the current price  The biggest open interest is on the Call side at the 145 and 150 strikes 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 164 50 with a stop at 160 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 164 50 with a May 160 145 Put Spread   2 50  and selling a July 180 Covered Call   1 30  for cheap protection 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the May 160 150 140 Put Butterfly   1 50  looking for the gap to fill 
Trade Idea 4  Sell the stock short   163 67  and buy a May 165 Call   3 85  to protect against a move higher 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which heading into the first full week of April sees the equity indexes looking strong and ready to make another leg higher 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue its pullback along with Crude Oil  The US Dollar also looks to continue lower  possibly testing key 12 month support while US Treasuries are breaking to the upside and look to continue  The Shanghai Composite looks poised to move higher in its downtrend as Emerging Markets continue to trend higher 
Volatility looks to remain low and biased lower keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   IWM and QQQ  despite the moves the past week  Their charts also look strong on both the daily and weekly timeframe with the only slight warnings coming from slowing momentum indications  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well ",2016-04-04,Gregory W.

166000,387516,FDX,Estimated 2016 Earnings Drop From 8  To 4  Since January,opinion,"Using the Thomson Reuters data  with Q4  15 earnings complete for all but 70 S P 500 companies  the year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 will be about  1  when the final print is made April 1  16 
For 2016  the estimated S P 500 earnings growth rate has slowed from 8  to just 4  in the last 7 weeks  or since January 1  16 
Q4  15 revenue growth is  3 8   with the healthcare sector showing the best revenue growth at  9   and energy  naturally  showing the lowest y y revenue growth at  35  
S P 500 earnings data by the numbers   courtesy of Thomson Reuters   

Forward 4 quarter estimate   121 74 down from last week s  121 90 
P E ratio  15 75 x   the bears point to the p e relative to the growth rate as the primary reason to be bearish  and for good reason   
PEG ratio  13 76 x  see above sentence   4  earnings growth expected in 2016  versus the 15 75 x  P E today 
S P 500 earnings yield  6 35  versus last week s 6 74    still elevated 
Year over year growth rate of forward estimate   1 15   vs last week s  1 38 

Analysis  Part of the issue with the general equity market  and by that I m talking the major equity indices like the S P 500  the Nasdaq and the Dow 30  is that there is little seeming growth in the S P 500 outside of healthcare and a few select tech sectors  and the forward growth rate can t seem to get traction  To see the y y growth rate of the S P 500 forward 4 quarter estimate go negative again  as it did from April  15 through January  16  would not be good  in my opinion  
A lot of street strategists went more bearish in late 2015  and that seems justified now given that the  1  S P 500 earnings growth in 2015  and the expected 4  S P 500 earnings growth  down from 8  and still falling  implies close to two years of zero earnings growth for the S P 500  which is undoubtedly a  P E compressing  macro environment 
My own forecast was for a 10  return on the S P 500 in 2016  and that financials and technology in terms of sector allocations  would likely offer the least risk for 2016  and the sector bets have clearly been wrong 
Financials as a sector has actually far under performed energy YTD in 2016 
Not good 
Conclusion  Investors are entering the  dead zone  in terms of earnings results until some key large caps report in March  16 including Oracle  N ORCL   Fed Ex  N FDX   Nike  N NKE   and several others  Retail will finish out the month of February and March  16  The great majority of the S P 500 has reported Q4  15 and it sure looks like  1  S P 500 earnings growth will be in the books for last year

166022,387538,FDX,The Week Ahead  Will The Fed Be Data Dependent ,opinion,"Back from a quiet  holiday shortened week  market participants face an avalanche of data and plenty of FedSpeak  This is an irresistible combination for pundits  who will parse each economic report with emphasis on what it might mean for the Fed  In light of many Fed promises  they will all be asking 
Will the Fed really be data dependent  
Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted that the market stories for the week would emphasize individual stocks and include some rarely seen faces doing TV interviews  This was fairly accurate  with CNBC featuring stock pick segments all week  I also suggested that the low volume of trading could lead to some volatility until data were released on Wednesday morning  The only volatility came intra day on Tuesday in what proved to be one of the quietest weeks of the year  To get the full story  let us look at Doug Short s   Doug s full post shows the various relevant moving averages in a very negative week for stocks   With the ever increasing effects from foreign markets  you should also add Doug s World Markets Weekend Update to your reading list  

Doug s update also provides multi year context  See his  for more excellent charts and analysis 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
This Week s Theme
The economic calendar brings together all of the most important economic reports  We also have the Fed s Beige Book  used as a qualitative addition to the economic statistics at the next FOMC meeting   We will have plenty of FedSpeak  including Chair Yellen in front of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee 
The punditry loves to opine about the Fed and invite every guest or column source to do the same  The calendar combination will prove irresistible  If you are tired of hearing and reading about this topic  I understand  I could not agree more 
But my job here is to consider what will be the weekly focus  not what should be 
People will be asking 
Will the Fed  as promised  be data dependent in hiking rates  
There are several key viewpoints 
Data will show weakness  and the Fed will not hike rates   Some still expect more QE  
Data will show some weakness  but the Fed will not be deterred 
Mixed data allows the Fed to hike as planned 
Strong data will emphasize the need for higher rates  reviving the  Fed behind the curve  arguments 
Most observers believe that Friday s employment data will be the most important influence  Here are some ideas that most will not discuss or will get wrong 
People will speculate that Yellen  has the numbers  before her Congressional testimony on Thursday  This is an interesting idea  since the Fed gets some information a bit early to prepare some of their own reports  Theoretically  the overall report goes to the Fed Chair and the President the afternoon before the announcement  Many will expect Yellen s commentary to reflect special knowledge  but it probably does not 
Nearly everyone will forget that the payroll employment number is based on a survey with a confidence interval of     110K or so  This is just  sampling error  so it does not reflect any revisions due to more responses  changes in seasonal adjustments  or aligning with benchmarks 
Some will regard Thursday s initial jobless claims as a relevant signal  It is not  since it covers a different period from the monthly employment report 
Expect to see plenty of support for each of these various positions  since every expert has an opinion about the Fed 
But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was a little good news  but most results were in line with expectations 
Change in policy from Saudi Arabia  This is an important story  but a confusing one  There are two parts 
Would higher oil prices be good  In general  lower oil prices seem to be positive for most countries  lowering the consumption  tax  for consuming nations  Despite this  stocks have been positively correlated with oil prices 
Is this really a policy change  The FT   and it was treated as fresh news by many observers  Others noted that similar statements were made several days earlier    

Personal income showed solid growth  The gain was 0 4  month over month and 5 3  over last year  the best gain since May 
GDP for Q3 was revised higher  The adjustment was in line with expectations  but it does provide a higher base  Much of the gain was due to inventory adjustments     Doug Short has a great method for illustrating the components of GDP change over time  and also a post with plenty of other interesting comparisons 

Hedge fund oil shorts peak  This is good news if you are a contrarian investor and have noted that hedge funds have underperformed in the last two years    
Fewer homeowners are  underwater  than they believe  Only 8 7  are actually underwater  but 27  believe they are     
Durable goods orders beat expectations  The gain was 0 5  month over month  about 0 2  better than expected 
The Bad
Some of the economic data was disappointing 
Rail traffic is still declining  Steven Hansen    gets beyond the noise of the weekly data and reveals the trend  Read the full post for helpful tables and charts 
Existing home sales declined  Steven Hansen has   including those without seasonal adjustments   also has some comments about the surprising effect on inventory 
New home sales also disappointed  a slight miss on the current month and downward revisions to past months  Calculated Risk has the   also noting that year over year comparisons are still solid 

Personal spending lagged expectations  growing only 0 1  over the prior month 
Corporate profits have turned negative   the pattern of declines  chart below   but also mentions the impact of the energy sector   which might not continue  Brian Gilmartin makes a   and is a bit more optimistic about 2016 

Consumer confidence was disappointing  both from the Conference Board and the University of Michigan  Doug Short has his typical great charts and analysis on both series 
The Ugly 
Continuing terrorism   now including Turkey shooting down a Russian plane  There are various accusations and sanctions  but the actions are edging closer to a direct disagreement between major powers 
Noteworthy 
Take the global   Would you be surprised to learn that many cannot do simple percentage calculations 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  This week s award goes to  Davidson   brought to us once again    He takes on the popular notion of the economic forecasting powers of  Dr  Copper   Here is a key paragraph  supported by the chart below 

What holds as teaching in business schools are concepts like Dr  Copper and oil as economic indicators  They are simply fallacies of the worse kind  Because they have been taught by those society has deemed  smart    intelligent  and the  best minds of our time  we take these concepts to be truths tested by time  They are not   These concepts fall apart when examined rationally but the consensus rather than thinking independently accepts the misperceptions of a few 


Quant Corner
Whether a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update  Beginning last week I made some changes in our regular table  separating three different ways of considering risk  For valuation I report the equity risk premium  This is the difference between what we expect stocks to earn in the next twelve months and the return from the 10 year Treasury note  I have found this approach to be an effective method for measuring market perception of stock risk  This is now easier to monitor because of the excellent work of Brian Gilmartin  whose analysis of the Thomson Reuters data is our principal source for forward earnings 
Our economic risk indicators have not changed 
In our monitoring of market technical risk  I am using our  new  Oscar model  I put  new  in quotes because Oscar is in the same tradition as Felix and the product of extensive testing  We have found that the overall market indication is more helpful for those investing or trading individual stocks  The score ranges from 1 to 5  with 5 representing a high warning level  The 2 4 range is acceptable for stock trading  with various levels of caution 
Oscar improves trading results by taking some profits during good times and getting out of the market when technical risk is high  This is not market timing as we normally think of it  since it is not an effort to pick tops and bottoms and it does not go short  Instead  Oscar identifies and limits risk   More to come about Oscar  
I considered continuing to report the Felix updates  but I already have a distinction between long and short term methods  I want to minimize confusion  Those who want this information can subscribe to our weekly Felix updates

How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders 
Oscar continues Felix s neutral market forecast  but he is fully invested  There are often plenty of good investments  even in an expected flat market  For more information  I have posted a further description     You can sign up for Felix and Oscar s weekly ratings updates via email to etf at newarc dot com  They appear almost every day at Scutify  follow   
There is plenty of advice telling traders what they should do   to do it 
Insight for Investors 
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  Major market declines occur after business cycle peaks  sparked by severely declining earnings  Our methods are focused on limiting this risk  Start with our  and follow the links 
We also have a page  just updated   summarizing many of the   If you read something scary  this is a good place to do some fact checking  Pick a topic and give it a try

Obamacare effects follow up   Last week I wrote about the UnitedHealth Group  N UNH  story 

United Health Group downgraded earnings expectations  blaming the ACA  The health insurance group plummeted and the selling pressure rippled to hospitals and even to biotechs  The next day the other big insurers all stated that participation  fees  and revenues were on track  This has been a popular and important market sector  so the story deserves careful monitoring 

As I suggested  this is one to follow carefully  This   by leading expert Henry J  Aaron  explains why this might be a one off problem for United  which chose to enter the market later than competitors  This changed the mix of participants  It is wise to be especially careful when investing in this market

Final Thoughts
There is plenty of evidence that the Fed is ready for  liftoff  at the next meeting  Our go to Fed expert  Tim Duy  has an  of the recent positions of various FOMC participants  He concludes that the Fed is ready to declare  mission accomplished  barring a dramatic change in the outlook  Tim sees another 100 bps of tightening over the next year  and perhaps a start on reducing the balance sheet 
As long as this is the pace  I see little impact on stocks  beyond a possible knee jerk reaction   The Fed remains data dependent  but they have seen enough

166023,387539,FDX,Looking Toward S P 500 Earnings Yield And The FOMC Meeting,opinion," Fed Model  fans are familiar with the S P 500 earnings yield  since it is the Fed Model calculation that subtracts the 10 Year Treasury yield from the Earnings Yield of the S P 500  calculated by using Thomson s forward 4 quarter earnings estimate and dividing it by the closing value of the S P 500  to get a broadly based market valuation measure that was once cited by Alan Greenspan in the late 1990 s as indicative of what he thought was an overvalued stock market    The speech where Greenspan first referenced the Fed Model was July  1997  per Wikipedia   
If we look at the yield on the 10 year Treasury in July  97   roughly a 5    5 25  yield   and the year end S P 500 earnings  actual  97  were  43 50 and in July  1997  the S P 500 was trading at   let s call it 925   the S P 500 earnings yield was roughly 4 7   so the Fed Model  with a value of  0 50 was indicating  probably appropriately  in mid  07  that the S P 500 was overvalued 
So what s the point   While ZIRP distorts the Fed Model  Think Nikkei 225 and Japanese interest rates   the S P 500  forward progress by the S P 500 in my opinion is likely far more dependent on S P 500 earnings growth than interest rate levels over the next few years  in my opinion  
Looking back at 2013  readers saw a sharp increase in the 10 year Treasury yield  to up to 3  by year end  13  and the S P 500 rose 32  on the year 
For me personally  a  normal  yield curve would have a 2  fed funds rate  about flat with long run core inflation rate  and a 4  10 year Treasury yield  and even that implies that the short end of the yield curve would be just break even with inflation 
The S P 500 earnings yield as of Friday  December 11th was 6 13   The yield was above 6  for most of August and September  15  during the 10  correction 
The last time the S P 500 earnings yield was 6 12  was November 13th or one month ago  and the S P 500 rallied from 2 022 to 2 100 to close out November  15 
The Fed Model is a broad valuation sword  not a timing tool  but it couldn t help be noted when the S P 500 earnings yield of 6 13   versus November s yield  when the S P 500 saw a nice rally 
Also per Bespoke  bullish sentiment per AAII declined to 28 5  this week  the lowest level of optimism since the September  15 lows 
Look for the year end rally  possibly to start after Wednesday s FOMC announcement 
I do expect the FOMC to increase the federal funds rate 25 bp s 
S P 500 By the Numbers
The forward 4 quarter estimate as of December 11th was  123 34  down from last week s  123 49
The P E ratio on the forward estimate as of Friday  was 16 x 
The PEG ratio is still negative  but core S P 500 earnings growth  ex Energy  assumed at 5    7  means S P 500 still has a PEG over 2 x 
The S P 500 earnings yield is 6 13  versus last week s 5 90  
The y y growth rate of the forward estimate was  0 71   the 4th consecutive week of improvement for the forward estimate  Still negative  and I d like to see it positive 
This coming week  Oracle  N ORCL  and Fed Ex  N FDX  report Wednesday night after the bell  just after the FOMC decision  so the stock s reaction and the trading of both names on Thursday could be heavily dependent on what both companies say about 2016 after the bell Wednesday  For both Fed Ex and Oracle  this is their 2nd fiscal quarter s of 2016  ends May 31 for both  and both guided softer with teh August  15 s quarter s results 
Basically all of the S P 500 has reported their September  15 quarters  so with these November quarter ends  we get more input and perspective on a real time basis 
No question FDX is a real time economic barometer  but ORCL is likely the safer of the two stocks right now ",2015-12-13,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-earnings-yield---fed-model---fomc-meeting---year-end-rall-375578,375578
166024,387540,FDX,Worried Spectrum Of Altered Risks,opinion,"Any ideas about junk bonds outperforming because of the booming economy confirmed by a monetary policy rate hike has been killed and buried  Conventionally  it was assumed that interest rates are not the primary  risk  parameter for high yield corporates of all flavors  and that is correct  Junk issues and lower tier obligors are creatures of the credit cycle  thus we are forced to conclude that the blowup in corporates spreading down the scalesis a directcontradiction to  transitory  and the economic scenario envisioned by rising interest rates  as a matter of intentional policy  
Now that it is becoming more widely accepted that oil prices are not set for the expected return  even among economists that vociferously resisted any such idea  that leaves a few other fundamental conventions twisting precariously in the blowing financial winds  Oil prices were not long ago the primary  if not only  silver lining that could be derived from the oil collapse  If oil prices were going to work against the  anchored inflation expectations  that monetary policy depends so much upon  at least there was some  benefit  in that low oil prices were widely predicted to spur some sectors and if not completely offset any damage to inflation expectations then at least provide a cushioning  tax cut  
Mainly  retailers and transportation sectors would be at the front end of that  stimulus   If you take the part that oil prices are meaningless in relating the general economic direction  both of those sectors should have done  and continue to do  very well as oil prices provide benefits on top of the economy as it continues to perform  From February 
But in general  low oil prices  are an unambiguous positive for the U S  economy   says Chris Lafakis  Moody s Analytics  senior economist  who notes that there will be many industries that could reap higher profits as a result 

Many industries that depend heavily on consumer spending will get a big boost from lower oil prices  says Lafakis   Lower oil prices act as a tax cut   he says  adding that if oil prices fall from an average of  93 per barrel in 2014 to an average of  63 in 2015  that would be the equivalent of a  90 billion tax cut for the American consumer   That s not a small stimulus we re talking about   he says 

Lower gas prices will be a big boon to the transportation industry  says John Challenger  the CEO of staffing firm Challenger  Gray   Christmas thanks to the fact that a lot of transportation companies  costs come from fuel  Thus shipping companies like FedEx  N FDX    0 69  and N UPS   0 08  freight airlines  trucking companies and marine transportation companies are likely to see a boost 
By Mr  Lafakis  math  then oil prices at  35  averaging somewhere just in the  40 s  would be an inordinately tremendous consumer boost  As late as mid August  just before the global liquidations  this was repeated as conventional wisdom 
As oil prices continue to drop  certain industries stand to benefit  These fall into two main categories  The first should come as no surprise  industries  like airlines and transportation  for which oil is a direct and significant cost  lower oil prices improve their profitability   The other industries that benefit from lower oil prices are those that are dependent on consumer spending  When consumers spend less on fuel  they have more disposable income for other purchases 
It does appear as if that theme was the dominant trading practice exercised in the first part of the oil collapse  Both retailers and transportation industry stocks were well bid as oil prices fell apart in late 2014 and into 2015  particularly after the eventsof October 15  2014   The transportation sector  at least as viewed through the Dow Jones Transportation Index  remained elevated until early April while the retailer segment  using S P s retail sector ETF tracker  continued well on into mid July 

Since that transition in mid year  oil prices have again persisted rather than rebounded and of late have turned to new  cycle  lows  Yet  neither transportation nor retailers have traded as if further benefits were accruing in terms of that  stimulus   This is not to say that stock investors have boarded the recession view  only that there is a clear shift in risk perception that has undoubtedly rebalanced and reprioritized risk parameters  If the left side of the chart above was risks being viewed very favorable in terms of the economic fallout of low oil prices  the right is undoubtedly  much  less certain 
It may not be anywhere close to the paradigm shift of junk debt  but it shows  I believe  how risk resetting is taking place in far more than just junk  The spectrum of risk being traded even in the most favorable of places  such as stocks  has clearly been altered and there is now less uniformity on what all this financial reconstitution might actually mean   Everyone  was with Janet Yellen  and a great deal still are  but the doubts about her  and economists   ability to survey the economic landscape are strikingly different now   to the point that seriously lingering  very low oil prices are traded exclusivelynegative all around 

Like junk bonds  the economic component of the traded probability distribution has been widely altered  Increasingly  it seems as if convention recognizes the deep repercussions and reverberations of continued  persistent financial disorder  none of which was expected except by the radical change in money markets that see only a continued deterioration  As my colleague Joe Calhoun noted this weekend  people are truly starting to worry that people are worried  I would only add that it works against them  economists  that they stubbornly refuse any worry 
Common sense declares  as does recession history  that if oil prices so collapse and remain so  dreadful  that something far worse and more primordial is truly at work in the economy   and that is nothing good and that is increasingly what is being revealed 


1  Dollar doesn t matter  indicates strong economy relative to the world  2  Dollar matters for oil  but lower oil prices mean stronger consumer  3  Manufacturing slump doesn t matter  only temporary  4  Manufacturing declines are consumer spending  but only a small part  5  Manufacturing declines are becoming serious  but only from overseas  6  Maybe domestic manufacturing recession too  but the rest of the economy is strong  7  Rest of the economy might not be as strong as thought  but only an  earnings recession    8  Maybe full recession  but only a small probability ",2015-12-15,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/worried-spectrum-of-altered-risks-375835,375835
166025,387541,FDX,Will Late Deliveries Doom This Courier Service This Holiday Season ,opinion,"FedEx  N FDX    Industrials   Air Freight   Logistics   Reports December 16  before market open
Key Takeaways
A not so happy holiday season will lead to late deliveries  again
 1 6 billion capex into fastest growing segment  FedEx Ground
Energy sector has been falling  fuel prices are low  but FedEx shares are still tumbling
  a global courier delivery service  is set to report fiscal 2Q2016 earnings Wednesday morning  Historically  the holiday season has been everything but positive for the Memphis  TN based company  High volumes  not enough workers  and UPS dominance in the market usually cooks up below average earnings reports for FedEx  This holiday season  Wall Street analysts are expecting to see year over year increases in both revenue and EPS  however  FedEx has missed earnings forecasts in three of the last four quarters  The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  2 55 and revenue of  12 45 billion  Wall Street analysts are predicting EPS to come in two cents lower and revenue of  12 4 billion 
The holiday season tends to be one of the busiest shopping times of the year  With a rise in e commerce sales  both FedEx and   N UPS  have had to hire additional workers to alleviate delivery pressure  but to no avail  FedEx nonpeak  on time deliveries fell below its average of 95  while UPS  dipped to 91   Last year  several thousands of customers complained to FedEx because of shipments arriving after Christmas day  FedEx expects to deliver around 317 million packages between Black Friday and Christmas Eve  However  FedEx has taken action to set itself up for growth and profit to offset any losses that could be incurred this season 
Arguably one of their most important initiatives  the shipping company has declared that it will not accept more packages than it can take  It s simple  smart  and ultimately could save lost revenues down the line  Another step they are taking is to invest  1 6 billion in 2016 in their largest growing segment  FedEx ground  With more trucks and drivers on the road  FedEx could potentially avoid late deliveries for the next holiday time frame 
A huge expense for any courier delivery company is fuel  With recent declines in crude oil  fuel prices have been dipping to low points not seen since 2008  Lower fuel costs look like a bag of money to air and freight logistics companies  but in FedEx s case  share prices have tumbled 15  on the year due to a loss of fuel surcharges  Revenues will be negatively affected as FedEx has not shown enough growth on the earnings front to outweigh losses in revenue 

Overseas  FedEx was fined  18 5 million  17 million euros  in France for increasing price fixes on parcels for a duration of six years  Nineteen other companies were fined as well  but France s antitrust defenders claimed several companies met together to discuss price increases between 2004 2010 ",2015-12-16,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-late-deliveries-doom-this-courier-service-this-holiday-season-375996,375996
166052,387568,FDX,U S  Equity And Economic Weekly Review  Weak 3Q Projections  Edition,opinion,"The U S   immunity to international economic weakness continues  In their latest policy statement  the Fed once again described U S  growth as  moderate   With the exception of industrial production  this week s economic releases confirm that assessment  Retail sales rose  building permits were up and the leading indicators increased  Largely due to the negative impact of the strong dollar and oil sector weakness  industrial production provided the only negative news  Technically  the markets continue consolidating in upward sloping channels  But third quarter earnings projections continue to move lower  meaning there will be a dearth of support for a sustained upward move 
The Economic Environment
On Wednesday  the Federal Reserve  where they maintained their current interest rate and asset purchase policy  The statement contained the following assessment of the US economy 
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing moderately  and the housing sector has improved further  however  net exports have been soft  The labor market continued to improve  with solid job gains and declining unemployment  On balance  labor market indicators show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee s longer run objective  partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non energy imports  Market based measures of inflation compensation moved lower  survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations have remained stable 
Thanks to the strong dollar and weaker overseas economies  exports were the only area of weakness  And like other central banks  the Fed believes inflation s weakness results from low commodity prices 
U S  retail sales  an important coincident indicator of consumer activity  rose  2  M M and 2 2  Y Y  Car sales increased  7  M M and 5 7  Y Y  As the following graph  which is calibrated to an index of 100  shows  both statistics remain in a solid  long term uptrends 

The car sales figure is particularly important  consumers have to take on loans to buy cars and they don t do that unless they have some level of confidence in the future 
Industrial production  another important coincident indicator  was down again  marking the fourth decrease in the last six months 

The best way to analyze the above table is from the bottom up  Mining dropped in four of the last six months  and at a sharp rate in April and May  Oil s slowdown extended to ancillary industries such as materials extraction equipment and  to a lesser extent  consumer goods  laid off oil workers purchase fewer toys   Utilities declined in March and April as inclement winter weather gave way to moderate spring temperatures  Not reflected in any of the data  but which   is the slight export slowdown caused by the strong dollar  All three factors contributed to the industrial production slowdown  This trend will continue so long as oil remains in a bear market and the dollar is strong 
The Conference Board released the latest U S  leading and coincident indicators  which each increased  2   Let s start by looking at the LEI components 

Manufacturing orders  see discussion above  were the primary source of weakness  Because weekly initial unemployment claims are at historically low levels  they will continue to provide weakness to the index  Three of four CEIs increased last month 

As these three graphs from the Conference Board s report show  all three indexes are rising 

Economic Conclusion
This week s economic releases provide ample justification for the Fed s  moderate  characterization of the U S  economy  Retail sales  building permits and the LEIs all point to a modest expansion  The Atlanta Fed s GDPNow confirms this assessment 

And their recession indicator s latest readings is 13 3     a relatively low number 


The Markets
Once again  earnings projections are low  the following is  
The last earnings season was quite anemic  with growth rates in the negative and top line weakness notably standing  Unfortunately  the earnings picture is unlikely to improve in the Q3 earnings season either  with total earnings for the S P 500 index expected to be in the negative again  If two back to back quarters of GDP growth is the definition of an economic recession  then two quarters in a row of earnings declines would have to qualify as an earnings recession 
We will have to wait another few weeks for the earnings cycle to really get underway  But judging from current consensus estimates and reports from the likes of FedEx  NYSE FDX   the outlook isn t very inspiring  Total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  5 6  from the same period last year on  4 4  lower revenues  This would follow earnings decline of  2 1  on  3 4  lower revenues in the preceding quarter 
Energy remains the biggest drag in Q3  as has been the trend in recent quarters  with total Energy sector earnings expected to be down  65  on  36 6  lower revenues  Excluding this Energy sector drag  earnings growth for the remainder of the S P 500 index would be up  1 6  on  0 8  revenues 
Energy is no doubt a big drag  but there isn t much growth momentum in other sectors aside from Finance and Medical  with earnings growth for half of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to be in the negative  Finance is expected to have another positive quarter  with total earnings for the sector expected to be up  8 8  from the same period last year  Excluding the contribution from the Finance sector  total earnings for the S P 500 index would be down  8 9  from the year earlier period 
Although recent anemic oil sector financial numbers grabbed the financial media s attention  top and bottom line weakness is more widespread  According to Zacks  after they adjusted for non recurring and one time items  second quarter S P 500 Y Y revenue growth was  3 4   Ex finance  the number was  4 2  and ex oil the gain was only 1 3   After excluding the oil sector s 3rd quarter projections  top line growth estimates are a paltry  8   And they currently project half of the sectors to report third quarter revenue declines  In fact  the above excerpt uses the phrase  earnings recession  to describe the potential 3Q situation  And this is occurring when the market is expensive  the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  current the estimated PE ratios are 21 17 21 65 and 16 52 19 67  respectively 
And expensive market and weak earnings projections create a difficult fundamental backdrop for a technically challenged market 

After falling through the 200 day EMA and the 202 203 level  prices now form an upward sloping wedge  But the shorter EMAs are below the longer EMAs with weak momentum and relative strength numbers adding to the technical problems 


Mid and small caps share the same basic chart problems 

And it appears the transports are about to move through their top line downward sloping trend line a second time 
Conclusion
The oil sector slowdown and strong dollar continue to provide slight headwinds  But the core US  moderate  growth story remains  The markets  however are still expensive  And with a second consecutive quarter of weak revenue growth a distinct possibility  a solid and sustained upside move that eliminates recent losses seems difficult at best ",2015-09-21,Hale Stewart,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-equity-and-economic-weekly-review:-weak-3q-projections,-edition-265651",265651
166053,387569,FDX,FedEx  4 Ways To Trade,opinion,"FedEx  NYSE FDX  shares a near duopoly on the shipping business with UPS  NYSE UPS   But like every aspect of life  that can be good news in good times and bad news in bad times  And right now it is bad times  At least from FedEx s perspective 
Headquartered in Memphis Tennessee  FedEx owns one of the largest fleets of airplanes in the world  All flying in and out of the Memphis hub  They also have a large ground shipping business  Crude oil prices are down and that is a good thing for the company  but with shipping down they are just not making the grade 
The chart below shows the rise from the start of 2014 to a top at 184 in early December it plateaued for nearly nine months  making a double top  and then pulling back with the market  After a few weeks of consolidation following the major drop it closed last week below the range and towards new lows  That spike nearly fully retraced the move higher
The RSI is also turning back lower after failing to even cross 50 with the MACD turning back toward a bearish cross down  never having turned positive  The one positive  or should I say  not so negative  is that it is at the lower Bollinger Band   A measured move would target a drop to 128 on a break lower 
But support lower at 145 is followed by a gap to fill below from June 2014 to 140 48  Support lower comes at 138 75 and 137 25 before 133 50 and 131 70 followed by 128 34  Resistance above stands at 148 and 154 80 followed by 156 and 160  Short interest is low at 1 6  and the company is expected to report earnings next on December 16th 
Looking at the options chains reveals that FedEx has weekly options out to October 30th  then November and January 2016  This week sees open interest highest on the put side nearby at 144 with a cluster from 150 to 165 and higher on the call side  October monthly options have big open interest above starting at 155  January 2016 options  the only ones past the earnings report  are biggest at 145 on the call side and then 160 and 170 on the put side 

Trade Idea 1  Sell the stock short on a move under 145  with a stop at 149 
A straight short sell with a stop at the prior consolidation 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the September 145 puts  offered at  1 93 late Friday  
A defined risk way to participate in the downside 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the October 145 130 put spread   3 48  
Caps the return but for lower cost for a longer term trade  with better than 4 1 reward to risk ratio 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the October 145 135 130 broken wing butterfly put   2 60  
Low cost participation for a  10 move and makes money anywhere below 142 40 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad market macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the last week of summer and out of expiration week sees the equity markets looking weak again 
Elsewhere  look for gold to continue the bounce in its downtrend while crude oil slows consolidates with a short term bias lower  The US Dollar Index looks better to the downside in consolidation while US Treasuries may reverse higher in the downtrend  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue consolidation in the downtrend and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside after their bounce 
Volatility looks to remain above normal levels in its drift down with a chance of a renewed push higher  This would keep the bias flat to lower for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts agree with a downward bias although all are in consolidation ranges  no man s land  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

166054,387570,FDX,Wal Mart s Worst Stock Crash In 27 Years,opinion,"Now that a major global recession has begun  you would expect major retailers like Wal Mart to run into trouble as consumer spending dries up  and that is precisely what is happening  On Wednesday  shares of Wal Mart experienced their largest single day decline in 27 years after an extremely disappointing earnings projection was released  The stock was down about 10 percent  which represented the biggest plunge since January 1988  Over 21 billion dollars in shareholder wealth was wiped out on Wednesday  and this was just the continuation of a very bad year for Wal Mart stockholders  Overall  shares had already declined by 22 percent so far in 2015 before we even got to Wednesday  Here is more on this stunning turn of events from  

Wal Mart Stores Inc   N WMT  suffered its worst stock decline in more than 27 years after predicting a drop in annual profit  underscoring the giant retailer s struggles to reignite growth 
Earnings will decrease 6 percent to 12 percent in fiscal 2017  which ends in January of that year  the Bentonville  Arkansas based company said at its investor day on Wednesday  Analysts had estimated a gain of 4 percent on average  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 

If it was just Wal Mart that was having trouble  that would be bad enough  But the truth is that signs that the U S  economy has entered another major downturn are popping up all around us  Just consider the following list of economic indicators that  recently put out 
The Fed has now kept interest rates at zero for 81 months 
This is the longest period in the history of the Fed s existence  lasting longer than even the 1938 1942 period of ZIRP 
And the US economy is moving back into recession  Consider that 
1  Industrial production fell five months straight in the first half of 2015  This has never happened outside of a recession 
2  Merchant Wholesalers  Sales are in recession territory 
3  The Empire Manufacturing Survey is in recession territory 
4  All four of the Fed s September Purchasing Manager Index  PMI  readings  Philadelphia  New York  Richmond  and Kansas City  came in at readings of sub zero  This usually happens when you are already 4 5 months into a recession   H T Bill Hester 
Another huge red flag is the fact that month after month fewer products are being shipped around the country compared to last year 
If less stuff is being shipped around by truck  rail and air  is it a sign that the economy is getting better or is it a sign that the economy is getting worse 
The answer  of course  is self evident  With that in mind  please read the following excerpt which comes from a recent article by  

It has been crummy all year  With the exception of January and February  the shipping volume has been lower year over year every month 
The index is broad  It tracks data from shippers  no matter what carrier they choose  whether truck  rail  or air  and includes carriers like FedEx  N FDX  and N UPS 
Evidence keeps piling up in the most unpleasant manner that something isn t quite right in the real economy  The world is now in an inexplicable slowdown    inexplicable  for central bankers who ve cut interest rates to zero or below zero years ago  and who re still dousing some economies with QE even as governments are running up big deficits  And yet  despite seven years of this huge monetary and fiscal stimulus  the global economy is deteriorating 

Okay  so is there anyone out there that still believes that the U S  economy is in good shape 
The Obama administration will probably not admit it for a very long time  but the truth is that the numbers very clearly tell us that we are in a recession 
Anybody out there  whether an  expert  or just someone you happen to know  that tells you that everything is just fine is either completely ignorant or they are purposely lying to you 
And just like in 2008  state and local governments are starting to get into tremendous financial trouble as the real economy sputters  For example  the governor of Illinois has told reporters that  and that pension fund payments will be delayed as a result 

Illinois will delay payments to its pension fund as a prolonged budget impasse causes a cash shortage  Comptroller Leslie Geissler Munger said 
The spending standoff between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and Democratic legislative leaders has extended into its fourth month with no signs of ending  Munger said her office will postpone a  560 million retirement fund payment next month  and may make the December contribution late 
 This decision is choosing the least of a number of bad options   Munger told reporters in Chicago on Wednesday   For all intents and purposes  we are out of money now  

When these sorts of things started happening in 2008  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and the Bush administration went into full blown denial mode  They kept telling all of us not to worry and that everything would be okay  and that just made things worse in the end 
The same thing is happening now  The Obama administration and the mainstream media keep talking about an  economic recovery  even in the face of numbers such as I have discussed in this article 
Perhaps things are going well for you personally at the moment  and that is great  But now is not the time to buy lots of new toys  Nor is it the time to accumulate more debt 
Instead  now is a time to position yourself for a period of difficulty that could stretch on for years 
The next recession is here  and it is going to grow progressively worse ",2015-10-15,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wal-mart’s-worst-stock-crash-in-27-years-is-another-sign-that-the-econom-268191,268191
166055,387571,FDX,Global Trade Collapses As Worldwide Economic Recession Deepens,opinion,"When the global economy is doing well  the amount of stuff that is imported and exported around the world goes up  and when the global economy is in recession  the amount of stuff that is imported and exported around the world goes down  It is just basic economics  Governments around the world have become very adept at manipulating other measures of economic activity such as GDP  but the trade numbers are more difficult to fudge  Today  China accounts for more global trade than anyone else on the entire planet  and we have just learned that Chinese exports and Chinese imports are both collapsing right now  But this is just part of a larger trend  As I discussed the other day  British banking giant HSBC  N HSBC  has reported that total global trade is down 8 4 percent so far in 2015  and global GDP expressed in U S  dollars is down 3 4 percent  The only other times global trade has plummeted this much has been during other global recessions  and it appears that this new downturn is only just beginning 
For many years  China has been leading the revolution in global trade  But now we are witnessing something that is almost unprecedented  Chinese exports are falling  and Chinese imports  

Growth of exports from China has been dropping relentlessly  for years  Now this  growth  has actually turned negative  In September  exports were down 3 7  from a year earlier  the  inevitable fallout from China s unsustainable and poorly executed credit splurge   as Thomson Reuters  Alpha Now puts it  Most of these exports are manufactured goods that are shipped by container to the rest of the world 
And imports into China   a mix of bulk and containerized freight   have been plunging  down 20 4  in September from a year earlier  after at a 13 8  drop in August 

This week it was announced that Chinese GDP growth had fallen to the lowest level since the last recession  and that makes sense  Global economic activity is really slowing down  and this is deeply affecting China 
So what about the United States 
Well  based on the amount of stuff that is being shipped around in our country it appears that our economy is really slowing down too  The following comes from   and I shared some of it in a previous article  but I think that it bears repeating 

September is in the early phase of the make or break holiday shipping season  Shipments usually increase from August to September  They did this year too  The number of shipments in September inched up 1 7  from August  according to the Cass Freight Index 
But the index was down 1 5  from an already lousy September last year  when shipments had fallen from the prior month  instead of rising  And so  in terms of the number of shipments  it was the worst September since 2010 
It has been crummy all year  With the exception of January and February  the shipping volume has been lower year over year every month 
The index is broad  It tracks data from shippers  no matter what carrier they choose  whether truck  rail  or air  and includes carriers like FedEx  N FDX  and N UPS 

What major retailers such as Wal Mart are reporting also confirms that we are in a major economic slowdown  Wal Mart recently announced that its earnings would fall by as much as 12 percent during the next fiscal year  and that caused Wal Mart stock to drop by the most in 27 years 
And of course this is going to have a huge ripple effect  There are thousands of other companies that do business with Wal Mart  and  that they are starting to get squeezed 

Suppliers of everything from groceries to sports equipment are already being squeezed for price cuts and cost sharing by Wal Mart Stores  N WMT   Now they are bracing for the pressure to ratchet up even more after a shock earnings warning from the retailer last week 
The discount store behemoth has always had a reputation for demanding lower prices from vendors but Reuters has learned from interviews with suppliers and consultants  as well as reviewing some contracts  that even by its standards Wal Mart has been turning up the heat on them this year 
 The ground is shaking here   said Cameron Smith  head of Cameron Smith   Associates  a major recruiting firm for suppliers located close to Wal Mart s headquarters in Bentonville  Arkansas   Suppliers are going to have to help Wal Mart get back on track  

Similar things are going on at some of the other biggest companies in America as well 
For instance  things have gotten so bad for McDonald s  N MCD  that one franchise owner recently stated that the restaurant chain is  

 McDonald s announced in April that it would be closing 700  underperforming  locations  but because of the company s sheer size   it has 14 300 locations in the United States alone   this was not necessarily a reduction in the size of the company  especially because it continues to open locations around the world  It still has more than double the locations of Burger King  its closest competitor  
However  for the franchisees  the picture looks much worse than simply 700 stores closing down 
 We are in the throes of a deep depression  and nothing is changing   a franchise owner wrote in response to a financial survey by Nomura Group   Probably 30  of operators are insolvent   One owner went as far as to speculate that McDonald s is literally  facing its final days  

Why would things be so bad at Wal Mart and McDonald s if the economy was  recovering  
Come on now   let s use some common sense here 
All of the numbers are screaming at us that we have entered a major economic downturn and that it is accelerating 
 that the number of job openings in the U S  is falling and that the number of layoffs is rising 

Job openings fell 5 3 percent in August  while a 2 6 percent rise in layoffs and discharges offset a 0 3 percent gain in hires  Finally  the amount of quits   or what Convergex calls its  take this job and shove it  indicator because it shows the percentage of workers who left positions voluntarily   fell to 56 6 percent from 57 1 percent  indicating less confidence in mobility 

And as I discussed the other day  Challenger Gray is reporting that we are seeing layoffs at major firms at a level that we have not witnessed since 2009 
We already have 102 6 million working age Americans who do not have a job right now  As this emerging worldwide recession deepens  a lot more Americans are going to lose their jobs  That is going to cause the poverty and suffering in this country to spike even more  if you can imagine that 
Just consider what authorities discovered on the streets of Philadelphia  

Support is flooding in for a homeless Philadelphia family whose two year old son was found wandering alone in a park in the middle of the night 
Angelique Roland  27  and Michael Jones  24  were sleeping with their children behind cardboard boxes underneath the Fairmount Park Welcome Center in Love Park when the toddler slipped away 
The boy was found just before midnight and handed over to a nearby Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority police officer  who took him to the Children s Hospital of Philadelphia 
He was wearing a green  long sleeve shirt  black running pants and had a diaper on  but did not have shoes or socks 

Could you imagine sleeping on the streets and not even being able to provide your two year old child with shoes and socks 
These numbers that I write about every day are not a game  They affect all of us on a very personal level 
Just like in 2008 and 2009  millions of Americans that are living a very comfortable middle class lifestyle today will soon lose their jobs and will end up out in the streets 
In fact  there will be people that will read this article that this will happen to 
So no  none of us should be excited that the global economy is collapsing  There is already so much pain all around us  and what is to come is beyond what most of us would even dare to imagine ",2015-10-20,Michael T.

166056,387572,FDX,Will AMZN Disrupt UPS And Uber Or Will Uber Disrupt AMZN  FDX  And UPS ,opinion,"Last week Uber rolled out on demand delivery in New York  Chicago  and San Francisco 
Is that the wave of the future 
Or  is Amazon  O AMZN  about to disrupt delivery services by taking UPS and FedEx  N FDX  head on 
Colin Sebastian at RW Baird published a note yesterday highlighting the opportunity for Amazon to begin to offer third party logistics services in a similar way that it offers Web Services  The analyst believes that this could be a  5 billion opportunity for Amazon even if it only captures 1  marketshare in the various segments of the industry 
Transportation and logistics is the next massive market opportunity for Amazon but rather than developing it as another internal business unit  this may be spun out 
Amazon currently operates 167 distribution facilities around the world  totaling more than 100 million sq  ft   and continues to grow 
In North America  Amazon operates 92 facilities  including local sortation centers  
Amazon s third party Marketplace is a good example which leverages the scale of Amazon s e commerce traffic and supporting fulfillment infrastructure 

Another Massive Market for Amazon
Colin Sebastian says 
Amazon is not finished disrupting industries 
Just as Amazon leverages infrastructure behind the core retail business to grow AWS and Marketplace  there is evidence the company may extend its increasingly complex and technology centric logistics and delivery platform as a third party offering

166057,387573,FDX,Ride The Online Shopping Wave,opinion,"By now  most retailers have cleared their Halloween gear off the shelves and decked their halls with Christmas merchandise 
The holiday shopping season is nearly upon us  And even though  is far from dead  as I showed last week   we can t ignore the e commerce explosion  either 
Now  the world s most popular online retailer  Amazon com Inc  O AMZN   is wildly overvalued and out of reach for many investors 
However  it s possible to put in a cheap short term trade on the retail giant without buying a single share of Amazon stock 
What Can Brown Do for You 
United Parcel Service Inc  N UPS  is one of the oldest and largest package delivery companies in America 
It delivers packages in over 220 countries and serves nearly 10 billion customers  Importantly  UPS is also one of Amazon s chief U S  package delivery providers 
This year  both UPS and FedEx Corp  N FDX  are projecting a large increase in volume thanks to Amazon s surging Prime membership 
But  as you know  Amazon currently trades at about 900 times its trailing earnings  an absurd multiple 
On the other hand  UPS trades at 24 times earnings  a significant discount to both Amazon and FedEx  which sports a price to earnings multiple of 33 
And while it s not a pure play on Amazon s shipping business  UPS does present an attractive alternative to owning Amazon shares 
To be fair  UPS trades at a premium to the S P 500  18 times earnings   but the stock outperforms the market by a nice margin during the holiday season 

So  how do we profit from UPS on a compressed timeline 
Use the Option  Luke
The easiest way to execute this strategy would be to buy UPS shares today and then sell them sometime around first quarter earnings  And there s nothing wrong with that approach 
But how about a low risk trade that can save you at least 60  in upfront capital 
Because volatility has dropped to pre flash crash levels  options are once again cheap  A short dated  slightly out of the money  OTM  option like the April 2016  105 calls trades for around  3 90 right now 
100 shares of UPS at current levels would cost you  10 400  A 10 contract purchase of the  105 calls costs just  3 900  That s a 63  discount to owning shares 
Ultra aggressive investors might consider an in the money option like the April 2016  95 calls 
These are a bit more expensive  at  9 80  but they re still much cheaper than owning shares  And they ll move faster than the OTM options because they have a tighter price correlation to the underlying shares 
With either option  you only need a slight move in the underlying stock to make a huge profit  And your total exposure is limited to your net debit  or the amount of money you spent to enter the trade 
Another huge bonus to this trade  You re not only capturing Amazon s shipping business but also much of Amazon s online retail competition  as well 
As you can see  this low risk trade offers big time upside 
Bottom line  Don t overpay for Amazon shares  Take advantage of cheap UPS options to cash in on this year s e commerce holiday surge

166084,387600,FDX,Here s What To Expect From FedEx Today,opinion," NYSE FDX  reports its FQ4  15 results before the opening bell this morning and the result is expected to be strong  FedEx is a global player in the shipping and freight industries with a majority of revenues being derived from its Express   Ground Segments 
In anticipation of today s result  both the Estimize community and the Wall Street sell side analysts predict a strong uplift in earnings per share  EPS  for the quarter to  2 76 and  2 70  respectively  from  2 46 in the year ago quarter 

Dissimilar to the EPS estimates  the Estimize community predicts a revenue figure of  12 318B  which is slightly below the Wall Street consensus of  12 327B 

Investors will be eager to hear management s overall outlook as concerns surrounding the company s ability to grow revenues from its Express Segment in a slowing global economic environment persist  The Express Segment is FedEx s premium offering and is the largest contributor to top line revenues  Despite of the company s strong position in this market globally  FedEx has relied upon cost cutting to stimulate net income advances in this business unit  The company has struggled to expand revenues from its Express business over the past three years  a constant concern for investors 
The positive earnings outlook can be attributed to a number of factors including but not limited to the continued benefits of management s profit improvement strategy  Further  depressed oil prices globally are translating to lower expenses and therefore boosting margins  Year to date  YTD  the stock has performed comparatively well posting a 5 0  capital gain relative to the S P 500 which has delivered a lackluster 1 47   This should come as no surprise due to the company s better than expected FQ3  15 EPS figure  The stock has rallied since its intraday low on March 27 when it touched  164 51 and is now trading  181 90 

Today s result may be a catalyst for the stock and a sign for things to come  The Estimize community is predicting a 37 71  uplift in earnings from the FQ3  15 figure  If the reported figures tomorrow are in line with consensus  the stock will likely trade higher as a result ",2015-06-17,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here’s-what-to-expect-from-fedex-tomorrow-255268,255268
166085,387601,FDX,From The Floor  Well  Is It September ,opinion,"Is it September 
The Federal Open Market Committee meeting draws to a conclusion this evening and the question on the lips of virtually everyone who trades will focus on whether the US Federal Reserve is moving towards a September rate hike 
 It is clear that it won t give any firm guidance on a September hike   rather  the FOMC will try to keep all doors open   says Michael Boye from Copenhagen s Fixed Income desk   Nevertheless  the more bullish it sounds  the more the chance of a hike  
 We ll see some cautious optimism that the Q1 weakness in the US was an aberration  Q2 was encouraging  but also a requirement for more data input before pulling the trigger on rates   says John J Hardy  head of forex strategy at Saxo Bank   There is no downside risk to the current state of expectations  
 The upside risk is that if they do see a couple of months of positive data  it  the Fed  will be happy to lift rates   he adds   Currently  the expectations are for liftoff in October or December and if that is shifted back to September  that will be very dollar bullish  
 All in all  markets are very complacent and they have a right to be complacent   says Hardy 
Hardy anticipates USDJPY as one likely mover on the back of FOMC tonight with the resistance line at 123 80 
 Everything is springloaded and waiting for FOMC   he says   I tend to believe in dollar strength so stay on your toes for tonight  
USDJPY was at 123 58 at 0655 GMT

Wings of a dove
Certainly  bonds markets are increasingly factoring in a mildly dove like statement  says Boye  US 10 year Treasury yields have slipped from that 2 5  high of last week to 2 3  and he adds that Fed Funds Futures have also dropped  by a few basis points  possibly reflecting  a safe haven move  
Boye also suggests  watching out for dotplot revisions which are marked fairly aggressively so you would expect some kind of downward revision  In the absence of this  you could anticipate this as some kind of hawkish signal from the statement too

Roadblock
It s a very different picture in Greece with  quite aggressive comments yesterday from the Greek side bringing progress to a complete halt along with reports that Greece will now seek a postponement of the IMF payments due at the end of this month   says Boye 
Greek two year yields shot even higher to above 29  in the aftermath of those comments 
 Bond markets are clearly pointing towards some kind of default scenario   warns Boye 
Getting volatile
From the Floor s noticed that volatilities in the FX Options space have been somewhat dull for a number of months but at last  there looks likes some kind of pickup with NOK pairs in particular  ahead of tomorrow s Norges Bank meeting  getting perky 
 Front end vols on NOK pairs are elevated with the meeting ahead and also on the FOMC   says Dan Larsen from Copenhagen s FX Options desk   It s time to let the games begin as we kick off with the FOMC tonight  
Larsen also points to unusual developments in euro pairs 
 All euro crosses are trading significantly higher than the general market  which indicates that Greece is playing a big part here and this could continue until the end of the month   he says 
Gold s doldrums
It s still a bit of rangebound doldrumatics for gold with moves to the upside capped at  1 194 oz and the downside ultimately grounded at  1 167 oz 
 We ll see if the FOMC meeting tonight can swing the market into action   says Ole Hansen  head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank   It would need some fireworks today  
Platinum meanwhile hit yet another six year low in the Asia session demonstrating the general malaise permeating the precious metals sector 
WTI crude too seems stuck at around the  60 barrel mark with little or no sign of improvement  although an expected slip for the seventh week in a row for US oil inventories today will provide some support 
The fundamentals in oil nevertheless remain firmly on the supply side

Conditions still aren t right for a rate increase

 The Committee continues to judge that the first increase in the federal funds rate will be appropriate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term  At our meeting that ended today  the Committee concluded that these conditions have not yet been achieved      Central Bank 

There are still residual effects of the financial crisis Seven years later

 it seems likely that some cyclical weakness in the labor market remains  the residual effects of the financial crisis  which are likely to continue to constrain spending and credit availability for some time      Central Bank 

Most FOMC members anticipate that rates will be raised this year

 clearly  most participants are anticipating that a rate increase this year will be appropriate  Now  that assumes  as you can see that they re expecting a pickup in growth in the second half of this year and further improvement in labor market conditions      Central Bank 

That s not an ironclad guarantee  but it should happen

 Obviously  we have to you know  there can be surprises that might not happen  It s not an ironclad guarantee  but we anticipate that that s something that will be appropriate later this year      Central Bank 

We re all watching the same data  Monetary policy is being set day to day

 We will be responding to incoming data  we ve tried to make that clear  And I think it s clear that the market is also responding to incoming data and you can see that in daily market reactions to surprises in the economic data     Central Bank 

No one really knows how the market will react when the Fed does raise rates

 I think our experience suggest that it s hard to have great confidence in predicting what the market reaction will be to Fed decisions  and there have been surprises in the past      Central Bank 

We re putting too much emphasis on the first increase though

 I want to emphasize sometimes too much attention is placed on the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate  And what should matter to market participants is the entire trajectory  the entire expected trajectory of policy     Central Bank 

The Fed will still be accommodative even after it raises rates

 Let me emphasize that the importance of the initial increase should not be overstated  The stance of monetary policy will likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time after the initial increase in the federal funds rate     Central Bank 

Is the Fed being too patient though 

Labor markets sound pretty strong

 As investments spending around the world continues we continue to see pretty robust activity in North American search      Executive Search 

Inflation is more mixed

 Some commodities are up  some are down  We are seeing deflation in milk  produce and seafood just the volatility of inflation that s out there  while we ve seen some categories with deflation  we know that pharmacy inflation is actually as high as it s been over the last several years in the first quarter      Grocery 

But even Yellen agrees that the Fed may have raised rates too slowly in  04  06

 I think with the benefit of hindsight  it might have been better to raise rates more rapidly or more during the 2004 to 2006 cycle  You know  I m not certain of that judgment but I think there s a case to be made      Central Bank

 retail stores are really  really important people want to see things and people want to interact in a three dimensional nature it s not about the Internet  the Internet is a channel  It s going to change things  It s going to shift things  But retailers that are penetrating to shrink to greatness  I think they are missing the whole point      Home Furnishing

E Commerce is leading to the decline of the casual shopper

 the challenge for many of us in brick and mortar retailing today  is the decline of the casual shopper when customers come to the store they really have a pretty clear reason why they are there and so yes we re missing those people who are just coming in for a browse and making an impulse purchase whilst they re there  That s the new world that we live in      Retail 

Although E Commerce is booming  people forget that the cost of shipping hasn t really changed

 I think what a lot of people lose in this conversation is the fundamental input cost on pickup and delivery and that while technology today has certainly made user interface much more streamlined and easy as in the case of some of the applications we re all accustomed to today  the fundamental input costs have not changed      Shipping

166087,387603,FDX,Did You Just Miss The Deep Discount FedEx Delivered ,opinion,"FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  delivered a deep discount to your door yesterday morning  At its low point the stock was down almost 17  below Friday s close  If you were lucky enough to grab some stock just above 130 congratulations  In fact there were many stocks that reacted like this  down 15  or more and recovered quickly  But if you missed it don t worry  FedEx leaves those nice stickers on your door telling you they will be back tomorrow 
The chart of the stock may tell you the same thing  but not quite as explicitly  The candlestick that printed yesterday is called a hammer  It is noted for its long lower shadow following the open  that recovered and closed near the open and near the high of the day  It is a signal of exhaustive selling as sellers took control to drive the price down to 130  but buyers then overwhelmed them and drove the price back higher 

These candlesticks suggest a reversal  but need to be confirmed by a higher close Tuesday  Hence FedEx may be back around to give you a buying opportunity today  The other aspects of the chart can also be interpreted as ripe for a turnaround  The price has fallen far outside of the Bollinger Bands   often a place where it snaps higher  Also the RSI is oversold and could bring in some oversold buyers looking for a bounce 
If you bought at the low  certainly protect your gains today  but if you missed it  look for these signs in FedEx  and other stocks like this  to confirm a reversal Tuesday

166088,387604,FDX,S P 500 Earnings Update  Look Beyond The FOMC Meeting This Week,opinion,"All eyes are on the Fed this week  but I ll be more interested in what comes after i e  could we be looking at another government shutdown thanks to the debt ceiling  
When Fed Governor Dudley gave a speech at the NY Federal Reserve a few weeks ago  the Q A was carried live by CNBC  and Bill Dudley noted that with the market volatility at that time  I thought his speech was given the last week of August  15   the upcoming data  in particular the sentiment and jobs data  would be factored into the September 17th  2015  FOMC monetary policy meeting 
The sentiment data that Dudley referenced has come in weaker than expected  and the August  15 jobs report was thought to be on the light side  except that with revisions  it was probably closer to in line or neutral in my opinion 
However the unemployment rate was  as of the September 4th report  5 1  
That metric has to have the FOMC s attention 
This week the financial media will be apoplectic and in a frenzy over the September 16th   17th meeting  with the monetary policy announcement coming this Thursday afternoon 
Jeff Miller  the quality blogger at A Dash of Insight  who writes the  Weighing the Week Ahead  column every week at his own firm  will no doubt have a quality dissection of this week s pending announcement on his blog  with the usual new edition coming out Sunday morning  Here is last week s  Weighing the Week Ahead   Be sure and read the blog every week  Jeff is econ PhD  and knows the data well 
My own opinion is that with no inflation  the FOMC can continue to wait  but personally I d love to see 25 bp s  As one pundit said this week   it is only 25 basis points  bp s   
At some point  and maybe this is an uninformed opinion   the US Financial System has to be weaned off the financial crack of ZIRP  zero interest rate policy  and must learn to ride on two wheels 
By the numbers 
The  forward 4 quarter  estimate fell this week to  123 39  from last week s  123 51 
The P E ratio on the forward estimate as of Friday  9 11  was 16 x  
The PEG ratio is still negative since the y y growth of the forward estimate is still  1 82  
If we looked at  core  earnings growth ex Energy and Ex Apple   
The earnings yield on the S P 500 is 6 29   down from last week s 6 43  
Analysis   conclusion  With almost the entire S P 500 having reported Q2  15 earnings  497 of the S P 500 companies   there is little gained from looking at Q2  15 data  so we turn our attention to companies that will report their August  15 quarter end  and this week that means Oracle  NYSE ORCL  and Fed Ex  NYSE FDX   Wednesday morning  Fed Ex will give readers perhaps their first insight into the  real China  economy since Fred Smith and FDX have been focused on that country for years  Oracle s big issue is transitioning to the Cloud  After this week  Nike  NYSE NKE  and Micron will report the following week  and Nike will also give readers another look into China   Long for clients ORCL  FDX  NKE  
After the FOMC meeting  what I worry about is the renewed fight over the debt ceiling which has been kicked down the road consistently the last few years 
For me personally  one of the reasons ZIRP and monetary policy has been relatively ineffective in igniting robust US economic growth  is partly due to rancorous fiscal policy  and less financial leverage in the financial system thanks to the post 2008 Mortgage Crisis  part of which is due to increased banking regulation   Bill Reider of BlackRock has been talking about this for years  
The fact is the US banking system has been  de risked  the last 7 years  as large banks have shed trading units  and volatile revenue streams for safer businesses  like asset management   and businesses that aren t capital intensive from a regulatory standpoint 
Trust me  this matters to the US economy  I ve always felt that the US banking system was like the human heart  it is the primary vehicle for aggregating and distributing credit  blood  to the US economy  human body  
We have a different banking system today than in the 1980 s and 1990 s  which in some way is a positive and in some ways isn t 
And this isn t political commentary  just economic 
The S P 500 s range since the sharp August 24th drop  the 1 000 point  Dow 30 opening decline  has been 1 867 to 1 993 
The S P 500 closed Friday  September 11th  at 1 961 
The resolution of this trading range will tell readers much about the market  A close above 1 993 and it will be the first real technical sign the S P 500 is healing itself 
Very little has changed regarding core S P 500 earnings growth  we could see 4    7  growth for years  given that the top 2 sectors  Financials and Technology  went through their bear markets from March  2000 through March  2009 
Industrial s in my opinion offer good longer term value  The dollar and the non US markets have conS Pired to make this sector very cheap for longer term investors in my opinion 
All eyes are on the FOMC this week  but look beyond that 
This week is both an options expiration week and a FOMC meeting week

166089,387605,FDX,Company Notes Digest 9 18 15,opinion,"The Macro Outlook 
We talked it over  and we decided not to raise rates
 The recovery from the Great Recession has advanced sufficiently far  and domestic spending appears sufficiently robust  that an argument can be made for a rise in interest rates at this time  We discussed this possibility at our meeting  However  in light of the heightened uncertainties abroad and a slightly softer expected path for inflation  the Committee judged it appropriate to wait for more evidence     Central Bank 
This doesn t mean we ve changed our outlook
 Now  I do not want to overplay the implications of these recent developments  which have not fundamentally altered our outlook  The economy has been performing well  and we expect it to continue to do so      Central Bank 
We just would feel a lot more comfortable if we saw 2  inflation
 I think our credibility hinges on defending our inflation target  So let be clear  2  is our objective  We want to see inflation go back to 2       Central Bank 
But we don t want to push the economy so far that it gets overheated either
 But there are lags in the impact of monetary policy on our economy  And if we waited until inflation is back to two we might be faced within having to tighten policy in a way that could be disruptive to the real economy  And I don t think that s a desirable way to conduct policy  eventually we will find ourselves with a substantial overshoot of our inflation objective  And then we ll be forced into a kind of stop go policy  We will have pushed the economy so far it will have become overheated I don t think it s good policy to then have to slam on the brakes and risk a downturn in the economy      Central Bank 
So we re still hoping to start raising rates this year
 I think you can see from the SEP projections that most participants continue to think that economic conditions will call for or make appropriate an increase in the Federal funds rate by the end of this year     Central Bank 
I know everyone is hanging on our every word  and I m sorry for that
 we re well aware that there s been a huge focus on the decision today I do understand that during this intermeeting period  that every word that an FOMC member has said has been parsed for its potential implications for what our decision will be  I think that s an unfortunate state of affairs      Central Bank 
But we re doing the best we can
 I would ask you to appreciate that there are a lot of cross currents in economic and financial developments that we need to take into account in deciding on what the appropriate course of policy is  And we don t make continuous decisions every single day about our policy  We meet periodically  We do our darnedest to pull together the best analysis we can      Central Bank 
Meanwhile in the real economy 
Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  has given up on waiting for higher interest rates
 Obviously  the subject of interest rates remains very topical and in our own view it has evolved over the last year to more of a lower for longer expectation than in prior periods for both short term and for long term rates  As a result  we ve been adding duration to our balance sheet We still remain asset sensitive and we ll benefit from higher rates  but we stopped waiting for higher rates in order to grow net interest income      Banking 
The Fed s indecision is inducing real uncertainty for companies
 I think the thing we worry about like everybody worries about is  market instability  What happens with interest rates  What happens with the market  The high end of the food chain you ve got people heavily invested in the markets  And if markets are in stable  I think that that s something we ll worry about  And not a lot we can do about it  just be prepared to deal with it and what s going to be the effect of rising interest rates  Will it effect big ticket  Will it expect the home buying  We don t know     Home Furnishing 
FedEx saw weaker than expected economic conditions
 FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  is performing solidly given somewhat weaker than expected global economic conditions  especially in manufacturing in global trade      Delivery 
Citi is increasing loan loss provisions due to the macro environment

Kroger  NYSE KR  saw inflation turn slightly higher at the end of the quarter
 actually if you were to look at the very end of the quarter was a slight bit of inflation in the last several weeks  Nothing to write home about  But it was deflationary for the quarter but got less and actually turned a bit towards the end of the quarter      Grocery 
International 
The Fed is keeping a close eye on China
 with respect to global developments we reviewed developments in all important areas of the world but we have focused particularly on China and emerge markets The question is whether or not there might be a risk of a more abrupt slowdown than most analysts expect      Central Bank 
United Technologies  NYSE UTX  isn t expecting China to improve in 2016

There s a lot of risk taking going on in the banking industry right now
 frankly there s a lot of risk taking going on in the industry today and we re trying to be very  very careful the one area that I m particularly concerned about is multifamily  We don t have a bubble yet but we have an impending bubble there has been too much risk taking and my view would regard to leverage lending      Bank 
The riskiest financing is happening outside of regulated banks
 in leverage lending  I think the   the regulatory impact has been that fewer of us in the regulated banking community both Fed and OCC regulated banks are participating in the most aggressive activity      Bank 
Rather than creating new capacity we ve spent a lot of time recapitalizing businesses this cycle
 I think we ve been rather than creating new cash flows mainly new factories and new products and services  we ve been spending a lot of time recapitalizing businesses through levered buyouts and that s long term   that s not the healthiest thing for the country     Bank 
The Fed is well aware of the effect it could have on housing markets
 of course we recognize that the housing market is sensitive to mortgage rates it is an important factor     Central Bank 
Mortgage credit is just finally opening up again
 So the purchase market has improved  jobs picture has improved  availability has improved  credit I think is widely available     Bank

Healthcare 
States are more likely to expand medicaid coverage after 2016 once the issue isn t so politically charged
 I don t see much movement until post 2016 election  once we have someone else as President and the office maybe Medicaid expansion becomes something that s more state driven rather than considered Obama Care      Hospitals

A recent NLRB decision could affect small businesses all over the US
 I have to say the recent actions by the NLRB are concerned and should be of concern to every business in America  whether it s a large business or small business The BFI decision if it stands will discourage companies from contracting with many small and minority owned businesses  And these are the businesses that are the very heart of the U S  economy      Delivery

166100,387616,FDX,Cowen   Co    S P Capital Positive On FedEx Acquisition Plan,opinion,"On April 7  FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  announced a deal to buy Dutch delivery firm TNT Express NV  AMS TNTE  for  4 8 billion  or 4 4 billion euros  The deal is an all cash public offer of 8 euros per share  which represents a 33  premium over TNT s closing price on April 2  TNT s board unanimously recommended the transaction  though it is contingent upon approval by U S  regulators In January 2013  U S  regulators denied UPS s  NYSE    bid to acquire TNT  The nullified United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  deal valued TNT at  7 billion  or 9 5 euros per share  which is significantly more than FedEx s bid  At the time  regulators claimed the UPS TNT acquisition would impede competition in the delivery sector  However  TNT and FedEx executives are confident that their deal will be approved due to its simplicity and the different nature of the companies  FedEx has a much smaller presence in Europe than UPS  thus there will be little overlap between the two existing models FedEx  NYSE    has a considerable air delivery service in Europe  but a much smaller ground delivery footprint than competitors  The TNT acquisition will be highly beneficial as it will give FedEx access to TNT s existing delivery blueprint throughout Europe  as opposed to creating one from scratch  Home delivery can pose a challenge in some European neighborhoods as apartment buildings are often hard to access and streets are difficult to navigate FedEx CEO Frederik W  Smith commented 

 This transaction allows us to quickly broaden our portfolio of international transportation solutions to take advantage of market trends   especially the continuing growth of global e commerce   and positions FedEx for greater long term profitable growth   Likewise  TNT Express CEO Tex Gunning noted that though the acquisition was unsolicited  it is  good news for all stakeholders

166103,387619,FDX,FedEx Thanks Stronger Dollar for Acquisition,opinion,"Wall Street analysts have made some of the deepest earnings forecast cuts for S P 500 firms since the third quarter of 2009 
When it comes to U S  multinationals  the reason for the lower earnings estimates is  of course  the   Since the beginning of the year  the U S  dollar has increased by 14    and it s popped an incredible 29  in the last year 
Indeed  many investors have painted the stronger dollar as the nemesis of U S  corporations  But that s only true for those without a plan B 
Take the decision by FedEx  NYSE FDX  to acquire the Dutch shipping company TNT Express NV  OTC TNTEY  for  4 8 billion While the stronger dollar does reduce corporate profits from overseas operations  it s also a boon to U S  companies looking to invest in other areas of the world 
FedEx timed the purchase when the dollar is stronger compared to the euro  By doing so  it was able to purchase TNT Express at a price approximately 22  below the cost to buy the company a year ago   when the euro traded at  1 40 
And this good news was welcomed by shareholders of both companies  FedEx shares rose by 2 69   TNT Express had an even better day   nailing an increase of 26 1  over Monday s final price of  6 55 
The Deal Is on Solid Ground
Despite paying a one third premium to TNT s Thursday closing price on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange  the deal makes sense for FedEx   especially in light of FedEx s proven record of improving ailing companies 
Once the deal is completed in the first half of 2016  FedEx s presence in Europe will get a significant boost due to TNT Express  extensive ground network  This will greatly increase the scale of FedEx s European operations and drive operational efficiencies 
And thanks to the Fed s accommodative policy of low interest rates  FDX will consummate the deal at low carry costs  Subsequently  TNT Express  earnings will be highly accretive to FedEx s bottom line as early as Q3 2016 
Now  FedEx isn t the first American company to go after TNT Express  Two years ago  FedEx rival United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  failed to acquire TNT Express over the objections of European Union regulators  They feared potential antitrust concerns by the  
But those fears are likely tempered with the FedEx deal 
FedEx has agreed to a number of non financial covenants to ensure increased odds of regulatory approval  This includes keeping the combined firm s headquarters in the Amsterdam Hoofddorp region 
Additionally  the company hopes to appease regulators who are fearful of European job losses by honoring existing employment terms  FedEx will also maintain TNT Express  hub in Liege  Belgium as a significant operation   A true win win mentality  
And in the company s biggest concession  FedEx has committed to divesting itself of all of TNT Express  aircraft operations in order to comply with current airline ownership regulations 
Of course  this last concession isn t very important to a company that effectively operates the world s largest airline based on freight tons flown   and the world s fourth largest airline based solely on fleet size 
Time to Buy FDX 
FedEx has provided a very healthy earnings growth history recently  And it s this growth that promises to reward current and future FedEx shareholders 
The company s earnings per share  EPS  reached  6 75 in 2014  But EPS is expected to grow to  8 94 this year   a 32 4  increase 
Using the Graham Dodd formula for calculating fair value  FedEx is currently undervalued based on Tuesday s closing price  And if the company s future earnings estimates hold true  the company is significantly undervalued at these levels 
So investors should take FedEx s lead and use the stronger dollar to deliver profits to their own portfolios

Despite what should be a great environment for the transport names  lower gas prices paired with heightened consumer confidence and the increasing popularity of e commerce shopping  FedEx and some of its peers missed their Q4 expectations  Earnings per share for the latest quarter came in at  2 14  lower than the Estimize consensus of  2 17 and much lower than the  2 22  which the Street was anticipating  Revenue per package fell due to decreased fuel surcharges and lower weight  and international revenue per package was flat due to unfavorable currency trends 
It s important to note  however  that FedEx s Q4 numbers ended with November results  therefore only capturing the very beginning of the holiday shopping season  Sales during black Friday weekend and cyber Monday were admittedly disappointing  with holiday shopping not heating up until the end of December and even carrying into the beginning of January  With holiday sales for the 2014 season hitting a 3 year high  and new records for e commerce sales  Q1 revenues should be enough to offset any currency headwinds if the company managed properly 

Another win for the transport stocks will be the recently introduced  dimensional weight pricing   which previously only applied to packages greater than 3 feet  This is essentially the same as increasing prices  and there is no downside for logistics companies  If shippers decide to right size their packaging  FedEx will be able to take more packages per trip  if shippers do not adapt and continue to use boxes that are too large  they will just have to pay up for it  Either way  FedEx wins  The rumor is that this could boost shipping costs by 5  25

166137,387653,FDX,Europeans Markets Up Ahead Of PMI Data ,opinion,"European futures are trading higher and traders are glad that the US non farm payroll sell off was filtered by the long weekend break  It was an absolute panic on Friday and the U S  indices dropped like a rock on the back of the news the disheartening economic data  Although  it took them a while to digest the news that Fed are still data dependent and any weakness in the economic data is equal to the presence of cheap money The comment by the Fed officials  Mr Dudley  have further embolden those views  and now we have a question mark on the summer rate hike  A few more speeches in a similar tone by some other officials could further fuel up this speculative behaviour  Nevertheless  this makes the divergence in the global Central bank s policies  which is a concern for many  a lot less stressful and could ease up those tensions  As a result  we should see some new capital commitment by the investors Greece stayed in the headlines over the long weekend as the Greek finance minister refused to take out any time for his leisure and was in a constant battle to assure his country s creditors that they will make the payment to the IMF on time  However  it seems highly unlikely how that pot will be filled with the Euros  given the capital flight is on its peaks and the government is struggling to pay its employees  Although  investors may not take the IMF default incident a unique and a first event in the history because in the past such events have taken places  but perhaps  the more focus will be on the consequences of this event  History tells us that such events are followed by the lack in depositor confidence  a cut down in country s rating and further tighter grip around lending criteria that is if someone is willing to lend despite higher borrowing cost Mergers and accusation news is back today in full throttle after FedEx  NYSE FDX  has announced their desire to take over TNT express  Although it makes sense as it will make the process more streamline and will also reduce the cost for the company however  the TNT shareholders may try to squeeze out a little more despite the offer price is nearly 33  higher than the share closing price As for economic news  we have PMI reading for the eurozone and the UK  France and Germany will have their prints this morning  Although  the pound may still remain under pressure due to upcoming elections but the euro could move higher on the back of good readings  The lower euro and the ECB QE are both strong tail winds which so far have proven to ignite some growth in the eurozone

166167,387683,FDX,The Fear Factor Meets The Year 5 Phenomenon ,opinion,Despite continued front page fears over Greece s threatened exit from the euro and the military encroachments of the terrorist group known as ISIS  investors apparently aren t sufficiently worried enough to sell equities  If anything  adage about the  wall of worry  has been the driving force behind recent equity market gains as the front page fears have been largely ignored Investors were skittish entering 2015  so much so that billions were poured into safe haven assets including U S  Treasuries and precious metals  The soaring US Dollar  below  was as much a sign of the flight to safety as it was a symptom of U S  economic strength  Since the start of February  however  there has been a conspicuous change in investors  perceptions of the foreseeable future  To begin with  the sudden reversal of investor fear can be seen in the chart of the iShares Barclays  LONDON BARC  20  Year Treasury  ARCA TLT   a proxy for the U S  bond market  Treasury prices haven t fallen this sharply since the May September 2013 period  which also marked a period of increasing confidence in the future outlook for U S  consumers and investors  During that period  Treasuries and other safety assets underperformed vis   vis risk assets such as stocks Another indication that investors have cast off their worries  at least for now  is the dramatic plunge in the Dow Jones Utility Average  DJUA   The utilities have given back all their gains from the last two months and are experiencing their worst performance since 2013  Utility stocks normally follow the direction of bond prices  so it s not surprising to see the DJUA s recent weakness given the recent sell off in Treasuries  The relatively higher yields that utility stocks typically command along with their safety oriented reputation make them attractive to investors seeking safety  The utilities benefited from the increased investor pessimism of the late 2014 early 2015 period  Now the safe haven utility stocks are suffering along with gold from the unwinding of the  fear trade   Concomitant with the subsiding of investor fear is the breakout to a record high in the New Economy Index  NEI   NEI is comprised by averaging the stock prices of the most economically sensitive companies within the consumer retail and business sectors  including Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN O   FedEx  NYSE FDX  Corporation  NYSE FDX   and Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT   After spending most of 2014 in a lateral trading range  NEI broke out above the 1 year trading range ceiling earlier this month and followed it up with another high last week  The implication behind the breakout in the NEI is that consumers and business owners are increasing their spending levels as we head further into 2015  a sign of increasing consumer confidence  The true state of the U S  economy has been the subject of heated debate lately  Going strictly by the accounts offered by many respected economists  including Ed Yardeni and Scott Grannis  spending levels on both the consumer and business levels are quite healthy  Government statistics bear this out  as do various consumer confidence polls  Yet some analysts insist that the government s numbers are  cooked  and do not accurately reflect the underlying state of the economy  According to an Associated Press article  while the official unemployment rate has fallen to 5 6 percent  average hourly wages have declined  It was also reported last month that a record 92 898 000 Americans are not currently in the workforce  One news service even reported that there are still over 46 million Americans who are food stamp recipients  As one analyst concluded   It is quite obvious that the official numbers by the government are often very deceptive   So who is right   the mainstream analysts who contend that the U S  economy is on the mend or the naysayers who claim the economy remains stuck in neutral  or worse   The source of the confusion can be traced to misguided attempts at generalizing the enormous and multifaceted U S  economy  The economy is much like the weather in that any attempt at creating a compressed generalization is bound to cover a multitude of important details  The economy  much like the weather  covers a broad geographic area can only produce a very sloppy  average  picture while ignoring the scores of micro climates within that picture  What is commonly called the  economy  is simply a snapshot of the United States based on averaging the data within various sectors  Conventional economic analysis also tends to lump the various socio economic strata   namely lower  lower middle  middle  upper middle and upper classes   into a single broad category  Presently the U S  upper middle and upper classes are in a much more prosperous condition than are the lower to middle classes  Because the higher income groups account for so much of the big ticket purchases it tends to gloss over the fact that the middle and lower income strata have lagged  This is one reason for the differing accounts behind the U S  recovery It s often overlooked that at its core the U S  economy is essentially a financial economy  The financial sector accounts  directly or indirectly  for a huge percentage of total economic activity  This is why central bank policy is paramount to the overall state of economic activity in America  Quantitative easing  QE  directly benefits the financial market by inflating stock prices  which in turn benefits the financial sector  the economy s major component   As long as the financial sector is growing  it s only a matter of time before the rest of the economy follows suit  There s no denying the strength in the New Economy Index  NEI  previously discussed  An expanding NEI is tangible proof that consumers are spending at increasing levels while businesses which cater directly to consumers are also seeing increased sales  This will eventually filter into the broader economic statistics used by economists  NEI is essentially a real time reflection of consumer spending levels In the wake of the 1930s Great Depression  Freeman Tilden made this timely observation  In a great state in prosperity  things are never as good as they seem  on the other hand  in adversity they are never as bad as they seem  This is why contemporary prediction is nearly always wrong  Long after a tottering state should have fallen it is propped by the patient  law abiding  submerged  industrious and thrifty middle class  and by the mere habit of existing  The heart continues resolutely to beat  Sometimes the lag between a financial market turnaround and a general recovery in consumer finances can be quite long  as was the case in the 1930s and 1970s  Given that the U S  suffered its worst financial catastrophe since the Great Depression in 2008  it s to be expected that a broad based economic recovery has been very slow in arriving  As long as the financial sector remains healthy and monetary liquidity remains loose  the beleaguered middle class will eventually see improvement in its economic prospects  Despite proclamations to the contrary from pundits  the U S  middle class will emerge from the Great Recession in a stronger state Mastering Moving AveragesThe moving average is one of the most versatile of all trading tools and

Plug Power will become  EBITDA  break even by the fourth quarter of 2015
The company s stock price has risen over 20  in the past month  in accordance with Algorithmic Forecast from January 20th
Algorithmic Forecast For Last Month and for 2015

  Plug Power Inc  NASDAQ PLUG   an alternative energy technology provider  is engaged in the design  development  manufacturing  and commercialization of fuel cell systems for the industrial off road markets worldwide  Plug Power uses cost effective solutions to increase productivity  lower operating costs  and reduce carbon footprints  Its signature solution  GenKey  provides an all inclusive package for customers  incorporating GenFuel hydrogen and fueling infrastructure  GenCare aftermarket service and either GenDrive or ReliOn fuel cell systems  
Plug Power Set For Large Growth In 2015
Last year was a turning point for Plug Power  as the launch of GenKey  strong sales growth  and promising new market initiatives set the company up for an exciting 2015  Sales have soared over the last few quarters on strong demand for its GenKey product  an integrated suite of GenDrive fuel cells and services  but the company sometimes has to contend with choppy revenue recognition  The company s executives announced lower revenue projections than it was expecting  with the latest revenue projections for 2015 at  100 million  Previous estimates put the revenue projections for the year closer to  120 million  While this could be interpreted as bad news for the company s outlook  it should actually end up having a positive impact  Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh said the lower projections were not due to slowing acceleration of sales  but because of how revenue is recognized  The company cannot recognize sales as revenue until the product is shipped  Marsh also emphasized that he would rather under promise and over deliver  setting the company up to be successful during the upcoming year compared to Wall Street estimates  Plug Power believes it can grow revenue by 40  this year  even with the lowered revenue projections  The fuel cell company expects to book  200 million in orders this year  up from  150 million last year  Marsh stated that he expects to add six new customers this year  while continuing to grow orders with current customers  The company is seeing recurring orders from its existing customers  indicating that they are satisfied  The current customer base is rather strong  including automobile giants such as Mercedes Benz  XETRA DAIGn  and BMW  XETRA BMWG  and large retail customers like Kroger  NYSE KR  and Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   To keep its customers happy and maintain their business  Plug Power introduced its own GenFuel stations  The hydrogen fueling infrastructure is expected to be a bigger part of their market in the future  These will provide operational efficiencies and cost savings to its consumers  Customers already signed up for this service include Wal Mart and FedEx  NYSE FDX   The company also provides after market service  another stream of revenue that keeps customers satisfied  Plug Power also announced changes to its corporate management team that provides the structure needed to enable the company to translate success and momentum generated in 2014 into profitable growth opportunities in 2015  Tim Cortes joined the company as Vice President of Hydrogen  and he will oversee the GenFuel business  His knowledge of investment planning will enable the company to more effectively expand into adjacent segments  Jose Luis Crespo was also promoted to Vice President of Global Sales  a new position for the company  and will be responsible for market entry for the GenDrive and ReliOn brands  
The Company Will Become Profitable This Year
What really makes 2015 such an interesting time for the company is it appears set to become profitable by the end of the year  With the most recent financial projections discussed earlier  Plug Power will become  EBITDA  break even by the fourth quarter of 2015  meaning earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization will be positive instead of a loss  The company s operations have never been profitable before  a big step for the publicly traded company  Figure 1  Source   Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO O  Finance A closer look at Plug Power s operations shows why the company is set to become profitable this year and why the stock is so attractive for investors at this point in time  Figure 1 shows the companies research and development in the blue bars and total operating expenses in the red line  The total operating expenses continues to go up as the company grows  but the research and development investment has decreased and remains low  The company is coming to scale  as it has introduced the technology and products to be successful  Figure 2 shows selling general and administrative expense  SG A  in the blue bars and gross margin percentage in the red line  This table shows that SG A expenses have increased 20  in the last year  At the same time  gross margins have been steadily increasing over the last 18 months  and look like they will break even if the trend continues  The two tables taken together show the company is now focused on becoming profitable  focusing more on sales of the products it already has instead of creating new products  Plug Power s ability to scale sales up and turn gross margins positive make this small cap company extremely attractive to any long term investors  Figure 2  Source  Yahoo Finance
Algorithmic Forecast From Last Month
I Know First is an investment firm  that utilizes an advanced self learning algorithm based on Artificial Intelligence  AI  and Machine Learning  ML  that also incorporates elements of artificial neural networks  as well as genetic algorithms  in order to model and predict the flow of money in almost 2 000 markets from 3 days to a year

166190,387706,FDX,Bulls Revel In New Highs But Oil Introduces A Dark Cloud,opinion,"As everyone knows  stocks do not go up in a straight line  not even during the holidays  So although the future looks bright for U S  equities  as the major indexes continue to hit or challenge new highs  the market has been gasping for a breather to gather bullish conviction  My fear has been that we might not see it until January  which likely would have resulted in a more severe correction at that time  But falling oil prices and a weak Energy sector seems to have introduced a reason to sell this week  Correspondingly  the Energy sector is now ranked at the bottom of our fundamentals based  forward looking sector rankings 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
In the fall of 1999  my older daughter was in kindergarten  and I met another father at her school who had moved his family to Santa Barbara from Puerto Rico  He had enjoyed success with real estate and construction there and owned free and clear a large house in downtown San Juan  As his kids were ready to start attending school  he decided to monetize his big house by leasing it out  But rather than using the lease payments as income to live on  he took out a large mortgage on his house and gave it to his financial advisor back home to invest for him  After all  stocks were raging and his broker was enamored with the performance of the NASDAQ Composite Index  All his money was invested in NASDAQ stocks  particularly the Technology sector 
The following spring of 2000  as the index approached its incredible closing high of 5 048  or 5 132 intraday   he was getting more and more anxious about the meteoric rise  And as the market began its fateful decline  his broker kept telling him not to worry because new technologies were the engine for all future of global economic growth  But fears of Y2K doom and gloom proved unfounded  and instead budgets were slashed for further capital upgrades  Software company valuations based solely on projected revenues rather than earnings were chopped off at the knees  Dot com valuations that were based solely on web site visits  a k a   eyeballs  became dot bombs  Ultimately  my friend s investment account was decimated and his brief retirement  in his 30 s  had to end  He returned to the construction business back in Puerto Rico 
Today  the NASDAQ is once again approaching the 5 000 level for the first time in nearly 15 years  Over the past two years as U S  economic recovery has taken shape  the index is up almost 2 000 points  70    So the logical question is whether there is more validity to this valuation level  beyond the impact of inflation  of course  
Well  some things are quite different this time  With a trailing P E around 20  NASDAQ stocks display an average P E that is actually about the same as the S P Midcap 400 Index  But many market observers still believe that the Fed s easy money policy has inflated the valuations for many speculative stocks 
Not to be outdone  the Dow 30 Industrials blue chip average is knocking on the door at 18 000  The S P 500 large caps are eyeing 2 100  The combination of economic weakness outside the U S  and increasing U S  oil production continues to push down the price of oil  which on the surface should create a wealth effect among consumers  Hiring is on pace to make 2014 the strongest for job growth since 1999  And of course  we are in a seasonally strong time of year  which has been bolstered by recent short covering among hedge funds and share buyback activity among corporations  And despite worries about a slowdown in China s growth  the Shanghai index is up about 40  this year 
Another bright spot in the bulls  court is falling asset price correlations  which ConvergEx reported has fallen in November to five year lows  with average correlations among the ten business sectors of the S P 500 at 58   and with other asset classes  displaying similar trends   ConvergEx believes that the end of QE3 is allowing asset classes to perform according to their fundamentals rather than enabling highly correlated risk on risk off behavior  In other words  stock picking and asset allocation strategies matter again  Moreover  ETFGI reports that the U S  ETF ETP industry reached a new record of  1 98 trillion in AUM at the end of November  while global ETF ETPs set a new record of  2 76 trillion 
However  the oil price collapse is proceeding far deeper than imagined and might be shaping up as a dreaded Black Swan type event in many ways    not only for the energy sector and oil producing nations directly but also indirectly for the banking sector through the junk bond market  Those countries that depend upon oil revenues are in deep trouble  since there seems to be little in the way of near term catalysts to drive oil prices higher  And high yield bonds have been showing a technical divergence from equities for well over a year  which has been worrisome for the economy  Energy high yield debt represents 16  of the  1 3 trillion market  which leaves many banks holding that debt seriously exposed 
The U S  10 Year Treasury bond yield closed Friday at 2 33  and seems unwilling to move higher  while the 2 Year Treasury bond yield is up significantly  In other words  the yield curve is getting flatter  even without the new injections of bond buying from the Federal Reserve 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  fell even further to close Friday at 11 82  In this bullish climate  the VIX remains well below the important 15 level 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 208 00  and in the process set new intraday and closing highs  Two weeks ago it closed at 206 68  so not much has changed  As the month began  the market flirted with the idea of a pullback that it very much needs  closing the gap from November 20  but the bulls just wouldn t let it happen    at least not yet  Price is creeping higher beneath the strong resistance line from the long standing rising bullish channel  but not even attempting to break through  The 20 day simple moving average seems to be offering temporary support  The overbought technical condition has not abated  as oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic all quickly returned to overbought but really need to cycle back down if a concerted breakout attempt is to have any chance of success 

Notably  the Russell 2000 small cap index  which hit 1213 during the summer  is struggling mightily at 1182 and will be hard pressed to eclipse strong resistance at the 1200 level  NASDAQ and the mid caps hit their new highs during Thanksgiving week  So  although a sustained breakout of the SPY is still possible at this level  I would greatly prefer to see a retest of support levels  some back and filling  and a working off of the overbought conditions  Sorry  but last week s mild pullback to start the month wasn t nearly enough  So  this is the week that we should see something happen in this regard or else we will likely have to wait until early January    which could be a more dramatic event 
Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
The outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials ETF  NYSE IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU   
Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
   Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   The rankings continue to remain mostly stable    and perhaps a bit more bullish  Technology and Healthcare continue to rein supreme  although they have switched places again  Technology is back in the top spot with an Outlook score of 86  Tech stocks are no longer getting hit with downward earnings revisions from sell side analysts  and they display the best return ratios  a good forward long term growth rate  and a reasonably good forward P E  Healthcare scores a 78 and displays good sell side analyst support  a strong forward long term growth rate  solid insider sentiment  buying activity   and good return ratios  although its forward P E is on the high side  Financial remains in third with a score of 68  and it continues to display the lowest  most attractive  forward P E  Next in the rankings are Utilities  followed by Consumer Services Discretionary  a k a   Cyclicals  and Industrial  The latter two continue to see their scores improve  which is bullish for the market   and in fact Consumer Services received the strongest analyst score this week  net positive earnings revisions  
2   Basic Materials got a reprieve from the onslaught of downward earnings revisions while insider sentiment also improved  so its score has strengthened  But Energy continues to be pounded by Wall Street analysts  as oil prices fall beyond all expectations   with cuts to forward earnings estimates and a lower forward long term growth rate  Even with the big fall in prices already for stocks within the sector  the overall forward P E is a bit higher  worse  this week due to the downgrades  As a result  Energy is in the bottom position  although its one glimmer of hope is a slight uptick in insider sentiment  buying activity   Joining Energy in the bottom two is Telecom  which generally scores poorly across the board in most factors in the Outlook model 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Industrial displays the highest score of 60  followed by Healthcare and Energy  Telecom scores the lowest at 46  The top bottom spread is 14 points  reflecting relatively high sector correlations during particularly strong market days  i e   correlated risk on behavior  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide  risk on  mentality that dominated 2013 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities again displays the highest score of 60 this week  as one would expect for this traditionally defensive sector  but its score is actually falling  Utilities stocks have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  Energy displays the lowest score of 40  followed by Basic Materials  The top bottom spread is 20 points  which continues to reflect low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5   Technology now displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  followed closely by Healthcare  while Energy is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Healthcare is the leader  followed closely by Utilities and Financial  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Energy is still the worst  followed closely by Telecom and Basic Materials  indicating general investor avoidance 
6   Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings look more bullish to me  The onslaught of downward earnings revisions has subsided  with the exception of Energy sector   although it hasn t turned greatly positive either  thus allowing the stable Utilities sector to hold up in the rankings   Five of the top six sectors are economically sensitive  or in the case of Healthcare  all weather   and they also display some of the highest Bull scores  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   continues to indicate a bullish bias this week  and it suggests holding Healthcare  Industrial  and Technology  in that order  for those portfolios that might be due for rebalance    Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based trend following standpoint because SPY is above both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Healthcare  Industrial  and Technology sectors include iShares US HealthCare Providers ETF  NYSE IHF   SPDR S P Transportation ETF Trust  NYSE XTN   and Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund  NYSE XLK  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Healthcare  Industrial  and Technology sectors include Centene  NYSE CNC   Health Net  NYSE HNT   FedEx  NYSE FDX   Spirit Airlines  NASDAQ SAVE   SolarWinds  NYSE SWI   and SanDisk  NASDAQ SNDK   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top two quintiles  lowest accounting related risk  of our   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found EQR quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you prefer to maintain a neutral bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Technology  Healthcare  and Financial  in that order   And if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Technology  and Healthcare  in that order  
IMPORTANT NOTE   Some readers have been asking for more specifics on how to trade our sector rotation strategy based solely on what I discuss in my weekly newsletter  Thus  I feel compelled to remind you that I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

166191,387707,FDX,S P 500  Pressure Continues On Earnings As Oil Sinks,opinion,"Per Thomson Reuter s This Week in Earnings  the  forward 4 quarter  estimate fell this week to  124 37 from last week s  125 36 

The p e ratio on the forward estimate is now 16 x  

The PEG ratio is 2 52 x  

The  earnings yield  on the SP 500 is 6 21  

The year over year growth rate of the forward estimate fell again to 6 38  from 7 18  last week 

Analysis   commentary  As someone who has CNBC   Bloomberg on all day  sometimes muted  sometimes not   it was tough to reconcile this week s very bullish commentary about the  75    100 billion gasoline tax cut  a potentially renewed consumer  and the price action of the SP 500  which finished the week down 3 52   and shook the confidence of those looking for the year end rally 

Since the week ended October 17th  the growth rate of the SP 500 forward estimate has now fallen over 300 bp s to 6 38  from 9 49   Energy s estimated q4  14 growth rate has fallen 2 350 bp s or 23 5  from October 1  14 through December 12  2014  which is accounting for a big percentage of the drag on q4  14 earnings 

Fed Ex reports this week  and given FDX s fuel costs as a percentage of their revenue   about 10    makes me believe their fiscal 2015 guidance  ends May  15  will be critical  FDX should see a HUGE tailwind from the drop in crude oil and fuel prices  but what they say about the volume and economies of the US and non US economies will be critical 

Basically everyone is blaming any weakness on the drop inCrude Oil the last three months 

1   Widening credit spreads  particularly in high yield are blamed on Energy s weight in the high yield index  which is supposedly 15  or so 

2   The drop in equity prices this week was blamed in the drop in crude as the  rapid flush  in oil prices was supposedly too far  too fast spooking investors 

3   For me personally  and what no one I ask can seem to answer the question I ve asked  is it seemed like the Bakken and Marcellus shale regions were the source of a lot of some US growth over the last 3   5 years  Just how many new jobs were from those regions  and how secure are those jobs now  and what impact does that have on employment since OPEC and the Saudi s seem to be targeting exactly that production  

4   Jobless claims have stopped falling and seem to have steadied in the  just below  300k area 

5   Factset noted that per their data  th drop in the q4  14 SP 500 earnings estimate was due to Energy and Telco revisions  Verizon s   NYSE VZ  warning this week  was a bit of a surprise  There is a price war in the wireless carrier business  and supposedly consumers will benefit  For q4  14 the Telco sector earnings growth has fallen from an expected 23 8  on October 1  14 to 15 1  today   No Verizon  but bought some AT T Inc  NYSE T  

Seasonally  the market should be strong into the year end  so this week s price action was a big surprise  Granted the SP 500 and all but the Energy sector were overbought coming into Monday  but at any point over the last 2 years you could have said the same thing 

Energy s earnings weight in the SP 500 is larger than its market cap weight  as was noted in  blog post yesterday 

Naturally after this week s 3 5  drop in the SP 500  the 3 78  drop in the Dow 30 and the 2 66  decline in the Nasdaq  I wonder if this is more than Energy supply issues at work here 

FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX   Oracle Corporation  NYSE ORCL  and Nike Inc  NYSE NKE  all report this week  with November 30 quarter ends  I will be listening for linearity of demand during the quarter s  particularly from FDX and NKE 

The underlying premise up till now is that Energy earnings decline are masking good growth in other sectors ",2014-12-13,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/s-p-500:-pressure-continues-on-earnings-as-oil-sinks-235649,235649
166212,387728,FDX,Will FedEx Reverse 2 Earnings Misses In A Row On Wednesday ,opinion,"FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  is set to report FQ4 2014 earnings before the market opens on Wednesday  June 18th  FedEx is one of the largest courier and delivery service companies in the United States  Last quarter FedEx disappointed investors by reporting lower than expected revenue and earnings  missing the Wall Street earnings consensus by over 25c per share  This quarter Wall Street is expecting FedEx to step up its profitability and increase earnings per share by over 10   However  investors are not quite as bullish in their bottom line expectations as the Street is on Wednesday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for FedEx to report  2 36 EPS and  11 617B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 18 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  2 31 EPS and  11 659B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting FedEx to miss the Wall Street earnings consensus by 5c per share while outperforming the Street s revenue projection by  42 million 
Over the previous 6 quarters  the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting FedEx s EPS and revenue 2 and 4 times respectively  By tapping in to a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant Research and an independent academic study from Rice University  that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing an average differential between the two groups  expectations 

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  2 15 to  2 37 per share and from  11 520B to  11 855B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a wider range of estimates on FedEx s earnings 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wide range of estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Over the past 3 months  Wall Street increased its EPS consensus from  2 32 to  2 36 while the Estimize consensus fell throughout the period from  2 34 to  2 31  Meanwhile  the Wall Street revenue forecast decreased from  11 720B to  11 617B while the Estimize sales consensus declined from  11 754B to  11 659B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and the directionality of analyst revisions going into an earnings report are often a leading indicator  Here we see the Estimize consensus dropping before the report 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is nano who projects  2 33 EPS and  11 648B in revenue  nano is  overall among over 4 500 contributing analysts  This season nano has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 47  and 50  of the time respectively throughout 36 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case nano is expecting FedEx to report between the expectations of Wall Street and Estimize  beating the Estimize consensus on earnings  but missing on revenue 
This quarter FedEx doesn t have the poor weather excuse to lean on and Wall Street has set its year over year profit growth target high at over 10   Contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform seem to have taken notice of FedEx s 2 quarters in a row of misses on the bottom line and are expecting FedEx to miss the Wall Street earnings consensus again on Wednesday while brining in slightly better than expected revenue ",2014-06-18,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-fedex-reverse-2-earnings-misses-in-a-row-on-wednesday-216437,216437
166213,387729,FDX,Is There A Market Bubble ,opinion,"Oh  the power of misinformation   and the price that gets paid in the end  I can hardly believe it  but here we go again 
For the stock market  the highlight of the week was the Fed meeting  the rough equivalent of Sherlock Holmes s dog that didn t bark   that was the curious incident    When the FOMC  monetary policy committee  didn t raise rates  stock prices joyfully leapt higher  in a manner reminiscent of 2007  Back then  every Fed meeting at which the central bank did not actually cut rates was occasion for ecstatic joy in the equity pits  That may seem counterintuitive  but every momentum market knows how to create its own reality 
In the 2007 edition  each deferral of action only increased the market s frenetic certainty that the Fed would simply have to cut rates at the next meeting  The slogan was   if you wait for the move  you ll miss the move  and so the market would rally in eager anticipation of rate cuts that would never come  When the Fed finally did cut rates in October of that year  it was the beginning of the end  The stock market peaked two weeks later and took another year and a half to bottom  losing more than half its value in the process 
As I wrote during the week  the last minute notion that the Fed might instigate a surprise rate increase was typical of any number of rumors of the most dubious origin I have seen over the years  The point of them is to spread some fear while simultaneously taking the opposite side of the trade  an old wheeze that goes back to the days of Daddy Warbucks and the Roaring Twenties   and to William Shakespeare  for that matter  When Ronald Reagan was president  the market that so adored him would also periodically kill him  psst    the President s dead   
The jubilation over the Fed not raising rates   an event thought to have zero probability three weeks ago   obscured the fact that once again  the bank lowered its forecast for the current year to 2 1  2 3  inflation adjusted GDP  for a year widely predicted to come in at 3 5  or more this past January  As usual  it maintains its forecast for next year  and come September or December  the bank s staff will no doubt rinse and repeat the second part of the process of the last four years  Start lowering the forecast for next year while raising it for the year after 
A similar ploy came along Friday  when an  equity strategist  from Wells Fargo was on CNBC talking about  event risk  as being the  only threat  to the stock market s invincible  inevitable  divinely ordained  surely   rise  As an example of big negative event risk  he gave the possibility that come July  China might announce a 6 5  growth rate for second quarter GDP 
To quote Mr  John McEnroe  you cannot be serious  The strategist knows as well as I do that 1  the Chinese government announces whatever GDP rate it sees fit to announce  and 2  that a minimum floor for GDP of 7 5  had just been announced by China s Premier    The chances that the country will announce 6 5  four weeks after its Premier said 7 5  is the minimum are exactly zero   but don t be surprised to see more attempts to push this inside baseball  rumor  in advance of the release  It s a farce 
Exhibit Three  FedEx  NYSE FDX   ne  Federal Express  The company announced its quarterly results Wednesday morning and I was rather taken aback to see a jubilant Jim Cramer uber gushing over them on   Had I been missing something in the economic data  Surely the market would have discounted a certain amount of traffic rebound in a quarter ending May 31st  especially since FedEx itself had complained during our seemingly endless  though not on the West Coast  winter about the weather s deleterious impact on business  Perhaps something big was afoot 
So I looked at the company s numbers and went through the conference call  The first thing I want to say is that the company s performance was absolutely normal and that it executed its plan well  The second thing is that while management was perfectly straightforward about the numbers  all  I repeat  all of the Wall Street hoopla thrown about in their aftermath is an absolute  back of the medicine truck load of utter nonsense that would have sent The Catcher in the Rye s phony phobic Holden Caulfield charging off his cliff  Any notion that the company s results reflect some sea change in either the economy or its own business is a lot of nonsense  ebullient stories notwithstanding 
FedEx quarterly revenue was up 3 5  year over year  To be candid  I consider that to be less than special for a rebound quarter  The revenue increase was on the back of 2  growth in total package volume  That s right  2  growth  the same 2  growth rate that the company had for its entire fiscal year  the same 2  that real GDP has been growing at for the last two years 
This lede from CNBC   Shares of FedEx shot up to an all time high after the company reported its quarterly profits more than doubled last quarter   More smoke and mirrors  Profits more than doubled because the just ended quarter had none of the writedowns and special charges that the company took a year ago  FedEx was completely straightforward about that fact in the first paragraph of its release  using a figure of  2 13 as the base comparison to the latest quarter s  2 46  That s a long way from doubling  but even so 15  growth is pretty good  isn t it  Sure  except that  0 12 of it came from share repurchases  that the company also plainly disclosed  
That still leaves us with 10  EPS growth  Oh  one more thing  the company has eliminated 3 600 positions in the last eighteen months  In fact  what we are left with is the national formula for S P earnings growth  take volume growth of one to two percent  Add price growth of one to two percent until you have revenue growth of two to three percent  Sack employees and buy back shares until earnings growth is to taste  by the way  lowering FedEx book value by about 5  in the process   Why  just look at that earnings growth   the economy must be doing great  Yes  it s growing at 2  
Here s another fellow   the EPS outlook fell exactly into the middle of Wall Street estimates  so it was hardly a surprise   In fact  if you dissect the company s outlook the outlook for earnings improvement is based not on an acceleration in revenue or volume  but on buying back more shares and operational efficiencies   yield    It s also qualified on no increases in fuel costs and no slowdown in global growth  In other words  it expects to grow unless the economy slows down and or costs go up  Cause for celebration indeed 
The FedEx story is no surprise at all  but an all too familiar one that gives rise to editorials like the one Stanley Druckenmiller  successful hedge fund manager  and Kevin Warsh  erstwhile Fed governor  penned this week in the Journal     As the article says   corporate chieftains rationally choose financial engineering debt financed share buybacks  for example over capital investment in property  plants and equipment   Or increased hiring  for that matter 
In the interim  the curiously closed world of the investment community whips itself into an ever great lather over asset prices  Not earnings or economic growth  mind you  but asset prices that rise out of any proportion to the first two until it s taken on faith that the latter must be growing in a way we can t see  or can t see yet but surely will  or   in the latest artful dodge   really quite handsome in spite of their homely appearance  Most of the talking heads on CNBC seem content to play the role of cheerleaders these days  aided and abetted by nearly any equity mutual fund manager that can get onto the show   prattling twenty times a day  at least  over the latest  new all time high   Oh  for the days of the late uber skeptic Mark Haines and his unflappable co host  Erin Burnett 
The problem is not rising stock prices  It s that when prices have been rising out of any proportion to the underlying fundamentals of real earnings  those prices inevitably do not rise to they sky  but return back to earth  And it won t be the governors of the Federal Reserve that pay the price for that yawning crater  nor the money managers and their fawning acolytes who insist that the only logical future is to invest more into a market that must surely go up  It s everyone else watching their 401K plan  their IRA plans and their jobs suddenly disappear at an age they can least afford it  But don t worry   Janet Yellen says there is no bubble  and the Fed would never misinform us  As Marc Antony once observed  they are all honorable men 
The Economic Beat
The highlight of the economic data  apart from the lowered GDP forecast from the Fed  was the current manufacturing rebound  which owes as much to the warming weather as the earlier downturn did to the cold  though the latter got far more attention in the investment world  The lowlight was housing  where weak housing starts and declines in mortgage activity led to a wave of downgraded growth estimates for the sector 
Industrial production rose 0 6  in May  according to the Fed s initial estimate  a decent rebound from an April not as bad as feared  being revised from   0 6   to   0 3    The year on year rate benefited from an easy comparison and will do so a bit longer  as production eased last summer  May 2014 shows a 4 3  annual rate  seasonally adjusted   with manufacturing up 3 6  
The rebound was also reflected in the two regional Fed business surveys  from New York and Philadelphia  Both showed decent breadth of improvement and were above estimates  with New York coming in at 19 28  virtually unchanged from the May reading of 19 01  while Philadelphia reported 17 8 versus the month s prior level of 15 4  My usual caution  the surveys report diffusion results  not volume of depth of activity  The higher the number  the broader is improvement  but the amount of improvement is unknown 
The key number this month was in the Philadelphia six month forecast  which happens to be a very reliable contrarian indicator for short term activity  you can see the chart    Given the seasonal and weather factors  I suspect at least one more month of gain in this number and possibly two  depending on the strength of the May durable goods orders to be released next week  Then activity will undergo a normal cyclical pause  which may come as a shock to the perennial cheerleaders for the ever elusive second half rebound 
Housing starts were a clear disappointment  with the seasonally adjusted number showing a 6 5  month on month decline  What really matters is the comparison with 2013  since that trend will decide housing s contribution to annual GDP in 2014  Through the first five months  starts are up 6 5  compared to the same period in 2013  with single family starts up only 2 5   To give you some context  starts grew at a 19 8  clip in 2013  my own estimate of 7  10  for 2014 now appears to be in jeopardy   and I had been leaning towards the high end 
After mortgage purchases had a dismal week  dropping back to a minus 15  comparison year over year  the Mortgage Banker s Association threw in the towel and  for home sales in 2014 to predict an annual decline of 4 1   Interestingly enough  the investment market for non performing mortgages is apparently  as the reach for yield continues 
The report that might have sparked the most controversy   after all  the Fed behaved exactly as expected   was the latest consumer price report  CPI   The index rose more than expected  by an estimated 0 4  from April to May and leaving it 2 1   1 9  excluding food and energy  which no one really needs  higher than a year ago  Janet Yellen s take on the issue during the press conference was somewhat non committal  characterizing monthly data as  noisy   True enough 
The price increases in food and energy are more supply related  as some difficult weather has led to diminished harvests  and geo political tensions  along with commodity speculation  are largely responsible for elevated oil prices  Housing is definitely getting more expensive  however  The two main problems for the Fed s is that first  its 2  long term target  it uses a different measure than the CPI  wasn t really expected to be hit this year  Not only that  it was supposed to be generated by higher levels of economic growth  not coming in the wake of a negative GDP quarter  The second problem is that there is a veritable host of monetary hawks who strongly disapproved of the recent quantitative easing  one that stands ready to scream and leap at any hint of inflation 
Looking ahead  next week brings a substantial slate of data  beginning with existing home sales on Monday and new home sales on Tuesday  Consumer confidence also comes out on Tuesday  though I consider those surveys to be soft and not especially useful  in addition to being backward looking  The other big reports include May durable goods on Wednesday  released alongside the second revision of first quarter GDP  and personal income and spending on Thursday  A string of housing numbers that are consistent with the weakness in last week s releases  combined with another potential downgrade to the GDP estimate  might rattle the markets in what is often a difficult week for stocks  June post expiration   The income and spending number will surely be looked at in light of the Druckenmiller piece 
A number of Fed banks will also issue reports during the week  beginning with the national activity index from the Chicago Fed on Monday and regional reports from Richmond  Tuesday  and Kansas City  Thursday  ",2014-06-20,Kevin Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-there-a-market-bubble-216880,216880
166215,387731,FDX,What the Big Earnings Surprise From FedEx Means For The U S  Economy,opinion,"FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  is a benchmark stock  and it recently soared  The company delivered a solid earnings beat  and the position advanced six percent  or almost nine points  to a new record high on the news 
Even if you are not interested in investing in a company like FedEx  it s worthwhile following the company s financial results  because it is a very good barometer on the U S  economy among others  What FedEx reports all adds up to more intelligence on what s happening in certain parts of the economy and regional trends as well 
FedEx blew past Wall Street consensus with its fiscal 2014 fourth quarter financial report  The company s revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter grew to  11 8 billion from  11 4 billion comparatively  Earnings were the surprise  growing to  730 million from  679 million  And like so many other corporations  FedEx has been buying back a lot of its own shares  which contributed to strong earnings per share growth of  2 46 from  0 95   2 13 excluding charges  on a diluted  comparative basis 
The company said it bought back 9 9 million shares during its fiscal fourth quarter for a total amount in the fiscal year coming to 36 8 million  The company recently increased its quarterly dividend by some 33   Management reported that it is seeing volume growth in the marketplace and it expects its 2015 fiscal year to be better than the one that just ended  FedEx Express saw three percent growth in average daily volume  while FedEx Ground experienced an eight percent comparative quarterly gain  mainly due to e commerce demand 
The stock had a great day on news of its better than expected financial report  It opened nicely higher  and demand forced the position upward all day  If it holds above its current price  it will have broken out of its consolidation trend since the beginning of the year  which is meaningful 
When the company s Form 10 Q is released  it will be worth reading because it should break down business conditions in the most recent quarter on a regional basis  which is useful to be aware of  FedEx is part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average  which itself is toying with its highs and is a strong indicator for the broader stock market  
United Parcel Service  Inc   NYSE UPS  is about double FedEx s market capitalization  but the company doesn t report until the end of July  What package delivery companies say about their business is material to the stock market and those invested in it  Similar to railroad and trucking companies  their business conditions are a reflection and a good barometer on the current state of the economy 
Over time  FedEx has typically been a better stock market investment than United Parcel Service and its valuation is a little greater  The company s fiscal fourth quarter was just plain good and it surprised the Street 
I think we re going to see positive surprises in the upcoming second quarter reporting season  Some brand name companies have been increasing their guidance lately  A mature package delivery company may not be on most investors  wish list of stocks  but their operations are telling and that s the whole point 
So what s the takeaway from FedEx s earnings  1  The company s numbers are always worth following for market and economic intelligence  and 2  These numbers are confirmation that stocks are a hold  but there s no bandwagon to jump onto yet

166216,387732,FDX,Why We Keep Circling Back To Natural Gas,opinion,"It doesn t matter what s going on in the global markets  Like a lion stalking its prey  our commodities coverage keeps circling back to the Natural Gas sector 
For several reasons 
Consumer demand is set to grow annually  as more homes adopt cheaper sources of energy 
The electricity generation sector is also poised to grow  as government mandates for cleaner air accelerate the shift away from coal fired plants   A natural gas fired plant cuts carbon emissions in half  and it s the cheapest alternative  
Even the transportation sector is seeing double digit increases in natural gas usage  as American companies like FedEx  NYSE FDX  and UPS  NYSE UPS  begin to embrace natural gas for use in their delivery fleets 
However  when we consider natural gas  future growth potential compared to other energy sources  an important part of our long term thesis hinges on demand and consumption by the industrial sector

Just so we re clear  industrial usage doesn t refer to power plants  but to ethylene plants  ammonia plants  polyethylene plants  methanol plants  and metals and manufacturing 
Industrial customers use natural gas to fire up boilers for steam needs  direct heating for melting  baking  or drying commodities like metals  paper  steel glass  and food  Natural gas is also the fuel used for operating combined heating and power generation facilities to run factories  instead of being reliant on the electricity grid 
These are high energy users and will further cement the demand side of the equation   something that s still lacking  in my opinion 
Indeed  natural gas use in the industrial sector is becoming increasingly prevalent 
Between now and 2020  industrial adoption of the resource is projected to increase by at least 20  
The Center for Energy Economics  CEE    part of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin   estimates that daily usage of natural gas will approach 26 billion cubic feet  bcf  per day by 2020  compared to a baseline of 19 8 billion in 2012 
Of course  the fact that natural gas is plentiful   maybe too plentiful as dictated by the lack of price momentum after the recent move higher   is something to consider as an investor 
When it comes to the industrial sector  that plentiful nature is critical   as it means long term price stability and easy access at all times  So supply isn t the issue here  Demand is what needs to be stimulated further 
Unlike crude oil  however  natural gas infrastructure has yet to catch up  as evidenced by the lack of infrastructure in places like North Dakota  which is still flaring a good chunk of gas 
Infrastructure is the final piece of the puzzle that s needed to solidify the future of natural gas  And since consumption will increase significantly when accessibility is improved  infrastructure will ultimately push prices higher  too 
That spells insane opportunity  if you know where to look 
A Trio of Dominant Players
For the most part  investors are still caught up in the day to day movements of share prices based on inventory levels and weather patterns  That s not where your sights should be set 
Instead  focus your attention on dominant producers that will be in the sweet spot moving forward   companies like Devon  NYSE DVN   Encana  NYSE ECA   and Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK  
Knowing full well that natural gas usage is on the upswing   and will continue to be for decades to come   it s in your best interest to accumulate shares of these companies while the market is still ignorant to the longer term trends 
My job is to point this out to you while shares are trading on the cheap 
Chesapeake  for example  is down almost 20  from its recent highs  Too many traders are focused on the cooler summer weather and decreased demand for natural gas  All the while  they re ignoring the prolific and profitable natural gas liquids business the company operates  or its significant oil operations  or its substantial hedging program  which has locked in a lot of gas sales at prices in the  4s to  5s per thousand cubic feet  mcf  going forward 
It s time to buy while the herd is selling  and focus on the long term gains that natural gas will bring to your portfolio 
And  the chase  continues

166229,387745,FDX,The Bernanke Backstop Is Stronger Than The UPS  FedEx Warnings ,opinion,This morning  the major stock indexes are holding up very well despite a major warning from United Parcel Service  UPS   Earlier today  the giant transport company cited slowing U S  industrial demand and overcapacity in the global air freight market for cutting its full year earnings guidance  A couple of months ago leading competitor FedEx Corp  FDX  said the same thing  Today  UPS shares are trading lower by 5 30 percent to  86 57 Do investors care about what the leading transportation stocks are saying  After all  the iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average  IYT  is trading near all time highs  Today  the IYT is trading lower by just 0 13 cents to  115 19 a share  so the drop in UPS stock is really not having much of an effect on the transport sector It is perfectly clear what is keeping the stock markets held together  it is the central bank easy money policies  As long as the liquidity is pumped into the markets  the money is keeping asset prices inflated  Earlier in the week  the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke vowed to keep interest rates low for considerable amount of time  Stock futures soared after the Bernanke comments  proving that the stock market is trading on the back of easy money  Basically  as long as the Federal Reserve keeps its current  85 billion a month mortgage backed security and U S  Treasury purchases everything is fine How long can the central bank continue to buy these assets from the large banks  Apparently  they can do it infinitely  or until the bond market tells them that they can t  The Federal Reserve says there is no inflation and openly fears deflation  In fact  Ben Bernanke said that inflation is good as long as it does not get out of control  Currently  the central banks balance sheet is around  4 trillion  but who s counting  The stock market keeps inflating along with the central bank s balance sheet  Is this going to be the mother of all bubbles  or is this going to be a gentle unwinding of the balance sheet  My only question that should be asked  why did we have a recession or a depression in the past  If adding liquidity can solve every economic problem  we should all hail Ben Bernanke as the smartest man to ever live  History will ultimately tell us how he will be remembered ,2013-07-12,Nicholas Santiago,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-bernanke-backstop-is-stronger-than-the-ups,-fedex-warnings-175220",175220
166230,387746,FDX,Just How Stupid Do Public Companies Think Investors Are ,opinion,"According to FactSet  between January 1 and mid March of this year  195 of the S P 500 companies have used the word  weather  in some manner in their conference calls  This is 81  higher than the same period a year ago  when 108 of the S P 500 companies used the term  weather  in their conference calls   Source  FactSet  March 14  2014  
Public companies in key stock indices are preparing investors for poor first quarter earnings by saying poor  extra cold  weather conditions this year are putting a damper on sales 
Take FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  as an example of the many companies on key stock indices blaming the weather for dismal corporate earnings  While presenting its most recent quarterly corporate earnings for the three months ended February 28  the CEO of the company said 

 While severe winter weather often affects our  fiscal  third quarter results  the impact from multiple severe storms and frigid temperatures was significantly more pronounced this year and we are reducing our full year earnings per share guidance as a result of the weather impact    Source   FedEx Corp  Reports Third Quarter Results   FedEx Corporation  March 19  2014  

How can you lay blame on one quarter s  bad weather  for the entire year s earnings performance  The way I look at it  the  weather  is just a  blame factor  for companies in key stock indices that are facing earnings growth issues 
Stock analysts have really been busy lowering their corporate earnings expectations for companies in key stock indices  In the first quarter of this year  on average  analysts expect the corporate earnings of the S P 500 companies to increase by only 0 3   At the end of last year  this number was 4 4    Source  FactSet  March 14  2014  
And it doesn t end here 
Corporate insiders have turned extremely bearish on key stock indices  They are selling a significant amount of stocks in the companies they work for  Current bearishness among corporate insiders exceeds 2007 s levels 
Last year s trick of buying back stocks to make per share earnings look better for companies in key stock indices helped mask the problem of falling corporate earnings growth  This year  aside from the  weather  thing  public companies in key stock indices have failed to come up with another financial engineering move that will boost per share profits 
With all this said  I am very careful  Yes  I know I ve been saying for some time now that the party for key stock indices that started in the spring of 2009 is coming to an end  And I ll be the first to admit the length of the  rebound rally  from 2009 s lows has been longer than I ever expected 
But at this point  all the historically proven stock market indicators I follow are flashing red  Yesterday  we even had new Fed Chief Janet Yellen say interest rates would rise in 2015 and the stock market rallied 
A stock market that rises for no good reason is a risky stock market

founded Sprott Securities  now called Cormark Securities Inc    which today is one of Canada s largest independently owned securities firms  After establishing Sprott Asset Management Inc  in December

Fund L P   Sprott Hedge Fund L P  II  Sprott Bull Bear RSP Fund  Sprott Offshore Funds  Sprott Canadian Equity Fund  Sprott Energy Fund and Sprott Managed Accounts  In December 2007  Eric was named Fund Manager of the Year by Investment Executive  a widely circulated publication for Canadian financial advisors Eric s predictions on the state of the North American financial markets have been captured throughout the last several years in an investment strategy article that he authors titled  Markets At A Glance  I had the pleasure of recently speaking with Eric Sprott over the phone  The following is the transcript of this interview Patrick MontesDeOca  Hallo Eric  and thank you once again for sharing your insight here in this most opportune time  Getting right into the interview  first of all  can I have your opinion on a report or a summary that you recently published on your website Sprott Asset Management called Markets At A Glance  In this report you cover in detail the eurozone crisis currently basically happening in the eurozone Cyprus  and all the other peripheral countries  Can you give us your opinion and insight on that Eric Sprott  Sure  Well  Patrick great to talk to you again first of all and again congratulations for keeping people informed on events that are transpiring that perhaps aren t in the mainstream media but are important for people to follow very closely  The Markets At A Glance I can probably explain it in 2 words  And that is the title of the article and that is  Caveat Depositor  Obviously  when Mr Diesel Boom suggested that there was no template he was not being very forthright because there is a template and in fact  I think in his first interview he basically said the same thing four times because when the banks have risks those banks risks have to be shared with the various people who have liabilities of the firm which is of course the depositors as one  and we saw that of course play out in Cyprus and it was very unfair what happened and the more I think about it and I don t think many people have commented on this but what I find most interesting is that the depositors take the first hit in other words when the ECB says they are going to put in  10 billion which we are not even sure what they are going to put it in  they get a piece of paper in return  they say they have a loan to somebody and therefore it could possibly be repaid The depositor walks away with a loss  day one  he doesn t get a piece of paper and in fact I think I even heard that the ECB is exempting any deposits they might have any liabilities that they already had with Cyprus  as exempt from the haircut so that is just a travesty of how things should work ok  the depositor taking the first hit  In fact the bigger they hit the depositor the more likely the ECB is to collect their  10 billion  because of the hierarchy on the balance sheet right  But essentially what we said is because we ve seen what happens in other countries in so for example New Zealand  the banking authority just passed the same sort of thing  ok  that if there is a systemically important bank  here is what is going to happen  the same as happened in Cyprus The government in Canada recently introduced legislation to do the same thing   The US and the UK have done the same thing  so obviously there has been a decision made by the governments who realize that their financial systems are at risk  their banking systems I should probably say when their banking systems are at risk  how are we going to deal with this problem  Because the problems are bigger than the countries  because the banks are so much bigger than the countries and that is obviously their solution PM  You know one of the things that I find disturbing is the complacency of investors realizing that the central bank leader s intentions to levy  basically to steal deposits to save the banks  they are not really understanding what the consequences are  Could Cyprus possibly be the Black Swan in the Eurozone banking system or will it disappear from the headlines ES  Sure  Well Patrick  for the first part of the question  you know  that people are being benign about it  I m not so sure in fact that is the case  We judge that by what s happening in the precious metals market and the stock market you know  and if it s gee  The stock market is going up and the precious metals market is going down and therefore everyone is complacent about it  I don t think that is the case whatsoever in the real world As you know the stock market is almost a function of central bank printing of money  that is essentially what is happening  ok  And I have written many times that I think the western central banks continue to supply physical gold to the gold market to suppress the price and I fully believe it and I fully documented it  And the other thing I would say is we have noticed that there has been a pick up in buying of precious metals since the Cyprus thing happened There is no doubt that it is happening whether you want to look at the US Mint statistics  We have a company called Sprott Money and we see more buying of gold and silver happening there   You can see that people  people aren t stupid  particularly when you realize that the people at risk are the people with over 100 000 euros in the bank  these are not stupid people  these are people that got that kind of wealth because they anticipated things right  And I think that things are going on and I think it is a black swan   and you know that thing I am watching the most is  ok I am thinking is what s the next bank  Ok  Because there are weak banks out there and we know who they are  Do we not think there will be a bank run going on in some of those banks right now PM  Well just the peripheral countries should be affected by this economically so its a domino reaction it has to be ES  And there s weak banks in those countries  we all know who they are  so if you are sitting there with money in a weak bank do you think people are leaving their money there  I mean all they have to do is change banks  Like move it to at least a stronger bank PM  Well I think that is the danger is third party risk at the highest level that you have ever seen ES  Right  you know the money has got to be moving and of course here is the problem  banks can t fund the deposit withdrawal because they don t have that much in current assets  you know  cash ready assets so when the money starts leaving  we have an example we hadBanco di Montepaschi said well we ve had a few billion dollars  undefined by the way  leave the bank  well  you know you have to sell something in order to fund these deposit withdrawals which means you have to sell an asset and lots of cases banks don t have assets that are readily sellable  or the first ones to go they sell and then of course if gets tougherI mean you can t just liquidate a mortgage portfolio particularly when everyone else is trying to liquidate it  I would imagine that there are bank runs going on right now in some of these lower quality banks which you are not going to hear about but you know it has to be happening PM  What does this mean for the US fragile economy and the stock market moving forward from here ES  Sure  Well  I have always been of the view that there is no recovery  That we are always told this is great recovery  as we were told last year you know 2012 this is going to be a great year  we finally get to the end of the year and GDP is up  1  so there was no recovery going on even as it was much touted earlier on in the year  And as I look at 2013 I ve argued there is even more reason for there to be no recovery this year  We have had people who have taken a tax increase  we have had a sequester that is going to negatively affect people and everyone is merrily looking at the stock market saying oh well everything must be fine  but recent data is not very good  I mean we ve have the PMI s go down  purchasers manufactured index go down  we ve had jobless claims are going back up  we had announced job cuts went up 30  in March in the US this year versus last year  We had announced job hirings that went down by 90  this year in March versus last year  So my view is that it is not very robust at all  we ve had lots of earnings warnings from Caterpillar  CAT  and Fedex  FDX   Oracle  ORCL  and  restaurant chain sales went down 5 6  in February which is totally in line with what would be happening to disposable income of workers in this case because of the increase in tax  So I don t think there is recovery  I think the market goes up on the fumes generated by the Fed but sooner or later we are going to look at things in the light of day  what s really happening here and I am very much looking forward to seeing the first quarter both revenues and earnings and see if this huge rally that we ve had of the 209 low is substantiated PM  You know Eric  we have covered the eurozone greatly in our previous interviews and we talked about the possibility of bank runs and price controls   this is the very thing that we are witnessing right now  Are we moving closer to a total collapse of the monetary system as we know it or do you think there is hope that things will get fixed ES  Well of course  I think that we are getting closer to a total monetary collapse if I took myself back 10 years  which we wrote about at the time  the problem is that the banks are too levered  OK  they are all levered twenty and thirty to one  well if you are levered thirty to one you could take a 3  hit on your assets and you are have no capital   well what the hell is a 3  hit  I mean if you are in Greek bonds or Cypriot bonds  you know what the percentages are  they are just unbelievably greater than that  And that is the problem  the financial system got too leveraged  And it got too leveraged  and if you want to go back and review it  because the banks thought they could generate this 15  return on equity every year and the banks as a group became such an important part of the economy  for example I think it was at one point it was nearly 25  30  of the stock market  well when you are 25  30  of the stock market if you grow at 15  a year for about 15 years you are 100  of the stock market  it is impossible  how can you do that  But they believed it  and the only way they could grow that way is they had to keep levering so they just levered and levered in order to keep up this facade of being this wonderful business so that could forever produce a 15  ROI well world GDP grew at 2 or 3  so we know it couldn t continue to happen PM  What are the alternatives to deleveraging or what is the process ES  Well there are only 2 ways to deal with  either you inflate the debt away thru hyperinflation which is one way of doing it  of course the other way is what you call a dead jubilee or where you all just agree hey we can t pay off these debts let s just write them all off  which of course would be disastrous for those who think they have some asset which is worth something in their portfolio and find out that they weren t going to get repaid PM  Well isn t that s what is happening right now in Cyprus ES  That s exactly what s happening with Cyprus  And already happened in Greece  I mean that was a 100 billion dollar haircut there right  And it ll happen in other countries  You know its funny that almost every month these European countries keep downgrading their GDP growth and upgrading what the size of their debt or deficit is going to be versus GDP every month it goes higher  I have a theory that weakness begets weakness and there was when JP Morgan announced they were going to lay off 19 000 people  it not just the 19 000 people that are affected it is where the 19 000 people spend their money  they are also affected  There are only 2 ways to change a trend of weakness  fiscal policy and monetary policy  and its got to be sort of an exogenous event  We run a gamut on fiscal policy  nobody has got any room for fiscal policy changes here we even have austerity in the USA with sequestration right  Everything is austerity policies in Europe so we don t have a fiscal policy that can change things so now you go to monetary policy  we have zero interest rate and we are printing money  I mean is there anything left in the tank here  I don t think there is anything left in the tank PM  There is some discussion going around basically using gold as a collateral to replace austerity in the eurozone  Italy and some other countries  how much of a real possibility is that  that they could use their gold reserves ES  OK  In other words sell the reserves to spend more money PM  Not sell it  but basically collateralizing it lets say five to one in order to possibly to generate some liquidity and reduce the interest rate payments on the bonds ES  I don t know who would want to be the guy backing that quite frankly  maybe the ECB would its just another form of printing money I mean they could may as well print the money rightPM  Well that s essentially the same thingES  Have another LTRO right  guys whatever amount of money you want just take it so but all of these are essentially insane financial policies I mean  it comes down to pure insanity and we keep thinking and looking at the same things they do and they don t work and we keep thinking the next ones going to work QE1 didn t work  QE2 didn t work it doesn t look lik3 QE3 is going to work  I don t know why people are always hopeful something is going to change the economy just doesn t have any spunk to it the only things that are getting better are auto sales and home sales which are 100 percent reliant on ridiculous amount of credits  Particularly in autos  I was reading in an article where sub prime lending in autos has gone crazy  And so we keep having these people who can t afford a car that get a car  Of course the interest rate is 25  then they put it in some package where they sell it off as a lump sum its almost as is like subprime in housing all over againPM  Moving into the gold and silver market  Eric  what s going on with the gold market  Have you ever seen such a disparity between the paper and the physically market in your career ES  Well it gets a little more bizarre all the time and I ll just use 1 proximate  look at the US mint sales  they re up 40  in gold and 40  in silver  that s the statement about what people think of the system  and here we have the price of gold going down which is unfortunately is determined in the paper market and so there s no decrease in demand for gold and silver here but I think there are so many reasons the western centrals banks to want the price of gold to be down  because it would be the towel on the responsibility of their financial policies and they know it We re all looking in inflation to break out with all the printing of money  well  where are you going to look for inflation first  You think it would be manifested first in gold and silver because that would be the first physical thing that people would buy because it is so easy to store and it has a longer history  I mean we re not all going to go out and buy wheat and soybeans and stuff like that  Natural thing to do is it to go and buy gold and silver and I see by the US Mint statistics that that s what people are doing  they are buying it PM  Just to the common listener here to understand why is the price of metals going down if there is physical demand like you are describing ES  Well because the Comex market which is a paper market determines the price  So for example  I believe that if I single handedly wanted to go into the wheat market today  and sell a bunch of wheat contracts  I could probably to get the price down 5 percent today in the paper market  God forbid they ask me to deliver the wheat because I wouldn t have it  But that s what is going on  people are shorting the paper market and driving the price down  I think its the big banks  and were short or scaring the hedge fund into thinking gold and silver are going to go down they all start shorting it  and of course all the while the big bankers have been short the whole time and covering their shorts and now we ve got all the hedge funds going to be short PM  The commitment of traders report showed that the large specs or managed money increased their short position to a massive 22 382 thousand contracts from about I think 2900 as of February 5th  that is huge ES  That s what s happening  you get everyone believing its going down and you get these reports of this  and others who has never been right on gold in my mind suggesting that gold price is dead or the markets over and everyone  herd like  goes into shorting the paper  well  they re going to get a rude awakening when we find out that China still a buyer and Russia is a buyer and Turkey is a buyer and all these countries that have been buying gold  they re not going to back away from the gold market  I mean  its like it s on sale here  The physical guys will win the day here PM  What other metals do you like beside gold and silver ES  Well  Patrick  we just started a platinum and palladium trust the same as our silver and gold trust and we look at the supply demand for platinum and palladium its just outstandingly positive We even had Russia and South Africa talking about having their cartels in the metals and the price didn t do anything they want get together and do something  they produce 80 percent of the world s platinum and palladium so that will have a big impact  But again we had all these people coming in short those two markets too  where there was no activity in the futures market all of a sudden there s these huge short positions in platinum and palladium  and I think they went in there because the shortage of platinum and palladium and the outlook is so positive but they didn t want them to go because it might lean into silver and gold  people see platinum might go through 2000 people are going to buy gold too  So they try to control these things and they control it because they know any central banker in his right mind must know that those policies are insane and irresponsible  they know it  And yet we ve got to keep everyone in the game and keep them calm and keep the market going up keep gold a little subdued and everything looks normal  Cyprus is a one off event  oh yeah  Sure it is  It ll be a one off event until we get the next eventPM  What do you think of the mining sector Eric  They ve demolished that completely almost to the point of extinction  but that do you make of it ES  Well  you know there s some tremendous opportunities in mining   I m looking now at some companies that could pay very  very significant dividends  I m talking of dividends of 20  per share and one of the things we have got to convince some of these managements is  look  is that if you pay the dividend and don t start the new project your shares will react as long if you got a long life line just pay the dividend  your share price will probably double and it ll still be yielding 10  you ll be able to raise all the money you want for your future capex program   But  whatever you do  don t commit to another project  because then the investors will say I won t see that money for a while and now I gotta worry about the next mine and is it going to be capex is the mine going to work  and you put all this risk on the table that s not necessary  because mining companies are quite profitable and they have a lot of free cash flow so they could easily pay it out  I m working on trying to get some of these companies to go that route  and I suspect we re gonna be successful PM  Eric  can you leave our audience with your wisdom and insight on how to deal with these unfolding and accelerating crisis here ES  Sure  Well I think the safest thing I can say  is paper assets are a very dangerous to own  I wouldn t be caught dead with a Japanese bond or a US bond or a UK bond or an ECB bond  First of all  you get paid nothing  Much like a bank deposit was  right  you get paid nothing  Now you find out your risk  as it is Cyprus was 60   my god you get paid nothing and taking on all that risk  Do you ask as I ve written on this many times before is effectively bankrupt their gap deficit was 6 6 trillion last January  except accounting principles deficit was 6 6 trillion as was announced by the department of the treasury  never made it to any newspaper by the way  but that is what they announced and this year it will be 7  8 trillion  this is all in a  16 trillion economy  There is no way they are going to meet their entitlement so you just give yourself a little forward time here  it might happen in as little as 1 or 2 or 3 years here  I mean this whole paper thing could just implode in front of us  so I think get out of paper get into real PM  For the benefit of our audience Eric   how can they get in touch with you  and learn more about your product ES  Well  as you know Patrick   we have these gold and silver trust and now the platinum and palladium trust listed on the NYSE and in Toronto here  People who want to keep up to date on the things we write if they just send a note to sprott com we ll put them on our mailing list and they can see the various array of hedge funds and other funds we run here I think that if one thing we bring to the table is we bring a view that isn t an accepted view  its always a little off the scale  it has been important to be off the scale in these last few years because here because we ve gone through some pretty weird times that most people would never forecast  so if they go to sprott com they ll know everything they need to know PM  Once again Eric  thank you for your time and you insight and wisdom in this auspicious time and until next time my friend  you take care ES  OK

166295,387811,FDX,What 2013 Means For You  Your Portfolio And The Economy At Large,opinion,Now that Obama has been re elected  the BLS and other Government entities have begun to revise all of the positive data from before the November election downward  New jobless claims are back over 400 000  The amazing new home sales of 389 00 from October has been revised back down to 369 000  And a new record has been set for food stamp usage Things are only going to get worse for the following reasons 1  Increased taxes2  Increased regulationBoth of these items will result in people parking their cash rather than investing in the economy  Case in point  last week  132 BILLION was suddenly parked in bank savings accounts  That s  132 billion  nearly 1  of US GDP  leaving the US economy and plunking into savings accountsTo put this number into perspective  this is more than the amount of money that fled to the safety of savings accounts when LEHMAN FAILED In simple terms capital is going into hibernation  Without the investment of capital  the US economy will continue to weaken  Between this  the fiscal cliff  the earnings disaster for corporations and more  the market is set for a truly horrendous 2013 Economic bell weathers such as Caterpillar  CAT   green   FedEX  FDX   red  and McDonald s  MCD   purple  are already discounting this in a big way However  we re not quite there yet  Unless things come unhinged sooner due to some event in Europe  it will probably be the end of December  when the fiscal cliff will be hitting  before things really get messy in the markets I want to alert you to all of this in advance because I believe 2013 will be the year in which the BIG Collapse happens  As I ve explained in earlier articles  it almost hit last summer  It was only through the ECB and Fed promising to buy everything that the system held together  But now even the Fed has stated outright that it cannot contain the impact of the fiscal cliff Please prepare well in advance  What s coming next year will be worse than 2008  There is literally nothing positive I have to say about what I see  At the very least  we ll face an economic slowdown on par with that of 2008 accompanied by a market crash  And this will happen at a time in which Central Banks will be totally out of ammo We get additional signs that those in charge are out of ideas in Europe  There the latest proposal for Greece is a debt buyback plan through which Greece would use  10 billion to buy some  30 billion worth of debt  Greece doesn t have  10 billion lying around so it would likely tap a bailout fund  the EFSF or ESM  to do this  This means Greece would need  you guessed it  another bailout in order to buy its own debt It would also need to convince Greek bondholders to sell their stakes  which was a huge issue during the Second Greek bailout earlier this year So once again  we have yet another non solution  the goal of this plan is to help Greece get its Debt to GDP to 120  by 2020  which will require a great deal of arm twisting and political machinations to accomplish almost nothing The same idiocy is playing out in Spain  The latest plan there is for the country to cut the balance sheets of three nationalized banks by 50  sometime in the next five years  How will they do this  By dumping their toxic property assets into a  bad bank  The idea here is that somehow someone will want to buy this stuff  Spain already had to postpone the launch of the bad bank by a month because no one wanted to participate in it  despite the mainstream media claiming that the idea was popular which is untrue  So  here we have Spain proposing that it can somehow unload a ton of garbage debts onto  someone  even though there is no  someone  to buy them  And the whole point of this exercise is to meet conditions so that Spain would qualify for another  40 billion in aid  40 billion in aid On an annualized basis  Spain has experienced portfolio and investment outflows of more than  700 billion  And the latest plan to address this situation  as well as the implosion of the Spanish banking system  is to dump toxic bank assets into a bad bank to free up  40 billion in aid Oh  and Spain needs to issue over  200 billion in debt next year Again  a non solution which doesn t fix anything As I mentioned before  without a doubt 2013 will be a disastrous year for the global economy and for the financial markets  Things could get ugly before then due to any number of issues that are boiling just beneath the surface  but barring any sudden developments  most of the key players will try to hold things together into year end At that point  there s really not anything to look forward to  compared to this year when many pinned their hopes on the US elections or on more intervention from the Central banks   And that s when things will get really ugly ,2012-12-17,Phoenix Capital

166323,387839,FDX,No Big Move In FedEx Share Price Expected,opinion,Here we revise our tentative model for the evolution of FedEx  FDX  stock price  In March 2012  we suggested that this share is slightly overvalued and a negative correction was possible  Actually  the price has been hovering around  90  The updated model  which includes monthly closing price for October  foresees no big change in 2012  The positive residual through Q2 and Q3 was stable but fell to zero due to the change in defining variables  not the price  In any case  the predicted correction of  5 was within the model uncertainty of  6 4  which is the standard model error from July 2003  FDX is a company from Services sector of the S P 500 index which     We decompose a FDX share price into a weighted sum of two consumer price indices  one has to be related to the overall FDX activity and one index is independent on FDX services   that all goods and services produced  provided  by FDX should define the share price evolution relative to other companies  In other words  the FDX relative pricing power is defined by the pricing power of its G S  Since other companies are also driven by prices for their goods and services  which compete with FDX  one need two defining sets of G S to estimate the relative pricing power  It is not excluded that the studied share price can be accurately defined by two CPIs  There are some measurement errors in all CPIs which are directly mapped into the model errors  Since we model the monthly closing prices  CPIs are reported at a monthly rate  the intermonth variations  high low prices  can be treated as natural uncertainty of the monthly closing prices  Therefore our pricing model has two sources of uncertainty  As in the tentative model  the best CPIs are selected from a set of 92 CPIs with estimates available from 2000  one may extend this set   The best fit  in the LSQ sense  consumer price indices are that of food and beverages  F   CUUS0000SAF  and the index of communication  CO   CUUR0000SAE2   The latter index is directly related to FedEx and the former one seems to be mainly independent and evolving according to own forces  The defining time lags are as follows  the food index leads the share price by 3 months and the CO index leads by 5 months  The tentative and updated models are as follows    FDX t     4 87F t 3    5 09CO t 5    26 50 t 1990    1039 05  February 2012 FDX t     4 70F t 3    5 52CO t 5    25 78 t 2000    1314 97  October 2012 where FDX t  is the FDX share price in U S  dollars  t is calendar time  Figure 1 displays the evolution of both defining indices since 2002  Figure 2 depicts the high and low monthly prices for a share together with the predicted and measured monthly closing prices  adjusted for dividends and splits   The predicted prices are mainly within the bounds of the share price uncertainty and lead by 3 months  Since the measured price volatility is much higher than the predicted one there are some large deviations from the predicted level  In any case  such fluctuations have always ended on the predicted curve  One can use this observation for a qualitative forecast of the future price movements  It should be noted the tentative model is partly validated by new data  The model residual error is shown in Figure 3 with the standard deviation between July 2003 and October 2012 of  6 43 ,2012-11-15,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/no-big-move-in-fedex-share-price-expected-143659,143659

166338,387854,FDX,FedEx Corp  Modestly Undervalued Dividend Growth Stock,opinion,This once consistent growth stock has a very cyclical earnings history after the recession of 2008  However  since fiscal 2009 earnings have begun growing again and stock price has recovered off of its lows  Nevertheless  its current PE ratio of 13 5 indicates that the company is modestly undervalued  The dividend growth investor might want to do their own due diligence into this company further for possible addition to their portfolio   FedEx Corp   NYSE  FDX  provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation  e commerce and business services  With annual revenues of  43 billion  the company offers integrated business applications through operating companies competing

Correlated Fundamentals at a Glance A quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  on FedEx Corp shows a slight picture of undervaluation based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 8 9  and a current PE of 13 5  Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 13   and when you look at the forecasting graph below  the stock appears undervalued   it s inside of the value corridor of the five orange lines   based on future growth   FedEx Corp  Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal PE Since 1998 Performance Table FedEx CorpThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 7 6  capital appreciation  green circle   long term shareholders of FedEx Corp  assuming an initial investment of  1 000  would have received an additional  119 87 in dividends  blue highlighting  that increased their total return from 7 6  to 7 9  per annum versus 3 8   red circle  in the S P 500 The following graph plots the historical PE ratio  the dark blue line  in conjunction with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for FedEx Corp is  66 which is historically normal  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that

EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in FedEx Corp to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds  illustrates that FedEx Corp s expected earnings would be 7 4  purple circle  times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper

166348,387864,FDX,Markets Still Looking For Direction,opinion,The leadership derived from the hopes of QE have eased  and now the markets look for direction  Equity indexes have flattened somewhat after around a 4  jump in September  but market internals are beginning to wane  Whether you look at indicators or price relativity  a new catalyst is needed for further advance  A bottom is in place for a market decline due to easing  but unless you are selling time  assets are merely consolidating  The first indicator of interest is China  China has made an effort in September to join equity strength  but has failed to sustain it  This past week was abhorrent for Chinese markets  The culmination of weak manufacturing data  disputes with Japan  and political uncertainty have made the case for money to be pulled from equity  The chart below shows the Shanghai Index  FXI  relative to world equity  VT   With the importance of China to the world economy  there is only so long SSEC can be a laggard and not have repercussions on world marketsA lot has been spoken about recently with regards to traditional Dow Theory  Transports are said to lead Industrials in prosperous times due to shipment of product  The chart below is a recent back test of this theory and its implications  Instead of Transports as a whole  Fed Ex  FDX  is used  They have been in the headlines recently forecasting Q3 projections  and are sufficient to represent Transports  The indicator Fed EX over Dow Industrials is compared to the S P 500 performance  SPY   The 5 year back test looks at correlations and price movements  The last time this indicator negatively correlated with equity indexes was August 2011 when there was a large price depreciation  This does not seem to be the case this time with a Bernanke Put in place  but lack of appreciation could lie ahead  A divergence is taking shape  and this looks negative as a whole for risk assets The last indicator is fairly obscure in nature  but correlates well with markets  The indicator is the number of S P 500 companies over their 50 day MA s over long term Treasuries  TLT   This breadth indicator must show strength relative to equity and bonds to advance  thus provides a good look at equity strength  Currently  this indicator sits at resistance  with waning support  A pullback in the indicator is bearish for risk  but support looks to reside just below  Their looks to be room for a broad pullback without adversely affecting the primary trends What can be seen is that market traditions are diverging and decoupling in the unorthodox environment in which financial markets reside  Leadership of some form is needed in coming weeks to further boost risk  The lack of such a catalyst will leave assets range bound between government demand and investor supply ,2012-09-24,Andrew Sachais,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-still-looking-for-direction-137471,137471
166349,387865,FDX,Market Sell Off Pushes Toward Support Levels,opinion,Over the past three weeks I have been reiterating that the markets were due for a correction  The run up in the markets from the May lows  in anticipation of the announcement of QE3 by the Fed in September  took the markets from oversold to extremely overbought conditions  However  as shown in the following chart  with all of our market  buy  signals in place we have moved from a defensive posture of selling rallies to buying dips  As a consequence of QE3  and as the markets move into the seasonally strong time of the year  it is likely that declines will be shallow  The one thing to note is that the markets are reaching the same levels of long term overbought conditions that we last saw at the peak of the market in 2008  While the media continues with its daily diatribe of establishing price targets for the broad indexes that push the boundaries of logic   the reality is that the advance over the last three years is pushing the limits of historical price movements  Could this time be different  Sure   it just never has been in the past  However  the reality is that the markets are currently being driven by Central Bank intervention and prices have become detached from fundamental and economic realities  This is a much different environment than we saw during the previous two QE programs  This is specifically why I have been discussing the risk   reward analysis of the markets to wit   As investors  like good gamblers  we need to have an estimation of what we can  win  if everything goes right versus what we can  lose  if something goes wrong   Understanding the trade off between what you can gain versus lose is critical to evaluating how much capital you expose to risk  Most investors have no concept of risk management but this analysis is crticial to long term investment success  Two weeks ago  as the markets were pushing new annual highs  I stated then that the maximum upside for the markets was likely the 2007 2008 market peak of 1560  The markets closed that Friday at 1465  Using that 1465 level I went through the risk reward analysis as follows   The maximum return  or reward  would be  1560   1465  1   6 48  In order to calculate our risk reward ratio we need to identify support areas to which the market could  dip  to in the days ahead  These  dips  will provide a better entry level for increasing risk based exposure  The addition of Fed stimulus will limit market declines unless some other exogenous event occurs  The chart below defines these current pullback levels   Note  I have updated the chart to reflect current price levels  With the markets already more than 2 standard deviations overbought it is likely that we could see a pullback as soon as next week  Be a little patient and do not chase the market  It is dangerous at these levels  Risk To Level 1  1420   1465   1    3 07   Risk To Level 2  1405   1465   1    4 09   Risk To Level 3  1390   1465   1    5 12   Risk To Level 4  1370   1465   1    6 48   The current correction is now pushing low enough to begin testing these support levels providing an opportunity to add to current equity exposure with better potential return metrics as shown below  using the previous support targets from above   Reward From Level 1 To Target  1560   1420   1   9 85  Reward From Level 2 To Target  1560   1405   1   11 03  Reward From Level 3 To Target  1560   1390   1   12 23  Reward From Level 4 To Target  1560   1370   1   13 87  At the current time  as long as all things remain status quo  I am not expecting to see the lower levels of support tested  The current support level has now risen from 1420 to 1425  and it is important that this level hold in the coming days  otherwise we will begin to test lower levels  Don t Dismiss The Risks We have been warning about the potential dangers of a resurgence of the eurozone crisis  a sharper downturn in earnings and slower economic growth   all of which could throw a wrench in the currently bullish bias  In just the past few days alone have seen the embers of the eurocrisis once again being fanned as riots over austerity in Greece and Spain rise while Germany puts the brakes on the ESM and the potential ECB bond bailout program  Domestically  Caterpillar  CAT   FedEx  FDX   UPS  UPS  and Norfolk Southern  NSC  have all warned about a weaker economy ahead as the recession in Europe  and slowdown in China  which I have warned about  has finally begun to impact the domestic economy  The important point here is that  complacency  is currently the biggest risk in investment portfolios  The general consensus is that because the Fed has implemented QE3 that the markets cannot go down  While that has been true in the past   that history is extremely limited and the market metrics when QE was launched in 2009  versus 2012  are entirely juxtaposed  While I do expect that the current QE program may well limit downside risk at the moment   markets have a nasty habit of doing what you do not expect when you least expect it  This is no time be a passive investor  Therefore  assuming that the current correction holds expected support levels  I have updated the guidelines for increasing equity exposure in portfolios   1  Rebalance bond portfolios to target levels to capture current gains  Assuming a 60 40 allocation model   bonds should be rebalanced to 35  of the total portfolio with cash making up the remaining 5   If we begin to see the effects of the Fed s bond buying program it should push interest rates higher as money is pulled from bonds to chase equities  2  Review current holdingsSell positions that are severely lagging the market Trim winning positions back to target allocation weights Review all other positions to make sure they contain no underlying risks that have been overlooked 3  Identify new equity positionsto be added to portfolio during corrective market actions  Favored sectors for a QE 3 environment are EnergyIndustrialsFinanceTechnologyMaterials4  On market pullbacks  as identified above  execute purchases of identified targets as follows 1420   buy 25  of position  If market turns back up add balance of position 1405   buy additional 25  of position  If market turns up add remaining balance of position 1390   buy additional 25  of position  If market turns up add remaining balance of position 1370   buy final 25  of position  If market turns up add remaining balance of position This is a scale in buying program designed to average into positions during a correction phase  Currently  the risk of the market reversal turning into a full blown rout is somewhat limited  However  there are enough risks prevalent that such a rout is not entirely out of realm of possibility  Therefore  while increasing equity exposure in anticipation a stronger seasonal period ahead  if the markets break critical support levels  and reverses the bullish trend  then defensive actions will be required to reduce overall portfolio risk  This is the risk that exists and investors must be aware and prepared for such an event  The 10 Best Days   Worst Days Understanding risk management is the key to the surviving the long term investment game  There are plenty of stories out there about what happens in you miss the 10 best trading days of the year  What you rarely see are stories about the increased returns you get by missing the 10 worst days  However  this is what it looks   Being invested for the 10 best days accounts for 50  of the buy and hold performance  roughly 0 2  of the days from 1993 to August 2010   However  the problem of chasing the  10 Best Days  is that you are most likely going to capture the bulk of the downside  Here is an example  In a classic  Buy   Hold  portfolio  assuming a  100 000 investment into the S P 500 Index  the net value at the end of the holding period is  324 330 15  If you happen to be out of the market during those  10 Best Days  of each year then the ending net value would fall by more than 50  to just  156 354 12  For the always bullish media  and mutual funds trying to sell you their wares  this is where the analysis stops  However  that isn t the whole story  What is critically more important than trying to capture all of the  upside  of the market is avoiding the losses to investment capital during the declines  By simply managing to miss the  10 Worst Days  of each year an investor would see the portfolio more than double the  Buy   Hold performance by growing to  692 693 90  The reality is that no one can consistently capture the 10 best days and miss the 10 worst  However  by applying risk management tools to a portfolio an investor  while likely missing some the best days  will avoid the bulk of the worst  It is the compounded effect over time of risk managed returns that will lead to long term investment success  30 Years To Garner 10 Investment Guidelines During the last 30 years of managing  investing  and watching capital work  as well as watching it evaporate more often than I care to remember  I have garned 10 guidelines that keep me out of trouble more often than not  Investing is not a competition  There are no prizes for winning but there are severe penalties for losing Emotions have no place in investing  You are generally better off doing the opposite of what you  feel  you should be doing The ONLY investments that you can  buy and hold  are those that provide an income stream with a return of principal function Market valuations  except at extremes  are very poor market timing devices Fundamentals and Economics drive long term investment decisions    Greed and Fear  drive short term trading  Knowing what type of investor you are determines the basis of your strategy  Market timing  is impossible   managing exposure to risk is both logical and possible Investing is about discipline and patience  Lacking either one can be destructive to your investment goals There is no value in daily media commentary   turn off the television and save yourself the mental capital Investing is no different than gambling   both are  guesses  about future outcomes based on probabilities  The winner is the one who knows when to  fold  and when to go  all in  No investment strategy works all the time  The trick is knowing the difference between a bad investment strategy and one that is temporarily out of favor As an investment manager I am neither bullish nor bearish  I simply view the world through the lens of statistics and probabilities  My job is to manage the inherent risk to investment capital  If I protect the investment capital in the short term   the long term capital appreciation will take of itself  As Kenny Rogers once wrote   Now Ev ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin    Is knowin  what to throw away and knowing what to keep  ,2012-09-27,Lance

166357,387873,FDX,Trade Deficit  Recession Risks Increase,opinion,I recently penned an article entitled  3 Major Risks To The 4th Quarter  wherein we discussed the impact of the Eurozone recession  and slowdown in China  on the domestic economy  In it we stated  The continued recessionary drag across the Euro zone is dampening revenues and slowing demand for exports from the U S  Recent corporate reports from key transportation related companies have all warned of weaker outlooks due to slowdowns in the Euro zone  The chart below was presented recently by the Frederick Smith  the President and CEO of FedEx Corp   which shows the clearly negative trends in the year over year exports including the U S These very negative trends are important to understand because it is the source of revenue for businesses worldwide  As consumer demand slows it reduces the need for production ultimately reducing profitability  Furthermore  this delcline in production and consumption leads to higher unemployment  lower incomes and ultimately an economic recession  Domestically  exports are more crucially important than ever as they now comprise more than 13  of GDP and 40  of corporate profits Historically  when exports have turned down the economy was either in  or slipping into  a recession  The recent drop in durable goods orders and industrial production have been clear warnings that this could already be in the works Today s release of the trade data provides further recessionary warning signs  In August  the U S  trade balance worsened as exports declined reflecting economic weakness in Europe and slower growth in Asia  Also  oil and petroleum product imports jumped on higher prices due to a weaker U S  Dollar The trade deficit expanded to  44 2 billion from  42 5 billion in July  originally  42 0 billion   Exports fell 1 0   following a 1 1  decrease in July  Imports slipped 0 1  after a 0 6 percent dip the prior month  The decline in exports was again was led by a decline in industrial supplies  foods  feeds and beverages with minor slippage in autos and consumer goods  None of this data is good for corporate earnings heading into the fourth quarter particularly as higher oil prices impact consumer demand Furthermore  this data is clear evidence as to why businesses are remaining cautious about equipment investment as demand for consumer goods  and capital goods excluding autos  continue to weaken  The decline in consumer goods leads to concerns about future demand putting businesses on the defensive which was clearly evidenced in our recent report on the NFIB Survey   The ongoing problem remains  poor sales  which is the driver for all other business actions from increased capital expenditures to future employment From the report   Weak sales continue to be an albatross for the small business community  The net percent of all owners  seasonally adjusted  reporting higher nominal sales over the past three months was unchanged at a negative 13   cementing the 17 point decline since April and affirming weak GDP growth for the second quarter  Twenty one  21  percent still cite weak sales as their top business problem    historically high  but down from the record 34  reached in March 2010 Consumer spending remains weak and high energy costs continue to  tax  consumer disposable income  The net percent of owners expecting higher real sales was unchanged at one percent of all owners  seasonally adjusted   down 11 points from the year high of net 12  in February  The weak reading is unlikely to trigger orders for new inventory or business expansion  Not seasonally adjusted  24  expect improvement over the next three months  down four points  and 31  expect declines  up three points   The chart below shows capital expenditure plans versus future expectations about the economy  The importance here is that companies are primarily spending on maintenance of plants  property and equipment rather than expansion and upgrades  In the most recent report only 34  reported spending on new equipment which was down seven points from August  Only 16  acquired vehicles   a decline of five points  and just 14  improved or expanded facilities which remained unchanged from the previous report  Overall  there was a substantial reduction in capital spending activity with the percent of owners planning capital outlays in the next three to six months falling three points to 21  The outlook  and ultimately actions taken  by businesses are driven by demand for their products  goods and services  Unfortunately the Fed s bond buying program does not impact these core issues However  what QE programs do have an impact on is the value of the dollar relative to other currencies  Historically  the dollar has declined during stimulus programs as money is pulled out of safehaven investments and moved into risk assets such as commodity and stock markets  During the third quarter as the markets advanced in expectation of the Fed s announcement of QE3    the dollar declined sharply  Therefore  as shown in the chart below  the recent increase in the trade deficit occured as stated in our last report   The continuation of the Eurocrisis has created a capital flight into the US dollar for  safety   However  since July  the strong dollar trend has reversed on the announcement by the ECB  do whatever is necessary  to save the Euro zone  Therefore  the trade deficit will increase in the next couple of months as the dollar weakens making imports more expensive for already cash strapped consumers  The overall backdrop from the trade report does not bode well for a reversal of fortune for corporations domestically  The increase in the deficit will subtract from GDP in the coming quarter  as shown in the chart above  as Net Exports are a part of the GDP calculation  The issues is that with the economy currently growing at an already very weak 1 25  in Q2    there simply isn t much wiggle room between growth and contraction The risk to the current expectations of continued growth in 2013 is that the annualized rate of growth in both imports and exports is not supportive of those expectations  With exports now making up such a large percentage of GDP  and imports reflecting a weak consumer  the implications are for further weakness in GDP  The chart below shows the year over year change in imports and exports  Historically speaking  when both imports and exports have declined in unison it has indicated the onset of a recession  With the current decline in both imports and exports close to going negative the outlook is worrisome The recent trade report does not provide much support for the economic and stock market bulls  As we have stated many times    the current fundamental and economic backdrops are not supportive of higher asset prices at current levels  However  while the market may advance due to the injections of liquidity into the financial system    it doesn t make it a  healthy  market ,2012-10-11,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trade-deficit:-recession-risks-increase-139512,139512
166373,387889,FDX,Economic Reports Confirm Deterioration,opinion,Economic reports all across the board this morning continue to confirm a further deterioration in the overall economy  The first set of releases came overnight with Markit s Flash Purchasing Manager Indexes from around the globe   the numbers were not pretty  Note   A reading below 50 indicates contraction Japan  47 9  down from 49 9 in JuneNetherlands  48 9  unchanged from 48 9 in JuneSouth Korea  47 2  down from 49 4 in JuneTaiwan  47 5  down from 49 2 in JuneVietnam  43 6  down 46 6 in JuneChina  49 3  up from 48 2 in JuneIndia  52 9  down from 55 0 in JuneRussia  52 0  up from 51 0 in JuneTurkey  49 4  down from 51 4 in JuneSpain  42 3  up from 41 1 in JuneItaly  44 3  down from 44 6 in JuneFrance  43 4  down from 45 2 in JuneGermany  43 0  down from 45 0 in JuneUK  45 4  down from  48 6 in JuneUS  51 4  down from 52 5 in JuneDo you see the problem here The global economy is slowing which has been noted by several major U S  companies as of late notably Fed Ex  FDX   UPS  UPS  and Caterpillar  CAT   Since the end of the last recession roughly 40  of corporate revenues have come from the goods and services that are exported to our global trade partners  As their economies weaken it is only a function of time before it comes home to roost The recent release of the Institute of Supply Management  ISM  Manufacturing Index shows this occurring in real time  While the recent release showed a small uptick to 49 8 from 49 7 the lift came primarily from an unwanted build in inventories which jumped 5 points in July to 49 0 from 44 0 in June  Customer inventories also showed an increase as consumption has slowed in recent months as per our discussion yesterday  Furthermore  the increases in prices  from 37 0 in June to 39 5 in July  will likely get worse in August due to rising commodity prices  The increase in prices will have to be passed on to the consumer which is likely going to result in further contraction in spending   As we stated in yesterday s report the primary concern of businesses at the current time is the lack of demand or  poor sales   New Orders remain in contraction at 48 in July  Inventories are rising as stated above and Backlogs Of Orders declined to 43 0 from 44 5 in June  Exports declined to 46 5 from 4735 in June due less demand from overseas and Imports declined sharply from 53 5 to 50 5 as domestic demand has waned  This lack of  demand  keeps business on the defensive  When New Orders fall  and Backlogs have been worked through  businesses resort to further cost cutting and productivity measures to maintain profitability  This leads to reductions in both current employment and plans for future employment as shown by the sharp drop in the Employment index from 56 6 in June to 52 0 in July  The ISM index is not the only index to show declines in employment  Since January of 2012 the employment component of the  Chicago Fed National Activity Index  a composite of 85 indexes  declined from  37 to 0 00 in June ISM Manufacturing Index fell from 54 30 to 52 00 in JulyISM Non Manufacturing Index slipped from 57 4 to 52 3 in JuneNew York Fed Manufacturing Index  Empire  was 12 09 in January  rose to 20 48 in May and then plunged to 12 37 in June Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index tumbled from 11 6 to  8 4 in JulyDallas Fed Manufacturing Index has been sliding from its February 2012 peak of 25 2 to 11 8 in July Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Index rose from 9 in January to 12 in April and crashed to 6 in July Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index was climbed from 4 in January to 16 in May and then plummeted to 1 in July National Federation Of Independent Businesses fell from 5 in January to 3 in June I have created a composite index of these primary employment components to get a better picture of the overall trend of employment  Historically  when this index is at 10 or below the economy has been either very weak or in recession  The index is currently at 14 45 which does not indicate an immediate recession  however  it is important to notice that declines in this index can occur very rapidly once the peak has been completed  shown by red arrows    Automobile manufacturing is also feeling the impact of the slow down  Both GM and Ford announced steep declines in sales  GM was expected to show a gain in July s sales of 2 1  but posted a decline of 6 4   Ford  likewise expected to show gains of 0 8  in July  disappointed with a decline of 4   However  this should not be news to anyone paying attention  We have been discussing recently that the  sales  that have been reported by the manufacturers has not corresponded to retail sales reports leading us to believe that dealers were engaging in  dealer channel stuffing  allowing manufacturers to elevate sales  This is a process that can continue only temporarily until the dealers become overloaded with inventory  These types of actions skew economic reports and inflate earnings  GM was recently served with a  on allegations of channel stuffing    In connection with the IPO  and in order to assuage concerns that GM was predicting revenue based on production rather than actual sales  GM falsely assured investors that it was actively managing its production by monitoring its dealer inventory levels  Additionally  GM assured investors that in 2011 it would improve inventory management  which would improve average transaction price  These statements were false when made  In July 2011  reports began to surface that GM had engaged in an extraordinary inventory build up  In particular  an article published by Bloomberg on July 5  2011 revealed that GM may have been unloading excessive inventory on dealers  a practice known as  channel stuffing   in order to create the false impression that GM was recovering and sales and revenues were rising   However  this is not isolated just to the U S  Much has been discussed of Germany s strong economy  which as shown above is now sliding into contraction  however   recently that while  official figures show a 0 7 percent rise in German car sales for the half year  figures from auto market research firms Dataforce and BDW Automotive show private demand fell 5 percent in the period  which would mean all the growth had been manufactured by the manufacturers    As stated above  corporations are under extreme pressure from the financial markets to make  their numbers  in terms of bottom line EPS  However  we need to pay attention to top line revenue as this is where the story of real strength is shown  Since the first quarter of 2009 top line revenue for the S P 500 companies has increased by 21   through the end of the first quarter of 2012  while operating profits have increased by 206   At the same time corporate profits per employee have surged from 0 9 to 1 5 which is an all time record  The creation of profitability has come at the expense of employment  and wages  which ultimately impacts economic growth However  this explains why there has only been marginal economic growth since the end of the last recession given the massive amounts of stimulus that has been thrown at the system  While corporations have gotten richer   the middle class has suffered the consequences  Since the turn of the century the average family income has fallen by 12  which is the largest sustained declined since the depression  With constrained spending power the consumer has been unable to provide the sustained demand needed to spur employment  We are currently witnessing the decline in demand in the manufacturing reports as new orders slow  backlogs are worked down and demand for employment drops  The problem with the stimulative measures that have been applied over the last three years by the Fed is that they have acted to drag forward future demand  That  demand pull  successfully pulled  and kept  the economy out of a deeper recession since 2009  however  at the conclusion of each of these programs the vacuum created by that  demand pull  was immediately felt through the economy  We are witnessing the same effect currently  There is clear evidence that there is still insufficient demand to stimulate  and sustain  organic economic growth  Without further stimulative support the recessionary drag from the Eurozone  combined with slowing domestic demand  will continue to pull economic growth rates lower ,2012-08-02,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/economic-reports-confirm-deterioration-131700,131700
166374,387890,FDX,Manufacturing Slowdown Intensifying  ,opinion,Market NotesS P 500 has broken out to a 4 year high  Is it another trap  Dow Theory did not confirm the break out and neither did the Dow Jones on its own  The broadest measure of US stocks  the NYSE Composite Index  is quite far below its May 2011 high and also not confirming a breakout  All charts thanks to Acting Man blog In 1982  a famous Time magazine cover titled  portrayed the mood of the time  Paul Volcker was fighting rampant inflation with Long Bond rates as high as 14   Over 30 years later  in sync with the Kondratiev Wave   the rates on the Long Bond are now down to 2 8  with a technical divergence giving us a sell signal  Is this the final bottom for rates Euro has broken its technical downtrend this week and now finds itself testing the 200 day moving average  The move has been linked to Draghi s promises  without any action  that has driven a huge short covering rally for several weeks now  Bearish bets on the Euro have been reduced by over 50  from 214 418 contracts in June to 102 306 contracts as of Tuesday Unlike the much loved US equities  one of the most hated and worst performing assets in the last 12 months has been Coffee  down over 40    The recent COT report showed that hedge funds now hold the largest net short position in the Coffee market since 2004  when the price was below 70 cents  Bearish hedge fund positions usually present opportunities  so is this time different Big Picture A week full of central bank intervention promises has pushed risk assets out of oversold levels  The euro has experienced a 7 cent rally from its previous bottom around  1 20  Copper  which tends to be an industrial economic indicator  is attempting to break above its 200 MA  However  Copper is far away from confirming the S P s new highs in 2012  The Emerging Markets  saviour of global growth in the post Lehman recovery  continue to lag other equity indices indicating that not all is well with the BRICs  Currencies and precious metals have technically broken out to the upside  but the real test will come as volatility of global risk assets rise and if the US Dollar starts to rally again  Finally  the DAX is now moving almost vertically like a NASA rocket  I believe that the current level of investor hope  easily found on blogs and forums throughout the net  is completely misguided and completely disconnected from fundamental conditions  Hope that the US will miss a recession  hope that central bank stimulus will revive economic growth  hope that China has a soft landing instead of a hard landing  and finally hope towards authorities finding a solution in the Eurozone crisis  There is a lot of hope out there  but from a contrarian point of view  I hold absolutely none  Personally  I believe a global recession is imminent as manufacturing is now entering a sustained contraction period  The printing of money cannot automatically revive manufacturing or global trade  if it could the Fed would have stopped every recession since 1913   Let us do a world tour starting with the US and finishing off here in Asia   Global manufacturing activity  measured by JP Morgan PMI  continues to slow  We now have 80  of the world s PMIs in contraction territory  which removes the notion of economic de coupling  Make no mistake about this  the world is in a synchronised slowdown  Commenting on the Global Manufacturing survey  David Hensley said   The August PMIs point to a further modest acceleration in the rate of contraction of global industry  as the sector is buffeted by rising headwinds in a number of key economic regions and falling levels of international trade  The labour market is still holding up better than the activity indicators  but this could be threatened as signs of excess capacity become more visible  US Manufacturing readings  measured by NBER ISM data  came in below 50 for the third consecutive month  New Orders declined further into contraction territory  while   A combination of both  known as Orders less Inventory  came in at levels indicating recession territory similar to 2008  Commenting on the US Manufacturing survey  Bradley J  Holcomb said   The PMI registered 49 6 percent  a decrease of 0 2 percentage point from July s reading of 49 8 percent  indicating contraction in the manufacturing sector for the third consecutive month  This is also the lowest reading for the PMI  since July 2009  The New Orders Index registered 47 1 percent  a decrease of 0 9 percentage point from July  indicating contraction in new orders for the third consecutive month  Comments from the panel generally reflect a slowdown in orders and demand  with continuing concern over the uncertain state of global economies   Bob Pisani  over at the   summarised the ISM quite well too  He stated that this month s ISM report had a strong message with a key word   slowdown   appearing everywhere  He listed various reports from subcomponent industries out of the survey  where  slowdown  or something similar appear  Here is the list from his blog  Internal indicators and feedback from sales channels are indicating a SLOWDOWN in demand for capital equipment    Machinery   Business continues to be very solid  but there is now a SLOWING of incoming orders    Fabricated Metal Products   Incoming orders have SLOWED somewhat  but indications are that there will be a stronger fourth quarter    Plastics   Rubber Products   Business is SLOW right now  Companies seem to be holding onto their money    Computer   Electronic Products   We can sense  feel and see HEADWINDS with customer orders  especially Europe related    Apparel  Leather   Allied Products   New orders and backlog remain FLAT    Miscellaneous Manufacturing   Auto industry SLOWING a bit in the second half  of the year     Transportation Equipment   LACKLUSTER demand continues in all regions of the world  and is supporting much lower raw materials prices in the second half of 2012    Chemical Products   Confirming the slowdown in both the global as well as US manufacturing  was the recent slump in Durable Goods Orders  This indicator has an amazingly strong correlation with both the US GDP data as well as the S P 500  as we can see in the chart above  In his recent September report  a well notable bear  Albert Edwards wrote   The metric which really stood out for me over recent weeks was a truly awful US durable goods report  For although the headline July data rose by over 4   both mom and yoy  the core measure of new orders has slumped  core is capital goods orders excluding the volatile aircraft component   Core orders fell 4  in July mom and 6 2  yoy  July was not a one off  This is now the fourth month out of the last five that core new orders have fallen sharply and is entirely consistent with the rapidly deteriorating profits backdrop  If as I suspect  this is further evidence that the US economy has already entered recession  it will not be long before the US equity market reacts  Certainly  the recent pop in the market above 1425 to a post crisis high sits badly with the facts on the ground  see chart   Irrespective of any prospect of QE3  the market will not resist this recessionary data for long  The S P will be led hand in hand by the economic cycle over a cliff into free  fall  That will be the third phase of this secular valuation bear market  Recessions and economic contractions usually come about through inventory levels growing beyond demand  which forces companies to slash production and fire employees  For those not familiar with US GDP calculations  a point should be made that it is shipments that are included in the final readings  not new orders  That would mean current ratio between the two is signalling a recession  chart above   Albert summaries it perfectly   For it is capital goods shipments  not new orders  that go into the GDP data  as what is not shipped just piles up in inventories until capital goods producing companies bite the bullet and slash their own production schedules in line with the weak new order flow   Eurozone Manufacturing  measured by Markit PMI  continued its theme of contraction  indicating that the Eurozone is entering a second recession within 3 years  Italy s PMI was at a 10 month low and Austria s at a 37 month low  while Spanish PMI was at a 5 month high and Netherlands at a 6 month high  Commenting on the Eurozone Manufacturing survey  Rob Dobson said   The final reading of the August PMI confirms that the Eurozone manufacturing sector remains firmly in contraction territory  The rate of decline was a little slower than in July  providing some heart that the manufacturing downturn may be easing  but the sector is on course to act as a drag on gross domestic product in the third quarter  The national picture remains one of widespread contraction  Only Ireland saw manufacturing output rise  while larger nations like France and Germany remain in reverse gear  The situation in Italy is also becoming more of a cause for concern  as it falls further down the PMI league table   Chinese Manufacturing  measured by HSBC and Markit PMI  signalled a continued contraction in August  New orders came in at a 9 month low  which is a very worrying sign and confirms Asian export contraction  Let us not forget that many of these Asian economies are export reliant for growth and are now facing huge headwinds in the coming quarters  Commenting on the China Manufacturing survey  Hongbin Qu said   The final reading of the HSBC manufacturing PMI  August  confirmed that China s manufacturing sector still faces intensifying downward pressure  New export orders contracted at the fastest pace since March 2009  this  combined with a record high in stocks of finished goods sub index  and a 41 month low employment index  suggests China s exporters are facing increasing difficulties amid stronger global headwinds   Japanese Manufacturing continues to slow at a more accelerated pace as well  with new orders down meaningfully in August  Production fell at the fastest rate in over 16 months  which is a sign that the post earthquake economic rebound is now stalling  Commenting on the Japanese Manufacturing survey data  Alex Hamilton said   Japan s manufacturing sector downturn continued in August  according to PMI survey findings  The data provide further evidence to suggest that growth in the world s third largest economy is faltering in the face of weakening global demand conditions  Overall new business  exports plus domestic  declined at a solid rate  while the index measuring trends in factory output fell further over the month  There was more deflationary news on the price front  with average input costs and output charges decreasing simultaneously for a third month running  Meanwhile  a muted labour market picture was signalled by the latest survey  with employment stagnating   So what can we expect as global manufacturing continues to slow  In my opinion there are two answers  a basic quick answer and a more in depth one  The quick answer is most likely linked to a global recession  The more in depth answer is seen in the chart below  According to Morgan Stanley research  global manufacturing tends to lead global trade volumes by about three months  If we were to do basic mathematics  the indicator above implies that global trade volumes would start contracting by the end of Q4 of 2012  post elections in the US   There is already evidence of a slowdown in certain trading hot spots around the world   where 8  of the worlds freight flows annually In this weeks news  FedEx confirmed that global air freight trade volumes are already starting to contract  as the company issued profit warnings  believe me more of them are about to come   Bloomberg writes   FedEx Corp   FDX   operator of the world s largest cargo airline  said quarterly earnings will fall short of its forecast after a weak global economy damped revenue from express shipments  The cut in profit adds to evidence of how Europe s economic slump and slowing growth in Asia are dragging on FedEx  which is seeking money saving efforts such as buyouts for some employees  The company is considered an economic bellwether because it moves goods ranging from financial documents to pharmaceuticals   The chart above shows how FedEx earnings tend to be a strong leading indication of the direction of the US GDP  It is only a matter of time until bullish economists realise that this is not just another summer slowdown viz a viz 2010 and 2011  Further proof of global trade volumes moving towards contraction mode is the rising profit warnings out of Hong Kong based companies since the beginning of 2012  as we can see in the chart above thanks to the Business Insider website  The Hong Kong economy is one of the major trading ports of the world  so it should not come as a surprise that its private sector tends to suffer with serious consequences during periods of global economic contraction We are witnessing strength in the equity markets around the world  while global economic growth continues to deteriorate towards stall speed and a potential recession  If one was to ask me why I think the equity markets continue to turn a blind eye towards fundamentals  the obvious answer would point towards investor hope of further stimulus by the Fed and ECB  While investors have been locked in a debate over the last several months regarding whether central banks will ease or not  a much more important debate should center on whether the stimulus will work by creating economic activity  In my opinion  anyone who thinks the printing of money can create economic growth  quite frankly  must be living on planet Mars reducing positions will be appropriate  Recommendation is to add on pullbacks  NAV long exposure is about 100  ,2012-09-11,Tiho

166388,387904,FDX,FedEx  Of Interest To Aggressive Investors With Patience,opinion,After suffering from shrinking earnings during the great recession  FedEx  FDX  appears on track to once again deliver the goods profitably  However  the market seems to have already recognized the current opportunity and pushed valuation to the outer limits of fair value  Therefore  FedEx may be an investment that requires patience  Aggressive investors could take a position here  but more conservative investors may want to wait for a more attractive entry point  Dividend Contender   FedEx Corp  FDX      This article looks at FedEx Corp  a Dividend Contender  through the lens of the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool  Since a picture is worth a thousand words  the reader will be

fully functioning earnings and price correlated set of graphs   Tip   Run your mouse over the various lines and watch the graphs come to life     A Dividend Contender is defined as a company that has increased its dividend for a minimum of 10   24 straight years  FedEx Corp is a Dividend Contender that has raised its dividend every year for 10 consecutive years  The complete Dividend Contenders

earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots FedEx Corp s earnings per share since 1998  A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that FedEx Corp has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 6 7   see purple circle on graph  per annum   Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line  Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1    The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide  2    The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs  Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance  Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values  Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income FedEx CorpThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 7 8  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of FedEx Corp would have received an additional  10 283 50 in dividends that increased their total return from 7 8  to 8  per annum  Note   Since this is a Dividend Contender it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 10 24  years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1998  A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for FedEx Corp is  67  which is historically normal    Looking to the Future   Extensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants    1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings 2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earnings   Therefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance    Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  FedEx Corp represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Contender at a reasonable price  The important factor is that FedEx Corp has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns    The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions    The consensus of 25 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast FedEx Corp s long term earnings growth at 15   FedEx Corp has low long term debt at 10  of capital  FedEx Corp is currently trading at a P E of 18 2  which is outside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  FedEx Corp s True Worth valuation would be  170 64 at the end of 2017  which would be a 14 1  annual rate of return from the current price  including assumed dividends  Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in FedEx Corp to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that FedEx Corp s expected earnings would be 7 6 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component This report presents essential  fundamentals at a glance  on Dividend Contenders FedEx Corp  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conduct his or her own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not  Follow the link we provided at the beginning of this article to a fully functioning F A S T  Graphs  on FedEx Corp Summary   ConclusionsAlong with their packages  FedEx has been delivering strong earnings growth  although slightly erratic  since the great recession  Furthermore  expectations are that earnings growth should continue at an above average rate over the next 5 years  Although the company does pay a modest but growing dividend  FedEx is more of a growth story than an income opportunity  Therefore  prudent investors may be better off waiting for a slightly more attractive price  As always  we recommend you
