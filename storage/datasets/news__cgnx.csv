Greetings  and welcome to the Cognex s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions 
It is now my pleasure to introduce Susan Conway  Senior Director of Investor Relations  Thank you  Please begin 
Susan Conway    Senior Director of Investor Relations
Thank you  and good evening  everyone 
With us today are Cognex President and CEO  Rob Willett  Vice President and Corporate Controller  Laura MacDonald  and Cognex Treasurer  Chris Stagno 
I d like to point out that our earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10 Q are available on our Investor Relations website at investor cognex com  Both contain highly detailed information about our financial results  During the call  we may use a non GAAP financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors or if we believe it will help investors better understand our results or business trends  You can see a reconciliation of certain items from GAAP to non GAAP in Exhibit 2 of the earnings release  Any forward looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today  Things often change  however  and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated  You should refer to our SEC filings  including our most recent Form 10 K  for a detailed list of these risk factors 
With that  now I d like to turn the call over to CEO  Rob Willett 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Hello  everyone  Thanks for joining us today 
I know most of you are used to hearing Cognex s Chairman  Dr  Bob Shillman  welcome participants to our earnings call  Dr  Bob is unable to join us this evening due to a prior commitment  He sends his regards  and he looks forward to talking with you on our next call 
Cognex delivered Q3 results in line with our expectations  with revenue at the top end of our July guidance  That said  our revenue was down both year on year and sequentially as a result of the ongoing slowdown in manufacturing investment  The decline can be almost entirely attributed to consumer electronics  which decreased by approximately  50 million  roughly 50  from Q3 of 2018  The automotive and the broader industrial sectors also continue to weaken due to persistent global economic uncertainty and trade conflicts  particularly in Europe and China  That deterioration was partially offset by growth in logistics  which increased by approximately 50  year on year  We have confidence in our logistics strategy  and we believe we can continue to grow at that 50  rate over the long term 
In logistics  well known traditional brick and mortar retailers are starting to invest heavily in logistics automation to compete more effectively with their e commerce competitors  They are changing their supply chain  and they are looking to Cognex s industry leading products to help them implement an automation strategy to fulfill orders rapidly  reliably and cost effectively  Near term market conditions notwithstanding  the long term potential for machine vision and for Cognex is unchanged  Our long term operating model remains intact  and with a target of 20  compound annual growth  mid 70s gross margin and 30  operating margin 
Now  I d like to say a few words about our recent acquisition of Sualab  an outstanding technology company specializing in deep learning software to automate inspection tasks that are currently done by human visual inspectors  Sualab is the type of acquisition that we like to do  It has an excellent engineering team  I ll expand on this in a few moments  and also is a great cultural fit  We believe that deep learning technology will be a major growth driver for Cognex in the years ahead  For the first time  machine vision is reaching a level of performance that allows it to replace tens of thousands of humans globally  whose work it is to perform highly repetitive  visual inspection tasks  to identify cosmetic flaws and defects on products during their manufacture 
The market we serve today for machine vision using deep learning and factory automation is estimated at  100 million of annual revenue and is growing rapidly  we believe  by 75  per year  The largest and fastest growing segment of that market is the replacement of human inspectors in Asia  particularly for electronic components and finished products where Sualab is well positioned  The acquisition of Sualab not only extends our deep learning capabilities for inspection application  it more than triples the size of the Cognex team dedicated to developing and applying deep learning technology to industrial inspection tasks 
Upon closing  we welcome the approximately 100 smart  ambitious and energetic new employees who share our passion for machine vision  the majority of whom are in engineering departments and are highly skilled in both contemporary programming techniques and applying deep learning to inspection tasks in the manufacturing process  Led by co founder Song Kiyoung  the Sualab engineering team will continue to operate from its headquarters in downtown Seoul  They will work closely with our team based in Cambridge  Massachusetts  which is led by Reto Wyss  a co founder of ViDi systems  which we acquired in 2017  The ViDi acquisition established our deep planning development efforts and is the reason for our success in this area to date 
Here are a few more details on the acquisition that I d like to share with you  The purchase price was  195 million  We paid  171 million in cash at closing  Payment of the remaining  24 million is deferred until a later date  Although Sualab s revenue is modest  the price is justified by the high value of the company s substantial engineering team  its core technology developed over the last six years  and its experience applying that technology at very large companies in Asia  We expect technology acquisitions to be accretive within two years  and it looks like Sualab will fit within that model 
Moving on to the next topic  We have published an updated view of our served market  You can find it on our Investor Relations website at investor cognex com  Our new estimate of Cognex s total served market for machine vision is  4 2 billion  This is a narrow definition of what we can serve with our current product offering  This estimate is 20  higher than our previous estimate as a result of both growth in the underlying market and new opportunities that are now addressable with Cognex products  Despite near term challenging market conditions  we believe our served market will grow in the low teens over the long term  and we expect to continue to outperform market growth as a result of our superior technology and the strength of our customer relationships 
Now I will turn the call over to Laura for financial details from the third quarter  Laura  the microphone is yours 
Laura A  MacDonald    Vice President and Corporate Controller
Thank you  Rob  and hello  everyone 
Revenue in Q3 was  183 million  at the high end of our expected range  Revenue declined 21  year on year due to lower sales in consumer electronics  particularly smartphone manufacturing  Revenue from automotive and the broader factory automation market also declined from Q3  18  partially offsetting the shortfall with growth in logistics 
Gross margin of 74  was down slightly from Q3  18 and consistent with Q2  19 despite lower revenue  Operating expenses declined from both Q3  18 and the prior quarter  reflecting reduced expenses for incentive compensation plans  We continue to be prudent with discretionary spending without changing product development plans  Operating margin in Q3 was 24   representing a decline both year on year and sequentially due to the lower revenue environment  Excluding discrete tax items  earnings per share were  0 23 in Q3  19 compared with  0 39 in Q3  18 and  0 27 in Q2  19 
Looking at revenue growth year on year from a geographic perspective  the Americas was the best performing region  increasing mid teens year on year due to strong growth in logistics  The impact of this quarter s substantially lower contribution from consumer electronics was most noticeable in Europe  where revenue declined by more than 45  year on year 
Customers in Greater China continue to defer their capital spending plans  resulting in low double digit revenue decline year on year  This decline would have been greater in Greater China and less extreme in Europe if not for procurement changes made by certain customers in consumer electronics  shifting their purchases from China    to China from Europe  In the rest of Asia  revenue was relatively flat with Q3  18 
Turning to our strong balance sheet  We ended the quarter with  918 million in cash and investments and no debt  Even after purchasing Sualab  we have enough capital to support our organic growth objectives and M A plans and for sharing our ongoing success with our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends  In that regard  our Board of Directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend by 10  to  0 055 per share  The dividend is payable on November 29 to all shareholders of record on November 15 
Now I ll turn the call back to Rob 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you  Laura 
Moving next to guidance  We expect revenue for the fourth quarter will be between  155 million and  165 million  making it the lowest revenue generating quarter this year compared with revenue of  193 million reported in Q4 of 2018  Industrial markets are significantly weaker today and continue to deteriorate  led by automotive  The contraction is most pronounced outside of the United States and particularly in business that relates to China 
Unlike Q3  we don t expect growth from logistics to offset the overall revenue shortfall in Q4  Even though logistics revenue grew by approximately 50  year on year in Q3  we expect it to decrease year on year in Q4  This is the result of a major customer delaying delivery of large orders for new sites 
Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be in the mid 70  range  consistent with the gross margin for Q3  Operating expenses are expected to increase by mid to high single digits on a sequential basis  Approximately 4 percentage points are attributable to incremental costs for the Sualab team  estimated amortization of intangibles and expenses associated with the acquisition 
The effective tax rate is expected to be 16   excluding discrete tax items  I d like to make you aware of two discrete tax items expected to be recorded in 2019  The first item involves changes to our corporate tax structure  which came about because of legislation passed by the European Union  For that one  we expect a discrete tax benefit of between  100 million and  125 million and a slight increase to our 16  effective tax rate  excluding discrete events going forward 
The second item is our decision to move acquired Sualab technology out of Korea to align with our corporate tax structure  This is expected to result in a discrete tax expense of between  27 million and  33 million  These items continue to be evaluated  and because of that  we do not have more detail at this time 
With that  we will open the call for questions  Operator  please go ahead 
Questions and Answers 
Operator
 Operator Instructions  Thank you  Our first question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company  Please proceed 
Joe Giordano    Cowen and Company    Analyst
Hey  guys  Good evening 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi  Joe 
Joe Giordano    Cowen and Company    Analyst
Rob  could you size that big order that was pushed  And is it something that you just found out recently  Is it something that you have visibility into  like  just delivering it after the quarter or something  I m just trying to see how indicative it is of the logistics environment in general  or this is just kind of a one off thing that gets fixed in a few weeks 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  So it s a pretty substantial order  Let me give you a bit of color on it  So  overall  our logistics funnel is strong and growing  but we expect lower revenue year on year from logistics in Q4 as a result of this major customer delaying delivery of large orders to new sites  And this same customer did take substantial deliveries in Q4 of last year  So many of these orders are on our books  awaiting delivery  which we now expect to result in revenue next year and not in Q4  Visibility of that is quite recent for us  but we see probably that some major integrators may have had some more specific understanding of that situation earlier  So  we continue to see strength in our logistics business  particularly among a broad base of customers who are growing very  very well indeed and remain confident that we can grow it 50  over the long run  But we now just don t expect to grow at that rate for the full year in 2019 
Joe Giordano    Cowen and Company    Analyst
Can I just clarify one thing there  So  this is an order you have received  right  This is not an order that you thought you might get that didn t materialize  this is an order that you already have though 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
So it s an order that s coming in in many pieces  it s very substantial  right  So we don t have all of it  but we have many  much of it 
Joe Giordano    Cowen and Company    Analyst
Okay  And then I guess my follow up  Yeah  go ahead please 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
I was going to sort of state it  I think it s really to do with changes at the customer  about their plans and the timing of their plans  which unfortunately for us is moving revenue out of this year and slowing down our overall growth rate in Q4 and for the full year for logistics 
Joe Giordano    Cowen and Company    Analyst
Okay  My follow up would be around China  Obviously  a lot of talk around trade war and what a Phase 1 agreement might do  How much of this stuff    do you attribute like any of this weakness to that specifically  And if there is some sort of like Phase 1 of 3 kind of deal coming out  does that change anything on the ground for you guys do you think any    on the near term 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
It s difficult to call but I have to say  yes  I mean  certainly  China is our softest region at the moment  and after being a real engine of growth for us for so many years  with customers there have a real wait and see mindset and they re very slow to place orders  and they continue to reduce and delay capital expenditures  So that s what we re seeing  And I think Laura pointed out also the revenue from China in Q3 benefited from purchases from certain consumer electronic customers that have started to purchase our products in China  when previously they bought them out of Europe  So that s also maybe making our China numbers or the situation in China look better than it really is 
So how quickly will that turnaround  Well  my experience with China  my experience with our business in general  is that when things do change  the business can come back very quickly  I ve seen that on a number of occasions  I don t know whether this is really a different long term situation  unlike what we ve seen before  but I do happen to think if confidence can return  we see momentum in the other direction  we could see a quick recovery  but I just have no way of gauging if and when that will come 
Joe Giordano    Cowen and Company    Analyst
Fair enough  I have some others  I ll jump in queue though  Thanks 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you 
Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W  Baird   Co  Please proceed 
Richard Eastman    Robert W  Baird   Co     Analyst
Yes  Good afternoon  Rob  could you put a little color around Sualab  When we looked at their website  they have a pretty impressive customer list  and all the big majors on the consumer electronics side  it appears  And I m curious  with very modest revenue presently  how is their product deployed  Is it still kind of in a piloting phase  Or is it deployed at a central location  Or is it deployed on equipment itself  Just kind of walk me through that  maybe just a little bit  and how quickly the revenue expectations can inflate  given the implication 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure  sure  Sualab has a business model  some    very like ViDi  right  So they sell SuaKIT  a sophisticated deep learning machine vision software  And they have a very strong team of application engineers who help customers apply it  right  So the majority    the vast majority of that business today  over the trailing 12 months  is related to that  right  And    but I think more excitingly  I think what we see the potential is to take that technology  and they re already working on this  and to deploy it through machine builders to help it scale much in the way that we have in our consumer electronics business over the last five years or so 
We  of course  have a great network of machine builders and integrators who can help them speed that up  And then they have some very nice application specific related products in their pipeline that we think will be very powerful in changing this market  So there s a base kind of business that I would describe very much like ViDi  very  very good technology with some relative strengths and differences compared to ViDi  and then some very interesting opportunities to apply more application specific products through machine builders in a form that should be more scalable in the coming years and where we are very well positioned to help them 
Richard Eastman    Robert W  Baird   Co     Analyst
Okay  All right  And then just a follow up on this issue that you raised about a consumer electronics customer purchasing in China for China versus prior  It was purchased    product was purchased out of Europe  What predicated that switch  Is it a currency issue  Why is there a shift there and where the purchases are occurring for presumably the same application 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  I m sort of limited into of what I can say specifically about the internal workings of our large customers  But I think  certainly in that case  perhaps due to some of the trade situations we re seeing and tax consequences and other things  they ve decided they want to purchase from us locally in China rather than out of a subsidiary in Europe  It doesn t really change the nature of the work we do nor does it really change our profitability on the business  generally speaking  but it just does mean where you see it show up in region is different 
Richard Eastman    Robert W  Baird   Co     Analyst
Okay  And that had started this quarter 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Laura 
Laura A  MacDonald    Vice President and Corporate Controller
Materially this quarter  yeah 
Richard Eastman    Robert W  Baird   Co     Analyst
Okay  Okay  very good  Thank you 
Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley  Please proceed 
Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    Analyst
Hi  good evening guys 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi  Josh 
Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    Analyst
Just want to follow up on the logistics comment  maybe some more color about some of the lumpiness there  I guess  first of all  can you talk us through kind of the concentration from a customer perspective  In that case  it sounds like there was some large order that got pushed  But is this going to be something kind of analogous to the electronics side with your large customer there  where we do see lumpiness just related to one customer really driving kind of the quarter to quarter cadence 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  OK  So you have two questions that are sort of what s that kind of customer mix in logistics and how does that play out in terms of lumpiness in the business  In our logistics business today  we have a handful of large important customers  right  who can be ordering a substantial amount from us in the order of  10 million to  20 million in a quarter  It would not necessarily be unusual  I think  in terms of how we see them playing out  And those orders are based often on their automation plans  that s how they roll them out  right  So I think that does have the potential to move revenue in and out of quarters  And I think that s probably going to become    that is probably a reality of our logistics business going forward  And then  we have many  many smaller customers who might be buying very small amounts  up to a few million dollars  And there s a good base of that business that looks much more consistent overall 
And that business actually is    when we look at it  it s growing faster than our overall business  We expect that probably to go on as our technology becomes easier to integrate  more widely known and accepted  and as we develop our own capability and our integrated network to deliver it  But in kind of answering your question here  we have a handful of customers  and I think the one we reference not by name but today  and I could certainly think of others  may mean that our revenue  as it plays out in the coming quarters  will be lumpy in logistics  and we ll just try to give you a heads up to that  We re really in this for the long term  We see a big change going on  and our 50  long term growth strategy is all based around that  So I think we re relatively comfortable with the fact that may change  but we realize we need to explain it to you as soon as we see it  as we are doing now  And sometimes  that can    it can move 
Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    Analyst
Understood  That s helpful  And then  just taking a step back from consumer electronics  obviously weakness there has been perpetuated for a couple reasons  Obviously  the tough comp coming off of some of the    the OLED roll outs a couple of years ago  and then your general weakness in the electronics industry in 2019  But we are starting to see kind of select green shoots from folks in the broader definition of capital equipment  maybe products that will come off a lot different from what Cognex is supplying  but some kind of early indicators that 2020 will be better  I guess from your perspective  you guys don t get a lot of that color until more of the 2Q time frame  but is there anything you can share with us either on kind of product roadmaps  any kind of technology shifts that you see out there  that would maybe help define important things to watch for 2020  understanding now that you have kind of a couple of years of easy comp starting to build out 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  Okay  Josh  I think I ll point to a few things  but these are really just reprising what I ve said before  We really get a better view of our consumer electronics business in Q2 when we re reporting the Q1 next year  I think that s when we ll have a real read on how it s shaping up 
Always  I would say  at this stage  there s a lot of interesting stuff in the consumer electronics pipeline that we have some visibility on  The question is sort of how well it s funded and able to be implemented as we get into the year  I mean obvious kind of things that could really help and be a big tailwind for the business overall next year  5G  is a very obvious one  To what degree that is implemented and the technical challenges around implementing it  there are always new features  We have a line of sight on coming in  in the electronics market  So that can really drive  but again  it s interesting to see which ones make it in each year 
And then as you mentioned  the roll out of OLED  specifically as it relates to high end phones  foldable screens  that definitely has the life in it as I think you can see by reading the paper  but that s some technology where    but there s a lot of value that Cognex can add  And then I think the headwinds would remain those still    now there is    one of the largest smartphone companies in the world is one we can t sell to  So that certainly is an ongoing headwind and I d like that situation to change and I think so would they  But at the moment  that s a potential problem for us 
Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    Analyst
And just one final one I d like to squeeze in there  Were you doing business with that company before and now you can t  Is there any way to size kind of what that missed opportunity was  And I ll leave it there 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  I think we don t really like to talk about customers by name specifically  but you can assume    I mean  we re the leading machine vision manufacturer in the world  So any company that s performing advanced discrete manufacturing is likely a Cognex customer  And you would expect a big electronics company to be doing    certainly to be doing a few million dollars or more with us 
Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    Analyst
Understood  Thanks 
Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Ritchie with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed 
Joseph Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Thanks  Good afternoon  everyone 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Joe 
Joseph Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
So Rob  just a few quick ones  Maybe just following up on that question on electronics visibility in 5G  how much visibility will you have as the year progresses  And what do you think the timing of that visibility will be  Will it be kind of early next year  Would you know by 1Q  I m just trying to get a sense for timing and visibility 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  I think we ll be in a position to give you a clear view of that as we have in past years when we report our Q1 results  I guess that is end of April    end of April  We may have    we ll probably have visibility earlier than that  I think it s    my experience now  having been through a number of cycles  is there s a lot of stuff there in the funnel  but in reality  the overall view of the market and what gets rolled out really doesn t crystallize until that kind of time frame  And that s very different than our other markets  We sometimes liken  Phonetic  it to they re building the airplane as it s going down the runway in that industry  So  we do have quite late visibility as to what really makes it into the final build 
Joseph Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Yeah  That s fair enough  And then just  I know we ve been talking about this topic a little bit on the call already  but the customer delaying the decision on large orders to new sites  Can you maybe give us a little bit of color on why there was a deferral 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
It has to do with their plans to roll out automation  their automation plans and delays are changing that  right  And those are delays that are related to that company and their plans  not to do    not related to Cognex vision and our ability to meet that demand  but I don t    I can t get more into specifically what and where that customer is finding those issues 
Joseph Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Okay  Got it  I guess I was just trying to get a sense for whether it was like liquidity issue from a customer perspective or whether it was just managing too much and having the capacity to roll this out 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
No  This is a very  very substantial company  It s not    it s really much more about engineering and automation product roll out and plan rather than anything to do with financial or anything to do with Cognex s ability to fulfill those orders that we have on our books and are expecting to complete on our books soon 
Joseph Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Got it  Okay  And then one quick one  I may have missed it earlier  but you mentioned on Sualab  the accretion within two years  What s the expectation then from a financial perspective for next year 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
I don t think we ve    so generally we have a policy of not talking about the forecast for next year  for the full year  So we re not currently disclosing that  But obviously  we re looking for some significant growth from that  And obviously based on what I ve said  it would be dilutive to us next year 
Joseph Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Okay  Got it  Thank you 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  And accretive in two years  and I think we ll be in a better position to give you more detail on that when we report the full year as well  It s still a relatively recent acquisition for us 
Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan  Please proceed 
Paul Chung    JPMorgan    Analyst
This is Paul Chung on for Coster  Thanks for taking our question  So just another follow up on the Sualab acquisition  Why now on this  And is this kind of customer driven demand  Or is this part of your vision for capturing some incremental offerings across your verticals  And if you could also talk about some of your cross selling benefits here with their existing consumer base  I have a follow up 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  Sure  I mean I think the right way to view it is at Cognex  we pride ourselves on having a deep understanding about the technology and the application for machine vision  And we spent a great deal of time studying those  And we ve talked about logistics and how we see that s kind of hitting    has hit a tipping point where the need for automation is changing  There s another tipping point going on currently in the world of machine vision  and it has to do with the deep learning technology and it s progress  and it s huge technology development going on in that space  And the potential it provides to replace human visual inspectors in electronics  of whom there are tens of thousands in Asia  And the technology is getting to the point where it s really now a very attractive market opportunity  and large customers really see that 
And they re very interested to work with us  They face a lot of challenges around finding people to staff  human visual inspection  visual inspection not being very effective  Human visual inspector might be 85  effective in their work in catching defects while machine vision has the capability to be 99 9  effective  So  there s a very good return on investment  That  I think  pretty clear to us and to the big electronics customers that we see in Asia  So I think that s the reason why this is happening now and why we re so positive about it  I think we re also fortunate in that we acquired VIDi 2 5 years ago  and we really had the chance through owning them to see the potential  but seeing that potential also made us realize that we needed more engineers and we needed more reach and engineering capability in Asia  where this market really is 
So as we looked at that and we worked on it  we really realized that Sualab is really right in the sweet spot of all of that  Then we got to know them  I think we ve developed a lot of mutual respect for one another  And we were so pleased to see a fantastic cultural fit  which for us is really important at Cognex because we like to buy acquisitions  We like to buy companies that have great engineers and great growth potential  And the amount of excitement that  that creates in us and in them is something that works very well for us  And we did that with ViDi  We ve done that with Chiaro and other acquisitions we ve made over the years 
So the more we drill  the more we got to know each other  the more we understood the market  the more we talk to large customers in the space and saw where Sualab is working  the more exciting we got and easier it was in our minds to justify making this for us a pretty substantial acquisition 
Paul Chung    JPMorgan    Analyst
Okay  Thanks for that  And then switching gears  on free cash despite material lower revenues and earnings  Can you just talk about the puts and takes of what s driving your working cap conversion benefits this year relative to last  Is this kind of temporary in nature or is there some things more structural going on and how you see working cap trends over the next six months  Thanks 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  Let me ask Laura MacDonald to answer that  Do you need more clarification 
Laura A  MacDonald    Vice President and Corporate Controller
Well  let me see if I can answer  You let me know if you need more clarification  But one of the noticeable changes in our balance sheet is our decline in our inventory balance  which has come down in Q3 as we delivered on large opportunities and ship recently introduced new products  and we ve worked that down nicely from the end of the year  We believe we now have enough inventory balance at an appropriate level  So that was one noticeable change in working capital  is    did that answer your question 
Paul Chung    JPMorgan    Analyst
Yeah  somewhat  Thank you 
Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from line of Matt Summerville with DA Davidson  Please proceed 
Matt Summerville    DA Davidson    Analyst
Hi  Thanks  Maybe just two quick questions  First  with respect to the Americas  can you provide a little bit more granular detail in terms of what you re seeing across the different end markets there  You mentioned logistics  But I could have missed it  just any more color in terms of what you re seeing there would be helpful 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure  Hi  Matt  Yeah  So pretty much like all of our end regions  the Americas region is soft  but particularly in automotive  But I would say  relative to other regions  I think we saw that softness early this year  and now it s more stable  It s not    we re not seeing declining rates we re seeing elsewhere  The    I think as we look at the market overall  we re seeing a lot of uncertainty and delays  And automotive is our
biggest market in the Americas  And we re not anticipating a sort of a significant budget flush in Americas or anywhere  really  that we might expect at the end of the year  So that s kind of baked in our guidance 
The Americas has a relatively better growth profile than elsewhere  also as a result of a higher weight in logistics  It s a home market where we have relatively more business in logistics than anywhere else  and that s a business that is growing very  very strongly  So that s also helping our results in this region  Other industries in the Americas  just out of interest  that    other industries that are holding up well  medical related business  food and beverage  and packaging  There  we re doing OK  They re    I think they re all growing currently despite the difficult market conditions  but    and logistics is growing well  But then certainly  automotive is much more challenging overall 
Matt Summerville    DA Davidson    Analyst
Got it  And then are you able to parse out between what the year over year revenue changes would have looked like had that customer not changed geographic  I ll call it  procurement strategy  just to try and bridge that instead of Europe being down mid 40s  maybe what would that have been down instead of China being down low teens  maybe what would that have been down  if that change didn t happen 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  there s still quite a lot of moving parts as we come through the end of the quarter  So  I don t think we re going to try to do that  per se  Laura  do you want to add   
Laura A  MacDonald    Vice President and Corporate Controller
Yeah  I think we    and that s kind of pro forma information that we haven t prepared to disclose 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  So we re not really ready to give you a read on that yet 
Matt Summerville    DA Davidson    Analyst
Okay  Got it  Thank you  guys 
Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Karen Lau with Gordon Haskett  Please proceed 
Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    Analyst
Thanks  Good afternoon  everyone  Just a quick one on opex  I think you mentioned about 4 points of the sequential increase is due to Sualab  but you also mentioned there is some amortization there  I just want to clarify how much of that would you say is sort of one time that shouldn t really continue into next year  And how much should we really put in the base number as we project forward 
Laura A  MacDonald    Vice President and Corporate Controller
Sure  I can answer that  Karen  So the 4 percentage points represents the Sualab team ongoing operating expenses in addition to an estimate of amortization of intangibles  but we re still in the process of finalizing the purchase price allocation  So we don t know exactly what those numbers will be  But I can tell you that we expect the majority of  170 million that we ll allocate to be assigned to goodwill  So that 4  there was a small percent that I would say is non recurring  Most of the 4   like 3  of the 4   I d say  would be recurring  And again  we expect most of the purchase price will be allocated to goodwill 
Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    Analyst
Okay  Got it  So parsing out the 4 points sequential increase that is related to Sualab  the core spending would be the remaining 4 points  I noticed that in the third quarter  you    in terms of opex  it looks like you underspend a little bit versus your guide  Is the sequential uptick more    in the core opex spending more of a timing issue  Or should we read into that as maybe some of the pent up investment coming back or maybe you re positioning for some projects next year  How should we think about that 
Laura A  MacDonald    Vice President and Corporate Controller
Yeah  I think what you saw us underspending a little compared to the guidance in Q3 related primarily to adjustments to our incentive compensation plans 
Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    Analyst
Okay  I guess    OK  Thank you  And then just  I guess  taking it more broadly into next year  Rob  let s say  for whatever reason  whether it s stabilization or consumer electronics start to turn next year  I would imagine you ve been doing    you guys have been doing a good job in quote unquote cutting the crap  but also  there is probably some pent up spending that might have to come back at some point  So let s say the end markets start to turn next year  would you expect sort of a normal type of incremental margins to be realized  Or do you think that given so many things have been kind of    investment and spending wise    have been delayed this year because of the environment  there is more sort of catch up spending that needs to happen next year if things start to get better  I m just trying to get a sense of the incremental that you would expect 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  Okay  It s an interesting question  Karen  At the moment  I m not expecting sort of that kind of our markets to recover very strongly going into next year  but it s obviously    I think it s really too early to talk about next year  But here s what I can say  I think we run Cognex for the long term  So we re not kind of cutting back on important things that are essential to our three year growth strategies  In fact  we go on investing in those things that we consider essential  And I think through what is  obviously  a much lower rate of increase in spending  we ve been able to keep our new products on track and our plans intact  So  I d say that s the case 
Now if I then go back and I look at times when we have seen a big recovery in our markets or a big incremental step up in growth that I m talking about years like 2010  2014  2017  where we had growth in excess of 30   the pull through in those years is awesome  right  Given our kind of gross margins  and there isn t a great need to add an additional incremental expense related to growth like that  So I would expect if and when our markets recover  And if they come back strongly  as they had  we should see very  very good fall through on incremental revenue 
Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    Analyst
Okay  So there is no kind of delay in spending that what have to be catch up  kind of regardless of how much end market come back next year 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Well  I think the thing to point out would be incentive compensation really  so that is    this is a year where we re not achieving our budget  and we re certainly paying out much less incentive compensation  So if we went back to a normal year  then it will be a step up in that  and we ll get back to a strong year  it will be a significant step up in that 
Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    Analyst

Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham  Please proceed 
Michael Cikos    Needham   Company    Analyst
Hey  guys  This is Mike Cikos on for Jim Ricchiuti  Just a couple of questions here  The first  coming back to the delayed shipments for this logistics customer  I wanted to get a better sense  It sounds like this is one of your larger customers  And I know you kind of scoped the large customers contributing as much as  10 million to  20 million per quarter  not being unusual  Fair to assume that this customer coming in at the higher end of that range  if not higher than that  20 million bogey 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
It s    we re not sure exactly where it would come in and    but perhaps the order of magnitude and yeah  in a range of significance  probably south    not as much as  20 million  but    and it all depends on how much of the orders  we would expect them to take in a particular quarter  And I do just want to clarify  you wouldn t take that number and multiply it by four to get the size of the customer  right  It would be just more like customers have plans  They rolled out at a certain cadence  and that may mean a quarterly revenue for any particular customer might be on that order of magnitude  And that might be the kind of level of challenge that we re seeing in headwind this quarter 
Michael Cikos    Needham   Company    Analyst
I see  Okay  And I guess  if you would say that the logistics business because of this Q4 shift is not expected to grow 50  year on year  how fast is it growing in 2019 then based on what you currently have in hand 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  that s not a number we re going to disclose at this time  right  We ve told you Q3  we re going to sort of see how things play out in Q4  And then we might have more to give you a better view of that when the year is over 
Michael Cikos    Needham   Company    Analyst
I see  Okay  And then just one final question  if I may  on the gross margin front  I was interested in hearing how you guys are able to maintain  call it this mid 70s percent gross margin versus Q3 on the lower revenue base is part of that mix shift  Or is there anything else we should be thinking about in that 
Laura A  MacDonald    Vice President and Corporate Controller
Yeah  That was a result of the revenue mix in the quarter 
Michael Cikos    Needham   Company    Analyst
Great  Thank you guys 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer

Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg  Please proceed 
Andrew Buscaglia    Berenberg Capital Markets    Analyst
Hey  guys  Quick question  So consumer electronics  can you comment if that continued to get worse from Q2  It sounds like auto is somewhat stabilized  but how would you characterize consumer electronics 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Well  I would say  consumer electronics has kind of played out as we expected this year based on what we told you in April  I think    if I think back and we certainly    we were unhappy to discover back at that time that our customers in consumer electronics  we re really looking at a very dry year  and I think we kind of had eyes on that and communicated at that point  And it s played out as we expected  So annual revenue from consumer electronics is on track to decline by roughly one third this year  And it represented 30  of our business in 2018  And it s particularly as a result of smartphone manufacturing  and the decline you ll see is most notable in our European region  followed by China and the rest of Asia  but it s certainly been a year of diminished investment  and I think that as we expected 
Michael Cikos    Needham   Company    Analyst
And just to confirm  you said    I think you said in the prepared remarks  it was down 50  year over year 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
So revenue for consumer electronics in Q3 declined by approximately 50  year on year or nearly  50 million  due particularly to smartphone manufacturing 
Michael Cikos    Needham   Company    Analyst

Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Ben Rose with Battle Road Research  Please proceed 
Ben Rose    Battle Road Research    Analyst
Yes  Hi  Robert and Susan  Rob  can you identify the industry of the customer in the logistics    for the logistics product 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
It s a large customer of ours in logistics  So you can assume it s either e commerce or retail 
Ben Rose    Battle Road Research    Analyst
Okay  Okay  I just wanted to be sure that   
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
It s not    it s not airport baggage handling or bridge tool  which might be the other thing  That s why you can see some large chunks of business  but that s not what it is 
Ben Rose    Battle Road Research    Analyst
Okay  And then just a question on Sualab s    are the customers today for their product  are they primarily the Korean OEM manufacturers  Do they have any penetration    meaningful penetration thus far outside of Korea 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  their main markets are in Korea and China and Vietnam  overall  and they re really with them  Chinese and Korean electronics or electronic components manufacturers doing inspection  And    but I    something we like about them is they re really    they  like us  really have close high level engineering relationships with senior engineers at those companies  So it s not    they re not trying to move that product through the OEM machine build there  It s being pulled by the end user who really    many of them are employing many thousands of visual inspectors and are looking to see better cost and performance out of that aspect of their business 
Ben Rose    Battle Road Research    Analyst
Okay  And sorry  just one final perhaps  Has the company actually validated the technology with the kind of reduction in visual inspectors that you mentioned earlier in the call in the order of hundreds or hundreds or thousands of visual inspectors being replaced by the technology 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Absolutely  Yes  yes  I don t think we would have acquired the company had we not done our due diligence on that for sure  right  Now there is    and we ourselves on Cognex before we met Sualab  see opportunities where our electronics customers really are very interested and have been previously unable to replace those visual inspectors with machine vision  And so  we re seeing a lot of interest from them as a result of this news 
Ben Rose    Battle Road Research    Analyst
Okay  Thank you 
Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Karen Lau with Gordon Haskett   Please proceed 
Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    Analyst
Hey  Thanks for taking my follow up  Rob  I m just curious on consumer electronics and    or maybe broadly  more in China  there s been stories about Chinese companies kind of future proofing their supply chain  I don t know if that s the right word to use  But just sort of in light of like blacklisting or all of a sudden  they get cut off from their US suppliers  I think that is more concentrated in like kind of chips manufacturing  that sort of thing  but I wasn t sure if you are seeing any of that sentiment in areas that you participate in China  Maybe you can talk a little bit about that 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  Karen  So the answer is we re looking for that  and we re really not seeing it among our customers  I can really only think of one instance that I ve heard of where a Chinese company    you didn t    and it s not a company we would    any of us would know readily  Didn t    was concerned that didn t want to do business with us because we were American  So that s not widespread  And I think what you re reading about is much more components and chips technology in that way  I think the other thing important to realize is our technology basically doesn t    isn t owned inside the US or sold from the US per se  right  in terms of how we re recognized by our customers  So I think that also somewhat insulates us from this  But clearly  what we ve seen with one of the largest and some companies where we might become unable to sell to them  if that was a real threat on a larger scale  that would be a big problem for us 
Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    Analyst
Okay  So nothing beyond far away that you re seeing that concerns you in terms of Chinese companies sourcing from suppliers from other geographies 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Correct 
Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    Analyst
Okay  Got it  Thank you 
Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen  Please proceed 
Joe Giordano    Cowen and Company    Analyst
Hey  Thanks for taking my follow ups here  On Sualab again I understand the geographic presence that bring in the engineering capabilities  Is this a fundamentally different products than BD or is this something that you foresee over time like one offering globally that s integrated as whenever you guys may call it or is it one thing or is it two kind of things 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi  Joe  And I should say  this is the last question I think we have time for  but I know I ll answer it  So a point from earlier  I think you might have asked the question what do we bring to Sualab  and I think what we do bring is a lot of customer relationships and a big sales footprint in the market  So I think I just still want to make that point  This is all    this is very much complementary  I think  for both companies and the synergies on the growth side for both of us working together  But your question related to what    can you repeat that again  I m sorry 
Joe Giordano    Cowen and Company    Analyst
Like  are these two fundamental    fundamentally different things ViDi and Sualab  or is this something that ultimately is like one team  one integrated product that Cognex offers 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  I m sorry  yes  So they re quite similar products  So deep learning software could do various functions  and we ve developed with ViDi certain functions that really relates more to our end markets where we ve been focused  particularly automotive and based on our geographical presence  right  And Sualab has some strong tools and capabilities that relate to Asian visual inspection  So similar but develops in different ways  right  I would    I would say that 
And then because they have a big footprint of engineers and application engineers in Asia  they have the ability to help unlock a lot of potential that we see in that market where we didn t have that capability  So they bring a lot of engineering and application capability  which could be applied to either ViDi or to Sualab  right  And then we have a big sales network where we have a pent up demand that they can help unlock  So that s kind of where the complementary parts of the business go  But the product itself  ViDi and Suakit are quite similar  There s quite a lot of overlap with quite a few complementary strengths around specific tools  capabilities  user interfaces and other key elements 
Joe Giordano    Cowen and Company    Analyst
That s very helpful  And if you don t mind  just like a one    you can answer it in two words if you want  but the medical  food and beverage  and consumer at verticals that we don t spend a lot of time talking about  do you expect those to be up this year 
Robert Willett    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  We do 
Joe Giordano    Cowen and Company    Analyst

Biogen   BIIB  gapped higher in July and consolidated for 3 weeks before a blow off top and Island reversal  This held in the original gap and has consolidated since  The end of last week saw price push over consolidation as the Bollinger Bands  expanded  Look for continuation to participate higher

L3 Technologies Inc  NYSE LLL 
L3 Technologies   LLL  peaked in January with the market then dropped back  It found support at the 100 day SMA in February and bounced  rising back to the prior high  A second drop in April was much more severe blowing through the 200 day SMA and finding support more than 15  lower  It started higher immediately and after two steps was back near the top at the end of July  It has held there consolidating in a tight range since  The RSI is in the bullish zone with the MACD trying to cross up and positive  Look for a push over resistance to participate   
3M  NYSE MMM

Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which with eight months in the books and the long Labor Day Weekend upon us sees the equity markets are waking up tanned and rested from their summer vacation 
Elsewhere look for Gold to possibly pause in its downtrend while Crude Oil resumes the path higher  The US Dollar Index is searching for support in a pullback while US Treasuries are in broad consolidation  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside with the former on the cusp of new 4 year lows 
Volatility looks to remain very low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s  Their charts are now showing strength on both the daily and weekly timeframes as all end august at monthly all time highs  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

122520,344035,CGNX,Cognex Gainsw On Better Than Expected Q2 Earnings,opinion,"Cognex Corporation  NASDAQ CGNX 
Cognex Corporation  a machine vision technology company yesterday reported their second quarter 2017 financial results 
CGNX reported second quarter earnings of  0 63 per share which beat analyst expectations of  0 55 per share  They also reported second quarter revenues of  172 9 million which beat analyst expectations of  169 9 million 
Cognex Corporation Founder and CEO s Comments

 What a great quarter   exclaimed   Founder and Chairman of Cognex   The highest quarterly revenue in Cognex s 36 year history came from growth across the broad factory automation market  Equally important is that we also set a new  and ridiculously high  level of profit  
 Activity at Cognex is at a higher level now than ever before   said   Chief Executive Officer of Cognex   We are seeing strong demand across a broad range of geographies and markets  It is very gratifying to see that our investments in engineering and sales continue to pay off    

CGNX Technical Analysis

CGNX opened trading yesterday at  95 57 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  94 80  CGNX closed trading yesterday at  95 06 and spiked up after market to  102 95  equivalent to a 8  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that we are in unchartered territory as with the spike up CGNX is now trading at all time highs  
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up CGNX had already been in an overall upward dating back to February 15th when it traded at  69 96  CGNX has a float of 82 64 million shares and traded 1 20 times the normal daily trading on Monday 
For  purposes  I would like to see CGNX open trading on Tuesday above  100 00 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 50 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

time  Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price Future OutperformersBasically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share

122524,344039,CGNX,4 Stocks To Buy With Solid Earnings Acceleration ,opinion,Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings  Consistent earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price Better than expected earnings results mostly lead to an uptick in the share price  Studies  however  have shown that a majority of successful stocks see acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement  Hence  earnings acceleration works even better in driving stock price Future OutperformersBasically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance The Winning

122526,344041,CGNX,Has The IBD 50 ETF Rediscovered Its Magic Touch ,opinion,"The IBD 50  NYSE FFTY  is the Investor s Business Daily s  flagship screen of leading growth stocks that gives you 50 companies showing strong relative price strength and top notch fundamentals   according to the publication s website 
The index uses the CAN SLIM methodology  which looks for companies with earnings growth  some sort of product service catalyst  industry leadership and conviction  CAN SLIM tends to produce a portfolio filled with higher growth  higher risk names 
It also boasts quite a track record of beating the S P 500 over time  Consider first this chart from the Investor s Business Daily site that details the index s performance from 2003 through the end of 2015 

The difference in average annual returns between the IBD 50 and the S P 500 is stunning  During the 12  year period between 2003 and 2015  the IBD 50 outperformed the broader market by almost 9  per year  caveat  the small print says that prior to 2011  calculations used the  top 50 stocks of the IBD 100  so there may be some posturing there  
So  investor interest was high when it was announced that Investor s Business Daily decided to work with Innovator Capital Management to bring the Innovator IBD 50 ETF  FFTY  to market  It s the first time that the IBD 50 would be an investable product 
But early investors into the fund didn t get the kind of performance they were hoping for  From the fund s launch in April 2015 through the end of 2016  the IBD 50 ETF actually lost 3 4  compared to an 11 1  gain for the S P 500  During that time  the S P 500 Value ETF  SPDR S P 500 Value  NYSE SPYV   outperformed the SPDR S P 500 Growth  NYSE SPYG  by roughly 450 basis points  The fund s fast growth style was out of favor  but its severe underperformance was especially disappointing by almost any standard 
2017  however  has been a different story  Fueled by a post election rally  growth is back in style and the Innovator IBD 50 Fund ETF    has capitalized  Year to date  the fund is up nearly 40   more than double the return of the S P 500 

So  what can we attribute the fund s comeback story to  Credit individual stock selection and appropriate sector weightings  Momentum has easily been the top performing smart beta factor this year  the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor  NYSE MTUM  is up more than 32    and the CAN SLIM methodology makes the IBD 50 ETF a strong momentum play  The first half of the year was powered by strong gains inNVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA   Cognex Corporation  NASDAQ CGNX  and Dave   Buster s Entertainment  NASDAQ PLAY   The second half benefited from a major overweight in tech stocks  the fund currently has nearly     of assets dedicated to the space  and enjoyed big gains from companies such as Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   Arista Networks  ANET  and Stamps com  STMP  

The fund has also benefited from avoiding underperforming sectors  Three of the year s biggest underperforming sectors   real estate  energy and consumer staples   have been virtually non existent in the portfolio  The 20  allocation to China  specifically in names such as Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and China Lodging Group Limited  NASDAQ HTHT  which have both doubled in 2017  has also fueled this year s gains 
Has the IBD 50 ETF regained its former glory  As long as the momentum factor is a market leader  I think the answer is yes  The fund s methodology seems to work well when the market s winds are at its back  Momentum was the poorest performer of the smart beta factors in 2016  which is probably a significant reason the fund underperformed  There are both believers and detractors in the CAN SLIM methodology  but it s shown it can work in the right situations  Its expense ratio of 0 80  is actually pretty reasonable for an actively managed fund  especially one that rebalances its holdings as frequently as this one does  As long as momentum remains in favor  this fund should continue to do well  but watch out for when the market s winds change 
The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ETF was unchanged in premarket trading Monday  Year to date  FFTY has gained 40 58   versus a 16 09  rise in the benchmark S P 500 index during the same period 
FFTY currently has an  of A  Strong Buy   and is ranked  23 of 36 ETFs in the  category ",2017-10-23,ETF Daily News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/has-the-ibd-50-etf-rediscovered-its-magic-touch-200220312,200220312
122552,344067,CGNX,Why Cognex  CGNX  Stock Might Be A Great Pick,opinion,One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Cognex Corporation   NASDAQ CGNX    This is because this security in the Electronics Testing Equipment space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity  and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  This is arguably taking place in the Electronics Testing Equipment space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 5 out of more than 250 industries  suggesting it is well positioned from this perspective  especially when compared to other segments out there Meanwhile  Cognex is actually looking pretty good on its own too  The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month  suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm s prospects in both the short and long term COGNEX CORP Price and Consensus   In fact  over the past month  current quarter estimates have risen from earnings of 29 cents per share to earnings of 30 cents per share  while current year estimates have risen from earnings of  1 52 per share to earnings of  1 58 per share  This has helped CGNX to earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   further underscoring the company s solid position  You can see  So  if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry  consider Cognex  Not only is its industry currently in the top third  but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late  suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Tale of the Tape  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-12-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-cognex-(cgnx)-stock-might-be-a-great-pick-200168702,200168702

122554,344069,CGNX,4 Momentum Picks To Fetch You Profits Fast,opinion,When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks Translated  one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift  Thus  this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast moving train  without fretting about valuations or growth prospects  But why does momentum strategy work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that the momentum strategy works  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking lossesand hence hold onto losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in the prices  On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things gain clarity  they tend to go with the flowand overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends  and thusopen up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over a long periodof time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you benefit fromboth long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would reflect some profit taking in the stock Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price  52 Weeks    Top  50  This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks This

122564,344079,CGNX,Is Cognex An Incredible Momentum Stock  3 Reasons Why CGNX Will Be Tough To Beat,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on Cognex Corporation   NASDAQ CGNX   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CGNX s status as a solid momentum stock below Short Term Price Change for Cognex A great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity  This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now  It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area With a one week price change of 3 51  compared to an industry average of 1 02   CGNX is certainly well positioned in this regard  The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large as well Longer Term Price Change for CognexWhile any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of CGNX  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 23 65  to 5 34  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 53 23   Clearly  CGNX is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors CGNX Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with CGNX as of late too Over the past two months  5 earning estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that 4 estimates have moved upwards with no downward revisions for the next year time frame too  These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago CGNX was expected to post earnings of  1 23 share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of  1 41 for the full year now  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors COGNEX CORP Price and Consensus   Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have CGNX as a security with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of  B  You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep CGNX on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Confidential from Zacks Beyond this Tale of the Tape  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-10-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-cognex-an-incredible-momentum-stock-3-reasons-why-cgnx-will-be-tough-to-beat-200156975,200156975

Our third quarter performance was impressive   Revenue grew significantly year on year as large opportunities drove growth well above our 20  long term target for factory automation  Operating margin expanded to 37  compared to 26  in the third quarter a year ago  reflecting the substantial leverage that incremental revenue has on our profitability  And  earnings per share were significantly higher than consensus expectations even when you exclude the  0 07 per share tax benefit from stock option exercises that we recognized during the quarter  We are pleased to see our hard work deliver such great results

122634,344149,CGNX,Will Ametek Inc Surprise This Earnings Season ,opinion,"AMTEK Inc  NYSE AME  is set to report second quarter 2014 results on Aug 5  Last quarter  it posted a 1 8  positive surprise  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Growth Factors This Past Quarter
Ametek reported better than expected first quarter results with both the top and bottom lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Sales were up 10  from the year ago quarter  primarily driven by solid execution of its four growth strategies  Additionally  strong core growth in combination with enhanced operational performance and positive synergies from recent acquisitions helped the company deliver strong results  Ametek recently completed the acquisition of Zygo Corporation  a provider of optical metrology solutions  high precision optics  and optical assemblies  which can be utilized across a broad range of scientific  manufacturing  and medical applications  The acquisition will be merged in its Ultra Precision Technologies Division within the Electronic Instruments Group  The acquisition will further ramp up Ametek s product line  strengthen its market position and boost the bottom line through revenue growth and effective operational activities  The company believes that strong execution of its four core growth strategies of operational excellence  global market expansion  new product development  and strategic acquisitions will continue to play an important role in driving its growth  This in combination with its excellent backlog and strong portfolio of businesses will help the company post better results in the upcoming quarter 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ametek will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 59 cents  Hence  the difference is 0 00  Zacks Rank  Ametek s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies  which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Charter Communications Inc  NASDAQ CHTR  with Earnings ESP of  271 43  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

Up Next  Bonus Idea

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Thursday which  heading into the first week of April the Equity markets are mixed with the IWM strong but the SPY and QQQ weaker and maybe ready for some short term downside 

Elsewhere look for Gold to bounce around 1200 as it consolidates while Crude Oil churns back in its consolidation channel  The US Dollar Index should generally move sideways but with an upward bias while US Treasuries are biased lower short term in their consolidation  The Shanghai Composite looks very strong and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  ARCA EEM  are getting jealous  and trying to join it to the upside 

Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts point to consolidation or even a downside bias for the SPY and QQQ  while the IWM seem the place to be  holding up well at the all time highs  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

122637,344152,CGNX,The Internet Of Things On The Factory Floor,opinion,"At the end of March  China s State Council  in essence the administration s cabinet  promulgated a new vision for Chinese industry     Made in China 2025   It hits the notes that one would expect  greener and more high tech  value added manufacturing is the centerpiece 
Notably  as China continues to move beyond its heavy industry led growth model  the new program for industry is focused especially on the internet of things and its integration into manufacturing and the supply chain 
Sectors singled out for special attention in the plan include information technology  automation  green vehicles  and biotechnology  The Premier noted   China s traditional manufacturing industry must improve its quality  become greener and more intelligent  as well as adapting to the trend of being increasingly integrated with the internet   To us  that was a call to integrate the factory with the internet of things  IoT   a development we have discussed several times in these pages 
China s move parallels other high level strategies elsewhere along the same lines  such as Germany s 2013  Industrie 4 0   which explicitly invokes the theme of the internet as a  fourth industrial revolution   after steam  electricity  and assembly line production   The U S  government has jumped on board with its own Supply Chain Innovation Initiative  aiming to support the same developments    automation  advanced sensors  secure supply chain management  process optimization through big data capture and analytics  cloud computing  etc 
The head of global business development for NXP Semiconductors NV  NASDAQ NXPI  recently commented that industry is  in the early stages  of an integration of the IoT into manufacturing  NXPI s near field communication and security chips are in demand for the development of smart factories  and the company is forging ties with Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei Technology Co Ltd  SZ 002502  
For now  investors can seek exposure to companies like Huawei only through the limited number of ETFs holding Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks    and since these tech companies are the most richly valued of any mainland stocks  they will certainly be vulnerable to volatility and corrections  even as the mainland bull market continues  ETFs holding Shenzhen tech stocks include the Deutsche X trackers Harvest CSI 500 China A Shares Small Cap ETF  NYSE  ASHS  and the Market Vectors China AMC SME ChiNext ETF  NYSE  CNXT  
We continue especially to watch large U S  and European companies for exposure to the theme of smart manufacturing and the IoT  At this juncture  we would wait for a correction in the U S  and European markets to initiate a position 
 Investment implications  We view companies such as Siemens AG NA  XETRA SIEGn   ABB Ltd  SIX ABBN   Honeywell International Inc  NYSE HON   Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO   and Rockwell Automation Inc  NYSE ROK  favorably for this theme  An interesting smaller company in the  smart factory  space is Cognex Corporation  NASDAQ CGNX   which focuses on machine vision systems in manufacturing  Speculative names include companies like Splunk Inc  NASDAQ SPLK   which focuses on generating actionable information from machine data  While we believe these technologies will be integral to the transformation of manufacturing underway in the U S   Europe  Japan  and China  exposure to smaller  richly valued companies comes with a commensurate level of risk  We do not currently own any of these companies except Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  ",2015-05-10,Monty Guild,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-internet-of-things-on-the-factory-floor-251195,251195
