93983,315498,MRVL,Day Ahead   Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Salesforce  Marvell Tech Earnings in Focus
Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  will report third quarter earnings after the market closes on Tuesday 
Ahead of the report  many expect its recent acquisitions will likely have boosted Salesforce s enterprise software revenue 
With the recent addition of MuleSoft and Tableau  sales are expected to have topped  4 45 billion in the third quarter  up from  3 39 billion a year ago  and  4 billion in the second quarter 
Salesforce is expected to report earnings of 66 cents a share  up from 61 cents a share a year ago  according to consensus estimates from Investing com 
Marvell Technology  NASDAQ MRVL   meanwhile  also reports after the closing bell  with analysts expecting the chipmaker to report earnings of 17 cents per share on about  660 million in revenue  down from 33 cents a year ago on revenue of  851 million 
The earnings report comes at a fraught time for chipmakers as U S  China trade relations have soured  cooling expectations that both nations will sign the phase one trade deal sooner rather than later 
The company previously lowered its guidance for the third quarter and warned of a worsening macro environment along with the ongoing impact from the current restrictions on shipments to Huawei 
The restrictions on U S  companies shipping supplies to Huawei  however  have since been lifted and extended until Feb  16  2020 
Beyond trade issues  the revival in data center spending and the earlier than expected first production shipments of 5G solutions will likely alleviate headwinds from the U S  China trade war 
2  Update on NY Business Condition  Vehicles Sales Due
The economic calendar is light on Tuesday  with an update on business conditions in New York due at 9 45 AM ET  14 45 GMT  and U S  total vehicle sales due at 6 PM ET  23 00 GMT  
The ISM NY Business Conditions Index is expected to have declined to 44 7  last month from 47 7  in October 
U S  total vehicle sales will also be in focus after data last month showed the U S  sold an annualized 16 8 million units in November  up from 16 6 million units in October but down from an annualized 17 5 million units in November 2018 
3  API Crude Inventories Data on Tap
The American Petroleum Institute s petroleum data is due after the closing bell on Tuesday 
The API last week reported domestic crude oil inventories for the week ended Nov  29  rose by 3 6 million barrels 
Oil prices in recent sessions have been driven by the ongoing trade dispute between the U S  China and bets on whether OPEC will announce further production cuts at this week s meeting  The Vienna meeting starts Thursday  
OPEC and its allies have been cutting output for three years in a struggle to get rid of a supply glut so prices can be steadied  Their current deal to cut production by 1 2 million barrels a day began in January and expires at the end of March

94040,315555,MRVL,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  March 8 
1  European Central Bank Policy Meeting
The European Central Bank is all but certain to keep policy unchanged at the conclusion of today s meeting at 1245GMT  7 45AM ET   but it may tweak its communication stance to offer at least a few clues about its progress toward ending its unprecedented bond purchases later this year 
President Mario Draghi will hold what will be a closely watched press conference 45 minutes after the rate announcement  How he views signs of undershooting inflation and any hints on when the central bank plans to end its  2 5 trillion stimulus program will be important 
The ECB will also unveil new macroeconomic projections  but sources familiar with the matter said they are unlikely to offer many surprises as growth and inflation are broadly on the same path as before 
Concerned over low inflation  a strong euro  rising political risk and recent market volatility  officials prefer waiting  perhaps as late as the summer  before starting to signal the end of asset buys 
The central bank cut its monthly bond purchases from  60 billion to  30 billion back in October  but extended the program until the end of September 2018  citing muted price pressures 
The euro was 0 2  lower against the dollar  with EUR USD at 1 2385  after retracing a bounce to a 2 1 2 week peak of 1 2447 on Wednesday 
2  Trump To Make Formal Announcement On Tariffs
Amid growing pressure to exempt U S  allies  President Donald Trump is expected to sign an order to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports during a ceremony scheduled for 3 30PM ET  2030 GMT  
Trump plans to offer Canada and Mexico a 30 day exemption from the tariffs  which could be extended based on progress in talks on amending the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   a White House official said on Wednesday night 
That raised hopes that the tariffs may be less onerous than feared  easing nerves over a full blown global trade war 
The moves came as more than 100 Republican House members sent an urgent letter to the White House pressing for Trump to change course 
The proclamation signing would cap a tumultuous week in the White House  where advisers have been sparring over the direction of U S  trade policy  with the tariffs handing a victory to the nationalist wing led by adviser Peter Navarro and playing a part in Tuesday s resignation of Gary Cohn  director of the National Economic Council 
3  Global Stocks Tick Up With ECB Policy  Trump Tariffs In Focus

European markets and U S  futures started Tuesday in the red as International Monetary Fund  IMF  chief Christine Lagarde urged global policymakers to prepare contingency measures in case downside risks to the global economy materialize  dampening risk appetite 
Lagarde appeared to attempt to minimize the alarmist tendency at her lecture in Frankfurt  assuring listeners that the recovery continued and insisting that the world was not in crisis  The not so good news is that the recovery remains too slow  too fragile  and risks to its durability are increasing   she said 
The U S  trade deficit did little to improve investor sentiment stateside as it widened to its highest level since last August  The read caused the likes of  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  or  Barclays   LON BARC  to cut their forecasts for growth in the American economy during the first quarter by 30 basis points to 0 5  and 0 4   respectively 
In positive economic news  service sector activity did serve to pare the losses on Wall Street as the ISM non manufacturing PMI bounced back from near a two year low in March  coming in slightly above forecasts 
Ahead of the publication of the Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday and an appearance by the head of the U S  central bank Janet Yellen on Thursday  Fed futures were pricing in zero possibility of a rate increase at the April meeting  with December now the first month with at least even odds of higher borrowing costs 
However  Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren warned on Monday that markets were mistaken in assuming a maximum of one rate hike or even none at all this year 
On Tuesday  Chicago Fed chief Charles Evans gave a similar view  repeating his call for two hikes in 2016 and stating that  financial market expectations are more pessimistic than  the Fed s   
Meanwhile  oil seesawed throughout the session as investors placed bets on whether the April 17 meeting of major oil producers in Doha will lead to any concrete measures to solve the global supply glut 
Market players looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U S  stockpiles of crude that are expected to reach new record highs  The American Petroleum Institute will release its inventories report later in the day  while Wednesday s government report could show crude stockpiles rose by 3 3 million barrels in the week ended April

 The debt crisis escalated this week as Moody s Investors
Service said it may cut the credit ratings of French banks 
citing exposure to Greek debt  Late Friday  Moody s said it was
reviewing Italy s sovereign credit ratings for a possible
downgrade 
  The question now in many people s minds is whether or not
a credit event in Europe  the ripple effect  will be strong
enough to put the U S  economy in a recession  I honestly don t
see that   said Natalie Trunow  chief investment officer of
equities of Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda 
Maryland  which manages about  14 8 billion

dots between the sovereign debt crisis and the potential impact

Yet market players kept the Federal Reserve in the background as decreased expectations for rate hikes this year pared gains in the dollar on Monday  The U S  Dollar Index  that compares the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies  inched forward 0 02  to 97 27  EUR USD dropped 0 10  to 1 0995  but USD JPY slipped 0 13  to 113 63  and GBP USD advanced 0 07  to 1 4237 
A National Association of Business Economics   NABE  survey released on Monday revealed that 80  of the 252 economists surveyed did still expect at least one rate hike in 2016  Broken down  39  said they expect the Fed to raise rates twice this year  24  forecast just one increase and 17  were placing bets on at least three 
Though NABE President Lisa Emsbo Mattingly said that a large and growing majority still expect rate hikes this year  she noted that  respondents on balance expect fewer increases in 2016 than they had predicted in the August 2015 survey  
Traders will pay attention to speeches from a pair of Fed officials on Monday to attempt to judge the balance of opinion among policymakers on the prospect of further rate hikes

94112,315627,MRVL,U S  futures lose ground as markets digest Fed and wait for data,news,"Investing com   U S  futures pointed to a lower open on Thursday as markets continued to take stock of the Federal Reserve s  Fed  dovish stance on monetary policy and waited for a slew of economic data to be released later in the day 
The blue chip Dow futures fell 67 points  or 0 39   by 11 03AM GMT  or 7 03AM ET  the S P 500 futures lost 8 points  or 0 40   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 20 points  or 0 46  
The Fed not only kept interest rates unchanged as expected but scaled back predictions for rate hikes this year to just two compared to the previous forecast of four citing that  global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks  
The decision came as Fed members also lowered growth and inflation forecasts and Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated she was not convinced that the recent uptick in prices was a return to an uptrend  insisting that  caution is appropriate  when considering interest rate hikes 
Accompanying the dovish stance  it may be worth noting that the decision was not unanimous as Kansas Fed president Esther George preferred to raise rates in 25 basis points to a range of between 0 5  and 0 75  
The market appeared to consider that the first rate hike could still come in June  though  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  pointed out that the probability had shrunk to  well below 50   compared to the more than 50  chance before the meeting and traders of interest rate futures now seeing no rate rise before September 
The dollar reacted to the news dropping to 5 months lows and continued its descent on Thursday  The U S  dollar index which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  was down 0 87  at 94 87 at 11 05AM GMT  or 7 05AM ET  while EUR USD rallied 0 88  to 1 1324  GBP USD rose 0 59  to 1 4343 and USD JPY lost 1 13  to 111 28

The data releases due Thursday include Fed Chair Janet Yellen s preferred indicator on the labor market  the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for January 
Other U S  economic reports due Thursday include weekly jobless claims  the Philadelphia Fed survey for March  February leading indicators and fourth quarter current account data 
Oil prices continued to climb to 3 month highs after bullish weekly supply data  an agreement by global oil producers to meet next month to discuss an output freeze and a broadly weaker U S  dollar as a result of a surprisingly dovish Fed all contributed to strong gains 
U S  crude futures rose 1 69  to  39 11by 11 06AM GMT or 7 06AM ET  while Brent oil traded up 1 46  to  40 92

94128,315643,MRVL,Marvell  MRVL  To Post Q2 Earnings  What Lies In Store ,opinion,Marvell Technology Group Ltd    NASDAQ MRVL   is set to report second quarter fiscal 2020 results on Aug 29 The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters  and missed it twice  the average negative surprise being 2 93  In the fiscal first quarter  non GAAP earnings of 16 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents  However  it declined 50  from the year ago quarter Marvell s revenues increased 9 6  year over year to  662 5 million  and surpassed the consensus estimate of  650 million Strong growth in networking business led to the top line improvement  However  due to the export restriction  which was implemented early in the quarter  both networking and revenues were affected Marvell Technology Group Ltd  Price and EPS Surprise   What to Expect in Q2 Marvell projects second quarter fiscal 2020 revenues of  650 million  up or down up to 3  The company anticipates non GAAP earnings per share in the band of 13 17 cents The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  649 78 million  indicating a decrease of 2 33  from the year ago reported figure  The consensus mark for earnings is 15 cents  suggesting a decline of 46 43  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayMarvell expects the decline in demand from its wireless base station customers  as they prepare to transition from 4G to 5G products later this year  to affect fiscal second quarter revenues from its embedded processors Furthermore  delay in talks of a trade deal between the United States and China  which continues to affect the overall chip industry  is likely to be an overhang on Marvell s fiscal second quarter performance  This is because of the company s significant dependence on semiconductor sales for revenues Demand for Marvell Storage Controllers is expected to be soft due to continued weak macroeconomic conditions  Impact of the export restrictions and accounting for the customer factory transition is expected to lead to an approximate mid single digit sequential decline in storage revenues for the quarter Revenues from networking are expected to decline slightly sequentially due to the export restriction Moreover  management expects non GAAP gross margin to be between 63  and 64   reflecting a weaker product mix due to the impact of export restriction and low storage revenues  Additionally  the Huawei ban has led the company to expect zero shipments to the telecom equipment maker in the fiscal second quarter and thereafter  This is likely to further affect the product mix and put pressure on margins  However  a seasonal customer based product ramp is expected to be a tailwind for the margins for the quarter to be reported Moreover  the worldwide  has shown signs of turnaround in the second quarter of calendar 2019 after witnessing a slowdown in shipment in the last two quarters  This is likely to take the steam off the headwinds in the demand for the company s storage controllers for the to be reported quarter Marvell s core switch  PHY and OCTEON family of high end embedded processors are expected to sustain the uptrend  The company s automotive Ethernet business is also gaining traction Moreover  the Cavium business is expected to be accretive to the company s fiscal second quarter top line by attracting design wins  Besides  with successful integration of the Cavium business completed in the fiscal first quarter  Marvell expects to reach its operating expenses

94158,315673,MRVL,Infineon To Acquire Cypress  Semi Sector Consolidating,opinion,"Cypress Semiconductor Corp   NASDAQ CY   is up roughly 25  this morning after news was released of a  9 4 billion deal with Infineon Technology s   OTC IFNNY    Infineon s investors aren t as enthusiastic  with IFNNY down over 8  today 
Infineon will be paying CY investors  23 85 a share  representing an almost 50  premium from its 30 day median price  Infineon investors are concerned that the synergies created by the economies of scale and scope of this acquisition will not be worth the significant premium  The semiconductor business is exceptionally cyclical and is expected to be in decline for the remainder of the year  As you can see below  EPS estimates are projected to be negative until Q1 2020 
 
Infineon s acquisition of Cypress is expected to create economies of scale that amount to roughly  200 million in annual cost reduction by 2022 and more than  1 5 billion in additional long term revenue  The combined business will be the  1 automotive chip company and the 8th largest semiconductor firm in the world  making the new Infineon a chip force to be reckoned with  Vehicles are getting smarter and the technology that goes into them is becoming increasingly in demand 
The acquisition will not only broaden Infineon s portfolio  create economies of scale and scope  but it will also expand its customer base and distribution  This international acquisition will improve the German Infineon s ability to operate in the largest consumer market in the world  The US  
Above you can see a visual that Infineon put together to illustrate the synergies to investors  85  of Cypress s R D budget is currently going toward automotive and connectivity chips  As you can see the connectivity segment is expected to unlock the door to the digital world for their products  allowing billions of devices to connect on a  smart  level 
The combined portfolio of products will be quite diversified  giving the new business a little more of a hedge to the cyclical nature of the semi sector 

 
The biggest concern with this acquisition is the multiple at which Infineon is purchasing Cypress  Buying the firm for  9 4 billion or a roughly  10 billion enterprise value puts CY s EV EBITDA above 16x  which is more than double Infineon s current multiple  This poses a lot of risk for IFNNY investors  especially when the equity market is already quite volatile 
Relative Performance
Above is a 52 week relative performance chart comparing CY  blue  and IFNNY  red   As you can see these stocks tracked together until February when CY began to outperform IFNNY  This acquisition has accentuated the performance gap 
Semiconductor Industry
The economies of scale and economies to scope make the semiconductor sector ripe for consolidation  Like I mentioned above  a broaden chip portfolio will allow these firms to smooth out the sharp cyclicality that the semiconductor industry is prone to 
NXP   NASDAQ NXPI   just agreed to acquire Marvell Technology   NASDAQ MRVL   for  1 76 billion in cash  strengthening the firm s position in connectivity chips  On Semiconductor   NASDAQ ON   purchased Quantenna Communications   NASDAQ QTNA   back in March for  1 1 billion  The acquisition is anticipated to increase On s automotive   connectivity position  Both of these acquisitions may have been a prerequisite for Infineon s purchase of Cypress which would give the combined firm a strong positioning in both automotive and connectivity 
Since the end of April  the semiconductor industry has lost over 20  in market value  substantially underperforming the S P 500  The reignited trade tensions have been pulling these stocks further down then the rest of the market because of their international exposure  Right now is not a bad time for an acquisition because of ostensibly discounted multiples  The semiconductor industry is trading below its 5 year median forward P E and PEG 
Take Away
The chip making sector is always shifting and in order for these firms to quickly pivot to consumer needs a broader portfolio scope is needed  Consolidation in this industry is inevitable with apparent economies of scale  it is just a matter of balancing price and added synergies in order to create value for shareholders

94238,315753,MRVL,3  Internet Of Things  Stocks To Buy Right Now ,opinion,"Tech stocks have been unpredictable lately  but there are a number of new secular trends which investors are looking to remain exposed to in the long term  Of these  easily the most exciting for certain semiconductor companies  gadget makers  and telecom firms is the Internet of Things 
For those that don t know  the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices  Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices 
For example  consumer level IoT products include things like Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   Echo  smart speaker   wearable motion and activity tracking products  and advanced in car technology  On the commercial side of the IoT market  industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency 
 Also Read    
The obvious play here for investors is semiconductor stocks  as chipmakers should be able to benefit from the growth of connected devices  But chip stocks have been sluggish recently  Wall Street is projecting an end to the extended cycle of strength for the industry  and investors are worried about headwinds such as demand and pricing 
Still  there is room for niche semiconductor firms to maintain their growth as the Internet of Things continues to blossom  And there are other ways to profit from IoT growth by maintaining a focus on other pieces of the technology that helps the network function 
With that said  we ve found three stocks which have been flagged by the Zacks Rank that could be poised for further IoT growth soon 
1  Marvell Technology Group Ltd     NASDAQ MRVL   
Marvell Technology is a leading designer  developer and supplier of mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits  The company s  EZ Connect  platform is used by a variety of global customers in the home automation  wearables  automotive  and industrial industries  MRVL is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Marvell offers direct exposure to several IoT adjacent markets  is comfortably profitable  and looks to have already turned the corner of the  peak to trough  process hitting semi stocks at the end of their growth cycles  EPS growth is expected to finish at 5  for the fiscal year ending this month  and that s projected to take back off again to the tune of 16  in the upcoming year 
The stock has a PEG ratio of 1 41  so you re getting a good price for that EPS growth  Moreover  Marvell is seeing remarkable revenue growth  Sales will likely improve more than 31  in the next two quarters  Full year revenue for the next fiscal year is expected to surge 16   and that s on top of 21  growth this year 
 
2  STMicroelectronics N V     NYSE STM   
STMicroelectronics is a French Italian semiconductors company  It develops circuits and discretes that are used in microelectronic devices  STM specifically markets its tiny  low power technology for use in a wide range of Internet of Things products  Shares are holding a  1  Strong Buy  and look to have found a supportive bottom after pulling back for much of the past year 
The stock has already surged nearly 20  from its 52 week low  and the value case is still easy to make  STM is trading at just 10 5x earnings  which is a steep discount to the industry s 13x  It also has a reasonable P S of 1 3  This is also something with long term growth potential  as analysts have its annualized EPS growth rate over the next three to five years pegged at 5  right now 
 
3  Verizon Communications Inc     NYSE VZ   
Moving away from the chip stocks  Verizon is also a solid  stable option for IoT and 5G exposure  You might be seeing headlines recently about the telecom giant s rivals launching their first 5G networks  but Verizon would kindly remind you that it was first to market with the new standard  This is a large part of the reason Verizon has one of the more exciting growth opportunities among the major telecoms 
Full year earnings growth in the current fiscal year is expected to reach 25   with long term annualized growth projected at 4   The stock is still relatively cheap at just 11 9x earnings  Income investors also love its 4 2  dividend yield

rising interest rates  International Business Machines Corp    NYSE IBM    a renowned player in this space  is no exception to the trend  Year to date  the stock has lost almost 26 3   compared with the  s decline of 20 6  Let s take a look at the factors that impacted the company s performance and see if there are any chances of revival ahead What s Affecting IBM s Performance IBM has been witnessed a year over year decline in its top line in third quarter 2018  Revenues of  18 76 billion declined 2 1  year over year  Cognitive Solutions  revenues external decreased 5 7  year over year to  4 15 billion  Revenues from Technology Services   Cloud Platforms external decreased 2  from the year ago quarter to  8 29 billion The inconsistent revenue growth  slow transition to cloud  increasing competition  and softness in cognitive solutions and technology   cloud platforms have been the primary reasons behind the company s dismal showing IBM is under tremendous pressure owing to its time consuming business model transition  which is negatively impacting results  Despite significant investments  the company is yet to gain a strong foothold in the Infrastructure as a Service  IaaS   Platform as a Service  PaaS  and Hosted private cloud market  Intensifying competition in most of the markets is a major concern for the company Moreover  IBM s continuing investments and pricing pressure related to its legacy hardware business is a concern  We believe the underperforming legacy business segments will remain an overhang on the company s bottom line till the business model transition  which is heavily time consuming  is completed Additionally  ballooning debt levels have been troubling IBM over time  At the end of third quarter  net debt amounted to  32 2 billion compared with  33 6 billion reported in the previous quarter Moreover  from a valuation perspective  the stock looks very unattractive as it currently trades significantly higher than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate  which reflects a huge downward possibility  The company currently has a trailing 12 month Price Earnings  P E  ratio of 8 43  This is quite high compared with the current P E for the industry that is pegged at 7 30 IBM s Efforts to Gain GroundIBM s growing presence in the enterprise artificial intelligence   AI   market on the back of an increasing clientele bodes well  Moreover  the company is benefiting from strong demand for z14 Mainframe and Power products  Its improving clout in the cloud  security and analytics remains a tailwind Additionally  blockchain has steadily gained prominence and is an integral part of IBM s product offerings  IBM has also undertaken a number of blockchain initiatives to capitalize on growth opportunity in the industry IBM s significant investments in  Strategic Imperatives    cloud computing  mobile  analytics  cognitive technologies and security is adding to the positives The traction witnessed by the company s Watson offerings and IBM Cloud is anticipated to drive growth IBM has recently entered in a definitive agreement to divest seven software products to HCL Technologies for approximately  1 8 billion  The solutions are estimated to have a total addressable market  TAM  exceeding  50 billion  The move is in sync with IBM s increasing focus on bolstering its hybrid cloud business  Further  IBM will gain  1 8 billion by divesting the software products  This is anticipated to improve the company s cash position  which is crucial at this point of time Further  IBM recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Red Hat for approximately  34 billion in cash  With Red Hat s synergies  IBM believes the company will be able to fast track growth in the hybrid cloud space  Will IBM Rebound in 2019 Although the company is undertaking a number of initiatives to counter the aforementioned challenges  its impact on quarterly results has not been significant Moreover  all the efforts are at a very nascent stage and will take time to contribute meaningfully to top line growth  This is a significant headwind in our view  Further  the stock

fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results  Quarterly revenues and earnings not only came ahead of the mid point of the company s guided ranges but also beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate Additionally  the top and bottom lines marked a significant year over year improvement  Per the company  this growth stemmed from better sales execution and efficient cost management Marvell president and CEO Matt Murphy stated in a press release that  Our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year results continue to demonstrate that Marvell s strategy is working and that our team is executing it very well  Quarter DetailsMarvell s revenues increased 8 7  year over year to  615 4 million surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  611 6 million  Moreover  reported revenues came ahead of the mid point of management s guided range of  595  625 million  mid point  610 million  In the end markets  storage revenues  53  of total revenues  grew 4  year over year and 3  sequentially on better than expected demand at the SSD  Solid State Drive  segments  along with elevated demand from enterprise and data center operators The networking business  25   increased 5  year over year and 3  sequentially mainly due to increase in the network of processor product line  i e  switch  PHY and embedded Revenues from connectivity  14   climbed 31  year over year  primarily driven by solid demand for  high end voice enabled  and home media streaming applications  However  sequentially  the segment s revenues slipped 16   Other product  8   revenues during the quarter grew 20  year over year and 5  sequentially Marvell Technology Group Ltd  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Marvell s non GAAP gross profit came in at  383 1 million  up 17  on a year over year basis  Gross margin also increased from 57 8  to 62 3  on a year over year basis  primarily buoyed by a favorable product mix and higher revenue base  Gross margin also came in marginally higher than management s expectation of 62  Non GAAP operating expenses rose 2 4  year over year to  217 6 million and were within the company s expectations of  215  220 million  As a percentage of revenues  operating expenses contracted 210 basis points to 35 4   Marvell s non GAAP operating margins came in at 26 9  compared with 20 3  reported in the year ago quarter  The results were positively influenced by higher gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues The company reported non GAAP net income of approximately  164 8 million during the quarter as compared with  118 4 million reported in the prior year quarter  On per share basis  non GAAP earnings came in at 32 cents  up 45 5  from the year earlier quarter s earnings of 22 cents  Quarterly non GAAP earnings also came ahead of the mid point of management guided range of 29 33 cents  mid point 31 cents  as well as beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny Balance SheetMarvell exited the quarter with cash  cash

projected to come between 22 cents and 26 cents per share Our TakeMarvell ended fiscal 2018 on an impressive note  reporting better than expected results for the fourth quarter  Furthermore  the company provided encouraging fiscal first quarter earnings guidance Though macro headwinds and stringent regulations might put its financials under pressure in the near term  we believe strong demand for Marvell s 4G LTE products will act as a catalyst  This will be supported by growth from the company s wide range of the recently launched Internet of Things  IoT  solutions In an effort to expand offerings beyond hard disk drives to high growth areas such as data centers and wireless communications  Marvell entered into an agreement to acquire Cavium in the last quarter  This buyout will provide the company an opportunity to expand its offerings and access newer markets The company s current restructuring initiative will help Marvell improve cloud infrastructure and applications  which are projected to drive the top line  The latest buyback scheme also reflects sound financial position and favorable prospects Nonetheless  intensifying competition in the High Definition  HD  storage drive market makes us increasingly cautious about the stock s prospects  In the HD storage drive market  Broadcom   NASDAQ AVGO   is Marvell s main competitor as these two are the primary SoC  system on a chip  suppliers  Also  NXP Semiconductors  QUALCOMM   NASDAQ QCOM   and Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  offer various components to the market Given the fact that Broadcom has been trying to acquire Qualcomm  while the latter is already in process to buy NXP Semiconductor  the former will become a bigger entity  along with enhanced capabilities  which can supply SoCs as well as components  This might dampen Marvell s long term prospects Therefore  despite the company s strong quarterly results  Marvell s shares declined roughly 3  during yesterday s after hour trade  The stock has unperformed the  to which it belongs to in the year to date period  Marvell has gained 12   while the industry recorded growth of 12 7

94348,315863,MRVL,3  Internet Of Things  Stocks To Buy For 2018,opinion,"One of the strongest corners of the market in 2017 was the semiconductor industry  and we expect that trend to continue into the New Year  Throughout the chip making space  companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer  including an increased demand for small  high powered chips that enable  Internet of Things   IoT  devices 
For those that don t know  the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices  Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices 
For example  consumer level IoT products include things like Amazon s  AMZN  Echo  smart speaker   wearable motion and activity tracking products  and advanced in car technology  On the commercial side of the IoT market  industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency 
 Also Read    
As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow  semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit  And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers  with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth 
With that said  we ve found three already strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018 
1        Texas Instruments    NASDAQ TXN   
Although you might recognize the brand because of its calculators  Texas Instruments is actually one of the leading suppliers of advanced semiconductors in the world  The company s IoT profile falls under its Embedded Processors division  which includes the Connectivity  Microcontrollers  and Processors categories 
In its most recent earnings report  Texas Instruments saw growth of 17  in its Embedded Processors unit  while segment operating profit climbed 45  and that s not to mention that TXN once again surpassed our consensus estimates for earnings and revenue  Texas Instruments is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   putting it near the top of the  Semiconductor   General  group  which is currently in the top 6  of the Zacks Industry Rank 
 
2        STMicroelectronics N V     NYSE STM   
STMicroelectronics is a French Italian semiconductors company that develops circuits and discrete devices for use in microelectronic devices  The company specifically tailors its tiny  low power technology for use in a wide range of Internet of Things products  The stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
The story for STM is aggressive earnings growth  Our consensus estimates call for earnings to expand by 38  in fiscal 2018  and that s on top of a staggering 217  projected explosion in 2017  Revenues are growing too  as the firm s top line is expected to swell by more than 10  this year  Meanwhile  the stock is trading at just 19x forward earnings and 2 75x sales  so investors are getting a decent price for those profits and revenues right now 
 
3        Marvell Technology    NASDAQ MRVL   
Marvell Technology is a leading designer  developer and supplier of mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits  The company s  EZ Connect  platform is used by a variety of global customers in the home automation  wearables  automotive  and industrial industries  MRVL is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Marvell is an exciting growth pick  as the firm is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 16  over the next three to five years  The stock also has a PEG ratio of just 1 39  which means that this earnings growth could be undervalued  Marvell also operates with a better than industry average net margin of 16 5  and RoE of 12   so investors can trust that the firm operates efficiently and delivers value to shareholders 
 
Bottom Line
The Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world   And while these specific products are interesting  the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products  The Internet of Things needs semiconductors to function  and as the IoT grows  so too will semiconductor companies 
The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify semiconductor companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things  but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics

94370,315885,MRVL,5 Best Efficient Stocks To Buy In 2018,opinion,Efficiency  which is the ability to transform inputs into outputs  is a potential indicator of a company s financial health  Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions  This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company s price performance Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks  These efficiency ratios are Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a four quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales  which resulted in excess inventory Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four quarter average of total assets  Like the above ratios  high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient Operating Margin  This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers     The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 16 Here are five stocks from the 14 that made it through the screen Lululemon Athletica Inc    NASDAQ LULU   designs  distributes  and retails athletic apparel and accessories for women

94435,315950,MRVL,Beat The Market With These 4 Momentum Picks,opinion,It has been two decades since academics zeroed in on what we today call the  momentum effect  in stock markets  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift  Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles  this strategy has barely anything to do with the fundamentals of a company  and instead works with the human penchant to extrapolate current trends into the future At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  Why Does Momentum Strategy Work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back to their original prices  On the other hand  investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum versus Other StylesIt is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares to other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has also declined radically since the 1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  becomes known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes However  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s Chase the AlphaMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you take advantage of both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would

Though the US withdrawal from the TPP agreement dismantles a key Obama legacy  when asked yesterday about his   Trump said he would approach it  at the appropriate time   It s one thing to pull out of a not yet ratified agreement such as TPP but an entirely different endeavor to renegotiate a longstanding trade deal  If the new President delays tackling NAFTA  the dollar could get some breathing room

ISM services sector report unexpectedly improves
The February Institute for Supply Management  ISM  non Manufacturing Index surprisingly rose to 57 6  the highest since October 2015  from January s unrevised 56 5 level  where the Bloomberg forecast called for it to remain  A reading above 50 denotes expansion  New orders improved to 61 2 and employment ticked higher to 55 2  while prices declined to 57 7  The ISM said comments from respondents continued to be mixed  with some uncertainty  however  the majority indicated a positive outlook on business conditions and the overall economy 
The final Markit U S  Services PMI Index was revised to 53 8 in February from the preliminary 53 9 level  versus estimates of a 54 0 reading  and compared to the 55 6 figure posted in January  However  a reading above 50 depicts expansion  The release is independent and differs from ISM s report  as it has less historic value and Markit weights its index components differently 
Economic data has continued to beat expectations  but the number of upside surprises may start to level off  That doesn t mean things are getting worse  just that expectations are catching up with the improvements in the data  which could have a dampening impact on investor enthusiasm in the near term  However  ultimately  we believe fiscal stimulus is coming  although perhaps later than anticipated  and the bull market in U S  stocks will continue 
Treasuries were nearly unchanged  with the yields on the 2 year and 10 year notes  as well as the 30 year bond flat at 1 31   2 48  and 3 07   respectively  Bond yields paused from a recent rally  while the U S  dollar pulled back from a run as of late and the stock markets were flat after yesterday s retreat from all time highs 
With expectations of a possible Fed rate hike later this month jumping this week in the wake of continued strong economic data and commentary from Central Bank members  the markets focused on Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen s speech on the economic outlook  where she noted that the economy has exhibited remarkable resilience and is close to meeting the Fed s goals of maximum employment and price stability  These comments appeared to preserve elevated rate hike expectations 
Europe mixed  Asia lower
European equities finished mixed  with financials gaining ground as bond yields in the region and the U S  extend rallies  bolstered by boosted expectations of a possible rate hike in the U S  later this month  The markets awaited today s speech from U S  Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen today  Also  eurozone political risk continued to fester as a key French Presidential election looms 
In economic news  Markit s final  Eurozone Composite PMI Index a gauge of business activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors was unrevised at 56 0 for February  matching expectations and above the 54 4 level posted in January  A reading above 50 denotes expansion  Markit s U K  Composite PMI Index showed although activity decelerated  it remained in expansion territory  The euro was higher and the British pound dipped versus the U S  dollar 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly lower on the heels of the drop in the U S  markets from all time highs  amid the backdrop of heightened expectations of a possible rate hike in the nation later this month  while the markets awaited today s speech from U S  Fed Chair Janet Yellen 
Japanese equities declined  with the yen recovering from a recent slide and as data showed household spending dropped more than expected in January  though the nation s core consumer price inflation unexpectedly rose  Chinese stock markets traded lower  continuing to pare recent rallies that have been bolstered by upbeat economic data  The favorable data continued today as a read on key services sector activity showed growth accelerated last month  Australian securities dropped and South Korean listings fell  while Indian equities finished flat 
Stocks continue to rally as data counters political risk 
U S  stocks extended a rally on the week  registering fresh all time highs  They joined a global equity market push to the upside that was bolstered by a plethora of upbeat global business activity reports  as favorable data out of China and Europe was met with a jump in the U S  ISM Manufacturing Index to the highest level since August 2014  Expectations of a Fed rate hike later this month rose  which helped send the U S  dollar higher  revived a rally in Treasury yields and helped boost the financial sector  Along with the economic optimism  President Donald Trump s dialed down tone in his first address to Congress  although lacking details of his reflationary policy plans  appeared to be met positively by the markets 
With earnings season all but in the books and Fedspeak going quiet ahead of its March 14 15 meeting  all eyes will likely focus on next week s U S  economic calendar  which will deliver reads on factory orders  the trade balance and 4Q nonfarm productivity and unit labor costs  However  the docket will be headlined by Friday s key nonfarm payroll report for February 
U S  stock indexes broke to the upside  on better economic data but also heightened expectations of tax and regulatory reform  The bar is now set higher for policy action to support the rhetoric  setting up the possibility for a market pullback and or a pickup in volatility  The economic picture continues to look good  but inflation is heating up  which has put a March rate hike by the Federal Reserve firmly on the table  An earnings growth recovery has helped fuel a global rally  but there are risks that expectations and valuations have gotten a bit extended 
International reports due out next week that deserve a mention include  Australia retail sales and the Reserve Bank of Australia s monetary policy decision  China trade balance and inflation reports  Japan trade balance and 4Q GDP  Eurozone investor confidence  4Q GDP and the European Central Bank monetary policy decision  along with German factory orders and trade balance  U K  industrial and manufacturing production  trade balance and inflation forecast ",2017-03-05,Marvin Clark,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-mostly-flat,-yellen-hints-at-possibility-of-march-hike-200177740",200177740

94483,315998,MRVL,Seagate Or Western Digital  Which Is The Better Stock ,opinion,"The ever evolving technology sector has been seeing a number of new trends over the past couple of years  Of these  the notable ones include cloud computing  Big Data  Bring Your Own Device  BYOD   Internet of Things  IoT   flash storage  social networking and 3D printing The storage market is a flourishing part of the technology space and has been gaining momentum in the recent years with expanding storage needs and more options to address those needs  Since the market is dominated by a few large players  it makes sense to weigh the pros and cons before investing  In this article  we will provide a brief industry background before diving into the details Digging into the DetailsA number of factors are driving the market today  These include increased digitization of workloads  the move toward cloud computing  the shift toward mobile computing that necessitates cloud storage  and growing volumes of unstructured data from social networking and other sites that are extremely valuable for online retailers and marketers Big Data has been one of the biggest buzzwords in the technology sector in 2016  The term refers to management of vast quantities of unstructured data  i e  information available from messaging  emails  open source surveys and many other sources Storage of unstructured data has become a major problem these days  Big Data storage includes the ability to handle capacity and provide low latency for analytics work  Flash memory is gaining ground against traditional hard drives in this environment due to significant performance advantage and low power consumption Moreover  usage of flash in cloud storage that involves pooling of shared resources is increasingly gaining popularity  Simultaneously  the demand for analytics solutions that can analyze this vast unstructured data and unlock its value has increased in recent times  The storage market is seeing a steady increase in demand  given fast growing stored data volume  especially the explosive growth of unstructured data  NAND  nonvolatile storage technology  demand is expected to remain very strong again this year  Solid State Drive  SSD  demand will also increase and could even surpass manufacturing capacity  leading to periodic shortage and higher pricing in the near term Storage Market Trends to Watch ForAccording to market research firm IDC  revenues from Big Data and business analytics applications is expected to grow from  122 million in 2015 to more than  187 million in 2019   up more than 50   Another research firm  Research and Markets projects worldwide data center storage market to grow at a four year compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 15 01  during the period 2016 2020 Also  TechNavio projected that enterprise SSD market will grow at a CAGR of 17  during 2016 2020  The SSD segment s growth potential is a major positive for storage stocks because this could offset the losses incurred due to the secular decline in the PC market  which does not necessarily use SSDs We see the growth trend in storage and particularly  SSD to be especially beneficial for companies like Seagate Technology plc   NASDAQ STX   and Western Digital Corporation   NASDAQ WDC    which have based their products in the SSD storage market Seagate or Western Digital Seagate and Western Digital are the two big players within the storage space  Seagate is the second largest manufacturer of hard disk drives  HDDs  in the U S  The company offers a portfolio of solid state drives and solid state hybrid drives  It also offers a range of disk drive products for the enterprise  client compute and client non compute market applications  The company provides data storage services for businesses  including online backup  data protection and recovery solutions On the other hand  we have Western Digital  which is one of the largest HDD producers in the U S  The company designs  develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of HDDs used in desktop PCs  servers  network attached storage devices  video game consoles  digital video recorders and a host of other consumer electronic devices  By completing the acquisition of SanDisk during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  the company has been able to venture into the flash drive storage technology space For numerous years  these two companies have battled each other for market share and brand recognition in every conceivable way Western Digital Looks GoodWestern Digital  a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  technology stock  has generated a strong three months return of around 32 6   The company has a market cap of  17 39 billion The stock has delivered three positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 5 87   Moreover  over the last 60 days  six out of eight estimates for fiscal 2017 were raised upward  pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate up by 19 7   up 9 cents  to  5 48 It is worth mentioning that the acquisition of SanDisk has opened new avenues of growth for Western Digital and will help it to gain market traction in SSD  The merger will lead to economies of scale  lower costs  increased market reach and acquisition of new technologies  among other synergies Going forward  we believe that the shift toward non PC applications  secular growth of digital data and growing exposure to the small and medium business space are the long term positives Notably  the company is the largest U S  manufacturer of HDDs with a 44  market share Seagate Not Far Behind Seagate  on the other hand  also carrying a Zacks Rank  1  focuses more on the enterprise side  which is the key growth area in the information technology sector Seagate has generated a return of 24 9  over the last three months  The company has a market cap of  11 57 billion Over the last 60 days  12 out of 13 estimates for fiscal 2017 were raised upward  pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate up 24 2   up 73 cents  to  3 75 Nonetheless  the recent merger between Western Digital and SanDisk has made it more challenging for Seagate to capture market share in the SSD technology  Western Digital and SanDisk will be able to offer competitive solutions in cloud based computing  which has overtaken digital storage solution space over the past couple of years  Therefore  it will be difficult for Seagate to remain competitive in the storage business Notably  Seagate is the second largest manufacturer  after Western Digital  of HDDs with a 40  share 
Computer and Technology Sector Price IndexConclusionWe believe that both the stocks have their share of pros and cons  But given the current scenario  we would bet on Western Digital because it is well positioned to outpace the industry and is fundamentally strong enough to withstand risks Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors may consider other stocks like Marvell Technology Group Ltd    NASDAQ MRVL   and NVIDIA Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA    both of which sport a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Zacks  Best Investment Ideas for Long Term ProfitToday you can gain access to long term trades with double and triple digit profit potential rarely available to the public  Starting now  you can look inside our stocks under  10  home run and value stock portfolios  plus more  Want a peek at this private information ",2016-11-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/seagate-or-western-digital:-which-is-the-better-stock-200166042,200166042

94523,316038,MRVL,Helmerich   Payne  HP  To Post Q4 Earnings  What To Expect ,opinion,Contract drilling services provider Helmerich   Payne Inc    NYSE HP   is set to release its fiscal fourth quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Thursday  Nov 17 In the preceding three month period  the Tulsa  OK based company reported wider than expected loss owing to dismal performances by all its segments Coming to earnings surprise history  Helmerich   Payne has a bad record  its missed estimates in three of the last four quarters HELMERICH PAYNE Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to Consider This QuarterHelmerich   Payne is a major land and offshore drilling contractor in the western hemisphere  having the youngest and most efficient drilling fleet  The company specializes in shallow to deep drilling in oil and gas producing basins of the U S  and in drilling for oil and gas in international locations The company s technologically advanced FlexRigs are the key to its success  helping it to maintain relatively strong daily rate margins even during market uncertainty  The company s proprietary FlexRig design makes the rigs move faster than conventional rigs  drill quicker and more efficiently  and allows for a safer operating environment As such  these are better suited for the new requirements of the exploration business and  therefore  command higher dayrates and utilization than rigs from other land drillers  In fact  the company projected a slight improvement in average rig margin per day However  oil prices are still languishing under  45   about half the level of two years ago   and far below the breakeven price for many energy companies  As a result  the top energy companies continue to cut spending  particularly on the costly upstream projects  on the back of lower profit margins  This  in turn  means less work for contract drillers like Helmerich   Payne  The pace of new term contract orders have weakened considerably while newbuild awards have also been hard to come by due to flat rig demand and stiff price competition  This will continue to weigh on Helmerich   Payne s fortunes in the near to medium term Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Helmerich   Payne will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  11 63   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 48 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged narrower  at a loss of 43 cents Zacks Rank  Helmerich   Payne has a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Helmerich   Payne  here are some firms from diverse sectors you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter Marvell Technology Group Ltd    NASDAQ MRVL   has an Earnings ESP of  40 00  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is expected to release earnings results on Nov 17  You can see  Best Buy Co  Inc    NYSE BBY   has an Earnings ESP of  4 26  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is anticipated to release earnings on Nov 17 Foot Locker Inc    NYSE FL   has an Earnings ESP of  0 91  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is likely to release earnings on Nov 18 Zacks  Best Private Investment Ideas In addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website  how would you like to follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time Our experts cover all kinds of trades  from value to momentum       from stocks under  10 to ETF and option moves       from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  You can even look inside exclusive portfolios that are normally closed to new investors  Starting today  for the next month  you can have unrestricted access ,2016-11-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/helmerich---payne-(hp)-to-post-q4-earnings:-what-to-expect-200164731,200164731

94583,316098,MRVL,2 New Stock Ideas From A Guy Who s Beat Wall Street For 15 Years Running,opinion,It s that time of year again  when investment managers are required to disclose their fund s holdings to the SEC  and by extension  to all investors  And for most investment companies and hedge funds  it s a pretty straight forward process    just make a list of all the stocks you own  and how much of them you own    If you re Greenlight Capital s David Einhorn  however  it s not quite that simple  With Einhorn s willingness to hold short as well as long positions  not to mention his willingness to speak out about them  in the  7 billion hedge fund  it s a bit of a process to truly figure out what he s thinking  or trading    On the other hand  considering his fund has returned an average of 21  per year for the past 15 years  sifting through the data is worth the effort    What Einhorn likes    Of course  closed trades are history and don t offer investors any new specific coattails to ride  The best clues traders can glean from Greenlight s exits last quarter are to look at what he bought    There were only three new positions added in the first quarter  in addition to only three existing trades that were bolstered    Einhorn increased his stake in information services firm DST Systems  NYSE  DST  by 39  to a total position of about 1 5 million shares  while the fund s stake in semiconductor maker Marvell Technology Group Ltd  Nasdaq  MRVL  and data storage firm Seagate Technology  Nasdaq  STX  both saw a very modest amount of new money thrown in    nothing noteworthy on either front    As for the brand new positions  eyebrows may have been raised  but he may well be on to something good      The biggest addition was the 1 million share   33 million position in online travel booking site Expedia  Nasdaq  EXPE     In retrospect  it was a brilliant a trade  The stock jumped from  32 63 to  40 30 on April 27th after the company handily topped earnings estimates of  0 16 per share by posting a gain of  0 26  Clearly it was a nice call  but given Einhorn s active nature  odds are decent that he s already aiming to lock in the 25  gain    The other two new positions are likely to be intact  as they seem to be longer term ideas  As such  they re the ones investors may want to seriously consider    The first one is Computer Sciences Corp   NYSE  CSC   Einhorn bought 2 4 million shares of the  4 billion computer services firm  making his stake worth  61 million  Computer Sciences Corp  is a bit of a leap of faith  The company isn t profitable on a trailing basis  but is expected to swing to a profit    in spades    this year  The pros say the outfit is poised to earn   2 69 per share for the current fiscal year  ending in March of 2013   and earn  3 11 per share next fiscal year  thanks to a recently announced  1 billion cost cutting effort  That translates into a forward looking price to earnings  P E  ratio of only about 8  which is a bargain by almost any standard    The other newcomer to the Greenlight portfolio is the 561 934 share   5 6 million position in Roundy s  NYSE  RNDY   Yes  this is the same grocery store that saw its shares take a 20  hit a couple of weeks ago on weak same store as well as overall sales results  Net earnings cratered  from  0 29 per share a year earlier to  0 06 in the first quarter of this year    It s an inauspicious start  And besides  what s an aggressive guy like Einhorn want with a grocery store stock anyway  Actually  he s probably doing what all investors should be doing  looking at the bigger picture    As it turns out  on an operating basis  Roundy s actually earned  0 28 per share last quarter  topping estimates of  0 26  The company also expects its expansion effort to lead to annual revenue growth of 2 5  to 3 0   That s not a lot  but in the grocery business  where margins are notoriously thin  a little more incremental revenue goes a long way toward the bottom line    Risks to Consider  While it s possible for all hedge funds  it s especially possible for an actively traded fund like Greenlight Capital  that by the time you learn about a position  it s actually been exited for weeks     While Greenlight Capital added just three new positions and only added to three pre existing positions  there s actually a lot of potential within that small group BY James Brumley,2012-05-22,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-new-stock-ideas-from-a-guy-who's-beat-wall-street-for-15-years-running-123922,123922

94586,316101,MRVL,Where Are Valuations Now ,opinion,"Yesterday s market was strong with lots of volume to open the week and close the quarter   The strongest index of the day was the Russel 2000  up 1 8   followed by the S P 500  up 0 8   and the NASDAQ  up 0 7    NYSE volume was a strong 810 million   The S P 500 squeaked out a narrow 0 7  gain for the month  which is better than the NASDAQ s 2 5  drop and the Russell 2000 s 1  drop   The biotechnology ETF  iShares Nasdaq Biotech  NASDAQ IBB   delivered an exceptionally strong performance  up 3 1  for the day after a dreadful month   The quarter was led by the S P 500  up 1 4   with the Russell 2000 up 1 0  and the NASDAQ up 0 8  
To what do we credit such strong numbers close to a relatively flat month where strong openings were typically followed by very weak closes   Last week  despite many good starts  only Large cap Value ended the week positive  gaining 0 16   Small cap Growth dropped a nasty 4 28    President Putin s call to President Obama gave hope for a diplomatic settlement to the Ukrainian issue   Or  one could argue that Fed Chairman Yellen s remarks that the Fed remains short of its employment and inflation targets created a feeling that the Fed might taper a bit more slowly  charging yesterday s market   Of course  EOQ window dressing might have been the real trump card   Regardless  we are once again nearing various index highs with the strength from yesterday s rally 
Reaching new highs might once again raise the issue of valuation in Q2   We completed our quarterly analysis of Sabrient GARP ratios  growth at a reasonable price  to measure valuation   You might recall that the Sabrient top 300 GARP stocks reached a historic low in February 2009  as did Sabrient s 1000 best GARP stocks   The indices are composed of a nearly 2500 stock universe that includes all publicly held domestic companies that have at least three IBES analysts following them  
The forward P E of the Sabrient 300 averaged the historically low figure of 6 46 on March 6 of 2009   By May of 2011  it had reached a high of 9 37 before the summer pullback in 2011   By early 2012  it had risen again to nearly 10 with an average of 9 44   Once again  it fell back  reaching 7 75 in the summer of 2012   From that low  the resulting strong market drove it to 10 69 February 2013   It had been relatively stagnant since that time until moving above 10 in late 2013  now reaching its post 2009 high of 11 84 on Friday   Perhaps 12 as of yesterday s close  
Even the Top 1000 Sabrient GARP stocks have moved across 15  which we haven t seen since the dot com boom early in the 2000s when it was well above 20  the Top 1000    However the Top 300 never were much over 17  so current valuations are about 80  or so above 2009 s lows while remaining about 40  below dot com highs   Interest rates are well below dot com highs  so at or near current rates  favorably priced growth stocks are more than 50  below interest rate adjusted highs of the frothy market of the early portion of the 2000s 
While interest rates will likely rise further  it seems quite unlikely that they will reach formerly high rates anytime soon   Our conclusion is that bargain growth stocks remain at historically average levels and should be sought by the prudent investor especially with the risk of high interest rates threatening the fixed income market   Our Sabrient SectorCast report favors stocks from the technology  financial or healthcare sectors

One note of caution  Nearly 50  of the Sabrient top 1000 GARP stocks are projected to earn less in their next quarter than the same quarter a year ago   The forward P E takes this into account by its very calculation  but this is by far the highest number of the top 300 or Top 1000 to be facing lower quarter over quarter earnings   Will the economy grow enough to offset these projections as few companies can really afford to cut costs much more   We will closely watch the forward P Es as well as the ratio of stocks projected to earn less quarter over quarter

Petroquest Energy Inc   PQ PetroQuest Energy   PQ  had a large move higher off of a double bottom at 3 70  Consolidating in a wide range from 5 40 to 5 80  it printed a bullish Marubozu candle Friday  The RSI is starting back higher after holding at the mid line and the MACD is leveling 
Telephone and Data Systems Inc   TDS Telephone   Data Systems   TDS  has been moving higher since the end of February  Over the last 3 weeks it has consolidated in a bull flag under the 200 day SMA with a RSI that is bullish and a MACD that is pausing in the shallow pullback as it touches the signal line

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the May options cycle sees the equity markets as mixed  Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil continues to move up  The US Dollar Index seems ready to move sideways or pullback while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are both in consolidation mode with the Chinese market looking better lower and Emerging Markets biased to the upside  Volatility looks to remain low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   iShares Russell 2000 Index  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ  and potentially signaling for a new all time high to come in the S P 500  The equity Index ETF s themselves paint a mixed picture with all rising on the short term  but the SPY the strongest and back at the consolidation zone  while the IWM and QQQ still have a lot of work to do to remove the intermediate term downward bias  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
