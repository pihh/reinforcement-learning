187422,408938,PEAK,Macerich  MAC  Gears Up For Q4 Earnings  What To Expect  ,opinion,The Macerich Company   NYSE MAC   is slated to report fourth quarter and full year 2019 results on Feb 6  before the market opens  The company s quarterly performance will likely reflect year over year increase in revenues  while its funds from operations  FFO  per share might display a decline In the last reported quarter  this retail real estate investment trust  REIT  adjusted FFO per share of 88 cents  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company witnessed strong tenant sales growth as well as increase in average rent and releasing spreads  while occupancy declined Over the preceding four quarters  Macerich beat estimates on one occasion and met in the other three  the average positive surprise being 0 58   This is depicted in the chart below Macerich Company  The  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Per a  by CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE    retail sales increased 3 8   year over year  in the December end quarter  supported by strong sales growth in the food service   drinking places as well as non store retailer categories  Record low unemployment levels  rebound in consumer sentiment and confidence in the economy drove retail sales growth  All retail asset types also recorded positive net absorption  with the sector absorbing more than 9 8 million square feet of space during the quarter under review However  the health of this sector in 2019 was defined by the all time high announced store closures with the growing threat of e commerce  In fact  according to a Costar Group   announced store closures for 2019 totaled more than 10  500 stores as of November 2019  Amid this choppy retail environment  mall owners were compelled to reduce rents in a bid to preserve occupancy  In fact  rents for the lifestyle and mall segment in the fourth quarter declined 12 4  sequentially    As for Macerich  the company s dominant shopping centers in vibrant retail destinations will likely enable it to tide over retail blues in fourth quarter 2019  Additionally  over the past quarters  the company has been actively adapting omni channel modeling to enhance its traditional business model Specifically  it is reducing exposure to struggling department stores while embracing more experiential retail that is thriving  These efforts will likely boost mall traffic and drive sales for the company in the October December quarter Additionally  the mall operator has been active on the redevelopment front  through which it is undertaking unique and transformative densification projects focused on repurposing the properties as well as improving merchandizing mix  The company witnessed robust demand at Scottsdale Fashion Square  NYSE SQ  during 2019  with the mall s sales surging 42 7  year over year to  1 472 per square foot  following redevelopment and expansion of the property s luxury wing that was inaugurated in November 2018 Moreover  the company bagged several leases at Scottsdale Fashion Square  Fashion District Philadelphia and Wilton Mall during the quarter  These outline solid leasing activity that have likely supported leasing revenues  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter leasing revenues of  218 million calls for sequential growth of 1 9   Given these efforts and factors  we expect the productivity metric trends to have remained healthy during the fourth quarter Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at  218 4 million  indicating a year on year rise of 1 2  Nonetheless  Macerich has been witnessing high volumes of tenant bankruptcies and these are expected to weigh on its fourth quarter and full year operating results In fact  Forever 21 s bankruptcy filing affects 15 of Macerich s stores  while lease termination with Sears is likely to have resulted in rent reductions and deceleration of same store net operating income growth Additionally  given the disposal of weaker performing malls over the past few years  the earnings dilution from such sales might have thwarted the company s bottom line growth In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter under review has been revised 1  south to 99 cents over the past month  Further  it represents a year over year decline of 9 2  Lastly  prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  the company has been witnessing downward estimate revisions  indicating bearish analyst sentiments  The full year 2019 FFO per share estimate has been revised marginally downward over the past month to  3 54  calling for an 8  year over year fall  Management projects 2019 adjusted FFO per share at  3 50  3 58 Here is what our quantitative model predicts Our proven model does not conclusively show that Macerich is likely to beat estimates in terms of FFO per share this quarter  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

187428,408944,PEAK,Key Factors To Impact Annaly Capital s  NLY  Q4 Earnings,opinion,Annaly Capital Management Inc    NYSE NLY   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2019 and full year results on Feb 12  after the market closes  The company s earnings results are likely to reflect a year over year decline In the last reported quarter  this mortgage real estate investment trust  REIT  posted core earnings  excluding premium amortization adjustment of 21 cents per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents  Further  net interest income totaling  152 4 million witnessed a steep decline from the year ago tally of  315 6 million Over the last four quarters  the company s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on one occasion  missed the same in the other two while met the mark in another quarter  The average negative surprise is 4 07   The graph below depicts this surprise history Annaly Capital Management Inc Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Positive economic growth  strong demand for housing and mortgage rates being relatively stable are expected to have supported mortgage originations during the fourth quarter  This  in turn  is likely to have benefited Annaly s portfolio of Agency mortgage backed securities  MBSs  Moreover  the company s investment strategy is driven by a prudent selection of assets and effective allocation of capital  In fact  during third quarter 2019  it rotated capital from higher coupons to lower coupons agency investments  Analysts believe that these efforts might have aided Annaly to achieve better returns for the period  Additionally  the company is expected to have continued with its securitization measures within the residential credit businesses during the December quarter  In fact  its commercial real estate investment portfolio strategically complements its agency investments and is likely to have generated decent cash flows in the quarter under review The rapidly changing interest rate environment was the key theme that dominated the financial markets in 2019  In October  the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  slashed the federal fund rate by 0 25   This might have resulted in higher mortgage prepayments and refinancing The speedy prepayment scenario suggests higher premium amortization expense and elevated levels of conditional prepayment rate  CPR  for Annaly s Agency MBS portfolio pertaining to the fourth quarter However  volatility in the repo markets in 2019 escalated funding costs and dampened the performances of many industry participants  In fact  in mid September  the rate on overnight general collateral repo spiked to 10   reflecting about four times above the usual levels due to shortage of cash available for lending  This instability prompted the Fed to conduct a series of operations for overnight repurchase agreements  thus injecting significant liquidity into the funding markets  Thus  it is assumed that the turmoil in the funding market might have affected Annaly s net interest margin and spreads for the quarter to be reported Furthermore  the credit markets witnessed volatility in the fourth quarter  which in turn  induced tighter spreads and is likely to have adversely impacted the company s Residential Credit Group investment portfolio that consists of non Agency residential mortgage assets within securitized products and residential mortgage loan markets Lastly  Annaly s activities during the December quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter FFO remained unchanged at 24 cents in a month s time  indicating a 17 2  decline from the year ago reported figure Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Annaly this time around  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   which is not the case

announcement Factors at Play from the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing   Care  NIC  indicates that during fourth quarter 2019  fundamentals of the U S seniors housing sector remained healthy  This was supported by a seasonal uptick in occupancy  robust net absorption and moderating new construction  Usually  demand for senior housing space increases in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and is generally the year s strongest Nationwide occupancy expanded 10 basis points  bps  to 88  at the end of fourth quarter 2019  with San Jose and New York recording the highest occupancy rates Further  for 2019  net absorption aggregated 15 643 units  the highest level recorded since 2006  This was supported by strong demand and a slowdown in construction activity  Additionally  17 718 new construction starts in 2019 were recorded in NIC s primary markets  This was the lowest level of new starts since 2014 With a strong portfolio of senior housing assets in strategic markets  Welltower seems well poised to have gained from the favorable senior housing environment during the soon to be reported quarter  The company has been enhancing its senior housing operating portfolio  SHOP  quality through addition of strategic properties and recycling of capital on dispositions  Through these capital allocation measures  the company improved its operator diversification and expanded geographic footprint in high barrier to entry urban markets This is expected to have resulted in superior RevPOR gains in the quarter to be reported  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter NOI from the SHOP segment is pegged at  271 million  indicating year over year growth of around 27  A significant increase in outpatient visits and growing need

revenues from outpatient medical properties  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2019 revenues is pegged at  1 25 billion  indicating 0 3  growth on a year over year basis Although development starts moderated in the fourth quarter  supply level of seniors housing assets are elevated  This is expected to have impacted Welltower s performance in the December end quarter  In fact  high supply might have curtailed the company s pricing power and limited resident fee income  thereby impeding segmental revenue growth The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2019

187435,408951,PEAK,Iron Mountain  IRM  Gears Up For Q4 Earnings  What To Expect ,opinion,Iron Mountain Incorporated   NYSE IRM   is set to release fourth quarter 2019 results on Feb 13  before the market opens  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this real estate investment trust  REIT  posted normalized FFO of 54 cents per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents  Results reflected decent growth in its storage revenues Over the preceding four quarters  the company surpassed the FFO per share estimates on three occasions and missed in the other  the average positive surprise being 2 31   This is depicted in the graph below Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderIron Mountain s expansion efforts in the faster growing Adjacent Businesses segment  most notably being data centers  are anticipated to have boosted its data center business  revenues  We expect the company to have continued data center wins and leasing  helping it achieve the higher end of 15 20 megawatts guidance   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the global data center business  quarterly revenues suggests sequential improvement to  69 million Iron Mountain enjoys a steady stream of recurring revenues from its core storage and record management businesses  RIM   This is expected to have buoyed its top line growth in the fourth quarter as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly storage rental revenues from its North America RIM segment is pinned at  315 million  indicating year over year growth of 2 6  Moreover  the company s durable record management and storage business are anticipated to have aided organic revenue growth in the quarter under review  Specifically  Iron Mountain derives majority of its revenues from fixed periodic storage rental fees charged to customers based on the volume of their records stored  We believe the company s initiatives to strengthen its core storage business will lead to year over year top line growth of 1 03  to  1 07 billion However  persistently declining volumes in North America have resulted in aggressive pricing  Accordingly  the fourth quarter storage rental revenues from the company s North America data management segment are expected to have recorded year on year decline of 1 5  to  66 million Also  hard copy documentation needs at the enterprise level are reducing  resulting in contraction of physical storage volume  This is expected to have strained the company s margins during the period in discussion This is expected to have adversely impacted adjusted OIBDA from the North American data management segment  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is  51 million  calling for a sequential decline of 5 5  Additionally  during fourth quarter 2019  Iron Mountain expects to record pre tax restructuring charges of around  60 million associated with its transformation program  Project Summit  This is expected to have thwarted bottom line growth Lastly  prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  the company has been witnessing upward estimate revisions  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter has been revised marginally upward to 63 cents over the past week  reflecting analysts  bullish sentiments  It also represents year over year growth of 12 5  Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn t conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of

187460,408976,PEAK,What s In The Cards For Federal Realty s  FRT  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Federal Realty Investment Trust   NYSE FRT   is set to report fourth quarter and full year 2019 results after market close on Feb 10  Both its revenues and funds from operations  FFO  are anticipated to reflect marginal year over year growth In the last reported quarter  this retail real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered an in line performance in terms of FFO per share  Results reflected rise in property operating income and cash basis rollover growth on comparable spaces Over the last four quarters  it surpassed estimates on two occasions and reported in line results in the other two  the average positive surprise being 0 48   The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors that Might Have Influenced Q4 PerformanceFor Federal Realty  the company s portfolio of premium retail assets  along with a diverse tenant base  both national and local  positions it well for decent growth  With superior demographics  dense population and strong household income  the company s properties have a decent scope of enjoying solid demand However  though upbeat consumer confidence and a healthy economy have infused optimism into the retail market  mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers  shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds  These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures  Further  retailers unable to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies  This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs like Federal Realty  as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably  Such events are likely to have affected the company s performance in the December end quarter In fact  store closures and bankruptcies have been affecting the retail real estate market  for long  which has been undergoing structural changes  In addition  the recent  from Reis shows that the retail and the Mall vacancy rates both increased in the quarter  Particularly  the retail vacancy rate inched up 0 1  to 10 2  in the fourth quarter  Further  retail rent growth was just 0 1   while mall rents remained flat Furthermore  amid fast evolving retail environment  Federal Realty is undertaking concerted measures to reposition  redevelop and re merchandise its portfolio  Although repositioning and redevelopment are a strategic fit for long term growth  such initiatives involve considerable upfront costs  tend to drag down near term profitability  and might have curbed the company s growth tempo in the quarter Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at  238 4 million  indicating a 1 3  rise from the year ago reported figure However  Federal Realty s activities during the quarter did not win analyst confidence  In fact  the consensus estimate for fourth quarter FFO per share moved down marginally to  1 60 in a month s time  Nevertheless  this indicates a year over year rise of 1 9  For 2019  Federal Realty expects FFO per share of  6 16  6 22  Excluding the charge related to the buyout of the Kmart lease at Assembly  the company estimates FFO per share of  6 32  6 38  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pinned at  6 35  indicating a 1 9  projected increase year on year on revenues of  934 3 million Key Developments in Q4In December  Federal Realty announced that it has sold under threat of condemnation a portion of San Antonio Center  in Mountain View  CA  for  155 million  A school will be constructed by the Los Altos School District on the 11 7 acre sold land  The regional shopping center  aggregating 35 acres  was acquired by the company in 2015 for  62 2 million Additionally  in November  Federal Realty announced the acquisition of a 147 000 square foot grocery anchored neighborhood shopping center   Georgetowne Shopping Center   in Brooklyn  NY  The company has shelled out  83 7 million in cash to buy this surfaced parked shopping center on 9 acres in Brooklyn s Georgetown neighborhood  The move comes as part of the company s growth endeavors through portfolio expansions in locations that exhibit solid demographics and high barriers to entry  The company also plans to enhance the property value over time through continued remerchandising and space lease up with the possibility of augmenting square footage Here is what our quantitative model predicts Our proven model does not conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for Federal Realty this season  The

growth of 4 4 4 8  Let s see how things have shaped up The industrial real estate asset category has been firing on all cylinders  of late  and continues to play a pivotal role in a rising e commerce market  transforming the way consumers shop and receive their goods  Further  services like same day delivery are gaining traction and last mile properties in high income urban areas are witnessing solid pricing  occupancy and growth in rentals Moreover  demand for distribution space has been rising  as e commerce continues to expand to sectors like grocery and furnishing  Also  apart from e retail  companies are taking the omni channel plunge and making strategic moves to boost their supply chain efficiencies  thereby propelling demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks This is encouraging industrial REITs to employ sophisticated technologies at their logistics centers to achieve efficiency in trans shipment and delivery processes Per a  from Newmark Knight Frank  the robust demand has continued to push pricing higher  while the vacancy rate hovers near the cyclical low  Particularly  at fourth quarter 2019  average industrial asking rent across the United States measured  7 41 per square feet  denoting 4 5  year over year growth as well as the highest quarterly average recorded this cycle  In fact  industrial rents have improved each quarter for the past five years  suggesting the resilience in this asset class However  this environment of stout growth has attracted many developers  resulting in an increase in construction pipeline and delivery of industrial space  Developers added 74 1 million square feet of industrial space during fourth quarter 2019  bringing the 2019 total to a new cyclical high of 254 4 million

187555,409071,PEAK,Will HCP s Endeavors To Revamp Portfolio Be Sufficient ,opinion,HCP Inc    NYSE HCP   has undertaken portfolio repositioning measures in a bid to improve the quality of its senior housing portfolio and lower the concentration of Brookdale Senior Living Inc  Earlier in this month  HCP provided an update about such efforts and it seems right on track to achieve its target In fact  over time  with diligent measures  the company aims at having more than half of its business comprising specialty office segments of medical office and life science  and lower senior housing concentration to around 40   The focus on having a diversified private pay portfolio is likely to drive long term growth Nevertheless  the softness in the seniors housing market fundamentals amid new supply is anticipated to thwart the company s pricing power  Further  the hike in interest rate and stiff competition remain concerns for the company Per its recent update  HCP has reaped  332 million of proceeds through the completion of the disposition of its residual investment in the RIDEA II senior housing joint venture  JV  to an investor group led by Columbia Pacific Advisors  LLC  Notably  this JV owned 49 communities and 46 of them were managed by Brookdale Regarding Brookdale 25 asset sales  the company has already accomplished the disposition of five communities for  32 million and is under contract to sell another 15 communities for  98 million  The remaining five assets are expected to be either sold or transitioned this year too Further  HCP is focused on making acquisitions to enhance its overall portfolio mix  The company acquired Hayden Research Campus in the Boston life science market in December 2017 and is experiencing strong leasing velocity  Moreover  in March 2018  the company acquired development rights at Hayden for  21 million and its planned 214 000 square foot Class A development is expected to improve the company s scale in this leading life science market  Also  the company started Phase I of Sierra Point  which marks its next key life science development in the South San Francisco market In fact  increasing longevity of the aging U S  population  along with growth opportunities related to biopharma drug development  have promoted life science and medical market fundamentals  The trend is expected to continue in the upcoming years  giving significant impetus for growth to HCP Moreover  national healthcare expenditure is expected to rise in the future and as senior citizens constitute the major customer base of healthcare services   they end up spending more on healthcare services compared with the average population  Hence  with an expectation of rising senior citizens  population in the years ahead  we believe that HCP has a strong upside potential  being well poised to capitalize on this expenditure trend of senior citizens on healthcare services However  softness in the seniors housing fundamentals is likely to continue in the upcoming quarters  amid rise in new supply in the market  This is anticipated to adversely affect the company s pricing power and occupancy level  In addition  the cut throat competitive market makes it more challenging for the company to increase its rent and occupancy level  The competition also makes it hard to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities to meet the company s objectives Moreover  the company is currently focusing on lowering its Brookdale portfolio concentration  The move involves strategic efforts  including selling of considerable part of its portfolio and using the proceeds in debt repayment  Although such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term  the dilutive impact on earnings in the near term from the sale of assets is unavoidable Amid these  shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company have underperformed its  over the past six months  declining 7 4  against the industry s decline of 2 4   Stocks to

187664,409180,PEAK,Opening Bell  Calmer Trump  Positive Sentiment Push Markets Higher,opinion,"by Eli Wright
Asian markets moved up this morning  in part as a reaction to last Friday s record high U S  close  European markets are trading higher right now as well 
Though US President Trump s promise of a  phenomenal  tax plan goosed markets late last week  it s likely some of this morning s risk on appetite in Asia was fueled by Trump s comparatively moderate behavior over the past weekend  especially toward Asian allies  his assurance to Chinese President Xi Jinping that the US would adhere to the  One China  policy which has been the standard for US China diplomacy for many years  contrary to earlier presidential statements  the fact that he didn t broach the subject of Japanese currency manipulation during his Saturday meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also calmed markets  His statements to Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the  United States   stands behind Japan  its great ally 100   after North Korea launched a ballistic missile which landed in the Sea of Japan  also eased markets this morning 
Trump s calmer tone could also diminish worries in the US ahead of Fed Chair Janet Yellen s two day monetary policy testimony in front of the US Congress   which begins tomorrow  Markets will be waiting for her assessment of the current state of the US economy as well as the strength of the Fed s commitment to ongoing rate hikes 
At least for now  it looks as though the  Trump Trade  is back on  Even extremely low volatility may not be cause for concern 
Overnight in Asia  the Nikkei gained 0 41  to 19 459 15  the Shanghai Composite rose 0 64  to 3 217 22  and the Hang Seng finished 0 52  higher  at 23 697 50 
In Europe  the FTSE has gained 0 4  to 7 258 75  the DAX is up 0 21  to 11 666 97  and the Stoxx 50 is 0 32  higher  at 3 282 
On Wall Street  all three major indices ended last week at record highs  The Dow rose 0 48   to 20 269 37  the S P 500 gained 0 36  to 2 316 10  and the NASDAQ closed up 0 33   at 5 734 13 
The Dow  S P  and NASDAQ are all approximately 0 1  higher in pre market trading 
US Treasury yields are up across the board  the 2 year yield is 1 202   the 10 year yield is 2 422   and the 30 year yield is 3 015

The Dollar Index has slipped 0 06  this morning to 100 74  Since President Trump s plans remain a primary driver for the USD  FX markets  as well as equity markets  await additional clarity on his administration s plans  Though the currency continues to move in a relatively narrow and choppy range  some analysts still see quite a bit of upside ahead 

The euro is trading at 1 0646  clinging to narrow 0 06  gains  Resistance could get tested at 1 075 while to the downside  the single currency could drop to 1 055 
Sterling is up 0 34  at 1 2532  To the upside  the cable could rise to 1 265  to the downside  it could fall to 1 248 
The Canadian dollar is up 0 05  at 1 3079  ahead of Trump s meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau later today during which time the two leaders will presumably discuss NAFTA among other subjects 
The Chinese yuan is down 0 15  to 6 8751 ahead of January Chinese PPI and CPI  which are scheduled to be released this evening 
Commodities
Crude oil is down 0 31  to  53 56 while Brent is down 0 31  to  56 39  OPEC is slated to release an assessment of its January production this morning  later in the day  the EIA will publish an update on US shale output  Both reports will likely impact oil s price trajectory 
Gold is down 0 3   to  1 232 15 as traders embrace risk on assets  However  according to some analysts  the gold rally hasn t yet reached overbought status  and there remains upside potential for the yellow metal to go to  1 280  Silver is up 0 06   to  17 943 
Of some surprise  the price of coal has jumped  According to Reuters  in an effort to combat extreme levels of pollution  China s Ministry of Environmental Protection is mulling moves which include redirecting coal shipments away from Tianjin  the port that currently handles 17  of the nation s imported coal  This alongside pre existing concerns of a   because of alternative energy sources and myriad global government regulations  have contributed to higher coal prices  which at  60 15  have now increased 60  YoY 
Related  aluminum  and iron ore prices are also on the rise  China is considering forcing aluminum and steel producers to cut output as an additional way to rein in pollution  Aluminum is currently up  10 50 to  1 981 25 while iron ore  used in the production of steel  is up  2 76 to  87 19

187744,409260,PEAK,Is HCP s High Yield Dividend Safe ,opinion,"HCP Inc   NYSE HCP  is the only real estate investment trust  REIT  in the S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index  With a dividend yield in excess of 7   it s no surprise that this stock has been a popular holding for investors living off dividends in retirement 
Generally speaking  dividend aristocrats are some of the most reliable dividend paying stocks in the market  After all  it takes meaningful competitive advantages and a committed management team for a business to pay higher dividends for at least 25 consecutive years 
We own several aristocrats in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio  but HCP possesses several characteristics that require a closer look  With the stock down about 20  over the last year  now is a good time to review if HCP is a high yield dividend aristocrat worth buying or a potential value trap Business OverviewHCP is a real estate investment trust  REIT  with over 1 200 properties in the healthcare sector  The company went public in 1985 with 24 skilled nursing facilities and primarily grew by investing billions of dollars in acquisitions to expand its portfolio 
HCP makes money by renting out its properties to healthcare companies such as senior living centers and doctors  offices  Roughly half of HCP s investments are under triple net lease agreements  which are generally thought to have lower risk profiles because they require the tenant to pay property taxes  insurance  and maintenance expenses 
By segment  HCP generated 42  of its 2015 revenue from Senior Housing  24  from Post Acute Skilled Nursing  13  from Life Science  17  from Medical Office  and 3  from Hospital  The company s mix of operating income was similar  but it s worth mentioning that two of HCP s customers accounted for over 30  of its revenue last year  HCR ManorCare 23   Brookdale 10   Business AnalysisThe U S  healthcare real estate market is extremely fragmented  In an investor presentation  HCP estimated that the market is about  1 trillion in size but public REITs own less than 20  of it 
As the healthcare industry continues to focus on reducing costs  consolidation is likely and should benefit the bigger players  Acquisitions have fueled much of HCP s historical growth  and we expect them to play a key role in the company s future strategy as well 
The healthcare market also has attractive demographics  Spending generally continues unabated regardless of economic conditions  sales were flat in 2009   and many of HCP s properties will benefit as the average age of the U S  population skews higher over the coming decades to reflect improving standards of living Source  Simply Safe Dividends
HCP has also built long term relationships with many of its tenants  which helps it maintain strong occupancy and renewal rates at its properties  As long as its tenants remain financially healthy  they provide a stable source of revenue for HCP over the duration of their lease 
Despite its strengths  HCP is a business that will never earn high returns on its invested capital due to the capital intensive nature of real estate  the large number of competitors  and the industry s relatively low barriers to entry  As seen below  HCP has generated a low  to mid single digit return on invested capital over the last five years  which is a little below the market s average return on capital  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
However  HCP is a reliable cash flow generator because of its long term leases with customers  the industry s slow rate of change  and the non discretionary nature of healthcare spending  Some of these factors make healthcare one of the best stock sectors for dividend income  As seen below  HCP has generated free cash flow in nine of its last 11 fiscal years Source  Simply Safe DividendsHCP s Key RisksHCP s main risks are its customer concentration  dependence on government reimbursement programs  and reliance on capital markets 
Whenever a business is highly concentrated with a customer or two  its fate will largely be determined by how those customers perform  In 2015  HCP generated 23  and 10  of its total revenue from HCR ManorCare and Brookdale  respectively 
HCP acquired a large stake of real estate from HCR ManorCare for about  6 billion in 2011  which significantly increased its customer concentration 
Prior to the deal  HCP s two biggest customers in 2010 were Emeritus  10  of sales  and HCR ManorCare  9    In other words  the magnitude of its two largest customers has about doubled over the past five years from 19  of sales in 2010 to 33  last year  The company s mix of post acute skilled nursing revenue also increased from 12  of revenue in 2010 to 24  in 2015 
Despite HCP s status as a dividend aristocrat  it has much more customer concentration risk today than it did five years ago  Many income investors assume dividend aristocrats are invincible  but it s important to be aware of how a company s business has evolved  for better or worse  
Unfortunately  both HCR ManorCare and Brookdale are struggling  which is hurting HCP s stock and creating greater risk for its dividend payment 
Brookdale is the biggest provider of senior living care in the U S  and is dealing with lower occupancy levels  Many of HCR ManorCare s issues are being caused by unfavorable trends in skilled nursing facilities and the company s dependence on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements 
HCP estimates that about 25  of its annualized rental payments received from tenants are dependent on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements  This is a high level of government assistance and creates risk because reimbursement rates can unexpectedly shift and make certain areas of healthcare more or less attractive and profitable 
In addition to customer concentration and government reimbursement risk  HCP s margin of safety is also less than many other companies because REITs are required to pay out 90  of their taxable earnings as a dividend to keep their REIT classification 
As a result  REITs have less capital to reinvest in the business for growth and have to turn to the capital markets more often than other types of companies 
As seen below  HCP has maintained a reasonable debt to capital ratio near 50   but its diluted shares outstanding have more than tripled over the last 10 years from 136 million shares in 2005 to 463 million shares last year Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
If HCP experiences unfavorable business developments  it could quickly become financially strained due to its high payout ratio and interest expense payments 
If banks are unwilling to lend money to the company at reasonable rates and HCP s share price is in the dumps  making it costly to issue equity  the company will have a hard time sustaining its dividend and growth spending  Dividend Analysis  HCPWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend 
Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
HCP s dividend payment ranks slightly below average for safety with a Dividend Safety Score of 40  One of the first metrics we look at is a company s payout ratio  REITs are different than other types of companies because their properties record large depreciation charges each year  which lower reported earnings  However  the value of real estate generally rises over time 
For this reason and others  REITs report non GAAP measures that can provide a better representation of their cash flow and dividend coverage  One such measure is funds available for distribution  FAD   which is similar to free cash flow but for a REIT 
HCP s management team expects the company s FAD to range from  2 62 to  2 68 per share in 2016  which implies a forward looking payout ratio of about 90   This would be HCP s highest FAD payout ratio since 2004 
While all REITs will have higher than average payout ratios  HCP s makes us more nervous than others because its two major customers are facing rather murky headwinds related to changing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements 
Changing reimbursement models has resulted in lower rates and shorter patient stays for HCR ManorCare  and the company is incurring legal costs related to an investigation by the Department of Justice over false Medicare reimbursement claims 
As a result  the tenant s cash flow coverage is deteriorating  According to HCP  HCR ManorCare s fixed charge coverage  FCC  in 2015 was 1 07x and fell to 0 97x for the last six months of the year 
A coverage ratio below 1 0x means that the company s cash flow is unable to cover its rent and interest expenses  In other words  there is pressure to sell off assets or negotiate lower rent rates 
If operating performance continues deteriorating  HCP might be forced to give HCR ManorCare another major rent cut  For now  HCP expects HCR ManorCare s FCC in 2016 to range from 1 06x to 1 16x  which leaves little cushion if industry trends further deteriorate 
HCP is in the process of selling off about  350 million worth of non core strategic assets from HCR ManorCare as it works to reduce its exposure and improve its credit lease  but nothing will happen overnight 
Looking at the balance sheet  HCP has about  400 million in cash compared to book debt of  11 1 billion  This large debt load would usually raise some red flags  but it is backed by the value of HCP s real estate in this case  reducing some of its risk 
In the event that interest rates start to rise  it s worth noting that over 95  of the company s debt is fixed rate  This prevents HCP from needing to make significantly higher interest payments on its existing debt load 
HCP also has investment grade credit ratings from Fitch  BBB    Moody s  Baa1   and Standard   Poor s  BBB   with stable outlooks from each 
Overall  we think HCP s current dividend will probably stay safe  but there is some risk of a modest reduction if conditions deteriorate more than expected at HCR ManorCare or Brookdale this year  However  we don t expect such deterioration would result in a major cut  e g  50   to the dividend Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Not surprisingly  HCP s Dividend Growth Score of 19 is pretty weak  Until its major tenants stabilize and become a smaller portion of HCP s total sales mix  we expect any dividend growth to be very modest 
HCP most recently increased its dividend by 1 8  earlier this year  marking its 31st consecutive annual payout raise  The company is a dividend aristocrat and has increased its dividend by 3 0  per year over the last decade Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationHCP s stock trades at 12 3x forward FAD guidance and has a dividend yield of 7 1   which is significantly higher than its five year average dividend yield of 5 1   If HCP can continue its organic operating income growth of 3  per year  the stock appears to offer 10  annual total return potential 
Investors are clearly concerned by the company s exposure to HCR ManorCare and Brookdale  potentially creating an opportunity in the stock  However  it s ultimately too hard for us to accept the risks facing HCP s business at this time ConclusionGiven the murkiness of healthcare reimbursements and HCP s customer concentration risk  it s too hard for us to get comfortable with the business  The stock has been very weak because investors are trying to reassess the company s long term growth rate  which was immediately adjusted lower in response to deteriorating trends in the post acute skilled nursing industry last quarter 
The company s dividend payment seems more likely than not to remain safe  but that could change if HCR ManorCare needs to renegotiate its rent lower again this year  With a focus on capital preservation and safe income growth  we will stick with some of our favorite blue chip dividend stocks instead ",2016-03-08,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-hcp's-high-yield-dividend-safe-200120826,200120826
187746,409262,PEAK,OHI  A Healthcare REIT Paying A Safe 6 5  High Yield Dividend,opinion,"Omega Healthcare Investors  NYSE OHI  is a real estate investment trust  REIT  with a high dividend yield over 6  
The company operates in the healthcare sector  which is generally one of the best stock sectors for dividend income because of its essential products and services 
However  a high dividend yield can be a signal that a company s dividend payment will not be sustainable 
We will only invest in safe dividend stocks for our Conservative Retirees dividend portfolio  so let s see if Omega can make the cut 
Business OverviewOmega is a healthcare REIT that provides financing and capital primarily to skilled nursing facilities  SNFs   which account for about 90  of the company s facilities  The remaining 10  of Omega s facilities are used for senior housing 
Patients discharged from hospitals are sent to SNFs when they still require care or rehab before they can be sent home  Compared to hospitals  SNFs can provide short term care on a much more affordable basis to save healthcare costs 
Omega s tenants receive revenues through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements as well as private pay for their services  Omega receives fixed rent payments from its tenants with annual escalators and uses triple net lease agreements  which are generally thought to be lower risk deals because they require the tenant to pay property taxes  insurance  and maintenance expenses 
Overall  Omega has more than 930 properties located across over 40 states and operated by more than 80 different operators  The company owns about 84  of its assets with mortgages  9   and direct financing leases  7   accounting for the remainder Business AnalysisOmega is the largest skilled nursing facilities REIT with more than twice as many properties as its next largest competitor and is playing the role of consolidator in this large and fragmented market 
The company boosted its property count by nearly 50  with its  3 9 billion acquisition of Aviv on April 1  2015  which helped Omega gain operating  growth and cost of capital efficiencies 
Importantly  the deal also increased Omega s diversification by state and operator  Unlike HCP  NYSE HCP   another healthcare REIT that we analyzed earlier  Omega s largest tenant accounts for less than 7  of rent  and no state accounts for more than 11  of its total rent 
This diversification prevents the company from being overly exposed to unexpected headwinds that could emerge at any given tenant or in any particular state as it relates to issues such as Medicaid reimbursement 
While the skilled nursing industry certainly has its share of risks  more on that later   there are several elements of it that attract us 
Most notably  we continue to believe that the industry s supply and demand fundamentals remain attractive 
From a demand standpoint  Omega s occupancy rate has consistently remained in excess of 80  thanks to the non discretionary nature of its operators  services  and demand should rise as the senior population continues growing 
SNFs also seem likely to remain the go to sites for post acute care  Simply put  SNFs remain the most cost effective environment for rehab services in most cases due to their relatively smaller footprints and lower staff counts 
As seen below  SNFs have about 50  market share of patients sent to post acute care 
Source  Omega Investor Presentation
Looking at industry supply  we can see below that the supply of facilities and beds to meet increasing future demand has been limited due to Certificate of Need  CON  restrictions  which are aimed at restraining health care facility costs and have helped industry occupancy rates 
Source  Omega Investor Presentation
Overall  we expect Omega s operators to enjoy higher volumes thanks to expanding Medicare coverage and a growing senior population 
We think the company will continue to have plenty of opportunities for acquisitive growth as well  As seen below  Omega has done an outstanding job finding reinvestment opportunities over the last decade  double digit sales growth in nine of the last 10 years   and tougher reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid should continue encouraging consolidation Source  Simply Safe DividendsOmega s Key RisksOmega s biggest risks are arguably all outside of the company s control 
Skilled nursing generally has higher reimbursement risk than other areas of healthcare such as senior housing because SNFs more on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements from the government 
As a result  changes in federal policies and increased scrutiny over billing practices of SNF operators have potential to materially impact the ability of Omega s tenants to meet their lease obligations 
While Omega has enjoyed rising Medicare and Medicaid rates over time  see below   lengths of stay are declining under alternative payment models such as bundling and managed care 
Source  Omega Investor Presentation
Despite shifts in rates and the length of patient stays  SNF Medicare patient days are still projected to grow due to increasing enrollment

Let s take a closer look at some of these risks as it relates to dividend safety Dividend Analysis  OmegaWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Omega s Dividend Safety Score of 65 suggests that its current dividend payment is somewhat safer than the average dividend stock 
However  one of the first things income investors point to when reviewing Omega is the company s dividend cut in 2000 
As seen below  the company reduced its total dividends paid from  2 80 per share in 1999 to  1 00 per share in 2000 before completely eliminating the dividend in 2001 and 2002 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Since restarting its dividend in 2003  Omega s annual dividends have increased every year  However  conservative income investors have every right to question whether Omega s current dividend payment is really reliable  After all  a company that cuts its dividend once certainly seems more likely to cut it again 
Why was Omega forced to cut its dividend in 2000  and could that same risk reemerge in the future 
The answer comes from Omega s 2001 annual report  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 introduced a new payment system for the reimbursement of Medicare patients in SNFs 
A major shift took place in which a cost based reimbursement system that was historically used was essentially abandoned in favor of a reimbursement system that capped payments per service at a fixed amount  This was done by the government to save money and attempt to balance the federal budget by 2002 
While some of these payments changes were reversed by subsequent legislation in 1999 2000  the result was a major reduction in payments made to nursing home operators 
Many of Omega s tenants were forced to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy and could no longer make their rent payments  They had generally been levering up to fund acquisitive growth in the years leading up to the legislation and were not prepared for the substantial reimbursement reductions 
By all means  the reforms made to the Medicare reimbursement system in the late 1990s were nothing short of transformational 
While federal policy is still characterized by a healthy dose of uncertainty today  we believe new legislation aimed at tightening up Medicare payments will be more incremental and will not result in bankruptcies like those that occurred over 15 years ago 
Simply put  another transformational shift appears very unlikely  However  the situation is worth monitoring as we all know how unpredictable governmental policies can be 
Today  healthcare REITs have been hit by several issues that have resurfaced the events of the late 1990s in many investors  unforgiving minds 
First  Medicare Advantage coverage is increasing which has resulted in lower rates and shorter patient stays under alternative payment models 
The Department of Justice is also investigating billing practices of SNFs  which could hurt future revenues and margins  For example  Omega s largest tenant  Genesis Health Care   7  of total rent   went under investigation in February 2015 and has accrued a  30 million loss contingency reserve 
As a result  there is risk that tenants  cash flow coverage could deteriorate to levels that compromise their ability to meet their rent obligations 
However  we believe Omega is well positioned to deal with these developments and continue paying its dividend for several reasons  beginning with the health of its operators 
Omega s tenants appear very likely to be able to absorb moderate reimbursement rate reductions and still meet their monthly rent obligations 
In a recent investor presentation  Omega noted that its portfolio s rent coverage was 1 4x EBITDAR  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and rent costs  at the end of 9 30 15  indicating tenants  strong ability to continue making rent payments even with some adversity 
Fitch also notes that Omega s rent coverage  implies some cushion to sustain annual rental increases and or unforeseen changes to reimbursement rates  
We also like how well diversified Omega is by tenant  no operator is more than 7  of total rent  and state  helping minimize the impact of Medicaid rate changes in any one state 
Even if future operating conditions end up being more challenging than expected  Omega remains on solid financial footing to weather the storm 
The company maintains investment grade credit ratings from all three major agencies and has no major long term debt maturities until 2024  Omega also has  1 1 billion of cash and credit facility availability that it can tap at any time  and the company s debt ratios are generally more conservative than its peers 
Source  Omega Investor Presentation
What about the payout ratio  Analyzing payout ratios requires a different perspective for REITs because they book large depreciation charges each year for their properties  reducing their reported earnings 
However  the value of real estate typically rises over time  For this reason and others  REITs report non GAAP measures that better represent their cash flow and dividend coverage  One of these measures is adjusted funds from operation  AFFO   which is similar to free cash flow but for REITs 
Omega s dividend payout ratio using AFFO is 71   which is quite reasonable for a business with consistent and stable free cash flow 
Even during 2009  Omega s occupancy rate was very healthy at 84 6   The company s payout ratio should also be protected thanks to Omega s favorable lease renewal schedule   about 89  of portfolio expirations occur after 2020 
Overall  Omega s dividend looks safe to us  While we don t like being exposed to the uncertainties of healthcare reform  we believe the changes being made today are far from the devastating events of the late 1990s 
Omega s diversification  financially healthy tenants  reasonable payout ratio  and relatively conservative financial position give us further confidence in the safety of its dividend Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Omega s Dividend Growth Score of 48 suggests that the company s dividend growth potential is about average  The company s score was mostly pulled down by Omega s high payout ratio  which is typical of REITs but makes their dividend growth much more dependent on cash flow growth 
Regardless  Omega has raised its dividend for 14 consecutive quarters and increased its dividend payment every year since 2003  As seen below  Omega has consistently grown its dividend at a high single digit rate over the last decade Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As long as the regulatory environment remains stable and capital is accessible to fund growth  we expect at least mid single digit dividend growth to continue ValuationOHI s stock trades at a reasonable multiple of about 11x funds from operations  FFO  and has a dividend yield of 6 5   which is approximately in line with its five year average dividend yield 
Thanks to its acquisitions  Omega compounded its adjusted EBITDA by 21 6  per year from 2005 through 2015  Growth was significantly boosted by the company s  3 9 billion acquisition of Aviv in 2015 and is unlikely to remain at such a high rate 
Going forward  we think Omega s cash flow can continue growing at a mid  to high single digit rate given the number of acquisitive growth opportunities in its large and fragmented markets  Under this assumption  the stock appears to have double digit annual total return potential ConclusionNo dividend stock is perfect  and Omega certainly contains its fair share of uncertainties thanks to its indirect dependence on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements 
However  we believe the company s dividend payment is safe thanks to its client diversification  conservative payout ratio  strong rent coverage metrics  and relatively healthy balance sheet 
We don t view today s reimbursement changes being anywhere near as dramatic as the events of the late 1990s and expect Omega to be able to power through as it continues consolidating the SNF market

187772,409288,PEAK, 2 Healthcare High Dividend Stocks Beating The Market Pullback,opinion,"Looking for a safe place to hide during this latest market pullback  Healthcare was not only the leading sector in 2014 it has also led the market for most of 2015  Here s a look at how the Healthcare sector  via SPDR   Health Care  ARCA XLV   has fared vs  the S P 500  over the last 3 months  which just about coincides with the market highs of September 18  2014  The Healthcare sector is up 3 81   vs  a  1 44  loss for the S P 500  Digging further  we found 2 high dividend stocks within the Healthcare sector  which have both outperformed this sector and the market   HCP Inc    HCP    a Dividend Aristocrat   and Sabra Healthcare REIT  Inc    NASDAQ SBRA  
Here s a chart of these 2 dividend paying stocks over the same 3 month period  vs  the S P 500  HCP is up nearly 10   and SBRA is up nearly 7  during this period  vs  a  1 44  loss for the S P 500 
Dividends  Our   lists both of these stocks  in the Healthcare section  In addition  we also follow a third related high yield stock  Sabra s preferred stock issue  SBRAP  which currently yields nearly 7   and has also beaten the market during this same 3 month period  having risen 3 08  
Although HCP has a low 5 year dividend growth rate of 2 94   it has increased its dividend per share for 29 consecutive years 
SBRA has raised its quarterly dividend from   32 in 2011  to the current   39 payout  Sabra amply covers its SBRAP preferred dividends by a factor of 3 22  i e  its net income is 3 22 times its preferred dividend payout Preferred Long Term Yield  The table below summarizes your net annualized yield for SBRAP  based upon 2 conditions 
1  You were to hold SBRAP until its 2018 liquidation date
2  Sabra redeems buys back your SBRAP shares at the call date
Since SBRAP is trading at  1 08 above its  25 00 liquidation price  we subtracted this amount from the dividends that you d collect between now and 3 21 18  You d end up with a  4 71 net profit  which equals a 5 54  annualized yield 
Options  Our  and  don t yet carry any call options or put options for HCP or SBRA  as their options yields aren t currently that attractive  However  we do have over 30 other trades in each of these tables  which offer interesting income opportunities 
Valuations  Although HCP is a much larger firm than SBRA   its market cap is over 13 times that of SBRA   surprisingly  the 2 firms have very similar Price Book and Price Sales valuations  In terms of share price Funds From Operations   Price FFO   SBRA seems to be getting a higher price from the market  partially because of its higher dividend yield   Funds From Operations typically strips out depreciation and amortization from expenses  and is used extensively by REIT s  to give investors a clearer idea of how much money the firm has to pay dividends  Financials  In addition to having a much lower debt load  HCP is the clear winner in its management efficiency ratios  although SBRA does have a slightly higher operating margin Earnings  The market also seems to be favoring SBRA over HCP  due to SBRA s stronger growth in revenue  funds from operations  in addition to dividend growth Company Profiles 
HCP  Invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States  HCP s portfolio of assets is diversified among 5 distinct sectors  senior housing  post acute skilled nursing  life science  medical office and hospitals  A publicly traded company since 1985  HCP was the first healthcare REIT selected to the S P 500 index 
SBRA  investment portfolio included 154 real estate properties held for investment and leased to operators tenants under triple net lease agreements  consisting of 102 skilled nursing transitional care facilities  50 senior housing facilities  and two acute care hospitals  plus 14 debt investments

187773,409289,PEAK,5 Solid Dividend Stocks With 5  Plus Yields,opinion,"Remember when you could get a 5  yield on a CD 
Ah  those were the good old days  Today  you d be lucky to get 5  on a relatively safe  high yield  junk bond with a 10 year maturity  let alone something creditworthy and with a shorter duration  And yes  these days it is regrettably necessary to put quotation marks around  high yield  
But despite the lack of yield in the bond market  you can still find a respectably high yield among dividend stocks 
Sure  when choosing high dividend stocks over bonds you have a little more volatility to contend with  And stock dividends   unlike bond interest   can be cut by a company s board of directors with no warning and with no legal liability 
But if my options are to accept a  risk free  2  in government bonds  a risky 5  in junk bonds  or an only modestly risky 5  or more in dividend stocks  the choice is pretty clear  And when you add dividend growth into the mix  dividend stocks are a no brainer for investors hunting for income 
Today  I m going to highlight five solid dividend stocks with high yields of 5  or more 
HCP  Inc 
I ll start with HCP  Inc   NYSE HCP   a blue chip REIT included in both the S P 500 Index and the Dividend Aristocrats Index following its 30 consecutive years of dividend hikes  At current prices  HCP pays a very competitive 5 1  
HCP is backed by some very attractive long term demographic trends  most notably the aging of the Baby Boomers  At 37   senior housing makes up the largest segment of HCP s portfolio  followed by post acute facilities at 31   Life sciences  medical offices and hospitals fill out the rest of the portfolio at 14   13  and 5   respectively 
HCP is by no means a sexy stock  In fact  it s about as boring as they come  But that boring predictability is precisely what makes HCP so attractive as a dividend stock  Over the past 10 years  HCP has grown its dividend at a 4  annual clip  a rate I consider reasonable going forward 
Between the current dividend yield above 5  and the growth rate of 4   investors in HCP can expect something in the ballpark of 9  10  annual returns going forward  That s not amazing   but it certainly isn t bad in this market 
If possible  it s a good idea to hold HCP in an IRA or Roth IRA because REIT dividends are not always taxed at the more favorable 15  20  qualified dividend rate  In the quirky world that is REIT taxation  some of a REIT s dividend may be considered a tax free return of capital  but most of the dividend will be taxed as ordinary income at the investor s highest marginal rate  So as a general rule  it s good to hold REITs in a tax advantaged account like an IRA or Roth IRA 
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA
Next up is the first of two Spanish stocks I wanted to mention  banking giant Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria  NYSE BBVA   BBVA  MADRID BBVA  yields a very respectable 5 3  based on the past four payouts  and I expect BBVA s stock price to benefit from a major revaluation of the entire Spanish market over the next several quarters 
Spanish stocks are some of the most attractively priced in the world  Spanish stocks trade at a cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio   CAPE   of just 12 7    giving the market as a whole an expected return in excess of 7  per year over the next decade  This compares to a CAPE of more than 27 in the United States and flat expected returns 
BBVA is attractive for several reasons  First  despite being in beaten down Europe  it is not exclusively in Europe  Some of its biggest markets are the United States  Mexico and South America  BBVA is a global bank whose stock is treated as if it were completely dependent on Spain s broken economy 
Secondly  after multiple rounds of stress tests and capital reviews  BBVA finally capitulated and cut its dividend a little over a year ago  With that cut out of the way   an increasingly a distant memory   I expect income investors to gravitate towards BBVA s 5 3  yield  And finally  as I mentioned above  Spanish stocks as a whole are very inexpensive  and I expect a general revaluation of the entire market 
You ll also want to read on for an important note about European dividends and taxation 
Telefonica
Much of my rationale for BBVA is solid advice for fellow Spanish large cap Telefonica  MADRID TEF   NYSE TEF  
Telefonica is one of the largest telecom companies in the world  with an empire sprawling across 21 countries in Europe  Latin America and even China via its partnership with Chinese carrier China Unicom  NYSE CHU   Telefonica s businesses cover everything from mobile phone and internet service to paid TV 
Telecom is a brutally competitive business these days  particularly in the developed world where internet  cable TV  and mobile phone market penetration reached the saturation point years ago  But Telefonica s strong presence in the emerging world gives it built in growth 
As consumers continue to move from prepaid mobile plans to contract and data plans  Telefonica stands to increase its revenues per user without the heavy marketing costs associated with pulling users away from competitors 
Today  Telefonica s biggest risks come from currency fluctuations in Brazil rather than instability in Europe  This is a problem that may get a worse before getting better  as Brazil s political crisis stemming from the Petrobras bribery scandal shows no signs of abating  But I believe most of the bad news was priced in a long time ago 
Like BBVA  Telefonica found it necessary to cut its dividend due to fallout from the Eurozone debt crisis  In fact  in 2012 Telefonica slashed its dividend to zero  But after the market stabilized  Telefonica reinstated its dividend and hasn t looked back since 
At today s prices  Telefonica yields a very respectable 6 2  
Total SA
Next up  we have another solid European stock pick  French energy major Total SA  PARIS TOTF   NYSE TOT  
Energy stocks as a sector have gotten absolutely pounded over the past nine months due to the falling price of crude oil  and Total is no exception  Compounding the problem for U S  investors is the fact that Total is a European company whose shares are priced in depreciating euros 
Still  if you believe as I do that both the crude oil decline and the euro decline have mostly run their course for now  then the European oil majors are an intriguing value proposition  At current prices  Total sports a very impressive 5 9  dividend yield  Total has also been steadily increasing its dividend over the past three years 
Interestingly  in a bid to become more shareholder friendly  in 2011 Total moved away from the European norm of paying dividends semiannually to the American norm of paying quarterly  While this may seem minor  I applaud any attempt by management to be more responsive to shareholder needs 
Statoil ASA
Finally  we have Norwegian oil major Statoil ASA  NYSE STO   a company that has really emerged in recent years as a shareholder friendly dividend payer 
Statoil is an International Dividend Achiever  meaning that it has raised its dividend for a minimum of five consecutive years  Indeed  Statoil has raised its dividend for six years running and currently sports a yield of 5 4  
Statoil  which is majority owned by the Norwegian government  is best known for its role in bringing North Sea oil to market  But as the North Sea fields have matured  Statoil has aggressively expanded internationally and now has operations in 36 countries  And Statoil is   even amidst international sanctions 
Statoil s production costs are a little higher than some of the larger oil majors  and with crude prices under  90 per barrel  the company has to borrow to sustain its dividend and capital expenditures   
Yet management has repeatedly reiterated its commitment to its dividend and has indicated that it would sacrifice capital spending on growth projects if that is what was needed to preserve the dividend  And Statoil s manageable debt load allows it the flexibility to borrow if crude prices stay depressed for longer than expected 
Statoil s dividend has to be considered a little riskier than the others I ve covered here  but I still consider it safe enough to warrant investment 
Now  you re actually better off holding the European shares in a taxable brokerage account rather than an IRA if possible  That s because most European countries withhold taxes on dividends paid to U S  investors  For example  BBVA and Telefonica are subject to a 21  Spanish withholding tax  and Total is subject to a 30  French withholding tax  Statoil is subject to a lower 15  Norwegian withholding tax 
But while these taxes are a major irritant  all is not lost  You can recoup a lot of the foreign taxes paid via the Foreign Tax Credit  The math here is a little complicated  but I ll try to keep it simple  The credit is equal to whatever you would have paid in the U S  So  if you would have paid 15  on a U S  stock  you can get a credit for 15  paid to a foreign country  Using France as an example  you d recoup half of the 30  dividend tax withheld in France  But to take advantage of this  the shares have to be held in a taxable account ",2015-04-13,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-solid-dividend-stocks-with-5-plus-yields-248110,248110
