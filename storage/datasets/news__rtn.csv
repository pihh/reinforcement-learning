Dividend Growth Stocks for Assured Returns in 2020In a low interest rate environment  dividend investing has been a hot spot and seems an excellent choice for 2020  Though the strategy doesn t offer dramatic price appreciation  it is a major source of consistent income for investors in any type of market  In particular  focusing on the growth level in this strategy leads to higher returns Why is Dividend Growth Better Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Moreover  a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks

137938,359453,RTN,Raytheon  RTN  Q4 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"Raytheon  RTN  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 16 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 11 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 93 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 61   A quarter ago  it was expected that this defense contractor would post earnings of  2 85 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 08  delivering a surprise of 8 07  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Raytheon  which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense Equipment industry  posted revenues of  7 84 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 31   This compares to year ago revenues of  7 36 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Raytheon shares have added about 3 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 3  
What s Next for Raytheon 
While Raytheon has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Raytheon was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 06 on  7 20 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  12 91 on  31 40 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Aerospace   Defense Equipment is currently in the bottom 30  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/raytheon-rtn-q4-earnings-top-estimates-200503137,200503137

on to questions  Before I turn the call over to Tom  I d like to caution you regarding our forward looking statements  Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts  particularly comments regarding the company s future plans  objectives  and expected performance  and the proposed merger with UTC constitute forward looking statements  These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable  but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release  and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings  And with respect to the proposed merger and related matters in the definitive merger proxy statement filed with with us with the SEC on September 10th  2019 With that  I ll turn the call over to Tom Thomas A  Kennedy    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Kelsey  Good morning  everyone  Raytheon had a very successful year in 2019  and our global growth strategy is delivering record results for our shareholders and customers in many highlights and set many company records  So let me start by touching on some of our financial results In 2019  we continue to see strong global demand for innovative solutions  illustrated by our book to bill ratio of 1 54 in the fourth quarter and 1 25 for the full year  And for the third time in 2019  we achieved record backlog  which rose to almost  49 billion at the end of the year  This drove an increase in backlog of more than  6 billion year over year or up 15   and it positions us well for the future Sales were up 6 5  in the fourth quarter  and 7 8  for the full year  And in 2019  we accelerated our sales growth for the fifth time since 2015  this year  in the new company record for annual sales of  29 billion  EPS exceeded our expectations for the quarter and for the year  Cash flow was better than we expected  and we achieved a new company record for operating cash flow for the full year  Toby will review additional details about the fourth quarter and our 2020 outlook in a few minutes Now with all of our successes in 2019  I wanted to share what I see as some of Raytheon s key milestones during the year  Successes from across the company that will drive future growth  First  let me highlight the strength of both our classified business and our international business  In 2019  we achieved record classified bookings for the full year of almost  8 billion  and we saw strong classified bookings across the businesses including  2 8 billion at both missiles and IIS  and  2 1 billion at SAS Raytheon also had record classified sales  which grew 15  versus 2018 and represented 20  of company sales  Our strength in classified is driven in large part by the need of our domestic customers to address advanced threats as outlined in the National Defense Strategy  As we ve said before  classified business is crucial for Raytheon s growth and success  It funds next generation technology development that is integral to the long term growth of our future franchises and production awards We also achieved company records in our international business with both international bookings and sales at record levels for the year  International sales were  8 6 billion for the year  And year over year international sales have now increased for 16 consecutive years Turning to our franchises  We further strengthened many of them in 2019  to be long term value generators for years and decades to come  The newest example of this is our clean sheet offering for the US Army s next generation air and missile defense radar  In October  we are pleased to be selected to develop the lower tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor  which extends Raytheon s position as the world s premier air and missile defense radar capability provider for decades to come  We expect LTAMDS to have a potential lifetime value of over  20 billion from sales to domestic and international customers  LTAMDS will operate on the Army s integrated air and missile defense network Our Patriot franchise continued its momentum with the Kingdom of Bahrain signing an agreement in August to purchase Patriot  This letter of offer and acceptance allows the US government to begin contract negotiations with our Patriot team  Bahrain is the 17th nation to procure Patriot  With the US approval  all 17 of these Patriot partners will have the opportunity to add the LTAMDS capability to each of their fire units  This will enhance the performance and extend the life of their systems for many decades  In addition  the capabilities of the LTAMDS radar also opens up a market for stand alone forward deployed applications  Our Patriot system fires multiple interceptors  including our guidance enhanced missiles or GEM T And during the fourth quarter  we booked over  700 million on a direct commercial contract to provide GEM T missiles for an international customer  Demand for integrated air and missile defense solutions is also furthering growth in our NASAMS franchise  a mid range solution jointly manufactured by Raytheon and Kongsberg  In 2019  we added two new countries to the NASAMS  family  In May  we booked over  500 million to provide NASAMS for Australia  and in July  we received a  1 8 billion award to provide Qatar with NASAMS  Qatar is the 11th country to procure NASAMS  which uses a Raytheon radar and will be capable of firing multiple interceptors including our AMRAAM Extended Range and AIM 9X missiles As a result  NASAMS help support the growth of additional franchises  AMRAAM and AIM 9X  For AMRAAM  Raytheon is continuing the development of AMRAAM ER and expanding its capability to support land based applications  This significantly extends both the range of AMRAAM and the market of the NASAMS system  Qatar will be the launch customer of AMRAAM ER  As part of its procurement of the NASAMS system  we expect a foreign military sales contract award from Qatar for AMRAAM ER in 2021 Our airborne radar franchise was extended in July with our selection as a radar supplier for the B 52 radar modernization program  displacing the incumbent  Under the contract  Raytheon will design  develop  produce  and sustain AESA radar systems for the entire US Air Force B 52 fleet  With improved navigation  reliability  mapping  and detection range  the advanced radar upgrade will ensure the aircraft remains mission ready through 2050 and beyond And we continue to see strength across our Standard Missile franchise including the multi year award for SM 6  and then the bundle award for SM 3 Block IIA  both of which were booked in December  for a total award value of around  3 billion We still expect a multi year contract award for another SM 3 variant  SM 3 Block IB worth about  2 billion in the first half of 2020  The endo atmospheric SM 6 delivers a proven  over the horizon  offensive and defensive capability  and it supports the anti air warfare  anti surface warfare  and sea based terminal ballistic missile defense in one solution And the next generation SM 3 Block IIA interceptor defeats missile threats outside the earth s atmosphere and is produced in cooperation with Japan  With the recent and expected awards for our standard missile product lines  we have production visibility until at least 2026  Both the SM 3 Block IIA and IB are integral to MDA s position in missile defense This month after the quarter closed  IIS was selected by the US Air Force to develop the future operationally resilient ground evolution program  also known as FORGE  This newly developed open framework will be capable of processing Overhead Persistent Infrared satellite data from both the US Air Force s evolving SBIRS constellation  and the future Next Gen OPIR Constellation for missile warning Also in January  we were awarded the force element terminal by the US Air Force  which extends our protected communications franchise at SAS Finally  one of our most notable highlights of 2019 was announcing our transformational merger of equals with United Technologies  These two industry leading companies will create one of the best positioned aerospace and defense companies Raytheon Technologies will have a diversified platform agnostic suite of offerings that are balanced across end markets  which is a key differentiator through business cycles  The combined company will also have a vast global footprint  By combining our complementary technologies  we can go after and win an increased number of new franchises We expect the revenue synergy opportunities from our combined technologies to continue to be value generators for decades to come  Positioning the company to increase market share and outgrow the aerospace and defense markets  Integration planning for the merger is progressing well and the merger is targeted to close early in the second quarter of 2020 As we start the new year  we feel optimistic about the future in our ability to continue to grow  both domestically and internationally  We are pleased with the fiscal year  20 appropriations bill enacted in December with our Raytheon programs faring well and the DOD modernization account up versus fiscal year  19  In fiscal year  21  Budget Control Act caps were increased last year  So we have top line certainty and includes a modest increase in the DOD base budget  Perhaps best of all  fiscal year  21  is the last year of the BCA Bottom line  we have a strong foundation for the future  And this was recognized last week in Fortune magazine s annual survey  Raytheon was ranked the number one company in the aerospace and defense industry in the 2020 study of the World s Most Admired Companies  And this included number one rankings in key attribute categories  such as innovation  financial soundness  global competitiveness  and social responsibility Let me close by thanking all the members of the Raytheon team worldwide  When I think about our many successes in 2019  I do so with deep appreciation from our dedicated colleagues who made it possible  They are the ones helping the company grow and meet its commitments  the ones creating value for our shareholders  and the ones providing the trusted innovative solutions  our customers depend upon  Given the expected timing of the merger s close  this could well be the last earnings call for me and for the Raytheon Company  For nearly 100 years  this company has provided mission critical technologies to our customers  supported a diverse and engaged workforce  and has been a good corporate citizen  That legacy built on a foundation of trust  respect  collaboration  innovation  and accountability  will continue  And we are excited to redefine the future of the aerospace and defense industry as Raytheon Technologies With that let me turn the call over to Toby Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Tom  I have a few opening remarks  starting with the four quarter and full year results  Then I ll discuss our outlook for 2020  After that  we ll open up the call for questions  During my remarks  I ll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning  which are posted on our website On Pages 2 and 3  we have our fourth quarter and full year highlights and summary results for the year  We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in both the fourth quarter and the full year with bookings  sales  operating income  EPS  and operating cash flow that all met or exceeded our expectations We had record bookings in the fourth quarter at  12 1 billion  resulting in a book to bill ratio of 1 54  And for the year  we also had record bookings of  36 3 billion  resulting in a book to bill ratio of 1 25  This sets the stage for continued strong growth in 2020  which I ll discuss in more detail in just a few minutes  And we achieved record backlog of  48 8 billion  up 15  year over year Sales were  7 8 billion in the quarter  up 6 5  from the same period last year  We saw a growth across all of our businesses  For the year  sales were up 7 8  reaching a new company record of  29 2 billion Our EPS from continuing operations was  3 16 for the quarter and  11 92 for the full year  I will give a little more color on EPS in a few minutes We also generated strong operating cash flow of  2 8 billion for the quarter and  4 5 billion for the year  It s worth noting that we exceeded our operating cash flow guidance by approximately  400 million at the midpoint point and achieved a new company record for operating cash flow  This increase was driven by operations and improved working capital  The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of approximately  500 million Now turning to Page 4  Let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results  As I mentioned earlier  we had strong bookings of  12 1 billion in the quarter and  36 3 billion for the full year resulting in a record backlog of  48 8 billion  This is an increase to backlog of over  6 billion or 15  over year end 2018  and provides us with a strong foundation for the future International orders represented 28  of our total company bookings for both the quarter and the full year  At the end of 2019 approximately 38  of our total backlog was international Turning now to Page 5  We had fourth quarter sales of  7 8 billion  an increase of 6 5  compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations  International sales continue to be strong  representing 31  of our total sales for the fourth quarter and 29  for the full year of 2019 So looking at the businesses  IDS had net sales of  2 billion in the quarter  up 18  from the same period in 2018  primarily due to higher net sales on an international air and missile defense system program awarded in the third quarter 2019 and an international missile defense radar program IIS had net sales of  1 7 billion in Q4  up 2  compared with Q4 2018 Net sales at missile Systems in the fourth quarter were  2 3 billion  up compared with the same period in 2018  And for the full year  missile sales of  8 7 billion were up 5  over 2018  It s worth noting that Missiles had strong bookings performance for the full year 2019 with bookings up 23  over the prior year In the fourth quarter 2019  SAS had net sales of  2 billion  The 7  increase from the fourth quarter 2018 was primarily driven by higher sales on classified programs  the Next Gen OPIR program  and tactical communication systems programs For the full year  total company sales were  29 2 billion up 7 8  over full year 2018 Moving ahead to Page 6  We delivered strong operational performance in the quarter  Our operating margin was 16 3  for the total company  On a business segment basis  our operating margin was 12 7   up 70 basis points and higher than Q4 2018  primarily due to higher net program efficiencies  Total business segment operating income of  993 million grew  109 million or 12  in the quarter So now looking at the business margins  IDS fourth Quarter 2019 operating margin was strong at 15 5   up 80 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 IIS operating margin of 8 6  was up 20 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 and better than expectations Missile s operating margin was 12 7  in the quarter  up 90 basis points compared to Q4 2018  The fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from a favorable change in program mix and higher net program efficiencies SAS fourth quarter 2019 operating margin was 13 8  and in line with the fourth quarter of 2018  And SAS had a  21 million gain from the sale of real estate  which was assumed in our fourth quarter 2019 guidance Turning to Page 7  We had solid operating margin performance for the year  Our operating margin was 16 4  for the total company and 12 1  on a business segment basis  an increase of 10 basis points compared with 2018 Total business segment operating income was  3 5 billion in 2019  and was up  290 million for the year or 9  over full year 2018 On Page 8  you ll see both the fourth quarter and full year EPS  In the fourth quarter 2019  our EPS was  3 16 and for the full year was  11 92  Both the quarter and full year were higher than the comparable periods in 2018  primarily driven by operational improvements from higher sales volume and favorable pension related items Overall  we had strong operating performance for both the quarter and full year Now  let me update you on our 2020 outlook on Page 9  As we sit here today  we currently see the book to bill ratio above 1  and would expect to achieve another record backlog year  We also see strong sales growth for 2020 for the underlying Raytheon business of 6  to 8  over our 2019 results  Additionally  we expect growth across all of our businesses  we would expect IDS and SAS  our highest margin businesses  to have higher growth rates than the others  both with expected sales growth of 6  to 8  versus 2019 And at IIS  we d expect sales growth of 4  to 6  At Missiles  we would expect sales growth of 5  to 7  Although not on the page  I want to spend a minute talking about our expectations for the first quarter of 2020  We remain confident in our growth rate of 6  to 8  for the full year 2020  We expect the first quarter sales growth to be in the low single digits  due to a tough comp with last year s first quarter  We see the sales growth profile of 2020 second half weighted with sales ramping up throughout the year  which is driven by the strong bookings in the second half of 2019 Before concluding  I want to touch on the pending merger with United Technologies  The collaborative merger efforts and integration planning between Raytheon and United Technologies are continuing to progress well  We look forward to the next steps in the process including continue to work closely with regulatory authorities in the US and other jurisdictions to secure the required clearances and approvals for the merger  We are targeting the merger to close early in the second quarter of 2020  And post closing  we look forward to Raytheon Technologies delivering strong free cash flow growth and deploying a significant amount of its free cash flow to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends  Let me conclude by saying that 2019 was a very successful year for Raytheon where we once again delivered strong financial results  We set many new company records in 2019 including record operating cash flow backlog bookings and sales  and records for both sales and bookings in the classified and international areas  We have a strong balance sheet  which gives us a strong foundation as we move forward with the merger  And our business segments are well positioned to grow in 2020 and beyond  So with that  we ll open the call up for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions   The first question will come from the line of Carter Copeland  Please go ahead Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystHey  good morning  guys  And thanks for the time Thomas A  Kennedy    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Carter   Speech Overlap Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystI hope post the close  we don t lose the Boston sports banter on this  on this whole call  It s a bright spot of the week  so   Speech Overlap Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLet s go Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystYeah  we got to do it  So just a quick clarification and a question  just on the IDS growth Toby  it seems like for a 3Q19 award  the impact on the top line is pretty fast  Was that work that was done that got on contract  I just wonder if you could help us with that And then Tom  I wondered if you could give us some color on where the customer is kind of thinking are heading on the 3DELRR and the change there  Thanks Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  so on IDS  Carter  we re real pleased with their performance for the quarter in the year  The 12  growth they delivered in  19 was real strong  But  yeah  you got it right  There was some inventory liquidation that took place in order to ensure we had the right schedule  scheduled cadence on the program going forward Thomas A  Kennedy    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd on the 3DELRR  You may remember we initially won that back in 2014  with the techno   and there was a bunch of protests and everything else like that  So it s kind of a program that kind of got off to kind of an interesting start with the protest  But in any case  the technology baseline was  it was back in about 2008  when essentially the whole solicitation effort started with the Air Force  And as you can imagine  by time we got started after the protests  there were many advancements in technology since then  but we had a baseline that was kind of rigid  And it was also under the older   we call it  the acquisition strategies or techniques that the department has  and so a couple of things they wanted to do  One is they wanted to refresh on the technology  And then the other one is to get more into an OTA structure  where they thought they could get the program through faster  And so they re going to do it  go off and conduct an Industry Day here shortly  Lot more details Part of that is they re going to try to do a sense off that was very similar to what the United States Army did with the LTAMDS radar  And if you guys remember that last year they conducted a sense off  and in the end game  we went up winning that program with the solution that we brought to the sense off Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  the only thing I would add  given the state of where the program was that from a development point of view  it doesn t have a material impact on our financial results for 2020  and even the next year or two beyond that OperatorThank you  Your next response is from Sheila Kahyaoglu  Please go ahead Sheila Kahyaoglu    Jefferies   Company  Inc     AnalystHi  good morning  Tom  and Toby  and Kelsey   Speech Overlap  Tom  while we have you  how do we think about IDS and profitability mix given FMS sales pickup and just the cadence of those  And related to that  how do we think about Patriot international opportunities with the LTAMDS win in the US Thomas A  Kennedy    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the IDS has a really bright future  Number one  is they have the largest content of international  but they ve also developed some key franchises here recently  the Air and Missile Defense Radar  the SPY 6 for the DDG 51  They also developed the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar for the Navy  And as you know  the Navy is pushing for 350 ships  a lot of them are going to be frigates and the EASR has been already designated as the radar for those frigates  So that s  I think that s good for their moving forward They also won the lower tier Air Missile Defense Sensor  which is the LTAMDS for Patriot  And as we mentioned during the scripts  that s got about a  20 billion future here both between domestic and international customers  just last year  Bahrain became our 17th country that has the Patriot system  So we have 17 countries that we work with on the Patriot system  Obviously they re buying spares  the aftermarket efforts in those areas  but they also continue to buy new solutions for the Patriot system  and now we have a brand new solution  brand Phonetic  new Phonetic   that significantly enhances the capability of the Patriot system called the LTAMDS radar  And there s about an opportunity for over 240 of those radars here over the next  next decade or so So they re are very strong all across the board in terms of new franchises coming on board  refreshing the Patriot franchise on international marketplace  They ve done quite well by balancing both the FMS  which has higher margins than the domestic  but also bringing on quite a bit of  that we call DCS  direct commercial sales business which has higher margins than the FMS So all in all  I think IDS is on a very strong foundation  but they ve built  I call a launch pad for increased success through the decade Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And maybe I can just add a little bit  And I ll start  Sheila  at the highest level of the company  Right  So we re not giving guidance for 2020 consistent with what we said back in October  But that said  I would tell you  specifically around margins  nothing s changed  Right  We still see the opportunity and to improve margins incrementally going forward  improve our operating income overall  number one  As far as IDS and their FMS DCS mix  in the near term  yes  that s a headwind  It s a good problem to have  given the volume of the FMS were coming in  and we still have solid DCS work  I would tell you and remind you  I think you all know  right  IDS has been historically  our highest margin business  we expect that to continue in the future  And we talked about the improved margin in Q4 for the company  a lot of it through net program efficiencies  IDS was a big contributor to that  and we d expect strong performance from IDS going forward Let me just expand to a little bit on LTAMDS  because back when we were awarded in October  we mentioned that it   the contract vehicle here is an OTA  Given that  I think as folks know  that does require periods of investment  And we re going to experience that here for Raytheon  We have been spending on this for a while  As Tom alluded to leading up to the sense off and the hardware  we delivered there  We re delivering six production representative units under the contract  It s about a three year effort  The majority of the costs are going to be incurred in 2020  and you might have seen in our release  we took a  13 million expense at the corporate level related to LTAMDS  We re managing this as a corporate project given the strategic significance tied back to the  20 billion opportunity  The stand alone opportunities  and consistent with that  we ll be recording in expense throughout the year at the corporate level  probably in the  200 million range  plus or minus  And then it would tail off into 2021 as well There is no impact on the IDS margins or the IDS segment margins as a result of that OperatorYour next response is from Cai Von Rumohr  please go ahead Cai Von Rumohr    SG Cowen Securities Inc     AnalystYes  Thank you  So you had mentioned that your fastest growth  which is IDS and SAS  which are your higher margin  highest margin business  Excluding the  200 million investment in LTAMDS  I mean  should we assume that your margins  if you were a stand alone company would be up Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So I think  Cai  again both for 2020 and beyond  I think we ve been consistent  Right  We are on a path to incrementally on an annual basis improved margins  Our segment margins were up 10 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018  That said  we do have to think about mix impacts  and as Sheila asked  and I just mentioned  we do see some mix with more FMS  less DCS in IDS  but we are focused on operational excellence in driving more efficiencies through the business  Missiles as an example  we expect their margins to be improved after some of the challenges they had in 2019  we expect their margins to improve in 2020  But they re still dealing with more development work  more classified work  Again big picture  kind of punch line is  yes  as a stand alone business  we would expect the company s segment margins to incrementally improve in 2020 and beyond OperatorThank you  Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton  please go ahead Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystThanks  good morning Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Myles Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystI m focused on the remaining 19  for Forcepoint in the quarter  I m just curious if that now allows you to or pushes you to pursue a process there  And also how indicative is the price you paid for Vista to what you think you ll get in the open market Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystAnd maybe Toby  can you just give us  where the pension ended  Thanks Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  sure  So let me start with the Forcepoint part of your question  So you know look  back to when we acquired Websense almost five years ago  we had disclosed the liquidity rights that both sides had  I think  we invest  it had been aligned all along  Right  Ultimately the end game here was to monetize the investment in Forcepoint  They chose to do it through the the put process  We followed a very stipulated process per our agreement with Vista  We had outside advisors involved  and among other things  it took into account market conditions  comparable trading companies  etc  So  at the time  yeah  we think it is indicative of that  Obviously  at the end of the day  we still want to monetize the asset  We re going to do that in a smart way  evaluate all of our options  The whole software security market continues to trade pretty favorably here  And as we move along  we ll be looking to do what makes the most sense for the company and shareholders around that Switching over to the pension  we had a return of about 19  for last year compared to our 7 5  long term assumptions  a discount rate that we re using for 2020 now is down about 100 basis points from what it was last year  It s at 3   And we also did through our normal process update our long term return on asset assumptions  and we reduced that from 7 5  to 7   That all said  I ll just remind everyone that once the merger closes  because of purchase accounting  there will be some significant changes in this area  SAS operating and non operating expense will improve as a result of that  and I think also to keep in mind  there will not be an impact on our cash recovery  If you want to think of that from a cash flow perspective  the cash recovery stays intact OperatorYour next response is from David Strauss  please go ahead David Strauss    Barclays    AnalystThanks  good morning Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  David   Speech Overlap Thomas A  Kennedy    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi  David Kelsey DeBriyn    Vice President  Investor RelationsGood morning  David David Strauss    Barclays    AnalystI want to ask about the cash flow  obviously very strong performance this year  I think it came in the  700 million or so above what you were thinking or what was in the S 4  Does any of that representing sort of working capital pull forward that you had expected to come through in  20  Because I know what s in the S 4  it looks like it reflects a pretty big working capital benefit  And then I think capex came in a little lighter than what you were thinking  Can you just address kind of the capex profile from here as well Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Sure  sure  So  on the cash flow  I m real pleased with how the company performed and delivered and over achieved in this area  And it was from improvements in working capital  right  All program operational related  That said  again  we re not giving guidance for 2020  but I would expect  excluding the effects of the merger  right  So taking the merger related cost and cash impacts out of it  I d expect stronger cash flow in 2020  Right  Despite the over performance in 2019  So said another way  it s not a timing issue  right  It s not  it s not moving from one year to another  and again  I think that s indicative of our focus on running the business  executing the business  and obviously having a strong balance sheet here for the first part of your question Secondly on capex  a couple of things  Right  We had talked about 2019 being a peak year for capital spending  We still feel that way  even though it did come in a little below what the original expectation was  As far as 2020 goes  we d expect it to be down a little bit further  albeit slightly of the the reduction compared to what we were expecting in 2019  Some of that was permanent where we found ways to do things more efficiently and a little bit of it was timing that moved from 2019 to 2020  but again more on a downward trajectory consistent with what we had said at this time last year OperatorThank you  your next response is from George Shapiro  please go ahead George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystYes  good morning Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi  George Kelsey DeBriyn    Vice President  Investor Relations Speech Overlap  Good morning  George George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystToby  can you tell us what s actually happened in Missiles  I mean  the sales growth this quarter clearly came below your revised guidance  and for 2020  we re not expecting a lot of growth  On the positive  the margin got a lot better  But what s happened on the sales side for kind of compared to what we re seeing Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  sure  So for Q4  overall at the company level  the 6 5  growth that contributed to the 7  Phonetic  8  Phonetic  for the year  that was within the range we expected  You re right  missiles was a bit lower than we previously expected  We saw a little bit more strength in some of the other businesses  The way to think of Missiles sales in the fourth quarter was really some supplier delivery volume on a couple of production programs that we were expecting  didn t materialize  and we had a few awards that had some inventory liquidations that again we re a little less than expected  That said  the way to think of Missiles going forward as they close the year real strong  as I mentioned  relative to their bookings being up 23  year over year Tom in his opening comments spoke about  3 billion worth of awards in the Standard Missile family  They came in the fourth quarter  We have the   and one of those was the  one of the two multi years that we had previously talked about  The second multi year for the SM 3 IB  we expect in the first half of this year  So we believe all that taken as a whole supports and provides for a foundation for missiles to grow at a higher rate than we saw in Q4  Again  in the 5  to 7  rate for the year OperatorYour next response is from Robert Stallard  Please go ahead Robert Stallard    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystThanks so much  Good morning Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Rob Thomas A  Kennedy    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Rob Kelsey DeBriyn    Vice President  Investor RelationsGood morning  Rob Robert Stallard    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystThomas this could be your last opportunity  I was wondering if you could give us your usual run through of what you re seeing at the moment in some of these key export markets  Can you see another good year of bookings  I was wondering how that could progress from here Thomas A  Kennedy    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I ll start off  Let s start off in Europe  We have seen significant uptick over the last several years in Europe  a lot of it has been the pressure from our administration to push these countries to get to a 2   the NATO countries to 2  of their GDP for defense  So we have seen an uptick there in Patriot  countries like Romania and Sweden buying the Patriot System was part of that  but we also have additional opportunities in that region for Integrated Air and Missile Defense and upgrading their systems  military systems across the board Over in the Middle East  there continues to be an issue of significant demand for our solution set  As we recently saw in Iraq  anyone who has forces in that region needs to have Integrated Air and Missile Defense capabilities  and to defend their troops and there resources and their infrastructure  So we are seeing significant demands across the region for Integrated Air and Missile defense solutions that range all the way from countering drones to ballistic missiles to cruise missiles  So it s right in our sweet spot  And again we re doing quite well in that region already  but we see significant upside potential in the Middle East And in the Asia Pacific region  North Korea has not quieted down  They re still doing testing  So there is considerable concern relative to the   for example  South Korea  and then also Japan  Also in Korea  you don t see it out there in the press a lot  but there is going to be a hand off of the defense of South Korea from the US government to the South Korean government  and that s going to provide an uptick  the requirement for us to be able to help provide the South Koreans the solutions they need to maintain their defense in that region at them as a primary defender And then also relative to Japan  significant uptick there  not just from the North Korea issue  but also from the pressures from China  I think there is considerable push from China  as we know expansionism relative to the first and second island chains  Japan wants to make sure they have a defense against that  So that is requiring some higher end solution sets that we are working with the Japanese government to provide So in all the regions that we really participate in  in Europe  and the Middle East  and also in the Asia Pacific region  we are seeing significant demand signals for our solution sets across the board  Obviously  we have created a bunch of new solution sets  like the SPY 6 radar  the EASR  now with the LTAMDS radar  so we had new solutions to bring to those markets  and we re working that very hard Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd Rob  I just from a quantitative point of view  just reinforcing  We mentioned last year was a record year for international  including bookings  So we re seeing the results of that threat environment that Tom just walked through  materialized in our results  We talked about a 1 25 book to bill  both the domestic and international book to bill were plus or minus in that ballpark  Right  So it was not one side of the house  if you will driving the growth  We said 28  of the bookings were international  38  of the backlog  29  of the sales  and plus or minus  we d expect that same level of contribution from both in 2020 as well OperatorYour next response is from Seth Seifman  Please go ahead Seth Seifman    J P  Morgan    AnalystThanks very much  and good morning Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Seth   Speech Overlap OperatorToby  if I  just to look at the guidance for the individual segments and the proportion of the company  It looks like the growth for 2020 would come in more at the 6 end then at the 8 end  is that the right takeaway at this point  And where might there be potential upside Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think  the way I think of it  right  you got to think of it  is that ranges 6  to 8   Right  We re not specific beyond that  Don t forget that s total sales  Right  Don t have on the chart  We didn t talk about what would happen with elimination  So those numbers exclude eliminations which are closer to in line  We expect them to be more in line with 2019  So I think that may be part of what is  drove you to the question  You did there from the 6  versus either a midpoint or something else  That said  I mean  we re confident in the range  Right  The 6  to 8   the strong backlog  the  49 billion in backlog  up 15  growth across all the businesses  We see that happening consistent with what we ve laid out there  so no concerns on our end OperatorYour next response is from Peter Arment  Please go ahead Peter Arment    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystYeah  thanks  good morning  Tom  Toby Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning   Speech Overlap Peter Arment    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystTom  we know  Yeah  we know you re not going anywhere  So  but thanks for all your guidance over the years  But  hey Toby  just back to kind of  I guess  follow up on Seth s question  If we look at the 6  to 8  and offer the base to 2019  and we re going to compare it to the S 4  really seems closer to the 2021 numbers that you had out there  not the 2020  I guess  What would you highlight as the differences  I assume LTAMDS might be one of them or something  Thanks Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So actually LTAMDS would not be one  Peter  just because of the nature of the OTA and the kind of  as I described before the funded R D concept  Right now we re not recording revenue on that  We re really treating it as funded R D and the related expense that I talked about earlier  Just as a reminder  from the origin of that S 4 data  you know  we talked about in the S 4  the process that led to the merger and the timeline around that and that S 4 data  the origin of it pre dated that  Right  So you got to go back to the the 2018 timeframe for when we pulled that together  and I think the simplest way to think of it is  last year we ended 2018 with a backlog growth of 11   that was better than our expectations  because our bookings were higher and a similar thing happened here with the 15  increase  including multiple increases in the bookings outlook throughout 2019  So really tie it back to the strong bookings growth and the translation into the  49 billion in backlog that s driving   and as you did the math  the absolute dollar profile compared to the data in the S 4  Just shows the underlying strength of the business and how well positioned the portfolio was OperatorYour next response is from Hunter Keay  Please go ahead Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    AnalystHey  good morning  Thanks Anthony F  O Brien    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Hunter Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    AnalystGood morning  Obviously  not much you can say on this topic  but a high level  how is the classified arena evolving as you think about areas of priority  And can you just help us understand the pro forma RTX exposure to that market once the deal is closed  I asked the question  because I didn t really hear you guys talk a lot about hypersonics in your prepared remarks  either  So if you want to  Speech Overlap  Thanks Thomas A  Kennedy    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Hunter  let me just talk a little bit about the classified  I mean obviously  you re right  It s the reason it is classified as you can t talk about it  but in any case  it s really driven out of the National Defense Strategy  which really outlined this next generation capability that United States needs to be able to defend itself against these new evolving threats  And that really sets  I would say the overarching requirement  And then from there  we go down to what actually it has to occur  And there s all the areas of   the NDS calls out the fact that we need to protect space  and so there s a whole set of efforts going on to ensure we protect space or space assets  the assets that we need  just in our economy  but also for the defense of our nation  So that s a large area there There is also a large area and the  I would call it missile defense capabilities  And how do we defend our nation against a missile  intercontinental ballistic missile threat or other types of threats  like hypersonic weapons  So there s a whole counter hypersonics and counter advanced intercontinental ballistic missile threat type work that s going on And then there s the whole issue of the South China Sea and our ability to be able to maintain a presence there  keep those sea lanes open  and what type type of technologies we need there and what advanced capabilities we need  So that s the other major threat  But it all starts with the National Defense Strategy  And it s driven our business up  We have a solid set of not just franchises  but we also have a solid set of technical capabilities across the Company that we re seeing in significant demand to satisfy these needs  I would call it classified requirements  needs driven out of the National Defense Strategy And that s driven our sales up 20  of our company sales this year has been classified  And I ve said this on calls in the past  but this classified work  we use this term  is the sea corn for our future franchises  What I mean by that is this classified work  it allows us to take our technical capabilities and resources and IP  and it work hand in glove with our customers to evolve the next set for our sake franchises that will enable our customers to meet their mission needs and especially relative to the NDS  And so  I think one way of looking at this for Raytheon is  the greater the amount of classified work we have  the stronger our future will be in our ability to generate new franchises that lasts for decades to come  And the classified bookings represented 22  of our total bookings in  19  it was up 17  over 2018  again setting a new company record  And I think it just sets  it sets the company up for a great future to come OperatorThat s all the time we have today  Operator Closing Remarks  Duration  53 minutesCall participants Kelsey

137943,359458,RTN,RTN Vs  AJRD  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Aerospace   Defense Equipment sector have probably already heard of Raytheon  RTN  and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings  AJRD   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Raytheon has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that RTN has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
RTN currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 11  while AJRD has a forward P E of 26 10  We also note that RTN has a PEG ratio of 1 60  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  AJRD currently has a PEG ratio of 4 75 
Another notable valuation metric for RTN is its P B ratio of 5 03  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  AJRD has a P B of 7 23 
Based on these metrics and many more  RTN holds a Value grade of B  while AJRD has a Value grade of D 
RTN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than AJRD  so it seems like value investors will conclude that RTN is the superior option right now ",2020-02-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rtn-vs-ajrd-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200504011,200504011
137967,359482,RTN,StockBeat  Bargain Hunter BAE Hits 18 Mo High  Anglo Snaps up Sirius,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com     Who can resist a bargain 
Not mining giant   Anglo American    LON AAL   apparently  Nor  for that matter  defense giant BAE Systems  LON BAES   both of whom have announced opportunistic acquisitions on Monday 
But the two deals have very different backgrounds and outlooks  and have provoked correspondingly different reactions 
BAe s shares rose as much as 3 2  to an 18 month high after it said it would buy two military businesses that U S  antitrust regulators are forcing Raytheon  NYSE RTN  and United Technologies  NYSE UTX  to sell as part of their proposed merger 
That merger was always likely to end in some rare and valuable assets coming on to the market  and the highly regulated nature of the defense business meant that BAe had relatively little competition for them  As a result  it s been able to pick up Raytheon s Airborne Tactical Radios business for  275m and Collins Aerospace s Military Global Positioning System business for  1 925 billion  Both deals are cheap enough to fund via cash and new debt alone 
BAe said it expects the deals to be immediately accretive to margins and earnings  and combined tax benefits of some  365 million make the deal even sweeter   
The other big deal of the morning is a less clear cut affair   Anglo American   LON AAL  has also snapped up what    at least on paper    has the potential to be a lucrative asset  literally for pennies  It s agreed to buy Sirius Minerals  the owner of a huge prospective potash mine under a corner of northern England  for 5 5 pence a share  or 400 million pounds   520 million    barely 15  of the peak valuation in 2016 
Anglo s shares fell 0 2  on the news  although they still outperformed other FTSE listed rivals that were hit by profit taking after drifting higher recently on increased optimism for global growth  That optimism will be tested at 8 AM ET by the publication of the IMF s latest growth forecasts 
Sirius  main asset is a huge resource of polyhalite  a mineral that it says can be commercialized into potash fertilizer  which raises the productivity of arable land  But the startup ran out of money last year after failing to raise debt to complete the mine  having already spent  1 1 billion on it  That task  with all the associated project risk which includes almost 40 kilometers of underground tunnelling and sharp increases in heavy traffic in an area protected because of its natural beauty  now falls to Anglo  On the upside  the U K  now has a government that has made expansive promises to rejuvenate the economy of northern England  something that will generate at least some political tailwind 
By 5 AM ET  1000 GMT   BAe was up 2 6   while the FTSE 100 was down 0 3   supported by housebuilding stocks after data from Rightmove showed the biggest ever increase in U K  house prices for a January 
The Stoxx 600 benchmark was down 0 2  at 423 60  while the German DAX was down 0 1  ",2020-01-20,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-bargainhunter-bae-hits-18mo-high-anglo-snaps-up-sirius-2063044,2063044

United Technologies makes electronics  communications and other equipment for mainly commercial plane makers whereas Raytheon primarily supplies the U S  government with military aircraft and missile equipment

137972,359487,RTN,Raytheon  RTN  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Raytheon  RTN   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Raytheon currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if RTN is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this defense contractor holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For RTN  shares are up 3 1  over the past week while the Zacks Aerospace   Defense Equipment industry is up 1 13  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 4  compares favorably with the industry s 1 98  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Raytheon have increased 13 48  over the past quarter  and have gained 43 99  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 13 01  and 28 65   respectively 
Investors should also take note of RTN s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  RTN is averaging 1 180 129 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with RTN 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost RTN s consensus estimate  increasing from  11 86 to  11 88 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that RTN is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Raytheon on your short list ",2020-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/raytheon-rtn-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200497703,200497703
137973,359488,RTN,3 Reasons Why Raytheon  RTN  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Raytheon  RTN  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this defense contractor a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Raytheon is 11 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 8 4  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 3  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Raytheon is 30 4   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 5  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 4 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Raytheon have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Raytheon a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

This combination indicates that Raytheon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2020-01-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-raytheon-rtn-is-a-great-growth-stock-200498428,200498428
137974,359489,RTN,Consolidations To Lift Aerospace Defense Equipment Stocks,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises firms that manufacture a wide variety of vital components for the aerospace defense space  ranging from aerostructures  space shuttles  propulsion systems  aircraft engines  defense electronics  missile and radar systems to flight test equipment  structural adhesives  instrumentation and control systems  communication products and many more  A few of these companies also offer integrated simulation and training services to the U S  defense force While the majority of revenues is generated from production of the aforementioned accompaniments  the industry players also generate revenues by providing notable aftermarket support and services like maintenance  repair and overhaul activities to defense players  A prominent stock in this industry is Transdigm Group Inc   TDG  Here are the three major industry themes While rising competition has frequently prompted industry majors to expand their product lines through small and medium sized acquisitions  lately  there have been some big mergers in the industry  These can be attributed to the growing importance of cost reduction initiatives and increased control over production procedures  Speaking of such mergers  aerospace parts makers and suppliers  Hexcel Corporation  HXL  and Woodward entered into an all stock merger of equals agreement in January  The deal  worth  6 4 billion  will give birth to one of the top independent aerospace and defense suppliers globally  Such consolidations by leading industry players should improve economies of scale for the aerospace defense equipment industry as a whole   Being the largest digitally advanced nation  the United States is rapidly enhancing its electronic warfare  C4ISR  Command  Control  Communication  Computers  Intelligence  Surveillance and Reconnaissance  and cyber security measures  following frequent cyber attacks that affected a number of countries last year  According to Markets and Markets firm  the global C4ISR market is expected to witness CAGR of 3 6  from 2017 to 2022 to reach  119 4 billion  with North America dominating the market  This should further boost prospects of the stocks in this space  especially those providing defense electronics  U S  labor market statistics apparently reflect strong growth trends with the nation s unemployment rate reaching a 50 year low of 3 5  in September 2019  However  a deeper analysis shows that all is not well  The majors low labor force participation rate  which means fewer people are finding a place in the labor force   either because they lack the skills to enter it or are falling out of it  Now  the U S aerospace defense equipment industry  which employed more than 2 5 million workers as of the end of 2018  needs highly skilled labor  Unfortunately  U S  population growth rate has been decelerating since 1992  So  the working age population is not growing fast enough to meet the demand  To this end  a skills gap  from Deloitte and National Association of Manufacturers projected in 2018 that more than half of the 4 6 million manufacturing jobs created throughout the next decade will go unfilled  This remains a concern for growth of the aerospace defense equipment industry Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Gloomy OutlookThe Zacks Aerospace Defense Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  186  which places it in the bottom 27  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group s earnings growth potential in recent times  Evidently  the industry s earnings estimates for the current fiscal year have gone down by 1 7  since Dec 31 Before we present a few aerospace defense equipment stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Outperforms S P 500 and SectorThe Aerospace Defense Equipment industry has outperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite as well as its own sector over the past year  The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 45 8   while the Aerospace sector has gained 26 9   However  the Zacks S P 500 composite has rallied 27 6  in the same timeframe One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12 month EV Sales  which is used for valuing capital intensive stocks like aerospace defense equipment  the industry is currently trading at 2 55X compared with the S P 500 s 3 29X and the sector s 1 75X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 2 55X  as low as 1 91X  and at the median of 2 32X  as the charts show below EV Sales Ratio  TTM Bottom LineThe fiscal 2020 budget indicates 5  growth from last fiscal s approved budget spending  Such hawkish spending provisions for the U S  Department of Defense  DoD   along with accelerating commercial aircraft production on account of rapidly rising global air traffic  should keep U S  Aerospace Defense Equipment stocks  momentum alive Although the industry s dismal rank and workforce related issue remain concerns  considering its price performance history and merger oriented growth prospects  investors may bet on a few stocks from

138001,359516,RTN,Why Raytheon Stock Soared 43  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares in space  intelligence  and defense company Raytheon  NYSE RTN  soared 43 3  in 2019  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  Besides excellent execution by the company  the market has warmed to the idea of the upcoming merger with the aerospace businesses of United Technologies  NYSE UTX   

The improvement in Raytheon s performance through 2019 can be seen in the upgrade of its full year guidance  Here s a look the full year guidance given at the start of 2019 and the update in the third quarter earnings report in October 

Data source  Raytheon  
Not only has Raytheon executed well off of its existing backlog  but it s also doing a good job of winning new orders  As of the third quarter  Raytheon s backlog was  44 6 billion  representing growth of 7  compared with the same period last year  Throw in billions of dollars of contracts awarded at the end of the year  and the company looks well placed to meet analyst expectations for 7  revenue growth in 2020  
So what
Since Raytheon is merging with United Technologies  aerospace businesses  Pratt   Whitney and Collins Aerospace   you could argue that Raytheon s share price is also reflecting the performance of the latter  Indeed  an analysis of United Technologies  earnings in 2019 clearly shows that its aerospace businesses are the outperformers  The commercial aviation aftermarket exceeded most expectations  and Pratt   Whitney appears to have ironed out most of its technical issues with the geared turbofan engine on the Airbus A320neo 
All told  the performance of both companies augurs well for the merger in 2020  And based on the estimates given in United Technologies  Securities and Exchange Commission filings  both stocks look like good values  
Now what
Raytheon investors will be looking out for continued defense orders while keeping an eye on United Technologies  aerospace business  and the commercial aviation market in particular  United Technologies has a pretty good record of integrating acquisitions  not least Collins Aerospace and Goodrich   and Raytheon investors will be hoping that continues ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phet6,2058091

	The indices had one of their worst sessions in weeks on Friday after news broke that the U S  killed Iran s top military leader in an airstrike  The losses snapped the S P s five week winning streak  though the NASDAQ hung on and now has its own winning run  
	So add another uncertainty onto the pile  In just the few days since the airstrike  Iran and President Trump have been trading threats  
	The market is bracing for a retaliation from Iran  which could include cyber threats on top of military action

	In fact  President Trump plans to sign the Phase 1 deal later this month  and then make his way to Beijing to talk about Phase 2   
	Can you imagine the reaction to this airstrike if the market had been in one of its bad moods  How much would stocks have plunged if it came during the recession scare from a few months ago

138036,359551,RTN,Turkey Says Russian Missiles Key Issue in Meeting With Trump,news," Bloomberg     Turkey s purchase of an advanced Russian missile system will top the agenda for Recep Tayyip Erdogan s meeting with Donald Trump on Wednesday  a  critical  meeting that s set to shape the future of ties with the U S   the Turkish president s top aide said 
Turkey s relationship with its key NATO ally has been strained by a series of rows  from disagreements over the Turkish offensive in Syria to Ankara s decision to purchase the Russian made S 400 air defense system 
Erdogan sees this week s encounter at the White House as crucial to reconcile those differences  his Communications Director Fahrettin Altun told Bloomberg late Monday 
But obstacles to improved relations remain  Erdogan insists the Russian system will be activated soon  defying calls from Washington to hold off 
In Syria  where Americans have long been allied with Kurdish forces that Turkey regards as terrorists  Trump s decision to pull out U S  troops led to an invasion by Turkish forces  The military campaign against the Kurds touched off an international outcry and led to demands by members of both parties in Congress for sanctions against the Erdogan government 
Even before the Syria crisis  U S  lawmakers were pushing the administration to impose sanctions on Ankara for buying the Russian military hardware  citing risks to the American F 35 fighter jet  Turkey was suspended from the joint program that produces the warplane because of the purchase 
Why What Happens in Syria Matters Beyond Its Borders  QuickTake
 We have repeatedly expressed our stance  on the S 400s  Altun said  referring to Erdogan s long held view that the Russian missiles are absolutely necessary for Turkey s national security 
 Geopolitics require Turkey to have multiple air and missile defense systems  When we expressed our desire to buy the Patriots  the U S  set a condition for us to not purchase the S 400s   Altun said  referring to the Patriot missiles manufactured by Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co 
Erdogan said late last week that he was prepared to buy Patriots if the terms were right 
Altun s remarks highlight the difficulty of reconciling Turkey s position on air defense with that of Washington  a rift that has threatened to derail the decades long alliance between the two countries 
 I m confident Erdogan and Trump will have an honest discussion on this  I believe the two leaders can find a solution that s acceptable and can be implemented   he added ",2019-11-11,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/turkey-says-russian-missiles-key-issue-in-meeting-with-trump-2018352,2018352

138045,359560,RTN,Is Raytheon  RTN  Stock Outpacing Its Aerospace Peers This Year ,opinion,"The Aerospace group has plenty of great stocks  but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers  Is Raytheon  RTN  one of those stocks right now  By taking a look at the stock s year to date performance in comparison to its Aerospace peers  we might be able to answer that question 
Raytheon is a member of our Aerospace group  which includes 33 different companies and currently sits at  1 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors 
The Zacks Rank is a successful stock picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months  RTN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Within the past quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTN s full year earnings has moved 1 23  higher  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive

138046,359561,RTN,Raytheon  RTN  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Raytheon  RTN  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this defense contractor is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Raytheon is 11 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 11 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 11 5  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Raytheon is 30 4   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 5  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 4 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Raytheon have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Raytheon a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Raytheon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-12-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/raytheon-rtn-is-an-incredible-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-200495217,200495217

In the first of three separate efforts to overturn the Republican president s vetoes  supporters failed by a vote of 45 40  well short of the two thirds needed  Five of the chamber s 53 Republicans joined Democrats in voting to override Trump 
The vote tallies were similar in the two subsequent roll call votes to override vetoes of legislation blocking additional weapons sales to Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates and other countries 
In May  the Trump administration said it would go ahead with more than  8 billion in military sales  sidestepping a congressional review process 
The legislation would have blocked the sale of Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co precision guided munitions and related equipment 
Congress  effort was aimed at attempting to pressure the Saudi government to improve its human rights record and do more to avoid civilian casualties in a war in Yemen  where Saudi Arabia and the UAE lead an air campaign against Iran backed Houthi rebels 
Congressional sentiment toward Saudi Arabia worsened after the murder of Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi  a U S  resident  at a Saudi consulate in Turkey last year

138109,359624,RTN,Third Point cuts United Technologies stake after opposing Raytheon deal,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Hedge fund Third Point LLC said on Tuesday that it recently cut its investment in United Technologies Corp  N UTX   becoming the second activist hedge fund to sell shares after the company announced a merger with  Raytheon Co    N RTN  that the funds said they would not support 
The New York based firm sold 480 000 shares of United Technologies stock during the second quarter  cutting its holding by 7 percent to 6 million shares  according to a regulatory filing made on Tuesday 
In June  Third Point founder Daniel Loeb told the company its plan to merge with Raytheon was a  baffling change  in strategy 
Last week William Ackman  another prominent activist investor  told clients that his Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management had sold all of its 5 8 million United Technologies shares 
Ackman was the first to voice strong opposition to the proposed merger and wrote to United Technologies  chief executive in early June that he could not understand the deal s logic 
Both hedge funds  whose moves can influence other investors  told United Technologies that they did not approve of the deal  which is expected to come to a vote next year 
United Technologies is in the process of streamlining its operations  actions both hedge funds endorsed  by selling off its Otis elevator and Carrier buildings systems units 
The sales by both Ackman and Loeb are noteworthy because United Technologies had been big holdings in each man s portfolio 
At Pershing Square  which invests roughly  8 billion  the United Technologies position made up roughly 11 percent of the portfolio at the end of the first quarter  Pershing Square has not yet made its so called 13 F  a filing that details the amount of U S  stock held by investment companies at the end of the previous quarter 
While 13 F filings are backward looking  they are closely watched all the same by investors for hints on what big  often secretive hedge funds are thinking  The bulk of the filings will be made on Wednesday

138148,359663,RTN,U S  officials wonder  Did Turkish leader s coup memories drive Russia arms deal ,news,"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON  Reuters    For some U S  officials  the Trump administration s failure to persuade Turkey not to buy a Russian air defense system may have its roots in a coup attempt against President Tayyip Erdogan three years ago this week 
While they recognize that worsening U S  relations with Turkey in recent years and Russia s growing clout with Ankara may also have helped sway Turkey toward buying the S 400 system  three U S  officials and a defense source told Reuters of another working theory that has gained ground within the Trump administration 
One reason Erdogan may have chosen to buy from Russia rather than from a fellow NATO member is that he might be wary of his own air force  which played a major role in the coup attempt on July 15  2016  these officials say 
S 400 missiles  which Turkey began taking delivery of last Friday  would be better at fending off any attack on the Turkish government from its own jets than a U S  supplied Patriot system would  experts say 
Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co s s Patriot missiles  which have been on offer to Turkey  would have safeguards to help avoid  friendly fire  against other NATO warplanes  such as Turkish air force jets 
 You have to ask yourself  Why would Erdogan really want a Russian system   one of the U S  officials asked   He doesn t trust his air force  
Two other U S  officials and a defense source familiar with NATO discussions about Turkey  all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity  put forward the same theory about the long time Turkish leader s possible motivation 
 There s some talk that he wants the  Russian  system just to protect himself  He doesn t want a NATO integrated system   one of the officials said 
A senior Turkish official denied that concern about the military was a motivating factor in the decision and said Turkey has been purging supporters of the coup attempt  including from the armed forces 
 Turkey is not worried about another coup attempt and it trusts its own army and pilots   he said  when asked about the U S  speculation 
Another Turkish official  with knowledge of the S 400 deal  said Ankara had always wanted to buy Patriots but was forced to turn to Russia             
 There was no uncertainty about this  wanting Patriots    he said   However  the U S A  had a delaying attitude during Obama s term of office  
Erdogan himself has said Turkey bought the S 400s because Russia made him a better deal  and Turkish officials sought tough terms from the United States on Patriot pricing  joint production and technology transfer 
President Donald Trump has publicly defended Erdogan  saying Ankara only chose the Russian system because Trump s predecessor  Barack Obama  failed to offer him a viable U S  alternative until it was too late 
But the Turkish purchase has upset Washington and could drive a wedge into the heart of NATO 
The Pentagon  which sees the S 400 as a threat to the most modern stealth fighter jet in its arsenal  the F 35  announced on Wednesday that the United States would drop plans to sell the jet to Turkey 
JETS IN THE COUP
Turkish air force pilots played a major role in the abortive putsch  commandeering jets and helicopters that bombed the parliament building and threatened a government plane that Erdogan was flying in  The coup attempt collapsed within hours but 251 people died and more than 1 500 were wounded 
In June  a former head of the Turkish air force  Akin Ozturk  was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the coup  Just this month  Turkish prosecutors ordered the arrest of 176 more military personnel over their links to the alleged coup plotting network 
Another of the U S  officials described a 2018 meeting with American officials in which Turkish officials  when talking about buying a new air defense system  described their own air force as one of the top security threats facing the country 
 A Turkish bureaucrat said the primary threat to the government remained from Turkey s own air force  which operated NATO aircraft and had attacked government installations and attempted to assassinate President Erdogan during the July 2016 coup attempt   said the official  who had detailed knowledge of the meeting but did not attend it 
 And the S 400 system was designed to counter NATO aircraft   the official said 
To be sure  even proponents of the theory that Erdogan s worries about his own military fueled the S 400 purchase acknowledge there were almost certainly other factors behind it 
Those include Russia s growing power in the Middle East  splits between Ankara and Washington over the war in Syria  and even Erdogan s own sense of pride in the face of U S  pressure to back out of his deal with Russia 
Erdogan has also been angered by Washington s refusal to extradite Fethullah Gulen  a Pennsylvania based Muslim cleric who Turkey says engineered the coup  Gulen denies involvement 
Some U S  officials long held out hope that they could eventually sway Erdogan into forgoing the S 400 in favor of Patriot missiles  only to see their offers frequently rebuffed 
Soner Cagaptay  a Turkey expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank  acknowledged the view inWashington that Erdogan was buying the S 400 for his own protection 
But he also pointed to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the possibility that Moscow can work with Ankara to thwart YPG Kurdish guerrillas in Syria  Turkey views the YPG as terrorists 
 I think  though  the bigger driver    is that  Erdogan has realized that the U S  will not help him in Syria against the YPG  and Putin will   Cagaptay said   In return  Putin has lured Turkey into lucrative deals and bargains  many of which undermine Turkey s pro Western orientation  the S 400 purchase being a case in point  ",2019-07-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/us-officials-wonder-did-turkish-leaders-coup-memories-drive-russia-arms-deal-1926932,1926932

The vote breakdown in the committee was not made public 
Esper s confirmation hearing on Tuesday was mostly smooth  except for a sharp exchange with Democratic Senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren  who said Esper should not be confirmed because of ethical concerns related to his former lobbyist job at defense contractor Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co 
Esper  55  is expected to easily win confirmation in the Senate  where he has the support of many Democrats as well as Trump s fellow Republicans  He has served a Secretary of the Army since November 2017

138151,359666,RTN,Senate sets vote on Trump s Saudi weapons vetoes,news,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Senate will vote within days on whether to override President Donald Trump s vetoes of legislation to block the sale of precision guided munitions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday 
McConnell said the Senate would hold the vote before Aug  2  when lawmakers leave Washington for a five week long recess 
The three resolutions of disapproval are not expected to garner the two thirds majority in the 100 member Senate needed to override the vetoes  however  Only a handful of Trump s fellow Republicans  who hold 53 seats in the Senate  backed the resolutions when they passed last month 
The measures would block the sale of Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co precision guided munitions and related equipment 
The Democratic controlled House of Representatives backed the resolutions last week  largely along party lines  sending them to the White House for Trump s promised veto 
The Senate passed them   and 19 others that the House has yet to consider   a month earlier 
Supporters of the resolutions are unhappy with the Trump administration s decision in May to push ahead with more than  8 billion in military sales  sidestepping the congressional review process by declaring an  emergency  over tensions with Iran 
Lawmakers want Washington to push Riyadh to improve its human rights record and do more to avoid civilian casualties in the four year long war in Yemen  where the Saudis and UAE are leading an air campaign against Iran backed Houthi rebels 
Frustration grew after the murder at a Saudi consulate in Turkey last year of Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi  a U S  resident 
Trump wants to retain close ties to Riyadh  which he considers an important partner in the Middle East and counterweight to the influence of Iran  Trump also views foreign military sales as a way to generate U S  jobs

138157,359672,RTN,Can Value Investors Consider Raytheon Company  RTN  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Raytheon Company   NYSE RTN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Raytheon Company has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 99  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 23  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Raytheon Company s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 19 78 over the past five years  The stock s PE also compares quite favorably with the Aerospace Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 31  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  Raytheon Company has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 67  which is lower than the current level  So  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Raytheon Company stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Raytheon Company has a P S ratio of 1 95  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 22x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Raytheon Company currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Raytheon Company a solid choice for value investors and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Raytheon Company is 1 56  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 22  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Raytheon Company might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives RTN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  While the current quarter estimate has seen no upward or downward movements  the current year estimate has seen two upward and no downward movements over the past two months This has had a mixed effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 1 9  over the past two months  the current year estimate has inched up 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Raytheon Company Price and Consensus   Such mixed analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRaytheon Company is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a strong industry rank  among Top 13  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for Zacks rank and analyst sentiments to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks

Prior to today s trading  shares of the defense contractor had gained 5 51  over the past month  This has outpaced the Aerospace sector s loss of 0 39  and the S P 500 s gain of 0 72  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from RTN as it approaches its next earnings report date  The company is expected to report EPS of  2 86  up 27 11  from the prior year quarter  Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  7 22 billion  up 6 06  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  11 73 per share and revenue of  28 94 billion  These totals would mark changes of  10 56  and  6 94   respectively  from last year

138190,359705,RTN,Mergers Boost Aerospace Defense Equipment Near Term Prospects,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises firms that manufacture a wide variety of vital components for the aerospace defense space  ranging from aerostructures  space shuttles  propulsion systems  aircraft engines  defense electronics  missile and radar systems to flight test equipment  structural adhesives  instrumentation and control systems  communication products and many more  A few of these companies also offer integrated simulation and training services to the U S  defense force While the majority of revenues is generated from production of the aforementioned accompaniments  the industry players also generate revenues by providing notable aftermarket support and services like maintenance  repair and overhaul activities to defense players Here are the three major industry themes While rising competition has frequently prompted industry bigwigs to expand their product lines through small and medium sized acquisitions  lately there have been some big mergers in the industry  These can be attributed to the growing importance of cost reduction initiatives and increased control over production procedures  Speaking of big mergers  missile maker Raytheon  RTN  inked an all stock merger deal with multinational conglomerate United Technologies  UTX  this June  Considered to be the biggest merger in the U S  aerospace and defense space  this deal is expected to generate a conglomerate worth  121 billion  Such consolidation of production by leading industry players should improve economies of scale for the aerospace defense equipment industry as a whole   Being the largest digitally advanced nation  the United States is rapidly enhancing its electronic warfare  C4ISR  Command  Control  Communication  Computers  Intelligence  Surveillance and Reconnaissance  and cyber security measures  following frequent cyber attacks that affected a number of countries last year  According to Transparency Market Research  the global C4ISR market is expected to witness CAGR of 3 8  from 2018 to 2026  reaching a value of  132 26 billion  with North America dominating the market  This should further boost prospects of the stocks in this space  especially those providing defense electronics  In March 2019  the U S  Department of Commerce initiated an investigation to determine whether the present quantity or circumstances of titanium sponge imports threaten national security  An affirmation might result in imposition of tariffs or quotas on import of titanium sponge  Titanium sponge  made from titanium ore  is the primary form of titanium used in manufacturing varied defense products like aircraft structures and engines  munition systems  ground combat vehicles and ships  Unfortunately  there is only one domestic supplier of titanium sponge in the United States  On top of that  the manufacturing facility is more than 70 years old and needs  150 million for modernization  per a Forbes report   So  manufacturers have to rely on import of titanium sponge for smooth production  The final decision concerning this investigation is still pending  The outcome might result in imposition of import tariffs and hurt critical defense production Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace Defense Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  63  which places it in the top 25  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank

industry s position in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is due to a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions

138207,359722,RTN,U S  foreign arms sales hit  44 15 billion in first three quarters of FY2019,news,"By Andrea Shalal
PARIS  Reuters    The Pentagon s Defense Security Cooperation Agency  DSCA  has executed  44 15 billion in U S  foreign arms sales through June 19  and the agency s director said he was optimistic the total for the full year would reach last year s  55 66 billion 
DSCA Director U S  Army Lieutenant General Charles Hooper told business executives and reporters the U S  government was continuing its concerted drive to step up arms sales to improve the capabilities of allies and accelerate the process 
 I think things are going well  and remember  we still have a quarter left to go   he said at the Paris Airshow  where more than 400 U S  companies are exhibiting their aerospace and defense equipment 
Fiscal 2018 arms sales rose 33 percent above the year earlier level  and could rise further in the current fiscal year 
Hooper told Reuters after his speech that he could not predict the full year level for fiscal 2019  but said he was optimistic last year s total would be reached again 
 I look at this total  I think we ve come a long way  I m always optimistic   he said 
Hooper said a move by DSCA to reduce the administrative surcharge on foreign arms sales from 3 5 percent to 3 2 percent had already saved its customers  180 million 
The U S  government was also working to speed deliveries to countries that purchased U S  weapons  Hooper said  For instance  he said one country that had ordered the Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co Patriot missile defense system would receive initial equipment in just two years  far more quickly than in the past 
He said foreign military sales to the European area accounted for over  13 11 billion of total arms sales executed in fiscal 2018

138240,359755,RTN,Raytheon  RTN  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Raytheon  RTN  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 61 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 5  
Revenues are expected to be  7 01 billion  up 5 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Raytheon 
For Raytheon  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Raytheon will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Raytheon would post earnings of  2 45 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 77  delivering a surprise of  13 06  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Raytheon doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/raytheon-rtn-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200441378,200441378

138251,359766,RTN,Stocks   U S  Futures Rise as Trump Cancels Tariffs on Mexico,news,"Investing com   Wall Street pointed to a higher open on Monday after U S  President Donald Trump announced he would refrain from placing tariffs on Mexico thanks to a deal for more cooperation on controlling illegal immigration across the border 
The blue chip Dow futures gained 107 points  or 0 4  by 6 32 AM ET  10 32 GMT   the S P 500 futures rose 10 points  or 0 4   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 27 points  or 0 4  
Trump cancelled the planned implementation of 5  tariffs on all Mexican goods that was due to go in effect Monday as he touted that  there is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico and the USA  



 Now with our new deal  Mexico is doing more for the USA on illegal immigration than the Democrats   Trump tweeted early Monday 
The fact the president was willing to reach an agreement with Mexico and remove tariffs caused some speculation that a similar deal could be made with China 
 The assumption here is that this move demonstrates the pragmatic nature of US trade policy and raises expectations that Presidents Trump and Xi could find some room for accommodation when they meet at the G20 summit on June 28 29   Chris Turner  global head of strategy at ING  said 
 However  Mexico is not China and investors will want to see some clear signs of improvement in U S  China relations before increasing exposure to risk assets   he added 
G20 finance leaders who met over the weekend warned that intensifying trade and geopolitical tensions were still the biggest risk to the stabilization of global growth  while U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made clear that Trump will decide on the next move with China after the G20 summit 
Mnuchin stated that the president was  perfectly happy  to hit Beijing with new tariffs if the meeting doesn t go well 
On the economic front  China s exports unexpectedly returned to growth  although some analysts suspect that manufacturers may have increased shipments to avoid the most recent round of U S  tariffs on  300 billion of Chinese goods  Chinese imports  however  registered their largest decline in nearly three years  providing another sign of weak domestic demand

138253,359768,RTN,Stocks   Dow Jumps Triple Digits as Trump Touts Tariff Success  M A Supports,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks headed higher Monday as U S  President Donald Trump suspended plans to implement tariffs on Mexico and showed confidence that similar tactics with China would also prove successful  while a wave of mergers and acquisitions also boosted bullish sentiment
The Dow Jones gained 164 points  or 0 6   to 26 170 5 points by 9 35 AM ET  13 35 GMT   while the S P 500 rose 19 points  or 0 7   2 794 30 points and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite traded up 83 points  or 1 1   at 7 502 38 points 
Trump cancelled the planned implementation of 5  tariffs on all Mexican goods that was due to go in effect Monday as he claimed that  there is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico and the USA  
The fact the president was willing to remove tariffs caused some speculation that a similar deal could be made with China 
 The assumption here is that this move demonstrates the pragmatic nature of U S  trade policy and raises expectations that Presidents Trump and Xi could find some room for accommodation when they meet at the G20 summit on June 28 29   Chris Turner  global head of strategy at ING  said  warning that markets would likely still need to see  clear signs of improvement  
Trump made clear on Monday that he could return to tariff threats if the Mexican Congress did not approve the deal reached last week 
The president also insisted that the deal on immigration with Mexico was made precisely because he had threatened tariffs  although other published reports over the weekend said that there was little new in the deal and that Mexico and the U S  had agreed to many of the terms months ago 
 If we didn t have tariffs  we wouldn t have a deal with Mexico   Trump said in a phone interview with CNBC 
Trump also claimed that the tariff tactic would ultimately work with China  Beijing is  going to make a deal because they re going to have to make a deal   he said  claiming that  China is getting absolutely decimated  by companies leaving the world s second largest economy in order to avoid tariffs 
Risk assets have been roiled by fears that escalating trade tensions could potentially lead to a global recession  G20 finance leaders who met over the weekend warned that intensifying trade and geopolitical tensions were still the biggest risk to the stabilization of global growth 
But increasing bets that the Federal Reserve will be required to step in as promised to support the U S  economic expansion have led to a renewed bout of risk appetite  Worse than expected job creation and easing wage inflation boosted those expectations last Friday  leading to Wall Street s best weekly performance since the end of last year 
On a thinly filled economic calendar  the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey  JOLTs  for April will be released at 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT   providing further information on the state of the American labor market 
Overnight  Chinese data showed some mixed readings as exports unexpectedly returned to growth  Some analysts suggested  however  that manufacturers may have increased shipments to avoid the most recent round of U S  tariffs on  300 billion of Chinese goods  In a clearly negative sign  Chinese imports registered their largest decline in nearly three years  providing another indication of weak domestic demand

138282,359797,RTN,USDJPY Surged On China Mexico Trade immigration Deal Optimism But Faded On Trump s,opinion,"USDJPY closed around 108 36 in the U S  session Monday  edged down almost  0 08   Earlier USDJPY surged to the session high of 108 72 amid  risk on  sentiment on U S  Mexico immigration deal optimism coupled with renewed hopes of U S  China trade deal  But it faded on Trump s bellicose comments about tariffs coupled with a renewed fear of a 9 26 like terrorist attack as a helicopter crash landed accidentally on a Manhattan high rise rooftop and the building caught fire 
On early Monday  the  risk on  trade got a boost and Dow jumped over 200 points as Trump announced late Friday that the  indefinite  suspension of planned tariffs on Mexican exports after reaching an agreement to tackle illegal immigration  But Trump also warned Sunday that if cooperation falls short  we can always go back to our previous  very profitable  position of tariffs   Trump announced the agreement late Friday  following his return from a week long visit to Europe  tariffs that had been scheduled to apply on Mexican exports from Monday  10th June  would now be suspended indefinitely 
Trump tweeted late Friday on Mexican immigration deal 
 I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico  The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U S  on Monday  against Mexico  are hereby indefinitely suspended  Mexico  in turn  has agreed to take strong measures to     stem the tide of Migration through Mexico  and to our Southern  NYSE SO  Border  This is being done to greatly reduce  or eliminate  Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States  Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department  Thank you  
 MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS  
 Everyone very excited about the new deal with Mexico  
 I would like to thank the President of Mexico  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador  and his foreign minister  Marcelo Ebrard  together with all of the many representatives of both the United States and Mexico  for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed  
On Sunday  Trump tweeted  indicating about an extraordinary trade deal with Mexico  to be announced formally later 
 Another false report in the Failing  nytimes  We have been trying to get some of these Border Actions for a long time  as have other administrations  but were not able to get them  or get them in full  until our signed agreement with Mexico  Additionally  and for many years     Mexico was not being cooperative on the Border in things we had or didn t have  and now I have full confidence  especially after speaking to their President yesterday  that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done  Importantly  some things      
      not mentioned in a yesterday press release  one in particular  were agreed upon  That will be announced at the appropriate time  There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico   the USA  something that didn t exist for decades  However  if for some unknown reason    there is not  we can always go back to our previous  very profitable  position of Tariffs   But I don t believe that will be necessary  The Failing  nytimes    ratings challenged  CNN  will do anything possible to see our Country fail  They are truly The Enemy of the People  
On early Monday  Trump also warned Mexico 
 We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico  one that the U S  has been asking about getting for many years  It will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexico s Legislative body     We do not anticipate a problem with the vote but  if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming  Tariffs will be reinstated  
U S  and Mexico also released a joint statement on the agreement  Full text
 The United States and Mexico met this week to address the shared challenges of irregular migration  to include the entry of migrants into the United States in violation of U S  law  Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States  both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation  The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution  
As a result of these discussions  the United States and Mexico commit to 
Mexican Enforcement Surge
 Mexico will take unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration  to include the deployment of its National Guard throughout Mexico  giving priority to its southern border  Mexico is also taking decisive action to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organizations as well as their illicit financial and transportation networks  Additionally  the United States and Mexico commit to strengthening bilateral cooperation  including information sharing and coordinated actions to better protect and secure our common border  
Migrant Protection Protocols
 The United States will immediately expand the implementation of the existing Migrant Protection Protocols across its entire Southern Border  This means that those crossing the U S  Southern Border to seek asylum will be rapidly returned to Mexico where they may await the adjudication of their asylum claims  
 In response  Mexico will authorize the entrance of all of those individuals for humanitarian reasons  in compliance with its international obligations  while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims  Mexico will also offer jobs  healthcare  and education according to its principles  
 The United States commits to work to accelerate the adjudication of asylum claims and to conclude removal proceedings as expeditiously as possible  
Further Actions
 Both parties also agree that in the event  the measures adopted do not have the expected results  they will take further actions  Therefore  the United States and Mexico will continue their discussions on the terms of additional understandings to address irregular migrant flows and asylum issues  to be completed and announced within 90 days  if necessary  
Ongoing Regional Strategy
 The United States and Mexico reiterate their previous statement of December 18  2018  that both countries recognize the strong links between promoting the development and economic growth in southern Mexico and the success of promoting prosperity  good governance and security in Central America  The United States and Mexico welcome the Comprehensive Development Plan launched by the Government of Mexico in concert with the Governments of El Salvador  Guatemala  and Honduras to promote these goals  The United States and Mexico will lead in working with regional and international partners to build a more prosperous and secure Central America to address the underlying causes of migration so that citizens of the region can build better lives for themselves and their families at home  
In any way  on Friday Dow soared on hopes of rate cut by Fed after a terrible NFP report and U S  China Mexico trade immigration deal optimism  Trump tweeted  boasting about the surging U S stock market despite terrible NFP headline   Dow Jones has the best week of the year  
The U S  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said on Saturday that the U S  Mexico immigration deal met President Trump s objectives of fixing immigration problems on the southern U S  border  but Trump will retain the authority to impose tariffs if Mexico fails to live up to it
On the other side  the Mexican president said   We don t want confrontation with the U S  government  we don t wish to cease being friends with President Trump   Clearly  Mexico is not China 
In any way  the market is now hopeful that agreement with Mexico could now raise the prospect of a near term solution to the ongoing trade dispute between the U S  and China  The U S  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that Trump will decide whether to implement more tariffs on China after meeting with Chinese President Xi later in June  Finance leaders of the G 20 decried worsening trade tensions and their impact on global growth  but a statement from the group on Sunday didn t mention the tariffs the U S  and China have used and stopped short of calling for a resolution of the trade conflict between Washington and Beijing 
Meanwhile  on the sidelines of the G20 finance minister meeting in Japan  the U S  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said   US China trade negotiation is at a crossroad like that ahead of the December G20 meeting in Buenos Aires  Trump needs to see action to make sure Chinese President Xi is heading in the right direction regarding the trade deal  Trump will make a decision after the Trump Xi meeting in Osaka on June 28 29 at G20 leader summit  
Mnuchin also clarified   if China wants to move forward with the deal  we re prepared to move forward on the terms we ve done  If China doesn t want to move forward  then President Trump is perfectly happy to move forward with tariffs to rebalance the relationship  And  if no agreement is made  the end result will be that my expectation is that many companies will move their production out of China to other locations  
On Sunday  Mnuchin tweeted   Had constructive meeting with PBOC Governor Yi Gang  during which we had a candid discussion on trade issues  
On Huawei  Mnuchin said   What the president is saying is  if we move forward on trade  that perhaps he ll be willing to do certain things on Huawei if he gets comfort from China on that and certain guarantees  But these are national security issues  
The market is also concerned that boosting with success of his  negotiation tactics  using tariffs with Mexico  Trump may use the same bellicose policies against China ahead of the much awaited likely G20 summit between Trump and Xi  Trump is also using Huawei as leverage in trade talks with China  which is unacceptable to the later 
Although  China s Xi is talking soft  calling Trump a  friend   Trump is trying to use his bellicose style of negotiations to pressure Xi ahead of the expected G 20 meet  As per reports from Chinese sources formal dinner on cards for Trump and Xi at Japan G20   A widely anticipated meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump at the end of June in Japan could be a formal face to face negotiation over dinner  
Trump on his part is now using bizarre comments to Xi and threatened  like a local gang leader  if President Xi does not attend G 20  more China tariffs will go into effect immediately  On Monday  when asked during a telephone interview if that means the new tariffs would go into effect immediately  Trump said   Yes  it would  
On Monday  in a rare and surprising event  Trump called into a business channel to defend his tariff strategy  In the telephonic interview  Trump said   I will be surprised if Xi did not attend  But I have a great relationship with Xi   he s actually an incredible guy  But we will continue raising tariffs on Chinese goods  My administration is currently taxing 35  to 40  of the Chinese goods the U S  imports  If an agreement isn t reached  there are another 60  and that ll be taxed  
Trump added   I believe China will make a deal with the U S  because they re going to have to make a deal   tariffs on China  Mexico are putting the U S  at a tremendous competitive advantage  The China deal is going to work out  You know why  Because of tariffs  Right now  China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China  going to other countries  including our own  because they don t want to pay the tariffs  
Trump said he and Chinese President Xi are  scheduled to have a meeting  at the G20 summit in Osaka  Trump added   We re expected to meet and if we do that s fine  and if we don t   look  from our standpoint the best deal we can have is 25  on  600 billion  And  if we don t have a deal and don t make a deal  we ll be raising the tariffs  putting tariffs on more than   we only tax 35  to 40  of what they said then they had another 60  that ll be taxed  
Trump reiterated   China is going to make a deal because they re going to have to make a deal  At the same time  it could be very well that we do something with respect to Huawei as part of our trade negotiation with China  China very much wants to make a deal  They want to make a deal much more than I do  but we ll see what happens  
On Monday  the U S  Chamber of Commerce s EVP and head of international affairs  Brilliant criticized Trump s tariff policies  using it like a weapon   The weaponization of tariffs  the increase of threats on our economy  on our farmers  on our manufacturers  our consumers  is going to hurt our country  It also creates uncertainty with our trading partners  
In response to Brilliant s criticism  Trump said   He s not protecting our country  He s protecting companies who are members  of the Chamber   Trump blasted the U S  Chamber of Commerce on his Mexico strategy  as well   I just want to say to the United States Chamber of Commerce  if we didn t have tariffs  we wouldn t have made a deal with Mexico  We got everything we wanted  And we re going to be a great partner to Mexico now  Because now they respect us   earlier  they didn t even respect us  
Trump described tariffs as a  beautiful thing  that countries with money should use  Trump said  People haven t used tariffs  but tariffs are a beautiful thing when you are the piggy bank when you have all the money  Everyone is trying to get our money   He also touted boasted that  If we didn t have tariffs we wouldn t have made a deal with Mexico  on migration problem of the US 
Trump is also quite confident that the China trade deal is going to work out   Because of tariffs  Because right now China is getting absolutely decimated by countries that are leaving China  going to other countries  including our own  China is going to make a deal because they re going to have to make a deal  
Trump also mocked China Xi and cried foul as the Fed is not under his direct control   As per China s system the head of the Fed in China is President Xi and he can do whatever he wants  They devalue  They loosen  They devalue their currency  They have for years  It s put them at a tremendous advantage  On the other hand  we don t have that advantage because we have a Fed that doesn t lower interest rates  The Fed certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake  They raised interest rates far too fast and the day before a bond issue goes out so we have to pay more money  
Summary of  Tariff King  Trump s Monday interview comments on China 
 China is getting absolutely devastated and China is going to make a deal because they have to make a deal  The China deal is going to work out because of tariffs as companies are leaving China and going elsewhere  including to the U S  Tariffs is a beautiful thing  China has lost many trillions of dollars on tariffs out of China s total GDP of  12 trillion  From my standpoint  tariffs are no brainer  The tariffs are putting us at a tremendous advantage  but China devalues its currency   something has to be done  China currency moves nullified tariffs to some extent  
 If China s Xi doesn t come to G20  tariffs will go on immediately  but I think we re scheduled for a meeting  We re expecting to meet Xi at G20  but no deal with China would mean more tariffs  China wants to make a deal much more than I want to  A lot of people think Q1 GDP was 1 pp stronger because of tariffs  Huawei could be part of broader U S  trade deal with China  
Trump s comments on Mexico tariffs 
 We talked about Mexico deal for months but we couldn t get there until the tariffs  Mexico took 30  of our automobile companies  they would all move back if we put on tariffs and as soon as I put tariffs on the table  it was done  
Trump s comments on the Fed 
 Our Fed is very  very disruptive to us and raised interest rates far too tightly  
On Monday  Trump also commented that United Tech  Raytheon  NYSE RTN   M A  deal may hurt competition for the defense sector  Trump reacted somewhat mixed on the huge  121 billion M A of defense contractor Raytheon and United Technologies  NYSE UTX  at a time when Pentagon indicated it would take a hard stance at the deal  Although Trump likes such M A  consolidation  in the defense sector aerospace  the lack of competition may be worrisome 
Trump said   I want to see that we don t hurt our competition  I hope the Raytheon deal  I hope it can happen  But I don t want to see where we have one less person that can compete for an order  When I hear they re merging  does that take away more competition  It becomes one big  fat  beautiful company  but I have to negotiate  meaning the United States has to buy things and does that make it less competitive  Because it s already non competitive  
Trump  the great tariff man  who sees  tariffs  as a solution for each and every problem with another country  also attacked France  after just returning from that country   Trump said   we ll do something  about French wine tariffs 
On Monday  Dow as well as USDJPY slips to the session low on the concern of a terrorist attack  9 26 memory  after a Helicopter makes a crash landing on top of a Manhattan building  which later found an accident  The helicopter made a hard  forced landing and a fire ensued 
The risk on trade was also affected by Trump s bellicose comments about China tariffs  After  Mexican tariffs success   it now seems that Trump is more inclined to use  tariffs  threat to solve any problem  like a nuke   whether it s with an ordinary country like Mexico or a superpower like China  After  Trump s threat about China tariffs  the fate of the G 20 meet between him and Xi may be now uncertain  China might be also cautious because of Trump s tendency to insult a foreign leader President by suddenly  walking out  of the meeting without a lunch dinner  like with the NK leader Kim in the last summit  if talks do not go in Trump s way 
On late Monday  Dow slips over  150 points from the session high as the U S  Secretary Of State Pompeo said  If sufficient progress is not made on Mexico immigration  trump s tariffs could go into force  We expect to have a good idea within 45 days whether a deal can achieve expected outcomes   The U S  did not offer Mexico funding to enforce the agreement  The U S  Mexico deal reflects diplomacy at its finest and we have full confidence Mexico will fully implement immigration agreement  We are prepared to give agreement with Mexico some amount of time to see whether it s working  but the progress on the border will be evaluated literally daily  Lots of hard work to do on border plan implementation  
The Mexican Foreign Minister Ebard said   The White House meeting is a very tense moment in trade talks as the White House pushed for a safe 3rd country deal in the meeting and during talks  Mexico threatened with retaliation tariffs  Talks with the U S will resume if there are no migration results in 45 days  Mexico didn t agree for agricultural purchases from the U S during talks  Cuba  Africa  and Haiti migrants are traveling through Mexico and we are expecting United Nations help in regional migration efforts  A confrontation from the U S will be costly for Mexico and tariff scenario had a very high cost for Mexico  
Apart from politics  on economics  data shows that the JOLTS job openings for April edged down to 7 449M from 7 474M  revised downwards from 7 474M   lower than the expectations of 7 479M  while quits inched up to 3482K from prior 3461K  indicating confidence among U S  workers 
Overall  the U S  job openings remain above the number of unemployed workers in America for the 14th month in a row and there are 0 78 unemployed job seekers for each available job  Quits reached a new record high but layoffs also ticked higher  Layoffs and discharges at 1 2  in April against 1 1  in March as 1752K people were fired or laid off in April against 1788K in April last year  The latest JOLTS job openings report shows a robust U S  job market still on the card despite the terrible NFP job addition for May and could keep the Fed on a  patience  mode in June meeting

 The United States will immediately expand the implementation of the existing Migrant Protection Protocols across its entire Southern Border  This means that those crossing the U S  Southern Border to seek asylum will be rapidly returned to Mexico where they may await the adjudication of their asylum claims  
 In response  Mexico will authorize the entrance of all of those individuals for humanitarian reasons  in compliance with its international obligations  while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims  Mexico will also offer jobs  healthcare  and education according to its principles  
 The United States commits to work to accelerate the adjudication of asylum claims and to conclude removal proceedings as expeditiously as possible  
Further Actions
 Both parties also agree that in the event  the measures adopted do not have the expected results  they will take further actions  Therefore  the United States and Mexico will continue their discussions on the terms of additional understandings to address irregular migrant flows and asylum issues  to be completed and announced within 90 days  if necessary  
Ongoing Regional Strategy
 The United States and Mexico reiterate their previous statement of December 18  2018  that both countries recognize the strong links between promoting the development and economic growth in southern Mexico and the success of promoting prosperity  good governance and security in Central America  The United States and Mexico welcome the Comprehensive Development Plan launched by the Government of Mexico in concert with the Governments of El Salvador  Guatemala  and Honduras to promote these goals  The United States and Mexico will lead in working with regional and international partners to build a more prosperous and secure Central America to address the underlying causes of migration so that citizens of the region can build better lives for themselves and their families at home  
In any way  on Friday Dow soared on hopes of rate cut by Fed after a terrible NFP report and U S  China Mexico trade immigration deal optimism  Trump tweeted  boasting about the surging U S stock market despite terrible NFP headline   Dow Jones has the best week of the year  
The U S  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said on Saturday that the U S  Mexico immigration deal met President Trump s objectives of fixing immigration problems on the southern U S  border  but Trump will retain the authority to impose tariffs if Mexico fails to live up to it
On the other side  the Mexican president said   We don t want confrontation with the U S  government  we don t wish to cease being friends with President Trump   Clearly  Mexico is not China 
In any way  the market is now hopeful that agreement with Mexico could now raise the prospect of a near term solution to the ongoing trade dispute between the U S  and China  The U S  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that Trump will decide whether to implement more tariffs on China after meeting with Chinese President Xi later in June  Finance leaders of the G 20 decried worsening trade tensions and their impact on global growth  but a statement from the group on Sunday didn t mention the tariffs the U S  and China have used and stopped short of calling for a resolution of the trade conflict between Washington and Beijing 
Meanwhile  on the sidelines of the G20 finance minister meeting in Japan  the U S  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said   US China trade negotiation is at a crossroad like that ahead of the December G20 meeting in Buenos Aires  Trump needs to see action to make sure Chinese President Xi is heading in the right direction regarding the trade deal  Trump will make a decision after the Trump Xi meeting in Osaka on June 28 29 at G20 leader summit  
Mnuchin also clarified   if China wants to move forward with the deal  we re prepared to move forward on the terms we ve done  If China doesn t want to move forward  then President Trump is perfectly happy to move forward with tariffs to rebalance the relationship  And  if no agreement is made  the end result will be that my expectation is that many companies will move their production out of China to other locations  
On Sunday  Mnuchin tweeted   Had constructive meeting with PBOC Governor Yi Gang  during which we had a candid discussion on trade issues  
On Huawei  Mnuchin said   What the president is saying is  if we move forward on trade  that perhaps he ll be willing to do certain things on Huawei if he gets comfort from China on that and certain guarantees  But these are national security issues  
The market is also concerned that boosting with success of his  negotiation tactics  using tariffs with Mexico  Trump may use the same bellicose policies against China ahead of the much awaited likely G20 summit between Trump and Xi  Trump is also using Huawei as leverage in trade talks with China  which is unacceptable to the later 
Although  China s Xi is talking soft  calling Trump a  friend   Trump is trying to use his bellicose style of negotiations to pressure Xi ahead of the expected G 20 meet  As per reports from Chinese sources formal dinner on cards for Trump and Xi at Japan G20   A widely anticipated meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump at the end of June in Japan could be a formal face to face negotiation over dinner  
Trump on his part is now using bizarre comments to Xi and threatened  like a local gang leader  if President Xi does not attend G 20  more China tariffs will go into effect immediately  On Monday  when asked during a telephone interview if that means the new tariffs would go into effect immediately  Trump said   Yes  it would  
On Monday  in a rare and surprising event  Trump called into a business channel to defend his tariff strategy  In the telephonic interview  Trump said   I will be surprised if Xi did not attend  But I have a great relationship with Xi   he s actually an incredible guy  But we will continue raising tariffs on Chinese goods  My administration is currently taxing 35  to 40  of the Chinese goods the U S  imports  If an agreement isn t reached  there are another 60  and that ll be taxed  
Trump added   I believe China will make a deal with the U S  because they re going to have to make a deal   tariffs on China  Mexico are putting the U S  at a tremendous competitive advantage  The China deal is going to work out  You know why  Because of tariffs  Right now  China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China  going to other countries  including our own  because they don t want to pay the tariffs  
Trump said he and Chinese President Xi are  scheduled to have a meeting  at the G20 summit in Osaka  Trump added   We re expected to meet and if we do that s fine  and if we don t   look  from our standpoint the best deal we can have is 25  on  600 billion  And  if we don t have a deal and don t make a deal  we ll be raising the tariffs  putting tariffs on more than   we only tax 35  to 40  of what they said then they had another 60  that ll be taxed  
Trump reiterated   China is going to make a deal because they re going to have to make a deal  At the same time  it could be very well that we do something with respect to Huawei as part of our trade negotiation with China  China very much wants to make a deal  They want to make a deal much more than I do  but we ll see what happens  
On Monday  the U S  Chamber of Commerce s EVP and head of international affairs  Brilliant criticized Trump s tariff policies  using it like a weapon   The weaponization of tariffs  the increase of threats on our economy  on our farmers  on our manufacturers  our consumers  is going to hurt our country  It also creates uncertainty with our trading partners  
In response to Brilliant s criticism  Trump said   He s not protecting our country  He s protecting companies who are members  of the Chamber   Trump blasted the U S  Chamber of Commerce on his Mexico strategy  as well   I just want to say to the United States Chamber of Commerce  if we didn t have tariffs  we wouldn t have made a deal with Mexico  We got everything we wanted  And we re going to be a great partner to Mexico now  Because now they respect us   earlier  they didn t even respect us  
Trump described tariffs as a  beautiful thing  that countries with money should use  Trump said  People haven t used tariffs  but tariffs are a beautiful thing when you are the piggy bank when you have all the money  Everyone is trying to get our money   He also touted boasted that  If we didn t have tariffs we wouldn t have made a deal with Mexico  on migration problem of the US 
Trump is also quite confident that the China trade deal is going to work out   Because of tariffs  Because right now China is getting absolutely decimated by countries that are leaving China  going to other countries  including our own  China is going to make a deal because they re going to have to make a deal  
Trump also mocked China Xi and cried foul as the Fed is not under his direct control   As per China s system the head of the Fed in China is President Xi and he can do whatever he wants  They devalue  They loosen  They devalue their currency  They have for years  It s put them at a tremendous advantage  On the other hand  we don t have that advantage because we have a Fed that doesn t lower interest rates  The Fed certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake  They raised interest rates far too fast and the day before a bond issue goes out so we have to pay more money  
Summary of  Tariff King  Trump s Monday interview comments on China 
 China is getting absolutely devastated and China is going to make a deal because they have to make a deal  The China deal is going to work out because of tariffs as companies are leaving China and going elsewhere  including to the U S  Tariffs is a beautiful thing  China has lost many trillions of dollars on tariffs out of China s total GDP of  12 trillion  From my standpoint  tariffs are no brainer  The tariffs are putting us at a tremendous advantage  but China devalues its currency   something has to be done  China currency moves nullified tariffs to some extent  
 If China s Xi doesn t come to G20  tariffs will go on immediately  but I think we re scheduled for a meeting  We re expecting to meet Xi at G20  but no deal with China would mean more tariffs  China wants to make a deal much more than I want to  A lot of people think Q1 GDP was 1 pp stronger because of tariffs  Huawei could be part of broader U S  trade deal with China  
Trump s comments on Mexico tariffs 
 We talked about Mexico deal for months but we couldn t get there until the tariffs  Mexico took 30  of our automobile companies  they would all move back if we put on tariffs and as soon as I put tariffs on the table  it was done  
Trump s comments on the Fed 
 Our Fed is very  very disruptive to us and raised interest rates far too tightly  
On Monday  Trump also commented that United Tech  Raytheon  NYSE RTN   M A  deal may hurt competition for the defense sector  Trump reacted somewhat mixed on the huge  121 billion M A of defense contractor Raytheon and United Technologies  NYSE UTX  at a time when Pentagon indicated it would take a hard stance at the deal  Although Trump likes such M A  consolidation  in the defense sector aerospace  the lack of competition may be worrisome 
Trump said   I want to see that we don t hurt our competition  I hope the Raytheon deal  I hope it can happen  But I don t want to see where we have one less person that can compete for an order  When I hear they re merging  does that take away more competition  It becomes one big  fat  beautiful company  but I have to negotiate  meaning the United States has to buy things and does that make it less competitive  Because it s already non competitive  
Trump  the great tariff man  who sees  tariffs  as a solution for each and every problem with another country  also attacked France  after just returning from that country   Trump said   we ll do something  about French wine tariffs 
On Monday  Dow as well as USDJPY slips to the session low on the concern of a terrorist attack  9 26 memory  after a Helicopter makes a crash landing on top of a Manhattan building  which later found an accident  The helicopter made a hard  forced landing and a fire ensued 
The risk on trade was also affected by Trump s bellicose comments about China tariffs  After  Mexican tariffs success   it now seems that Trump is more inclined to use  tariffs  threat to solve any problem  like a nuke   whether it s with an ordinary country like Mexico or a superpower like China  After  Trump s threat about China tariffs  the fate of the G 20 meet between him and Xi may be now uncertain  China might be also cautious because of Trump s tendency to insult a foreign leader President by suddenly  walking out  of the meeting without a lunch dinner  like with the NK leader Kim in the last summit  if talks do not go in Trump s way 
On late Monday  Dow slips over  150 points from the session high as the U S  Secretary Of State Pompeo said  If sufficient progress is not made on Mexico immigration  trump s tariffs could go into force  We expect to have a good idea within 45 days whether a deal can achieve expected outcomes   The U S  did not offer Mexico funding to enforce the agreement  The U S  Mexico deal reflects diplomacy at its finest and we have full confidence Mexico will fully implement immigration agreement  We are prepared to give agreement with Mexico some amount of time to see whether it s working  but the progress on the border will be evaluated literally daily  Lots of hard work to do on border plan implementation  
The Mexican Foreign Minister Ebard said   The White House meeting is a very tense moment in trade talks as the White House pushed for a safe 3rd country deal in the meeting and during talks  Mexico threatened with retaliation tariffs  Talks with the U S will resume if there are no migration results in 45 days  Mexico didn t agree for agricultural purchases from the U S during talks  Cuba  Africa  and Haiti migrants are traveling through Mexico and we are expecting United Nations help in regional migration efforts  A confrontation from the U S will be costly for Mexico and tariff scenario had a very high cost for Mexico  
Apart from politics  on economics  data shows that the JOLTS job openings for April edged down to 7 449M from 7 474M  revised downwards from 7 474M   lower than the expectations of 7 479M  while quits inched up to 3482K from prior 3461K  indicating confidence among U S  workers 
Overall  the U S  job openings remain above the number of unemployed workers in America for the 14th month in a row and there are 0 78 unemployed job seekers for each available job  Quits reached a new record high but layoffs also ticked higher  Layoffs and discharges at 1 2  in April against 1 1  in March as 1752K people were fired or laid off in April against 1788K in April last year  The latest JOLTS job openings report shows a robust U S  job market still on the card despite the terrible NFP job addition for May and could keep the Fed on a  patience  mode in June meeting 
Technical view  USDJPY
Technically  whatever may be the narrative  USDJPY now has to sustain over 108 80 for a rebound to 109 00 109 25 109 50 110 00 and further rally to 110 70  111 15 111 75 112 40  in the near term  under bullish case scenario

138286,359801,RTN,Trump administration may use Iran threat to sell bombs to Saudis without Congress  approval  senator,news,By Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump s administration plans to use a loophole and rising tensions with Iran to sell bombs to Saudi Arabia  even though Congress blocked such sales for months over concerns about civilian deaths in the war in Yemen  Senator Chris Murphy said on Wednesday   I am hearing that Trump may use an obscure loophole in the Arms Control Act and notice a major new sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia  the ones they drop in Yemen  in a way that would prevent Congress from objecting  Could happen this week   the Democratic senator warned on Twitter  Congressional aides said there are provisions of the Arms Control Act  which sets rules for international arms transactions  that would allow a president to approve a sale without congressional review in case of a national emergency  In this case  they said the Republican president would cite rising tensions with Iran as a reason to provide more military equipment to Saudi Arabia  which he sees as an important U S  partner in the region  Trump has touted arms sales to the Saudis as a way to generate U S  jobs  Trump previously declared an influx of immigrants a national emergency to bypass Congress and get  6 billion to build his wall along the Mexican border  Both Democrats and his fellow Republicans voted to block the move  forcing Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency   It was not immediately clear what equipment would be sold to Saudi Arabia or when any sale might go ahead  However  any such plan would run into resistance in Congress  from Trump s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats like Murphy  even in the Senate  where Republicans have a slim majority  A handful of Republicans recently voted with Democrats in a failed effort to override Trump s veto of a resolution that would have ended U S  support for the Saudi led military coalition in Yemen s devastating civil war  Many lawmakers from both parties have also expressed anger over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey  Senator Lindsey Graham  one of Trump s closest congressional allies  told CNN he would oppose the administration if it decided to go around Congress  citing Khashoggi s killing   We are not going to have business as usual until that issue is dealt with   Graham said  The State Department declined comment  The White House did not respond to a request for comment  The top Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees  who review major international weapons deals  have been approving sales of defensive military equipment to Saudi Arabia  But they have been putting  holds    or blocking   the sale of offensive weapons like bombs  anti tank missiles  small diameter rockets and large mortars  Senator Bob Menendez  the ranking Foreign Relations Democrat  has been blocking the sale of Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co s precision guided munitions  PGMs  to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for about a year over concerns about the war in Yemen ,2019-05-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/trump-administration-may-use-iran-threat-to-sell-bombs-to-saudis-without-congress-approval-senator-1876514,1876514
138291,359806,RTN,U S  deploys more troops to Middle East  blames Iran for tanker attacks,news,"By Phil Stewart  Idrees Ali and Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States on Friday announced the deployment of 1 500 troops to the Middle East  describing it as an effort to bolster defenses against Iran as it accused the country s Revolutionary Guards of direct responsibility for this month s tanker attacks  President Donald Trump s administration also invoked the threat from Iran to declare a national security related emergency that would clear the sale of billions of dollars  worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates and other countries without required congressional approval  The actions were the latest by the Trump administration as it highlights what it sees as a threat of potential attack by Iran  and follows decisions to speed the deployment of an aircraft carrier strike group as well as send bombers and additional Patriot missiles to the Middle East  The deployments  decried by Iran as escalatory  have come amid a freeze in direct communication between the United States and Iran that has raised concerns about the increasing risk of an inadvertent conflict   Trump  however  described the latest deployments as defensive  in nature  The 1 500 troops include personnel manning missile defense systems  aerial surveillance to spot threats and engineers to fortify defenses  It also includes a fighter jet squadron   We want to have protection in the Middle East  We re going to be sending a relatively small number of troops  mostly protective   Trump said as he left the White House for a trip to Japan  The decision on troops marks a reversal of sorts for Trump  who only on Thursday said he thought no more forces were needed  Trump has sought to detangle the U S  military from open ended conflicts in places like Syria and Afghanistan  The deployment is relatively small compared with the about 70 000 American troops now stationed across a region that stretches from Egypt to Afghanistan  In addition  some 600 of the 1 500  new  troops are already in the Middle East manning Patriot missiles  but will see their deployments extended  Still  the Democratic lawmaker who heads the House Armed Services Committee  Adam Smith  said the deployment  appears to be a blatant and heavy handed move to further escalate tensions with Iran   Eager to avoid escalation with Iran amid already heightened tensions  Pentagon officials stressed the defensive nature of the deployment in a news briefing and noted that none of the troops would be heading to hot spots like Iraq or Syria   At the same time  the U S  State Department informed Congress that it will go ahead with 22 arms deals worth some  8 billion  congressional aides said  sweeping aside a long standing precedent for congressional review of such sales  Some lawmakers and congressional aides had warned earlier this week that Trump  frustrated with Congress holding up weapons sales like a major deal to sell Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co precision guided munitions to Saudi Arabia  was considering using the loophole to go ahead with the sale  ATTACKS ON TANKERS Rear Admiral Michael Gilday  the director of the Joint Staff  on Friday described U S  intelligence portraying a new Iranian  campaign  that used old tactics  and stretched from Iraq to Yemen to the waters in the Strait of Hormuz  a vital maritime chokepoint for the global oil trade   We believe with a high degree of confidence that this stems back to the leadership of Iran at the highest levels and that all of the attacks that I mentioned have been attributed to Iran through their proxies or their forces   he said  Gilday accused Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps  IRGC  of being directly responsible for attacks on tankers off the United Arab Emirates earlier this month  in what could be a foreshadowing of the conclusion of ongoing investigations into the incident    The attack against the shipping in Fujairah  we attribute it to the IRGC   Gilday said  explaining that the Pentagon attributed limpet mines used in the attack directly to the IRGC   He declined to describe  the means of delivery  of the mines  however  A Norwegian registered oil products tanker and a UAE fuel bunker barge were among four vessels hit near Fujairah emirate  one of the world s largest bunkering hubs located just outside the Strait of Hormuz  Gilday also accused Iran backed  proxy  forces of carrying out a rocket attack in Baghdad s Green Zone last week   The Pentagon did not provide evidence to support its claims but said it hoped to further declassify intelligence supporting them  Iran has dismissed the accusations entirely and accuses the United States of brinkmanship with its troop deployments  Trump played down the potential for military conflict in the region  saying he believed Iran did not want a confrontation with the United States   even as Washington tightens sanctions with a goal of pushing Iran to make concessions beyond the terms of its 2015 nuclear deal  Trump pulled out of the international deal between Iran and six major world powers last year   Right now  I don t think Iran wants to fight  And I certainly don t think they want to fight with us   Trump said

138330,359845,RTN,U S  missile defense budget cut as North Korea pushes ahead,news,"By Mike Stone WASHINGTON  Reuters    Just when it looks like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may restart his ballistic missile testing program  U S  President Donald Trump has proposed trimming the missile defense budget  as one set of deterrents is delayed by two years  The U S  Missile Defense Agency   charged with developing  testing and fielding a ballistic missile defense system   will delay the expansion of the Ground based Midcourse Defense  GMD  system by two years because of a delay in the redesign of the Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co made  kill vehicle  the system uses  A  kill vehicle  pops off the top of the defending missile above the Earth s atmosphere and seeks out and destroys the attacking missile s warhead  The GMD is a network of radars  anti ballistic missiles based in Alaska and California  and other equipment designed to protect the United States from intercontinental ballistic missiles  or ICBMS  The expansion of the field of interceptors in Alaska from 44 ground based interceptors  or GBIs  to 64 had been slated for completion in 2023  But the delay  due to technical issues and not connected to the cut in the agency s budget  now means that the placement of the additional 20 interceptors will not be operational until 2025  the MDA said on Tuesday   The important thing is to get it right  and if we re going to build more GBI s  we want to put the best kill vehicle on the top of it   said Tom Karako  a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington  At the same time  North Korea has been pushing ahead with its nuclear weapons program after a summit meeting between Kim and Trump in Hanoi ended abruptly on Feb  28 without an agreement on denuclearization  New activity has been detected at a North Korean ICBM plant  South Korean media said on Thursday  as Trump said he would be  very disappointed  if Pyongyang rebuilt a rocket site  In the budget  the Missile Defense Agency  or MDA  saw its appropriation cut by  1 billion to  9 4 billion  Michelle Atkinson  chief financial officer of the MDA  told reporters   What you are seeing in  20 actually looks like a decrease  but it s really just the declining funding   as the agency comes off recent financial injections  Trump s smaller request comes on the heels of a significant budget boost last year after several North Korean missile tests  The MDA projected a budget of  9 2 billion in 2021  and  9 1 billion in 2022  continuing the trend of declining funding  One Pentagon wide effort in lasers that could be used to defeat missiles saw investment slow dramatically  After nearly doubling just the MDA s budget for directed energy from  109 million in 2018 to  224 million in 2019  the Pentagon as a whole plans to invest only  235 million in the technology in fiscal 2020  Among other proposals included in a recently published Missile Defense Review is one involving lasers mounted on drones   aimed at stopping missiles just after takeoff in what is called the boost phase

138358,359873,RTN,Raytheon  RTN  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Raytheon  RTN  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 45 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 4  
Revenues are expected to be  6 58 billion  up 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 92  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Raytheon 
For Raytheon  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 54  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Raytheon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Raytheon would post earnings of  2 89 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 93  delivering a surprise of  1 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Raytheon appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/raytheon-rtn-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200408296,200408296
138359,359874,RTN,Long Ideas  Finding Value Hidden By The Noise,opinion,"As we wrote in  Danger Zone  Traditional Value Investors   price to book screens can easily miss high quality  undervalued stocks  This week s Long Ideas are two stocks that have expensive price to book ratios but are undervalued  Meritor Inc   NYSE MTOR  and Raytheon Company  NYSE RTN  
Price To Book Misses Undervalued Companies
We ve covered the many flaws in price to book  P B  ratios here  Instead of focusing on P B  investors should use price to economic book value  PEBV   a better measure of value  Rather than relying on unscrubbed accounting data  economic book value is derived from our best in class after tax operating profit  NOPAT  and weighted average cost of capital  WACC  
Figure 1  Price To Book Makes Cheap Stocks Look Expensive

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Both MTOR and RTN have P B ratios above the S P 500 market average but below average PEBV ratios  per Figure 1  When coupled with strong fundamentals  this disconnect creates the opportunity for investors to buy quality companies at undervalued prices 
Meritor
With its P B ratio of 5 6  above the S P 500 average of 3 3   MTOR is unlikely to pass traditional value screens  According to ETF com  only four out of 49  8   ETFs that allocate to MTOR are classified as  Value  funds 
MTOR is down 3   vs  S P  3   over the past year  GAAP net income understates MTOR s profitability  which may be leading the market to undervalue the stock 
GAAP Understates True Profits  Since fiscal 2016  MTOR s GAAP net income has fallen 25  compounded annually while NOPAT has grown 9  compounded annually  per Figure 2 
Figure 2  MTOR s GAAP Net Income Masks Rising Profits

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
From the fiscal 2018 10 K  one of the largest income statement adjustments we made is the removal of  126 million  108  of GAAP net income  in non operating expenses due to legislative changes related to U S  tax reform 
This adjustment led NOPAT to be 88  higher than GAAP net income in 2018  Even more impressively  MTOR was able to generate higher NOPAT without significantly increasing its capital base  Over the trailing twelve months  TTM   MTOR s invested capital grew just 6  YoY while TTM NOPAT grew 11  YoY 
After calculating NOPAT  we must account for hidden assets and liabilities overlooked by accounting book value to calculate economic book value  MTOR s book value also does not account for many of the intangible assets   decade long relationships with truck manufacturers  industry knowledge  and trusted reliable brand name   that help MTOR maintain its industry leading positions across its business segments 
When calculating EBV  we make the same adjustments to all companies to ensure comparability  For MTOR  we removed over  982 million  44  of EBV  in total debt  which includes  79 million in off balance sheet operating leases  and  116 million  5  of EBV  in underfunded pensions  Even after subtracting these items  MTOR s valuation still looks cheap given its strong fundamentals 
Strong Competitive Position  MTOR is well positioned to capitalize on rising freight demand and the electrification of automobiles  MTOR estimates they are the leading supplier of heavy duty commercial axles in North America  South America  and Europe  Its customer portfolio includes the two largest truck manufacturers  Daimler AG  DE DAIGn  and AB Volvo  in addition to many others such as PACCAR  NASDAQ PCAR  and Peterbilt 
Most importantly  it s building products to meet the needs of the growing shift to electric vehicles  Leveraging its existing expertise in the space  the company currently has programs across the globe providing parts  such as front rear suspensions  drum and disc brakes  and gearboxes  to electric vehicle manufacturers  In 2018  MTOR sold electric vehicle parts for Daimler Trucks North America  Thomas Built Bus  and Peterbilt  Using the company s Blue Horizon platform  the company will supply Peterbilt with all electric drivetrain systems for tractors and trucks  such as the recently announced all electric 220EV 
Don t Overlook Undervalued Shares  With GAAP net income in decline since 2016  even after the recent TTM increase  and a P B ratio above the market average  value investors could easily overlook MTOR  However  after removing accounting distortions and analyzing the expectations for future cash flows implied by the stock price  we find that MTOR provides excellent risk reward   
At its current price of  22 share  MTOR has a PEBV of 0 8  This ratio means the market expects MTOR s NOPAT to permanently decline by 20   This expectation seems rather pessimistic given that MTOR has grown NOPAT by 9  compounded annually since 2016 and 13  compounded annually since 2009 
Even if we assume MTOR s NOPAT stagnates  the current economic book value  or no growth value of the stock  is  27 share   a 23  upside from the current price 
If we assume MTOR can maintain TTM margins  6   and grow NOPAT by just 5  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  30 share today   a 36  upside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario 
Raytheon Company
With its P B ratio of 4 5  above the S P 500 average of 3 3   RTN is unlikely to pass traditional value screens as well  In fact  according to ETF com  fewer than 10  out of 178  ETFs that allocate to RTN are classified as  Value  funds 
RTN is down 15   vs  S P  3   over the past year  Given its strong fundamentals  this decline makes the stock look cheap  despite traditional valuation metrics showing the opposite 
GAAP Understates True Profits  RTN s 2018 GAAP net income understates NOPAT  This disconnect is largely attributable to non operating expenses  such as  1 2 billion  42  of GAAP net income  in non operating pensions costs 
In total  we identified  512 million in net non operating expenses that must be removed from GAAP net income to calculate RTN s true profits  After these adjustments  we calculate that NOPAT is actually 18  higher than GAAP net income 
Calculating NOPAT is only one piece of the equation for finding real value  One must also account for changes in the balance sheet to get the complete picture of a company s operations  Items such as off balance sheet debt  excess cash  deferred tax assets  and more represent hidden assets and liabilities that accounting book value overlooks  In 2018  the largest item we removed from reported net assets was  2 9 billion  12  of reported net assets  in excess cash  In addition  RTN s book value does not account for many of the intangible assets   government relationships  technical expertise  and more   that are required to succeed in the Defense industry 
History of Strong Fundamentals  Over the past decade  RTN s revenue grew 2  compounded annually while NOPAT grew 6  compounded annually  per Figure 3  The company s NOPAT margin increased from 8  in 2008 to 13  in 2018 while its ROIC improved from 8  to 10  over the same time

The history of strong fundamentals looks poised to continue as well  RTN reported record bookings  the value of orders awarded during the year  of  32 2 billion in 2018  which was up 16  YoY  RTN s total backlog  the value of all orders on which work has not yet been performed  ended the year at a record  42 4 billion  up 11  YoY  Furthermore  domestic defense spending is expected to rise as the U S  looks to update older equipment while foreign governments  30  of RTN revenue came from international customers in 2018  ramp up their spending 
Don t Overlook Undervalued Shares  Any metric that relies on unscrubbed accounting data will lead investors astray  The research we do to remove accounting distortions and measure the expectations implied by the stock price reveals that RTN is significantly undervalued 
At its current price of  184 share  RTN has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 1  This ratio means the market expects RTN s NOPAT to grow by no more than 10  over the remainder of its corporate life  This expectation seems pessimistic given that RTN has grown NOPAT by 6  compounded annually over the past decade and 5  compounded annually over the past two decades 
If RTN can maintain 2018 margins  13   and grow NOPAT by just 4  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  233 share today   a 26  upside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario

138381,359896,RTN,Why Raytheon  RTN  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Raytheon  RTN   which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense Equipment industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this defense contractor has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 8 68   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Raytheon came out with earnings of  2 93 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 89 per share  representing a surprise of 1 38   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 94 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 25 per share  delivering a surprise of 15 98  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Raytheon  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Raytheon currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 05   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 25  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-raytheon-rtn-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200406378,200406378

When looking at the last two reports  this defense contractor has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 10 79   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Raytheon came out with earnings of  2 25 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 94 per share  representing a surprise of 15 98   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 32 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 45 per share  delivering a surprise of 5 60

When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

138475,359990,RTN,Raytheon  RTN  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Raytheon  RTN  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 88 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  41 9  
Revenues are expected to be  7 50 billion  up 10 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 34  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Raytheon 
For Raytheon  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Raytheon will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Raytheon would post earnings of  1 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 25  delivering a surprise of  15 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line

138548,360063,RTN,General Dynamics Wins  347M Deal For Virginia Class Submarines,opinion,General Dynamics Corp  s   NYSE GD   business unit  Electric Boat  recently secured a modification contract in relation to the Virginia class submarine program  Per the terms of the deal  the shipbuilder will offer fiscal 2019 lead yard support  development studies and design efforts for the Virginia class submarines  Details of the Deal Valued at  346 5 million  the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command  Washington  D C  Under the agreement  lead yard support will maintain  update and support the Virginia class design as well as related drawings and data for each Virginia class Submarine  including technology insertion  throughout its construction and post shakedown availability period General Dynamics will also deliver all engineering and related lead yard support necessary for direct maintenance and support of Virginia class ship specifications   In addition  this modification will entail the company tocontinue development studies and design efforts related to components and systems for accomplishing research and development tasks as well as prototypes and engineering development models required to fully evaluate new technologies to be inserted in succeeding Virginia class submarines The entire task is expected to be completed by September 2019  majority of which will be executed in Groton  CT A Brief Note on the Virginia Class Submarine ProgramThe Virginia class submarine program is a class of nuclear powered fast attack submarines  SSNs  serving the U S  Navy  Designed for the full range of global mission requirements like intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare  these stealthy boats excel in littoral and open ocean environments  The Virginia Class submarines are being jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc    NYSE HII   As of December 2017  Electric Boat has delivered 15 Virginia class submarines in partnership with Huntington Ingalls  The remaining 13 submarines under the contract are scheduled for delivery through 2023 What s Favoring General Dynamics Being one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear powered submarines  General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor  Moreover  the United States is strategically strengthening its naval power by upgrading missile submarines as widespread geo political tensions loom large  This  in turn  provided a significant boost to the defense contractors like General Dynamics Coming to the Virginia Class submarine program  it is imperative to mention that cost and time to deliver follow on ships has been reduced consistently and significantly from 84 months to 66 months since the delivery of the lead Virginia class submarine  Also  the mission capability and quality of the ships at delivery have improved over time  This must have made this submarine program all the more a feasible choice for the U S  Navy as is evident from the latest contract Currently  General Dynamics is developing the Virginia Payload Module   VPM   for the fifth block of Virginia class submarines  expected to start construction in 2019  This block of submarines will provide a considerable upgrade to its size and performance  Additionally  it is likely to significantly boost General Dynamics  Marine System segment  which builds nuclear powered submarines  In the third quarter of 2018  this segment generated 3 7  revenue growth Furthermore  toward the end of June this year  the U S  Senate approved the fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments worth  18 4 billion for shipbuilding  The budget included an investment plan of  7 4 billion for two Virginia class submarines  We may expect General Dynamics to be a significant beneficiary of the aforementioned budget  which in turn  is likely to boost its profit margin moving ahead Price MovementIn a year s time  General Dynamics  stock has lost 16 1  compared with the  s 1 4  decline  The underperformance may have been caused by the intense

138608,360123,RTN,Believing This One Common Opinion Could Crush All Your Future Profits,opinion,"I ve chosen to publish this column today because I want every investor who reads it to have a fighting chance in the months ahead  at a time when the headlines are hopelessly negative and running for the hills seems like a prudent thing to do 
Not one in a million investors will come to terms with today s message  which is too bad  considering how much wealth will be created by those few   like you   who do 
Even if the others don t want to believe it 
The Perspective to Turn Pessimism into Profits
Years ago  I was a typical newbie investor trying to make sense of the financial markets  Like many people in the early 1980s  I found it difficult to come to terms with the collapse of the Soviet Union  runaway inflation that was a legacy of the 1970s  a recession  oil deregulation  and more  when it came to my money 
The headlines were extremely negative  leading some very smart people to conclude that the economic woes of the time were insurmountable  and by implication  investing was not worth the risk 
My grandmother  Virginia  Mimi  Gruner  didn t see things that way 
A self taught investor widowed at a young age  she was making thousands of dollars a month at a time when that was inconceivable  and her portfolio was doing exceptionally well 
I asked Mimi how she was doing that  What was she buying 
She told me  and my understanding of how markets worked changed overnight 
What did Mimi say 
Was it about which companies to buy  Cutting risk  Finding undiscovered stocks 
No 
Psychology 
Mimi simply looked across the dining room table and said 
 People want to believe the world is going to hell in a handbasket  
That was a major  a ha  moment for me 
Suddenly I understood why most investors cannot buy low and sell high  why they try to time the markets even though that almost never works  and why they cannot remove emotion from the equation even though they know it s the single biggest thing standing between them and the profits they crave 
More importantly  I also understood how to find the biggest  most profitable opportunities when others saw only chaos 
Shortly after Mimi and I had that conversation  I stumbled into research from Carnegie Mellon s Michael F  Scheier and the University of Miami s Chuck S  Carver  who  as it turns out  were the first to put together the scientific linkage between optimism and expectation in a groundbreaking 1985 study 
They found that optimists are  problem solvers who try to improve the situation   Pessimists simply let their behavior get the better of them 
Which brings me back to Mimi s point about why negative headlines make the news 
Simply put  it s easier to believe pessimists 
Optimists sound like they re throwing caution to the wind  The term carries an almost reckless connotation  especially today when the risks we face are seemingly higher than they ve ever been before 
When it comes to your money  a bearish view just sounds  well  smarter 
The unspoken message is that pessimists have somehow dug deeper or gone beyond the obvious to develop a nuanced view to explain what s around the next corner 
You can t blame people for feeling this way  given the downright apocalyptic headlines at the moment 
Yet Mimi would tell you pessimism only sounds intelligent because investors subconsciously interpret it as a protective reflex   and here s the important part   even when the data shows beyond any shadow of a doubt that staying the course is the far more profitable course of action 
Bond  King  Bill Gross famously predicted the Dow would sink to 5 000 in 2009  It s risen 278 4  since its 2009 nadir  as of Tuesday 
In 2010  Elliott Wave expert Robert Prechter called the Dow at 1 000 and a looming market crash of staggering proportions 
Demographic researcher Harry Dent took the Internet by storm in 2011  claiming the Dow would fall to 3 000  After a mere 13  dip that year  it s up more than 100 38  since 
Peter Schiff  president of Euro Pacific Capital  predicted that the Dow would collapse to 2 000 in 2010  Today it s up 111 46  since the end of that year 
In March of 2014  Dent piled on again  saying that the Dow was setting itself up for a major crash that would give investors a 50  haircut and take the average to 6 000 by 2016  Today the average trades around 24 600 
Unfortunately  as bright as these individuals are  what they re doing is a lot like predicting 10 out of the last two recessions  and about as useful as worrying there will be 18 feet of snow in July based on three inches in November 
Eventually  though  they ll get it right and claim vindication 
I d rather see you claim profits 
Case in point  my team and I have helped readers identify literally hundreds of double  and triple digit winners  including 326  on Altria Group  NYSE MO   174  on American Water Works Company  NYSE AWK    and 214  on Raytheon  NYSE RTN    even as the folks I just mentioned  along with legions of others  were warning of financial Armageddon 
How 
By keeping our Five Total Wealth Principles in mind no matter how scary the headlines got 

Capital is a creative force and the foundation of wealth which  in turn  is the embodiment of ideas  It is constantly growing and has been since the dawn of time  Sometimes growth slows  as is the case at present  but it will not stop 
The markets have an upward bias  which is a function of constantly increasing amounts of money chasing fewer quality stocks over time  You can argue that the markets go up and down  and you d be right  But that does not change the fact that the general direction over time is UP  The only question is how you handle the swings  and that comes down to proper risk management 
Technology increases total market size every time in every industry  Many pessimists base their argument on extrapolation  It s logical  for example  to assume the markets would go to zero if you look at what happened in 2009 when the bottom fell out and millions of investors believed the end of the financial universe was upon us  But  like I just said  that s about as accurate as saying we ll have 18 feet of snow on the ground in July based on three inches falling in November  If you re going to extrapolate anything  understand that technology is the one constant capable of increasing market size everywhere it occurs  This means a constantly expanding stream of ideas that are ultimately translated into earnings and  in turn  higher stock prices over time 
Profits follow innovation  Pessimists take doom and gloom personally and view it as a form of ultimatum  Optimists  on the other hand  view doom and gloom like I do and Mimi did   as an opportunity to try something different  Anything negative is only temporary  which is why you should keep in mind that innovation has never failed to produce profits  Ever 
Disruption crosses every economic strata  Pessimists want everybody to fail  whereas optimists want even pessimists to succeed  That s why disruption  and disruptive technology in particular  is so powerful and so capable of overcoming even the worst pessimism 

In closing  I realize that we ve covered a lot of ground  and I know it will take a while to sink in  especially if you re prone to pessimism   as many investors are at the moment 
Mimi and I had our conversation 37 years ago  and I still struggle from time to time to separate how I feel about a particularly nasty headline from what I know about money and profits  Not every prediction I ve made has been on the mark  but I ve never let that get in the way of profit potential

138664,360179,RTN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Home Depot  Merck  Raytheon  Eaton And Sun Life Financial,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 17  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Home Depot   NYSE HD    Merck   NYSE MRK    Raytheon   NYSE RTN    Eaton   NYSE ETN   and Sun Life Financial   TO SLF   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Top Analyst Reports for Home Depot  Merck and RaytheonThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Home Depot  Merck and Raytheon  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Home Depot s shares have gained  20 5  over the last year  outperforming the Zacks Retail Building Products industry s  14 1  increase  The Zacks analyst thinks that this performance is attributable to its five year long trend of beating earnings estimates  which continued in first quarter fiscal 2018 Further  both the top and bottom line improved year over year in the first quarter  Results gained from strength in core business as well as relentless focus on affording innovative products  boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity  Steady housing market recovery and strong customer demand also remain tailwinds Going into the fiscal second quarter  the company continues to witness strength in all lines of business in the first few weeks of May  Consequently  it provided an optimistic view for fiscal 2018  However  the top line lagged estimates mainly due to colder than normal weather that led to softness in the spring season categories  particularly garden  This softness also resulted in a decline in comparable transactions  You can   Shares of Merck have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry year to date  gaining  5 2  versus a loss of  4 0   Merck beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for sales in Q1 The Zacks analyst thinks that new products like Keytruda  Lynparza  and Bridion should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line in 2018  Keytruda sales are gaining momentum with approval for additional indications especially in the first line lung cancer setting as it is the only anti PD 1 approved in this setting  The Animal Health unit is also strong and remains a core growth driver for Merck Meanwhile  Merck will continue to focus on cost cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line  However  generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line  Rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and on products like Isentress  HIV   Zepatier  HCV  and Zostavax  vaccine  will remain headwinds in 2018  You can   Raytheon s shares have risen around  14 5  over the last six months  outperforming the Zacks Defense

138690,360205,RTN,Can TransDigm Maintain Impressive Momentum Amid Risks ,opinion,"TransDigm Group Inc    NYSE TDG   has managed to impress investors with its recent earnings streak  wherein the company s bottom line has trumped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters  TransDigm s impressive business model actively works toward strengthening and enhancing its position in highly engineered proprietary aerospace components  niche markets 
We believe that the company s strong operational execution  solid portfolio of products as well as complementary acquisitions should continue boosting growth  moving ahead 
Consequently  TransDigm s shares have had an impressive run on the bourse over the past six months  The stock has gained 16 3   compared with the  s rally of 9 5   We expect the company s remarkable traction across markets to continue in the upcoming quarters as well 

 
Given this backdrop  let s delve deeper to find out key drivers for the company right now 
Factors to Consider
TransDigm s business operation model is driven by three value driver concepts has helped the company generate sufficient organic and inorganic growth  and drive operating margin expansion over the past few quarters  Also  it designs  produces and supplies highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systems with a significant aftermarket presence  In this regard  90  of TransDigm s net sales are generated from proprietary engineered products  for which the company enjoys the intellectual property right  thus enhancing its competitive strength meaningfully 
Moreover  the company s penchant for acquisitions of proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content has helped it to bolster footprint in core market and grab a higher market share  In fiscal 2017  TransDigm acquired three add on aerospace product lines  for a total consideration of roughly  100 million 
These acquisitions should add to its product range with the proprietary products  which already enjoy strong positions on high use of platforms and robust aftermarket content  Further  its Defense business has been experiencing stability  thus adding to the company s strength 
Also  decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system for senior management have created a potent workforce that acts as one of the company s major assets  This apart  a diversified revenue base reduces TransDigm s dependence on any particular product  platform or market channel  thus playing a crucial role in maintaining its financial performance 
However  the company is suffering from escalating debt burden and consequent higher interest expenses  Its interest expenses have also been trending upward for the past few quarters  For instance  TransDigm recorded an interest expense of about  15 million  up 10  from the previous quarter  mainly on account of increase in its total debt  We believe that rising interest expenses will continue restraining its profits  going ahead 
This apart  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has been suffering from prolonged weakness in some of its major end market that has thwarted the company s growth momentum  Softening discretionary retrofits  interior retrofits and weakness in jet and helicopter markets have also impacted its top line performance in recent times 
Key Picks
Some better ranked stocks from the same space include Curtiss Wright Corp    NYSE CW    Raytheon Company   NYSE RTN   and Rockwell Collins  Inc    NYSE COL    While Curtiss Wright sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Raytheon and Rockwell Collins carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Curtiss Wright surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 15 1  
Raytheon surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 6 4  
Rockwell Collins outpaced estimates thrice in the preceding four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 2 5

138707,360222,RTN,Nervous Baltics on war footing as NATO tries to deter Russia,news,"By Robin Emmott and Andrius Sytas VILNIUS  Reuters    Leaders in the Baltic countries and Poland fear the force NATO plans to deploy on their territory is too small and symbolic to deter an attack by Russia  whose 2014 annexation of Crimea is fresh in the memories of the former Soviet bloc states  They will this week press other ministers of the western military alliance to help them build an air defense system against Russian aircraft and missiles  But that would be a highly sensitive step  likely to be condemned by Moscow as yet more evidence of a NATO strategy threatening its borders  Asked about the likelihood of Russian aggression in the Baltics  Lithuania s Defense Minister Juozas Olekas told Reuters   We cannot exclude it     They might exercise on the borders and then switch to invasion in hours   Lithuania  Latvia and Estonia see themselves on the front line in any potential conflict with Moscow and say they are putting their armies on a war footing  meaning they can be mobilized almost immediately   NATO defense ministers are set to agree this week on a new multinational force of 4 000 troops for the Baltics and Poland   The United States  Germany and Britain are set to lead battalions of about 1 000 troops each  Canada may lead a fourth   While the Baltic nations welcome the deployments  they say the build up must go further   pointing to Russia s efforts to develop an  anti access  capability in the Kaliningrad exclave bordering Lithuania and Poland  using missiles and submarines to stop NATO moving reinforcements into the Baltics  The Baltics want NATO fighters to protect their skies and are seeking medium range missile interceptors from Norway s Kongsberg Gruppen  OL KOG  and U S  defense contractor Raytheon  N RTN    We need to stop possible air aggression   said Olekas   We are discussing creating a regional medium range air defense system together with the Latvians  the Estonians and the Poles   Olekas expects to raise the matter with NATO colleagues at the ministers  meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday in Brussels  CREDIBILITY The head of the Estonian defense force Lieutenant General Riho Terras said   The first and foremost is the defense of our airspace  Air defense is the challenge that needs to solved together with the NATO alliance    We are not talking about defense of Lithuania  we are talking about the credibility of the whole alliance   said Lithuania s Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius  But such calls would require stretched NATO governments to beef up the so called air policing mission that regularly intercepts Russian jets flying over international waters close to the Baltic states  The Baltic nations rely on their NATO allies  quick reaction aircraft to patrol their skies  with no mandate to confront hostile aircraft in a conflict  Four British Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets and four Portuguese F 16 fighter jets are currently carrying out the air policing mission  Officials say a lot more would be needed for air defense   And southern NATO nations  focused on uncontrolled migrant flows and the failing states on Europe s borders  may also be unwilling to grant more resources to the eastern flank  Ben Hodges  the commander of the U S  army in Europe  visited Vilnius last week  He echoed Baltic concerns about the strength of NATO s deterrence    It is a transition   Hodges said   I hope that includes serious war fighting capabilities  Just putting garrisons of troops sitting in the countries     will not deter   Russia insists it poses no threat to the former Soviet states  Top NATO officials say talk of an impending attack is misleading  a view shared by Paris and Berlin  Russia has held unannounced exercises on the borders of the Baltics  including one in 2014 which mustered 100 000 troops  according to Danish Colonel Jakob Sogard Larsen  who heads the new NATO command outpost in Lithuania   You see it differently when you live here   Larsen said   We need to learn to fight total war again   he said  in a sign of the return of a Cold War style mood  Lithuanian officials accuse Russia of trying to buy off Lithuanian soldiers and business people to become spies for the Kremlin  intimidating diplomats and spreading disinformation on the Internet and television   Prosecutors are preparing to file criminal charges against someone they say is a high ranking Russian intelligence officer arrested last year trying to recruit informants   Russia denies any such activities  SWITCH TO  CLASSIC WARFARE  The NATO battalions are part of a deterrent to be approved by leaders at a summit in Warsaw in July  That will involve forces on rotation  warehoused equipment and a  spearhead  force backed by NATO s 40 000 strong rapid reaction force  Once the decision is made  Germany could deploy to Lithuania before September  Britain is expected to deploy to Estonia  the United States to Latvia and Canada possibly to Poland  German and Danish soldiers fanned out across swamps and woodland in Lithuania this week in war games to learn the unfamiliar Baltic terrain and test their ability to move equipment and personnel quickly to a possible front  Their tanks and armored vehicles were recently brought back from Afghanistan  desert yellow camouflage painted over with

portion of the deal A Brief Note on AMRAAMRaytheon s AMRAAM is the world s most sophisticated air dominance weapon  with operational flexibility during air to air and surface launch engagements  Its capabilities have been fully demonstrated in more than 4 200 test shots and 10 air to air combat victories Per Raytheon  in the air to air role  no other missile compares to the AMRAAM missile  The weapon s advanced active guidance section provides aircrew with a high degree of combat flexibility and lethality  This weapon has been procured by as many as 37 nations  including the United States  It has been installed in top quality military jets like F 16  F 15  F A 18  F 22  Typhoon  Gripen  Tornado and Harrier Its latest version  the AMRAAM Extended Range missile is a new  ground launched solution that will intercept targets at longer distances and higher altitudes Our ViewWith an increase in cyber attacks  terror threats and geopolitical instability  a rapid rise in defense spending has been witnessed among countries to strengthen their national security worldwide  As a result  America has been observing a solid inflow of military contracts lately  particularly for missile defense  in the wake of the consistent cross border tensions that prevailed in 2017 between the United States and North Korea With Raytheon being one of the defense majors in the United States  Raytheon s Missile Systems segment has been clinching significant awards from the United States as well as international customers  courtesy of its high end  combat proven advanced arsenal  For instance  the company won a  2 3 billionhybrid contract for providing engineering services to the Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target  PATRIOT  weapon systems program  at the end of January 2018 Based on the 15  sales growth at Missile Systems in fourth quarter 2017 and the growing demand for Raytheon s Integrated Air and Missile Defense portfolio in domestic as well as international markets  we expect this unit to scale new highs post winning contracts like the latest one  Moreover  the recently released fiscal 2019 defense budget aims at spending  12 9 billion for enhancements of U S  missile defense capabilities  of which  12 9 billion is allocated for missile defense  Notably  the budget includes an investment plan of  1 1 billion for 240 Patriot Missile Segment Enhancements  This in turn reflects higher growth prospects for Raytheon and we expect the company to win more such contracts from the Pentagon in the coming days Price PerformanceShares of Raytheon have rallied about 42  in a year  compared with the broader  s gain of 35 4   The company s growing demand for missile defense systems and expanding overseas business boosted the performance

138781,360296,RTN,Turkey in missile talks with France after China disagreements  Erdogan,news,"ANKARA  Reuters    Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was in talks with France on the purchase of a long range missile defense system after disagreements with China  which was originally awarded the tender 
U S  and NATO officials have said Turkish collaboration with China on the system could raise questions of compatibility of weaponry and of security 
Franco Italian Eurosam  which is owned by Franco Italian missile maker MBDA and France s Thales  PA TCFP   came second in a tender last September  losing out to China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp s  CPMIEC   3 4 billion offer 
 Some disagreements have emerged with China on the issues of joint production and know how during negotiations over the missile defense system   Erdogan told reporters as he returned from the NATO summit in Wales  private television channel NTV said on Sunday 
 Talks are continuing despite that but France  which is second on the list  has come up with new offers  Right now our talks with France are continuing  For us  joint production is very  very important   he said 
The comments were confirmed by Erdogan s office on Monday 
The choice of CPMIEC for the project irked Western allies as the company is under U S  sanctions for violations of the Iran  North Korea and Syria Non proliferation Act 
U S  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel  who told a defense industry forum last week that Russia and China were working hard to close a weapons technology gap with the United States  was in Ankara on Monday 
Last month  Turkey invited firms in the tender  including Eurosam and U S  listed Raytheon Co  N RTN   the maker of Patriot missiles which came in third  to extend the validity of their bids  indicating Ankara was still considering alternative offers but stopped short of discussing problems with the Chinese deal 
In May  Turkish officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity that China had not met the tender s conditions

138858,360373,RTN,Can Missile Systems Unit Drive Raytheon s  RTN  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Defense major Raytheon Company   NYSE RTN   is scheduled to release third quarter 2017 results on Oct 26  before the opening bell We expect Missile Systems business unit to primarily drive the company s revenues in the third quarter  Moreover  its overseas business expansion is also expected to boost the quarterly results   Let s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Raytheon s quarterly results Missile Systems Unit   A Key CatalystSegment wise  Missile systems business unit that represent almost 30  of the company s total business sales continue to be a major growth driver  The third quarter is also poised to benefit from this unit   Notably  the company won a modification contract worth  615 million for manufacturing 17 Standard Missile 3  SM 3  Block IIA missiles  Such order wins indicate solid demand for missiles manufactured by Raytheon and in turn is expected to boost sales Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter sales is  1 980 million for the segment  reflecting year over year growth of 13 2  Moreover  management earlier announced that it expects an  improvement in this segment s margin in the second half of the year  starting from the third quarter  In this line  our consensus estimate for operating income of  267 million for this segment reflects an annual improvement of 13 6   thereby hinting at possible operating margin rise in the to be reported quarter International Operations  A Major PositiveApart from its strong forte in domestic front  international business expansion has always been a primary growth driver for Raytheon  The company is currently witnessing strong demand for varied product line not only from Middle East but also from Asia Pacific  In particular  Taiwan  South Korea and Japan have emerged as new abodes for the company s expansion  Europe also continues to be a major contributor to sales growth  We believe once the company reports third quarter results  these nations  contribution to Raytheon s growth story will become clearer Other Contracts to Boost GrowthLike other defense bellwethers  Raytheon also won a number of contracts during the third quarter  Among the orders that Raytheon clinched  the significant ones include a  134 million modification contract for procuring Javelin containerized all up rounds  command launch units  Javelin vehicle launcher electronics and associated non recurring engineering and a  119 million contract to support the Maritime Strike Tomahawk Program  It also won a modification contract of  127 million for procuring Excalibur Precision 155 mm Projectiles It goes without saying that these contract wins will boost the company s third quarter sales  In line with this the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales stands at  6 3 billion  reflecting annual growth of 4 9  Moreover  during second quarter earnings call  Raytheon s management raised its EPS guidance to reflect the company s improved operating performance alongside expecting the bottom line to grow in the third quarter  In line with this our consensus estimate for Raytheon s earnings is pegged at  7 90 per share  reflecting annual growth of 6 4  Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Raytheon is likely to beat earnings this quarter  Notably  a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Raytheon possess both of these attributes  as mentioned below Zacks ESP  Raytheon has an Earnings ESP of  0 05   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  1 91  higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 90  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise     Zacks Rank  Raytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  which along with a positive earnings ESP hints at possible surprise prediction Meanwhile  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other defense companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc

Estimate of  3 54 billion by 1 5  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking

138969,360484,RTN,Will Textron  TXT  Disappoint Investors In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Textron Inc    NYSE TXT   is set to report second quarter 2017 financial results on Jul 19  before the market opens In the prior quarter  the company s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Textron has missed expectations in one of the trailing four quarters  with an average negative surprise of 0 82  Let s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderTextron is a multi industry conglomerate that is well known for its brands such as Bell Helicopter  Cessna Aircraft Company  Jacobsen  Kautex  E Z GO and Greenlee  Apart from manufacturing aircraft  automotive engine components and industrial tools as well as offering associated services  the company operates as a commercial finance corporation in select markets With respect to second quarter highlights  Textron won a couple of sumptuous contracts from Pentagon  which we believe will get duly reflected in the company s increased revenue growth for the yet to be reported quarter  While one of these contracts  worth  475 million was awarded by the U S  Special Operations Command  USSOCOM  for the Mid Endurance Unmanned Aircraft Systems  MEUAS   the other one was a Navy deal worth  146 6 million for repairing parts of the UH 1Y and AH IZ aircraft Coming to expectations regarding the quarter s outcome  the company is likely to witness strong sales growth at its Industrial business segment  courtesy of the Arctic Cat buyout in the first quarter of 2017  This segment s growth will be further boosted with Textron having started delivering its highly efficient ELiTE series lithium golf cars in the first quarter  which comes with zero battery maintenance Although the company s Bell segment has been dragging down its top line for quite a few quarters so far  management expects to see some upward potential  at least in terms of this segment s margins  starting from the second quarter   On the flip side  lower than expected Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle  TAPV  production in the first quarter hampered the company s growth  Textron has incurred a notable loss of  24 million under a contract related to TAPV  In the near future  no significant improvement in this situation can be expected  We believe this program will remain a challenge for the second quarter results as well  Also  the pre tax special charges of  22 million incurred in the first quarter owing to the Arctic Cat acquisition  has forced the company to increase the annual pre tax charges forecast by almost  15 million  These charges may also impose greater expenses on the company s upcoming results For the second quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents  down 16 86  year over year  while the consensus for revenues is estimated at  3 59 billion  implying a 2 29  year over year increase Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Textron is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  Textron has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 55 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Textron carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which increases the predictive power of ESP  But the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult Meanwhile  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

138970,360485,RTN,Make Any Investment Risk Free In One Move,opinion,"There s no way to eliminate risk 100  when it comes to investing 
I can t do it  You can t do it   And if anyone tries to tell you otherwise  take your money and run  
There s just no such thing 
That said  there is one way you can make any investment risk free under the right set of circumstances   by using one of my favorite Total Wealth Tactics  the free trade 
The concept of a risk free investment is not new  The allure of risking nothing and gaining everything has been around for centuries 
Case in point 
 the Tulip Bulb Crisis of 1634 1637
 the South Sea Bubble of 1711
 the Florida Real Estate Crash of 1926
 Bernie Madoff s Ponzi scheme
So  why is it that you hear the term in widespread use today 
Because Wall Street only associates risk with loss 
That s why you re told U S  Treasuries and other government paper are risk free investment choices  even though they know full well that there are risks inherent in every investment  It s a game of semantics 
It s also a game  incidentally  that Wall Street s big traders desperately want you to play because it forces you to implicitly buy off on the most profitable strategy of all  for them    diversification 
No doubt you ve heard that term before   just probably not like I m about to explain it to you 
 Diversification  Is a Marketing Tactic
Diversification is the idea that if you spread your risk around in different asset classes and investments   like stocks  bonds  cash  real estate  and the like   you ll be better off  The thinking is that not everything can possibly go down at once 
It s also a concept that s been around for a while  In fact  the theory was first noted in the book of Ecclesiastes written around 935 B C  It s also mentioned in the Talmud  Even Shakespeare picked up on it in  The Merchant of Venice  hundreds of years ago 
But it s absolutely wrong 
Ask anybody who got their portfolio halved twice in the last 15 years   first during the dot bomb implosion from 2000 2003 and then the ongoing financial crisis that kicked off in 2008 with a vengeance   Everything  went down at once  both times 
And it s not just me who thinks so  either 
Warren Buffett notably quipped that diversification  makes very little sense for those who know what they are doing  
The legendary Jim Rogers famously observed that  diversification is something brokers came up with  so they don t get sued   To which he added in a 2016 Business Insider interview on the subject   if you want to get rich  you have to concentrate and think differently  
I agree very strongly 
Wall Street doesn t want you to put all your eggs in one basket because   they ll tell you   it s riskier  To which I reply   for you  because spreading your money around means they earn higher commissions  they have a greater number of opportunities to pick your pockets  and they can prey on your worst fears 
I believe you ve got to think about risk differently in today s highly computerized and interlinked global markets  especially when it comes to your winners 
Again  Mr  Rogers and I agree  He notes   and I m paraphrasing   that you want to put all your eggs in one basket  just make sure it s the right basket and watch it carefully 
My logic isn t sophisticated 
Put simply  nobody ever went broke taking profits  but plenty of people have gone broke taking losses  So it not only makes sense to concentrate your assets using appropriate risk management  but also to harvest your winners when the markets are strong  That way you ll have opportunity at hand rather than be forced to run for the hills when the markets are weak 
It doesn t matter whether you ve got a lot of money or just a little  the principles driving our discussion today are exactly the same 
You want to capture profits every chance you get  and 
You want to take risk off the table at every opportunity 
Preferably  both at the same time 
Here s a Real Life Example of How This Works
I recommended Raytheon Company  NYSE RTN  to my Money Map Report subscribers in August 2011 because it was closely tied into one of the single most powerful Unstoppable Trends we follow  War  Terrorism and Ugliness  It was trading at  46 05 a share then 
By November 2013  the company s stock had risen to  85 19  and dividend payouts had reduced the cost basis to  42 51  so subscribers who followed along as directed were sitting on returns of at least 100     42 51 x 2    85 01  In keeping with what I ve just explained  I recommended selling half the position to capture profits and redeploy the proceeds into subsequent recommendations  I also suggested that they let the remaining shares run 
I call this a  free trade   because you not only get back your original investment  but you maintain all the upside you can handle  essentially  for free   Even better  because you ve now  paid  for your investment  you can stay in the game with not an additional dollar at risk  even if the stock you ve just harvested has a sudden reversal in fortune and goes from hero to zero 
By capturing profits when we had the chance  subscribers ensured that their focus was on winning and on new opportunity  exactly as a savvy investor should  Not losing their asteroids  as is the case for most investors when the markets take a hit 
As part of that move   selling half their RTN shares   subscribers were left with a remaining position in Raytheon that could literally go to zero and they wouldn t lose money  Obviously  that s a very unlikely outcome for such a major player   And I ll show you how the trade turned out in just a moment  
So while it s not literally risk free  I would argue that it s as close as you can get to the term s true meaning 
What I like about this most is that a free trade works  a  in all kinds of market conditions  b  on any investment  and c  can be set up well in advance  That means you don t have to be planted by your computer nor be an aggressive day trader to make it work 
No other technique I know of comes close in terms of simplicity or effectiveness 
Plus  you know exactly what price is required to harvest your gains   and remove your risk   in advance  In fact  you can set up your order to sell half of your investment for at least a 100  gain the moment you buy a stock you re interested in  Or any investment for that matter 
Contrary to what a lot of people think  the  free trade  is not about reducing potential at all when it s properly executed  That s because you can then take the money you ve pulled out of a free trade and immediately lateral it into another opportunity while letting the rest ride 
So How Did the Raytheon  Free Trade  Work Out 
The stock closed yesterday at  166 13  Meanwhile  after collecting more dividends  subscribers  cost basis is now down to  39 85 per share  Anybody who s followed along has had the opportunity to capture at least 100  while the remaining shares continue to appreciate  Returns are now north of 316 80  and climbing 
Meanwhile  they ve also had the opportunity to put the profits they captured from the  free trade  into subsequent recommendations that have allowed them to repeat the process yet again and  in the process  build their capital even faster 
Imagine how fast your money can grow if you do this once  twice  three times  or more   all from a single Total Wealth Tactic used at the right time 
The markets want to hand you money every day  all you have to do is make sure you re ready to grab it ",2017-07-18,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/make-any-investment-risk-free-in-one-move-200201674,200201674

Today  we woke to the good news of a targeted strike on the Syrian air base that had sent the planes to do the chemical weapons strike 
This is a measured  immediate military response that will now undergird a fresh round of behind the scenes diplomacy  both by the U S  and its allies 
All of this is  in fact  good news 
Which is why the U S  and global stock markets sold off in a knee jerk reaction at first  But by early morning  had recovered to trading flat  That says traders are comfortable with the approach taken by the U S   which is clearly being directed by the newly reconstituted National Security Council  and the former Marine at the head of the Defense Department  James Mattis

139089,360604,RTN,Radiant Logistics  Valspar  Raytheon  Rolls Royce Holdings And Huntington Ingalls Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 10  2017   highlights Radiant Logistics  NYSEMKT        as the Bull of the Day  Valspar Corporation  NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Raytheon  NYSE         Rolls Royce Holdings  OTCMKTS        and Huntington Ingalls  NYSE        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

Radiant Logistics  NYSEMKT       rallied on Friday with volume that was approaching twice the normal amount  Before the close I looked back at the last five trading days and I saw this stock up  13  for the week  but that should be no surprise for a stock that has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Growth Style Score of  A   Today  RLGT is the Bull of the Day 

Low Priced Mover

	I recently published a strategy piece that talks about using a wider net to catch more winners  You can read more about that here     and I bring that up because this stock would fall in that net  It is a low priced stock that has the growth and the Zacks Rank that we are looking for 

Description

	Radiant Logistics  Inc  operates as a third party logistics company  providing multi modal transportation and logistics services 

Earnings

	The earnings history for RLGT isn t the greatest I have ever seen  but I love what the most recent report looked like  The company reported EPS of  0 10 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for only a penny  That 9 cent beat was good for a 900  positive earnings surprise 

	The topline came in ahead of expectations by  9M or about 5  ahead of expectations  The end result of such a solid beat was the stock launching higher by 19  in the session following the release 

  

The Valspar Corporation  NYSE       has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four of the last five quarters and a recent decline in earnings estimates has pushed the Zacks Rank down to the lowest rating  Today VAL is the Bear of the Day 

Description

	Valspar is a global leader in the paint and coatings industry 

Acquisition

	The company announced that it was going to be acquired bySherwin Williams         for  113 per share or about  11 3B on March 21  2016 

Earnings Misses

	The company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four of the last five quarters including two straight misses  The most recent miss came on March 8 with the company reporting earnings of  0 52 when the Zacks Consensus was calling for  0 74 

Estimates

	The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate has slide from  5 29 in November to  4 92 in February and is now at  4 49 

	There has been a similar move in 2018 projections even as the company will likely be part of SHW by then  Still  those moves lower in earnings estimates are what drive the Zacks Rank

What Does This Syrian Missile Strike Mean for Stocks  

	In the last few days  we have had a set of players make moves inside the new U S  administration  And that is playing out in the arena of foreign affairs today 

	Last week  the U S  Secretary of State  a former oil company CEO  stated that Syria s fate was going  to be decided by the Syrian people   Unfortunately  that was diplomatic language interpreted by the dictator Assad as a green light  He went ahead and issued the order for an egregious chemical weapons air strike on his own people 

	At the same time this was happening  the new head of the National Security Council  H R  McMaster  won an important battle to staff that critical function with its standard role players  This took that internal White House function up in importance    and immediately restored a more traditional tone to this nation s foreign policymaking 

	Today  we woke to the good news of a targeted strike on the Syrian air base that had sent the planes to do the chemical weapons strike 

This is a measured  immediate military response that will now undergird a fresh round of behind the scenes diplomacy  both by the U S  and its allies   

	All of this is  in fact  good news 

	Which is why the U S  and global stock markets sold off in a knee jerk reaction at first  But by early morning  had recovered to trading flat  That says traders are comfortable with the approach taken by the U S   which is clearly being directed by the newly reconstituted National Security Council  and the former Marine at the head of the Defense Department  James Mattis 

	Today  we also got a muddle through print on the U S  nonfarm jobs reports  A  98K monthly number sounds low  But it came tied to a 4 5  unemployment rate  While a lagging indicator  this was showing more underlying progress is being made by the U S  economy  All in all  a mixed bag of data is no  new  news on the macro front  Again  we see no response from the broader stock market 

	In sum  I think traders and equity investors generally    and frankly U S  citizens and citizens of the world    should breathe a big sigh of relief  The new inexperienced President has taken the right steps here  He has been guided by the experienced hands  who are now fully empowered  and being listened to 

	That is all good news  coming from this economist 

My more specific stock picks for looking into trading activity  on this moment of foreign affairs  

	Note first  In this Syrian air strike  two U S  warships located in the eastern Mediterranean launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles  So these 3 stocks are worth looking into 

 1  Raytheon   NYSE       currently makes these missiles  There will be a need for re supply of the missiles shot  The stock was up about  1  intraday 

 2   Take a look at Rolls Royce Holdings  OTCMKTS         which is a higher Zacks  2 Ranked  BUY  competitor  based in the U K  It is also a sound long term play  with a Zacks VGM score of A  The U K  typically follows the U S  in on these types of missions  The stock was up  0 8  intraday 

 3   A final stop may be Huntington Ingalls  NYSE         They are the primary building of U S  warships  like the ones that shot the Tomahawk missile  This stock was up  2 0  intraday 

	That says it all  The U S  Navy may be the biggest winner here

Navy  and fiscal 2017 weapons procurement  Navy  funds A Brief Note on Standard MissilesSM 2 is the world s leading fleet area air defense weapon  It provides protection against a wide range of advanced threats  It has been integrated with both Aegis and non Aegis combat weapon systems that provide high  and low altitude intercept capabilities and performance against advanced anti ship missile threats  The SM 2 also has a secondary anti surface ship mission  and uses tail controls and a solid fuel rocket motor for impulsion as well as  maneuverability Since long  SM 2 has been the primary surface to air fleet air defense weapon of choice for U S  Navy   In fact  it has been deployed by the U S  and eight allied navies  The U S Navy has committed to continue to consign for SM 2 over the long term  This contract proves that it still continues to keep these missiles in their stock The SM 2 family continues to grow internationally  Countries like Australia  Canada  Germany  Japan  Korea  the Netherlands  Spain and Taiwan have deployed surface combatants  Moreover  several other navies are executing ship configurations to support SM 2 applications The SM 3 is a ship based missile system used by the U S  Navy to intercept short  to intermediate range ballistic missiles as a part of Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System  SM 3 Block IA  the first variant in the SM 3 family  is used in support of the first phase of the administration s Phased Adaptive Approach   PAA   for ballistic missile defense The SM 6 is a surface to air supersonic missile capable of successfully engaging manned and unmanned aerial vehicles and fixed  and rotary wing aircraft   It provides the warfighter with the enhanced capability to detect targets beyond line of sight  In addition  the missile defends against land attack and anti ship cruise missiles in flight  Deployed in 2013  SM 6 provides additional strength to defense personnel in hostile situations Furthermore  SM 6 leverages the legacy Standard Missile airframe and propulsion elements  while incorporating the advanced signal processing and guidance control capabilities of Raytheon s Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile Raytheon has already delivered more than 160 SM 6 missiles to the U S  Navy  This missiles  unique ability to neutralize threats had made it the most desired one among the combatant commanders  who want many of these interceptors to be installed in their ships In Jan 2017  the U S  Department of Defense authorized sales of the SM 6 missile to a number of international customers  many of whom were looking for the multi mission missile to support their shipbuilding programs Why Raytheon Raytheon s advanced Missile Systems division enables it to win consistent orders from the U S  as well as international customers  Like the U S  and its allies  other nations across the globe are also utilizing advanced technology to strengthen their defense systems  Thus  foreign military contracts are a vital growth driver for the company  Evidently  Raytheon s fourth quarter international bookings comprised 38  of its total bookings  During the quarter  international sales were up 5 6   representing 31  of total sales Moreover  the company has been enjoying a steady stream of contracts from government establishments  In March  Raytheon has won a modification contract worth  199 8

139105,360620,RTN,The Week Ahead  Will Q4 Earnings Confirm Recent Economic Strength ,opinion,"We have a light calendar for economic data and a short week of trading  The biggest news will come from corporate earnings reports  Some financial stocks reported on Friday  but this is the first big week for Q416  Earnings season is always important  but sometimes it is special  This week the pundits will be asking 
Will improving corporate earnings confirm perceptions of a stronger economy 
Last Week
Last week the economic news was strong  but with little reaction from stocks 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted a punditry focused on the incoming Trump Administration  The confirmation hearings provided a lot of fresh news  and there was not much going on in daily trading  My guess that people would be  digging down  for clues about policy changes was a pretty good one 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500 from Doug Short  As you can readily see  both the range and the weekly change were very small  You can also see the 1  intra day move during the Trump press conference 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long term perspective 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
This week s news was quite good almost all positive  I make objective calls  which means not stretching to achieve a false balance  If I missed something for the  bad  list  please feel free to suggest it in the comments  This is a good week to illustrate the problem with the so called  economic surprise  indexes  So much depends on how you determine the expectations  If conditions are good  they are good  even though some expect continued improvement each week 
The Good
Mortgage applications up 5 8   despite concerns that higher rates would hurt the market  This is a very nice surprise 
Jobless claims at 247K continues at an extremely low level 
Michigan sentiment at 98 1 on the preliminary survey remains very strong  although a slight miss on expectations  
Sea container counts end the year on a strong note  Steven Hansen    does his expected deep dive into the data  providing plenty of long term analysis  Here is a key table 

NFIB small business outlook surges  Scott Grannis has the story  including references to consumer confidence as well 

The Bad
Retail sales  More spin   good or bad 

U S  retail sales disappoint at end of the year    at 9 10 ET 
Holiday retail sales rise 4  to beat NRF expectations    at 10 29 ET 

Gasoline prices are up about 20  year over year   has the story 
Business inventories  Some regard this as bad because of the m o m increase of 0 7   Last week I called this a very spinnable number  Inventories are either wanted or unwanted  Going into the number we knew that the level was depleted  This is really a neutral report 
The Ugly
Volkswagen  OTC VLKAY  Diesel Scandal  We now know that this was the    not just low level employees or a faceless corporation  Fiat Chrysler is also charged  but  
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  There is week s award goes to David Moenning  a nomination from a reader    for his He writes as follows 

The pitch is strong   Alts   as they are called  are touted as a source of diversification  a way to create non correlated portfolios  and a means toward potential risk reduction during severe market declines  I ve heard some folks even suggest that alts are a way to produce a solid  riskless  returns 

And  

 who doesn t want to own an investing strategy that is designed to produce a nice  steady 6 8  return without the vagaries associated with the traditional asset classes 

And the problem  

Investopedia goes on to note that most of these alt strategies are designed for sophisticated investors   Most alternative investment assets are held by institutional investors or accredited  high net worth individuals because of the complex natures and limited regulations of the investments   the website says 

 Jeff  The most attractive track record I ever saw was from Bernie Madoff   consistent strong returns and minimal drawdowns  It was too good to be true  David s experience is quite like mine  I get pitches for these products on a regular basis  Some of them are theoretically sound and might work  The average investor does not have the skill to evaluate them 
We also published our annual review of winners  If you take a look at the excellent work reviewed   and   you will see the advantage of following these contrarian sources  You will be surprised at how much it can help your investing 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
It is back to normal for the volume of economic data  but fewer of the most important reports 
The  A  List
Housing starts and building permits  Th   The most important leading data in a key sector 
Industrial production  W   The expected rebound would improve overall confidence in the economy 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List
Beige Book  W   The Fed s district by district look will be scoured for signs that rate hikes might come more quickly than expected 
Philly Fed  Th   Earliest read on the new month has gained more respect in the past year 
CPI  Th   Interest in the inflation reports is building  but the worrisome stages are not imminent 
Crude inventories  Th   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
Fed speakers are still on the trail  with appearances every day  Chair Yellen will make two appearances 
Earnings reports will be the most important news 
Next Week s Theme
It is a short week  with a light calendar of data  The Trump story continues as confirmation hearings shed a little more light on possible policies  There will be plenty of FedSpeak 
Despite these factors  the start of earnings season should give the punditry a break from All Trump  All The Time  Because of recent economic strength  people will be skeptically searching the earnings news for signs of weakness or a negative outlook  The key question will be 
Do Earnings Reports Confirm a Stronger Economy 
The basic positions are simple 
Reports normally beat estimates  and there is plenty of potential this season   

Some recent laggards are looking strong energy  tech  financials    
 suggests that expectations are very high  This is an interesting collection of survey data  Read the full report  but here is a nice summary 
Heading into 4Q16 earnings season  85  of surveyed investors expect results to be in line or better than consensus  an increase from 78  last quarter
Expectations for improving organic growth surpasses worsening for the first time in more than a year
Investor sentiment towards the U S  has improved dramatically  70  now forecast higher U S  GDP while recession fears have pushed out
Rate hikes drive sector views  participants most bullish on Financials while Utilities and REITs see dramatic pullback in sentiment
67  of investors report feeling better about the U S economy post election  recession fears off the table for 2017

Earnings are inflated by peak profit margins and bogus analyst forecasts   Organic  growth is low and so is revenue growth   I see these comments  but we would all appreciate some credible sources  
What does this mean for investors  As usual  I ll have a few ideas of my own in today s  Final Thoughts

Risk Analysis
Whether you are a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  Think first about your risk  Only then should you consider possible rewards  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
The Indicator Snapshot

Although dropping last week  the yield on the ten year note has increased significantly since the election  This has lowered the risk premium a bit  I suspect much more to come  By this I mean that the relative attractiveness of stocks and bonds will continue to narrow 
The C Score has also dropped  The relationship is not linear  and it remains in the  safe  zone 
The Featured Sources 
Bob Dieli  The  C Score  which is a weekly estimate of his Enhanced Aggregate Spread  the most accurate real time recession forecasting method over the last few decades   His subscribers get  including both an economic overview of the economy and employment 
Holmes  Our cautious and clever watchdog  who sniffs out opportunity like a great detective  but emphasizes guarding assets 
Brian Gilmartin  Analysis of expected earnings for the overall market as well as coverage of many individual companies 
RecessionAlert  Many  for both economic and market analysis  While we feature his recession analysis  Dwaine also has several interesting approaches to asset allocation  Try out his new public   His most recent research update suggests some    from labor markets 
Georg Vrba  The  and much more  for an array of interesting methods  Georg  Bob Dieli s enhanced aggregate spread  considering when it might first give a recession signal  Georg thinks it is still a year away  It is interesting to watch this approach along with our weekly monitoring of the C Score 
Doug Short  The World Markets Weekend Update  and much more

Best Advice for the Week Ahead
The right move often depends on your time horizon  Are you a trader or an investor 
Insight for Traders
We consider both our models and the top sources we follow 
Felix and Holmes
We continue with a strongly bullish market forecast  Felix is fully invested  Oscar is fully invested  but the sectors are less aggressive  The more cautious Holmes has taken some profits  but is still about 90  invested  The group meets weekly for a discussion they call the  Stock Exchange   In each post I include a trading theme  ideas from each of our four technical experts  and some rebuttal from a fundamental analyst  usually me   There are fresh ideas each week  You can also ask questions and have a little fun 
Top Trading Advice
 that  Trump volatility  is good for active managers  This is also true for investors and traders  Check out Eddy Elfenbein s account of the Trump press conference  

Adam H  Grimes has advice aimed at new traders  but everyone can benefit  A  for traders turning the page on the calendar  While the focus is on motivation  he has several specific suggestions  He analyzes each of the following important points 

Decide if you want to trade or gamble 


Have an open mind  but a critical mind 


Understand what  proof  looks like 


If you want to trade  bet size is really important 


Psychology matters  but these things are more important 

Dr  Brett Steenbarger illustrates   He links to the Grimes post and extends some of the arguments  An intelligent discussion of important factors is one of the most important sources for traders  and investors   He has almost daily posts  Any serious trader should read them all  Another great example from this week shows how to turn

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be  of his dinner with Daniel Kahneman  It is a nice summary of Kahneman s basic ideas   all worth reading  Morgan has a great sense for what is important and what you need to know about it  Here is my favorite quote 

On education changing thinking   There are studies showing that when you present evidence to people they get very polarized even if they are highly educated  They find ways to interpret the evidence in conflicting ways  Our mind is constructed so that in many situations where we have beliefs and we have facts  the beliefs come first  That s what makes people incapable of being convinced by evidence  So education by itself is not going to change the culture  Changing critical thinking through education is very slow and I m not very optimistic about it  

Stock Ideas
Do you believe that managers with a ten year success record might have good ideas  If so  look at    We own several of them  which encourages me to put the rest on our watch list  
Many stocks are attractive  despite the popular valuation perception   the Jefferies take  Hint  Cyclicals and value look good 
Our trading model  Holmes  has joined our other models in a weekly market discussion  Each one has a different  personality  and I get to be the human doing fundamental analysis  We have an enjoyable discussion every week  including four or five specific ideas that we are buying  This week the dip buying Holmes  who has been very hot  likes Michael Kors  NYSE KORS   Check out the post for my own reaction  link above   and more information about the trading models 
Seeking yield 
How about Raytheon  NYSE RTN    the dividend hike and the potential 
Kohl s  NYSE KSS  5  looks safe      This is one where we enhance yield by selling near term calls 
But watch out for companies where the dividend might not be safe  Can you depend on 5 7  from Blackstone  NYSE BX     
And a key question  Should dividend investors be worried about rising interest rates   provides some great links 
Personal Finance
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  If you are a serious investor managing your own account  this is a must read  Even the more casual long term investor should make time for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his  My personal favorite this week is  on the importance of saving  Investors should understand that the 401 k  is not a substitute for the old guaranteed benefits plans 
I have often commented that when Tadas has the time to write a standalone post  it is a special treat  This week he  the  evidence based  movement  the endurance of outmoded ideas  and what it all might mean for investors  A general conclusion is that many investors should minimize fees  choosing cheap robo advisors or doing some basic rebalancing on their own 
Seeking Alpha Editor Gil Weinreich s Financial Advisors  Daily Digest has quickly become a must read for financial professionals  Somewhat to my surprise  the topics also stimulate comments from active individual investors  It has added to the value of the posts for both groups  Gil engages the same topic as Tadas   the    and   
This is a topic that hits close to home  I am quite sure that an intelligent investor who never made the common mistakes could avoid the fees of a professional advisor  I even provide a way for investors to check this out  Just ask for our free report  The Top Twelve Investor Pitfalls   and How to Avoid Them  If you regularly navigate these problems  you can fly solo  If not  you might be losing 4 8  each year  Less than 1  of my regular audience consists of clients  I started writing to help average investors  and that remains my principal motivation  I am disappointed to see what seems like an increasingly commercial approach by so many of my friends  I know that they all seek to provide excellent and special service 
Final Thoughts
As the Q2 and Q3 earnings seasons began  I wrote about the possible end of the  earnings recession  and an inflection point in forward earnings  Those events have come to pass  but we now have a new concern  the outlook  Conference calls and the company s guidance is always interesting  but this quarter is special  Companies cannot know what the policy changes will be  nor can they predict the effects on their business 
In each week s  Final Thoughts  I offer opinions based upon facts  Sometimes my conclusion is a description of what I find important to watch  So it is this week  My scorecard for earnings season will look for the following company characteristics 
Confidence  I expect most to have a murky outlook  with no reason to set the future bar very high 
Important trade relationships   imports or exports  Comments on these fears may create some buying opportunities 
Concern about a stronger dollar  Everyone is teed up to watch for this  and we should as well 
Earnings reports help us interpret the strength of the economy using non government data  In this earnings season  it is especially important to know the story as well as the numbers ",2017-01-15,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-will-q4-earnings-confirm-recent-economic-streng-200172427,200172427

Majority of the work will be executed in San Diego and a very minimal percentage at other continental U S  and outside continental U S  locations   Work is expected to be over by Sep 14  2019 
 This contract was awarded by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific  San Diego  CA  and will utilize research  development test and evaluation  operations and maintenance as well as other procurement funds 
 RAYTHEON CO Price
 

    
Under the terms of this contract  services to be rendered by Raytheon include technology assessment  development and transition  requirements analysis  systems engineering  operational and technical support  experimentation support  hardware and software development and prototyping  modeling and simulation  training  and security engineering cybersecurity 
Meanwhile  this defense giant has also grabbed another contract for the manufacture and delivery of 18 AN APG 79 Active Electronically Scanned Array  AESA  radars for Navy F A 18E F and EA 18G aircraft  Valued at  63 million  this contract was awarded by Naval Air Systems Command  Patuxent River  MD 
Majority of the work will be performed in Forest  MS  Dallas  TX  while the rest in El Segundo  CA  and Andover  MA  Work is scheduled to be over in July 2018  
Under this contract  Raytheon will also offer procurement of two AN APG 79 AESA radars in support of testing associated with the AESA configuration D upgrade  and one AN APG 79 radar for the government of Australia  This particular contract will primarily utilize fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement and  to a lesser extent  foreign military sales  FMS  fund 
Notably  Raytheon s combat proven AN  APG 79 AESA radar system represents a significant advance in radar technology  which substantially increases the power of the U S  Navy s F A 18E F Super Hornet aircraft in particular  making it less vulnerable than ever before  Currently this radar system also serves the Royal Australian Air Force 
Our View
With the U S  fiscal 2016 bill emphasizing cyber programs  cyber oriented work is expected to yield solid growth in the coming years  In recent years  Raytheon has invested more than  3 5 billion to expand its cybersecurity capabilities  as cybersecurity incidents have escalated an average 66  on a yearly basis between 2009 and 2014 globally 
Being one of the best positioned large cap defense players  Raytheon s next generation radar systems also offer advance defense solutions that attract potential customers like the U S  Navy and defense administrators of foreign countries  thereby enhancing demand for Raytheon s Integrated Defense Systems  IDS  products  Accordingly  we expect the aforementioned contracts to boost up the revenues that the company earns from its IDS business segment

139324,360839,RTN,People s QE  Central Bankers  War On Savings,opinion,"It is not in the world of ideas that life is lived  Life is lived for better or worse in life  and to a man in life  his life can be no more absurd than it can be the opposite of absurd  whatever that opposite may be    Archibald Macleish
QE for the people was actually proposed by Jeremy Corbyn last year in Britain last year  and it did not sit too well with  central bankers  Mark Carney Governor of the Bank England had the audacity to state that QE for the people would remove  fiscal discipline   Central bankers have been anything but disciplined  they have systematically created every boom and bust cycle for the past 50 plus years  To create a boom cycle  they loosen the cash spigots and vice versa  We are not stating that QE for the people is a good idea  but it s as good as any idea the central bankers have floated over the past 3 5 decades 
However  what if central bankers were not planning QE for the people but QE from the people  how would they achieve this  That is where negative rates come into play  If you make it expensive to save  it could force the masses to speculate  and this is what the negative interest wars are all about  The masses will revolt at having to pay interest to the banks on their money while the banks will have the ability to lend this money out and profit from it  Now banks want to rape you twice 
Talk about getting taxed to death  First the government taxes you on your earnings and then now banks could start charging you interest for holding onto your funds  that they will lend someone else and profit of from  what a perfect scam  It could inadvertently force people to speculate as they desperately search for higher yields and could lead to the creating of the term  QE from the masses  
Negative rate wars gaining traction
Sweden has further lowered rates from  0 35 to  0 5 in their bid to hit their pie in the sky target of 2  inflation  Switzerland and Japan have also embraced the negative rates bank wagon  and a host of other nations are becoming more open to this option  It is just a matter of time before our central bankers are forced to join the pack  In the era of  devalue or die  resistance is futile  and that is why we are sure it s just a matter of time before the Fed reverses course and starts to lower rates  They will prepare the masses for this by listing a host of negative factors that has forced them to reassess the situation 
There are some reasons to expect that the masses will be forced to speculate as the Fed has already succeeded in making things so hard for the average person that out of desperation they might turn to speculation as a means of survival 
76  of families are living from pay check to pay check 
According to CBS  33  of families earning  75 000 per year  this phenomenon is not restricted to just the so called working poor 
While the official unemployment rate is currently below 5   the unofficial rate is close to 23  according to shadow stats 
We are in the midst of a full blown currency war as a nation after nation jumps on the negative interest bandwagon  Swiss national bank president Thomas Jordan seems to confirm that negative interest wars are here to stay   Our monetary policy is clear   he said   It is based on two pillars  the negative interest rates and the willingness to intervene in the currency market if necessary  

The above image shows you just how quickly a host of nations in Europe have embraced negative rates  and it is destined to spread to North America and finally Asia 
The key to the markets are the masses  and the masses believe that the Fed and the government can solve their problems  Until they think otherwise  nothing is going to change  and the outlook will continue to worsen 
Game plan
If you are going to speculate  at least  understand how the financial markets operate and what drives them  The main driving force behind the markets are emotions  otherwise known as Mass Psychology   understand this and you will have a better understanding of how the markets operate and won t have to place your faith in shills on Wall Street who openly market themselves as experts  Compile a list of blue chip stocks or stocks that are showing strong rates of growth  Two good metrics to look for would be strong quarterly earnings growth rates and or strong quarterly revenue growth rates  Some companies to consider are Hormel Foods Corporation  N HRL   Pilgrims Pride Corp  O PPC   Oclaro Inc  O OCLR   Ciena Corp  N CIEN   Amazon com Inc  O AMZN   Raytheon Company  N RTN   Orbital ATK Inc  N OA   etc  
How will Gold fare in a negative interest environment 
Conventional wisdom states that precious metals trend upward when rates are rising  We are living in strange times  and central bankers are breaking rules left  right and centre so this old paradigm might not hold true  If the masses are forced to speculate  they could decide that Gold is a better storage of wealth  However  for that to come to pass  the average Joe would have to understand the true meaning of the word inflation and that Gold is a currency and not some ancient relic that has no place in the 21st century  This is not going to be an easy feat so  while we expect Gold to trend higher in the years to come  the next bull run is not going to begin with a bang  Another possibility to consider is that if the cost of holding money in a bank becomes prohibitive  it could trigger a run on the banks  We will examine this issue in more detail in a follow up article ",2016-02-23,Sol Palha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/people’s-qe:-central-bankers-war-on-savings-200119242,200119242

139326,360841,RTN,How To Invest For The Recession That s Already Here,opinion,"In a meeting with The Washington Post s editorial board earlier this month  GOP presidential primary candidate Donald Trump said the economy was so dicey that the United States was headed for  a very massive recession  
As I noted on FOX Business   I think we re already there  even if the Fed doesn t realize it yet 
Here s the thing   the measures the Fed uses to judge economic activity are based on a manufacturing economy that we enjoyed more than 100 years ago  They simply don t reflect the services based system we live in presently 
The hard truth is millions of American families are living paycheck to paycheck  The economic  recovery  that the Fed and legions of economists are so proud of having engineered doesn t exist   and hasn t for a very long time 
Here s the real state of American prosperity   and what you can do to ensure you re not left behind 
Your Economic Future Doesn t Have to Be This Grim
Look at income  for example  Incomes have grown by less than inflation in 28 states since 2007  according to Yahoo  Finance  Manufacturing activity has fallen off a cliff  dropping in 44 states over the same time frame  Median household income is still lower than it was in 2000  according to Sentier Research and BLS data 
Long story short  Many families are earning less than they did 16 years ago 
Never mind what the  official  definition is  That s a real recession   one that s leaving millions of families in the lurch 
Obviously  I don t want you to be one of them 
In fact  I want you to have the retirement of your dreams no matter what the Fed does next  no matter what happens this election cycle  and no matter how Wall Street tries to hijack your money 
Right now  that means paying attention to the data 
History shows that individual investors don t usually do that very well  In fact  they do it very poorly on average   selling when they should be buying and buying when they should be selling 
Consider what happened from September 2008 to January 2016  Over that period  domestic equity  long term  flows experienced monthly withdrawals totaling more than  875 billion versus  129 billion of additions   and over that time  the S P 500 rose by a 51 8  
Ergo  they sold low and bought high 
How Investors Are Walking Away from Big Gains
Right now you re seeing the same thing  again 
According to the TDAmeritrade Investor Movement Index  IMX   a proprietary behavior based index tracking individual investor sentiment  the markets are drifting sideways to up  even as individual investors are backing away 

That tells me the risk of being left far behind is rising  again 
I say that because traders are warming up to the idea that central bankers may try to manipulate their way higher in response to increasingly challenging deflationary inputs around the world 
We all know that s terrible from a macroeconomic standpoint  but that doesn t change the fact that they re going to try anyway 
And that means you ve got to be on board even if you don t want to be 
Let me prove it to you 
Take the 10 years from 1994 to 2004  The markets rose and fell  but ultimately you would have earned 6 5  a year over that time frame  However  if you missed out on just the 10 best days of that tumultuous time  your annual return would have been  wait for it  a whopping 0   As in zero  zilch  nada  bupkis 
Yes  you read that correctly  You would have earned all your money in just 10 days  out of 3 827 total 
So if you re tempted to run for the hills like a lot of people at the moment  ask yourself if you can afford to throw that kind of potential away 
The vast majority of investors can t 
But obviously  investing blindly won t cut it  I believe the best returns in this market are going to come from just six  Unstoppable Trends   Demographics  Scarcity Allocation  Medicine  Energy  Technology  and War  Terrorism   Ugliness 
In fact  I m willing to bet that every dime you ll make over the next ten years will come from one or more of these trends  They ve created more billionaires than any trend not on the list above in history 
Right now  this means buying companies like Raytheon Company  NYSE RTN   American Water Works  NYSE AWK   and NextEra Energy Inc  NYSE NEE   Each of these companies has rock solid potential right now  and of course they re all  powered  by unstoppable trends like War  Terrorism   Ugliness  Scarcity Allocation  and Energy 
The gains they provide aren t about to be stopped by any recession  either  even if the Federal Reserve and the government never get around to admitting we re in one ",2016-04-20,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-invest-for-the-recession-that-39;s-already-here-200125695,200125695
139345,360860,RTN,Volkswagen  Don t Go Bottom Fishing Just Yet,opinion,"Preconditioned to  buy the dips  and capitalize on special situations  millions of investors have picked up shares in Volkswagen  XETRA VOWG  AG   OTC VLKPY  with the hope of making a killing on the rebound  I think that s a mistake 
No doubt special situations can create huge profits  but what s happening now with VW stock is very different and poses special risks other  turnarounds  don t  We re going to talk about that today and  while we re at it  take a quick look at the trade recommendation I gave you last week on how to play the situation 
It s returned 15  in just eight trading sessions and is primed for a whole lot more in the months ahead  How much more 
Nobody knows for certain  but taking our cue from other winning recommendations like Raytheon  NYSE RTN   Altria  NYSE MO   and FleetCor  NYSE FLT   which I ve recommended over the years under similar circumstances  there s clearly double or even triple digit profit potential 
Here s what you need to know 
Newly Designated VW CEO Hans Dieter Poetsch Agrees with Us
I minced no words when the VW emissions scandal broke  calling the situation  an extinction level event   Others didn t see it that way  and I got my fair share of emails from those who thought I was being too harsh 
Now  millions of investors are coming around as the plot thickens and more information comes to light about just how damaging the situation actually is  Two engineers  Ulrich Hackenberg  Audi s chief engineer  and Wolfgang Hatz  a Porsche Formula One engine whiz  are being painted as possible culprits  They were  under pressure  to come up with a viable solution for strict U S  markets  goes the story 
Call me crazy  but that sounds like lawyers in overdrive who are going to try to position the engineers as hardworking good guys who simply took a wrong turn in the pursuit of continued excellence  It s a feeble attempt   in my opinion   to deflect potential damage away from VW itself 
Ultimately  though  it won t work  and I think VW s new CEO Hans Dieter Poetsch knows it  The company took out full page advertisements in German newspapers like Welt am Sonntag last week  pleading for support and trust because the company s diesel emissions scandal is an  existence threatening  crisis for the company  Never mind the  who  here  It s the  what  that matters 
The VW scandal affects more than 11 million vehicles around the world  and there s no way to know how much money will be required to pay the resulting regulatory penalties  let alone how much money will be sucked up by lawsuits  And that s what makes the VW situation different 
Normally  special situation plays are based on a single event or premise that s both containable and assessable  So you know going in what the downside is before you worry about the upside 
The Concordia disaster in Italy is a good example  Investors knew relatively quickly what the liability would be for Carnival Cruise Lines  NYSE CCL   a subsidiary of Carnival Corp  NYSE CCL   a point noted by George Young  a partner at Villere   Co 
In this case though  you cannot calculate the downside because it s completely unknown  So any upside growth potential that would otherwise be a factor is irrelevant  For instance  81  of fleet operations in the UK use diesel engines and 62  of fleet operators there state that they are less likely to trust manufacturers  claims following the VW scandal  according to Sewells Research and Insight  Some 49  are now considering other marquees for their fleet choice lists 
At the same time  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  NYSE FCAU  has gone on the offensive in Italy  offering VW drivers an additional discount of  1 700 to ditch their German clunkers  Ford  NYSE F  has stepped up with a  750 incentive for VW owners interested in crossing brand lines there  too 
Meanwhile  VW is exploring a range of options to fix affected cars  Estimates range from  20 to more than  10 000 a car  according to Bloomberg quoting anonymous sources  That s a potential cash impact of  220 million to  110 billion  The company s entire market capitalization is only  57 billion 
The company is also cutting back on all non essential spending  That s huge considering that VW spent more on R D than Ford and General Motors Company  NYSE GM  combined  And that means the company is going to have to evoke happy thoughts  memories  and the get on the road vibe that VW enjoyed for years  In other words  VW will have to separate the scandal from the brand to survive 
And  finally  in the words of branding expert Jim Prior of Lambie Nairn in London  VW will  have to live with the legacy of being a brand that cheated   All of these things will impact earnings for years to come  assuming VW has any 
So how do you play this 
I believe that VW will be an under performer but  thanks to the fair number of folks who are  holding and hoping   not necessarily a great short all by itself  So the key is to find a trade and the tactics that go with it to play the difference 
I suggested  in late September  a  pairs trade  that was simultaneously long the S P 500 and short VW shares  If you put  10 000 in that trade as directed at the close  your positions would have been worth  11 544 48 as of yesterday s close  a mere eight trading days later 
Here s how the math breaks down 
Assuming you followed along as directed in the article above  you would have shorted  10 000 worth of VKLPY  Using closing prices for simplicity  that means you d be short 360 shares at  27 10 per  Simultaneously  you would have purchased  10 000 worth of the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   or 51 65 shares at the closing price of  193 60   Note  I ve excluded commissions and rounding here for illustrative purposes  
Eight trading days later  on October 5  VLKPY closed at  23 36  so you would have a gain of  3 74 per share  or  1 346 40  on this half of the trade  SPY closed on the same day at  198 48  so you would have a gain of  4 88 per share  or  252 05  on this half of the trade  Together  that s a total gain of  8 62 per share  or  1 544 48  for a total return of 15 44  in only eight trading days 
As long as the  spread  between the two instruments   the SPY and VLKPY   continues to widen  the trade will gain value and  chances are  you ll be grinning like a Cheshire Cat for having made your move 

Are there other ways to play this trade  I ve gotten that question a lot over the past week or so  The answer depends  as always  on your personal risk tolerance  objectives  and experience 
For example  I can see buying at the money put options on VW stock  It s a simple  limited risk trade  albeit one that s a more direct bet that VW will drop  I could also envision a bear call spread  which would profit as VW drops further 
And if you really do want to go bottom fishing  there s always a Total Wealth favorite  the   In this case  the danger is getting dragged into the trade too early before the damage is done  That means you d want to think about placing one or even a series of orders at  impossibly low prices  ranging from  15 to perhaps  20 
In closing  I think the original pairs trade I suggested still offers the most flexibility while keeping risk to razor thin levels  That s because it s a broader take on the VW situation versus the overall markets which  odds are  don t have emissions problems of their own 
It s not too late to take the trade if you still want in ",2015-10-08,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vw-stock:-don’t-go-bottom-fishing-yet-267456,267456
139358,360873,RTN,Mid Year Mark Finds Eager Bulls Seeking Renewed Traction,opinion,"Stocks continue to hold up like troopers even though bulls have lost some traction  perhaps due to a combination of the summer doldrums and overbought technical conditions that have them biding time until the next setup for a run at new highs  To be sure  bears are AWOL and missing their opportunity to create some fear and ignite a correction  So  with little in the way of a catalyst in either direction at the moment  bulls remain in the driver seat 
As we hit the mid year mark this week  a few things are particularly notable  First almost everything is up at least a little bit  on a year to date basis  Gold began the year on a comeback tear  but hit a wall around mid March and has floundered about since then  Still  after a June rally  gold is the top performing asset class year to date  up nearly  10   U S  large cap stocks  as measured by the S P 500  are up more than  7   Corporate bonds and NASDAQ stocks aren t too far behind  followed by emerging markets and international developed markets  Even small caps  Russell 2000  staged a nice rally in June to get overall performance above  2   Bringing up the rear are government bonds  But everything is positive 
The U S  10 Year Treasury bond continues to confound many economists by holding up strong  with its yield languishing around 2 53   Some experts are now predicting it to fall to as low as 2 2  in the second half of the year  which should continue to push income hungry investors into dividend paying equities 
Among the ten U S  business sectors  income oriented Utilities continues to display the best performance year to date  up about  15 5   and REITs  which are also income oriented  are right there with them  Energy has been quite strong recently  overtaking Healthcare for second place  Technology  which has consistently ranked at the top of our fundamentals based sector rankings  has been coming on strong and gradually catching up with Healthcare  while Consumer Discretionary and Telecommunications  which have consistently ranked at the bottom of our rankings  are the worst performers year to date 
Moreover  the CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  continues to languish near its lows  closing Friday at 11 26  Again  some observers are predicting single digits for the VIX  while others insist that the extreme oversold conditions are ripe for reversion to the mean sometime this summer  perhaps to test resistance at 15  But short of a major black swan event  I don t see a catalyst for such a volatility spike 
Economists are expecting strong economic growth in the second half of 2014  Many top strategists  like James Paulsen of Wells Capital  believe the greater risk lies in bonds at their current levels rather than stocks  And low interest rates coupled with zero wage inflation means that central banks  including the Federal Reserve  have no reason to scale back on market manipulation via bond buying  So  stock prices and P E multiples still have room to run 
Therefore  I continue to suggest that investors ride the trend of rotation from speculative names into quality companies with attractive valuations  solid earnings growth projections  sound earnings quality  and preferably paying a consistent dividend  That s not to say  however  that we won t get a scary pullback to test the 50 day simple moving average or the 1900 level on the S P 500  just to shake up the complacency  as Mr  Market often likes to do 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 195 82  which is virtually the same as the prior Friday  The upper line of the long standing bullish rising channel has been extremely tough resistance  but because it is up sloping  stocks can continue to rise even without breaking out of the channel  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic have been loath to cycle down fully to oversold territory  but they have given up a little ground while price consolidates in place  The 20 day simple moving average offered good support all last week  Quite simply  bulls haven t been willing to give back much while bears have been in hibernation  Nevertheless  a test of the 50 day SMA  around 192     and preferably prior resistance at 190    would be a healthy development and a good setup for a strong second half run  But even if bears can t pull it back that far  there is still good potential in equities 

As I said last week  the 200 level is serving as both an enticing bullish target and a potential ambush location by hungry bears 
Latest sector rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each  
Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology remains in first place with a strong Outlook score of 94  Anything above 90 is quite impressive and dominant  Technology continues to display generally solid factor scores across the board  with a strong forward long term growth rate  a reasonable forward P E  the highest return ratios  and the strongest sentiment among both Wall Street analysts  upward revisions to earnings estimates   as well as good sentiment among insiders  open market buying   Energy has moved into second place on the strength of renewed optimism among sell side analysts and the second lowest forward P E  after Financial  which now holds third place  Healthcare and Industrial round out the top five  while Utilities has dropped from second to sixth place  which is good news for bulls  
2   Telecommunications stays in the cellar yet again with an Outlook score of 2  as it scores among the lowest in every factor in the model  It is joined in the bottom two again this week by Consumer Services Discretionary with a score of 19  despite its strong forward long term growth rate  Stocks within Consumer Discretionary continue to absorb earnings downgrades and a high forward P E  even after its lagging performance this year  
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Industrial and Basic Materials share the lead with a 53  while Telecom is the laggard with a 42  The top bottom spread has fallen to only 11 points  reflecting higher sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide mentality that dominated 2013  However  the recent lack of many particularly strong days is the likely cause of the tight range in Bull scores 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities is the leader with a 62  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  but again  there haven t been many lately   Industrial displays the lowest score of 48  The top bottom spread is only 14 points  reflecting higher sector correlations on particularly weak market days  of which there have not been many   Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5   Technology displays by far the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Telecom is by far the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Energy and Utilities are the leaders  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Telecom scores the lowest  indicating general investor avoidance of these sectors during extreme conditions  But again  there haven t been many extreme days from which to measure in quite some time 
6   Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings still look neutral  even after the fall in Utilities  Only four hold an Outlook score above 50  and three of the top six have high Bear scores and low Bull scores  Energy  Healthcare  Utilities   On the other hand  Technology  Financial  and Industrial are economically sensitive sectors that are all in the top five 
These Outlook scores represent the view that the Technology and Energy sectors are relatively undervalued  while Consumer Services and Telecom may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests continuing to hold Technology  Industrial  and Financial  in that order  in the prevailing bullish climate   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based standpoint because SPY is still above its 50 day simple moving average while also remaining above its 200 day SMA  
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Technology  Industrial  and Financial sectors include SPDR S P Semiconductor ETF  NYSE XSD   First Trust Industrials Producer Durables AlphaDEX Fund  NYSE FXR   and SPDR S P Insurance ETF  NYSE KIE  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within Technology  Industrial  and Financial  some long ideas include Skyworks Solutions  NASDAQ SWKS   NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI   Raytheon  NYSE RTN   Alaska Air Group  NYSE ALK   Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB   and SunTrust Banks  NYSE STI   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score in the top quintile  lowest accounting related risk  of our Earnings Quality Rank  EQR   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found it quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you are more comfortable with a neutral bias  the model suggests holding Technology  Energy  and Financial  in that order   And if you have a bearish outlook on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Energy  and Healthcare  in that order
