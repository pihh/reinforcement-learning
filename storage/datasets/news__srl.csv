5874,227389,SRL,Undervalued Energy Stocks  A Q A With Ray Saleeby ,opinion,To find undervalued energy stocks that offer upside and stability  look for utilities with undervalued energy assets  That s Ray Saleeby s preferred method  and the experienced value investor has shared his top picks in this Energy Report interview  along with some research pointers  Read on to find spin off pearls missed by overspecialized market analysts  The Energy Report  Ray  your firm  Saleeby   Associates Inc   focuses on identifying companies with turnaround potential    good firms that trade at a discount  but enjoy a solid customer base in hard to enter industries  Why  Ray Saleeby  I buy stock in companies that are discounted to the intrinsic value of their operations  This differs from growth investing  which focuses on companies that outpace their peers for earnings  It differs from momentum investing  which attempts to time stocks on a short term basis  My philosophy of value is more long term and contrarian  I buy companies when they are out of favor  I handle  220 million   220M  plus  of which about  100M is in the utility and energy industry  I buy a lot of utilities because there are tremendous barriers to entry to that sector  One does not find a gas utility popping up every other week  For the same reason  I like the construction aggregate business  And I absolutely love the water business  It s a resource that we re going to need forever  I also invest in defense electronics and oil and gas  There are also barriers to entry in the drugs and medical device space  TER  Tell us about your research process  RS  I have a library of 60 000 different research articles going back 20 years  I subscribe to about 60 different periodicals that provide financial reports and different types of information about various companies  I look at annual reports and presentations by companies  But before I buy a stock  I call up the management and ask detailed questions  TER  How do junior gas and oil companies fit into this model  RS  With the juniors  I take a very hard look at management  Does it have a track record of success  Are the managers personally invested in the firm  Second  I like companies that have a first mover advantage in acquiring developable property  Clusters of wells provide economies of scale where drilling rigs can easily be moved around  Energy is a commodity business and access to capital is very important  And being a low cost provider is crucial when dealing with commodities  as we never know when the market will fall  And  last but not least  I want companies that have a good hedging strategy  And for tax reasons  I look toward MLPs  master limited partnerships   TER  Let s talk about discounted utilities with exploration and development arms  Where are the undervalued opportunities in that space  RS  One of the positives about operationally diversified utilities is that they can spin off resource development divisions  Now  a utility analyst is completely different than an oil and gas exploration analyst  With a spin off  suddenly there are two different types of analysts following two related companies  and the new firm can get double coverage  Secondly  the new managers may have more incentive to produce than they did when they were operating under the parent company s top management  Also  utilities are heavily regulated  spin offs are usually nonregulated  The negative aspect of a divestment is that utilities are generally financially stable and can provide a cushion for commodity capital into its development divisions through boom and bust times  And the flip side of a spin off in the analytical marketplace is that the typical oil and gas analyst does not generally understand how to analyze utility operations  whereas the typical utility analyst does not understand how to value oil and gas assets  So the double coverage can turn into a negative  a discount of real existing value  TER  What are some promising names in this space  RS  Questar Corp   STR  is a perfect example  Originally  Questar was a utility that also had a gas exploration business  About two years ago  it spun it off as QEP Resources Inc   and it s been very successful and is leveraging the resource needs of its parent  Questar supplies natural gas to a lot of customers  It is very competitive with electric and it steals customers that have a choice between electric or gas meters  It is well diversified  its Wexpro division also develops and produces gas for the utility and it is very attractive on its own merits  Another factor to consider is that a lot of natural gas companies are not able to make a profit in the current price environment  unless they are hedged  Some are starting to shift their exploration dollars toward oil  rather than gas  because oil is holding up relatively well relative to gas prices  QEP Resources is well positioned in gas but has recently made a couple of acquisitions in the oil business to help balance things out  It s even buying back its own stock  An example of a well diversified company that has not split is National Fuel Gas Co   NFG   It is a combination of utility  pipeline  storage and explorer and producer  E P  company with  I believe  some of the best assets in the U S  It has 800 000  acres in the Marcellus fields close to the New York consumer markets  It s been around for 100 years  it has a good balance sheet  and it has a history of paying increasing dividends  Looking deeper  it had some problems with executing on oil producing land it owns in California  And it was not able to get a joint partner for its Marcellus field after natural gas prices went down  If gas prices start popping up again  National Fuel could be a takeover target  The Marcellus acreage is extremely valuable and it can be better exploited if natural gas goes higher  Mario Gabelli has a position in the company  as do I  TER  How hard is it for an exploration company to switch over from natural gas to oil  RS  Some fields are more attuned to gas  some to oil  It is hard to get out of leases to switch over from one to the other resource  And drilling crews have to be shifted around  which is expensive  But there s a glut of gas right now in a lot of different markets  And that s one of the reasons why the MLP sector is a very attractive sector going forward  TER  How do MLPs work  RS  Master limited partnerships are structured so that income flows directly to the investors  It is not double taxed at the corporate level  Investors receive K 1 forms versus 1099 forms for their IRS tax returns  However  it is advisable that you really know what you re doing before diving into a complicated MLP arrangement  MLPs may not be suitable for all investors  TER  What other utility centric natural gas companies provide good value for investors  RS  Enbridge Energy Partners L P     is an MLP  It operates one of the largest pipelines and brings Canadian tar sands oil into the United States  It enjoys great access to capital  It is a very well managed company  It has I units  which allow investors to reinvest dividends and receive a 1099  It s a unique investment for the long term  Energen Corp   EGN  is a small utility in Alabama that runs a large exploration company in the Permian Basin  It is currently out of favor in the market    discounted to its asset value  It is very conservative  It hedges a lot  and has 30 years of dividend growth  It uses the dividend income from the utility to grow the oil and gas exploration and development business  It s a good value find  TER  Why is Energen discounted  RS  As a combined utility and oil and gas exploration company  it is subject to the kind of analyst misdiagnosis I explained earlier  But Energen s cash flow and its EBITDA are cheap comparable to its peers  It has proven reserves  Management is competent  even though it just reported a disappointing quarter  gas prices plummeted and the firm was not as well hedged as it had been previously due to expirations  TER  Is there a limit on the supply of natural gas  RS  Some say that the U S  is the Saudi Arabia of natural gas  But the real question is  Is the existing supply an economic supply  Companies simply cannot make money exploring for gas at the current price  Capital is moving into oil  Sufficient cash is not spent on the necessary infrastructure  such as storage and transportation  to take the gas to the domestic consumer and to international ports for export  The other problem is that it takes a while for utilities to shift over from coal to natural gas  Facilities are being built  but it takes time  On the upside  there are transportation uses for gas  especially for heavy trucks and commercial vehicles and government vehicles  Incentives are needed to support that transformation  The more these gas dependent industries develop  the higher the price of gas will rise  providing more capital for more infrastructure and development  But a lot of E P firms are keeping the gas in the ground for now  TER  Are there any energy holding companies that reflect your investment model  RS  MFC Industrial Ltd   MIL  is a company that has done phenomenally well  A  1 investment in MFC a little over 10 years ago is worth  6 50 today  It s averaging a 20  compounded return  MFC is a true value investor  It turns energy and resource companies around and monetizes them  It recently bought Compton Petroleum  The management is very shareholder oriented  executives own a large stake in the company  It is a small firm  but it sources and delivers commodities and resources throughout the world  South Jersey Industries Inc   SJI  is a utility in New Jersey  But probably 30  of their business is nonregulated  An investment of  6 000 in 1985 with reinvesting the dividends    would now be worth  720 000  Management has just been top notch in creating shareholder value  TER  To conclude  are any of these firms looking at renewable energy development  RS  South Jersey is involved in solar  But with the revolution in cheap natural gas  a lot of the solar and wind ventures have been put aside  A few decades down the line  solar is going to be the solution  The world has an abundance of sun  There are  however  cost and efficiency problems with solar and wind due to storage and transmission of power  Alternatives have a role in the future  but we have an abundance of natural gas at this time  TER  Thanks for speaking with us  Ray  RS
