180472,401988,WU,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  August 1 
1  U S  dollar hits 2 year high in Powell aftermath
The U S  dollar climbed to levels not seen since May 2017 against developed market peers on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ruled out an extended policy easing cycle 
Although the Fed met expectations for a 25 basis point cut  Powell called the move a  mid cycle adjustment  and said  it s not the beginning of a long series of cuts  
Although markets still bank on an additional cut as early as September  fed funds futures are no longer assuming there will be a third cut this year  That has sent the greenback higher against other currencies 
2  Global stocks mixed in Fed hangover
After the Dow fell by more than 300 points on Wednesday  its largest decline since May  risk off sentiment spread to global equities  sending Asian shares to six week lows  although Japan s Nikkei 225 found support as the yen fell to a two year low against the dollar 
European shares however seemed to shake off the disappointment nearing mid day trading thanks in part to positive earnings from the financial sector    Barclays    LON BARC     Standard Chartered    LON STAN  or   Societe Generale    PA SOGN  all registered solid gains after results 
U S  futures struggled to recover  registering a slight bounce as earnings season continued to influence trade  Shares of Fitbit  NYSE FIT  and Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  sank in premarket trade after the companies issued disappointing guidance 
Verizon  NYSE VZ   General Motors  NYSE GM  and DuPont  NYSE DD  will release earnings ahead of open  while Pinterest  NYSE PINS  and Western Union  NYSE WU  are among companies reporting after the market close 
3  Global manufacturing on watch ahead of U S  ISM
With little progress made this week in high level trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing  traders will receive the latest data on U S  manufacturing activity in July from the Institute of Supply Management at 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT  
Despite trade conflicts damaging business confidence  U S  manufacturing has continued to expand and a slight improvement is projected for Thursday s reading 
Manufacturing activity in the euro zone contracted for a sixth straight month  with confidence at its lowest level since Dec  2012  while the U K  contracted for a third straight month as output declined at the fastest rate in seven years  Both readings were above  even more pessimistic  expectations  however 
4  Oil breaks rally as Fed disappoints
U S  crude broke a five day rally as the Fed disappointed by not guiding for a more aggressive series of interest rate cuts 
The Fed lack s of urgency boosted the U S  currency to the detriment of dollar denominated crude and other commodities 
Black gold s recent rally had been strongly supported by expectations that a more dovish Fed would do more to underpin global energy demand 
5  BoE expected to hold amid Brexit uncertainty
The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold in a unanimous decision at its meeting at 7 00 AM ET  11 00 GMT   as policymakers wait for the fog of the U K  s departure from the European Union to clear 
Markets await the BoE s assessment of the British economy s current downturn  and how it might respond in the event of a hard Brexit under new Prime Minister Boris Johnson 
Sterling hit its lowest level against the dollar since Jan  2017 overnight  largely on fears of a no deal Brexit  Johnson has maintained his hardline stance with Brussels  calling for the withdrawal deal to be rewritten and vowing to take the U K  out of the EU on Oct  31 regardless

180507,402023,WU,Euronet Worldwide trumps Ant Financial s offer to buy MoneyGram,news,"By Sruthi Shankar and Anna Irrera  Reuters    U S  electronic payments company  Euronet Worldwide  Inc  O EEFT  launched a  1 billion bid for rival MoneyGram International Inc  O MGI  on Tuesday  arguing that its all American deal would face less regulatory scrutiny than a lower bid by China s Ant Financial Services Group  Ant Financial  the financial services affiliate of  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd  N BABA   said it remained committed to its deal   MoneyGram and Ant Financial continue to work cooperatively under the terms of our merger agreement  and together  we are making progress on schedule towards obtaining all required regulatory and shareholder approvals   it said in a statement  MoneyGram said it would  carefully review and consider  the proposal from Euronet   MoneyGram remains subject to the terms of the definitive merger agreement with Ant Financial and MoneyGram s board has not changed its recommendation in support of the merger agreement with Ant Financial   it said  MoneyGram shares surged nearly 25 percent to close at  15 77 on Tuesday  above Euronet s cash offer of  15 20 per share  indicating investors expect a higher bid to materialize  Ant Financial said in January it would acquire Dallas based MoneyGram for  13 25 per share  or about  880 million  in its first major move to expand its presence overseas  MoneyGram is one of the biggest players in the global remittance market and a takeover would enable Kansas based Euronet to better compete against digital startups which are transforming the money transfer business    Euronet is the No 4 traditional offline global player via its Ria brand so it s not a surprise they have tried to crash the party   said Michael Kent  the CEO of money transfer business Azimo   Should be a major synergy play there   Euronet has four money transfer businesses  including Ria  IME  HiFX and XE  Euronet focuses more on independent agents  while MoneyGram targets large retailers and national post offices  MoneyGram  alongside  Western Union  Co  N WU   has long dominated the global money transfer industry with its large network of retail locations  It has about 350 000 outlets in retail shops  post offices and banks in nearly 200 countries and territories  A Euronet deal would not require clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   a U S  inter agency panel that reviews foreign acquisitions of domestic assets for national security concerns  The CFIUS has been a stumbling block for several Chinese deals in the United States and was considered a big hurdle for Ant Financial  A Euronet deal is likely to be more agreeable to U S  policymakers against a backdrop of rising tensions between China and the United States over trade and foreign policy  On March 10  some 20 organizations sent a letter to U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  who chairs CFIUS  and other officials that warned against allowing Ant Financial to buy MoneyGram    There can be little doubt that if China is allowed to dominate the global payments market  it will use the information  technology  intelligence and economic power it obtains to the detriment of America s economic and national security   they wrote in the letter which was seen by Reuters  ATTRACTIVE MARKET Ant dominates China s online payment market but has been ramping up investment overseas amid fierce rivalry at home with peers such as Tencent Holdings Ltd s  HK 0700  popular WeChat Pay  A MoneyGram acquisition would have boosted Ant s international presence ahead of a future initial public offering  allowing it to deploy its technology in the large U S  payments market with a well known brand  The takeover interest in MoneyGram spilled over into its biggest competitor  Western Union  whose shares rose 3 5 percent to close at  20 27  Mark Palmer  an analyst at BTIG  wrote in a research note on Tuesday that Euronet s bid for MoneyGram underlines  the attractiveness and potential of the global remittance space  and that it may  have given rise to the notion that WU could be an acquisition candidate for another deep pocketed firm   Western Union declined to comment on Tuesday  While a deal with Euronet would bring cost synergies  a combination of Ant s technological expertise and MoneyGram s brand had been seen as a game changer for the international payments industry with scope for more consumers to use online transfer services rather than taking cash to storefronts  In addition to offering  15 20 for each MoneyGram common and preferred stock share on an as converted basis  Euronet also offered to assume about  940 million of MoneyGram s outstanding debt   The combination of Euronet and MoneyGram offered stockholders a clear path to closing   Euronet Chief Executive Michael Brown said in a letter to MoneyGram s board  adding the current agreement with Ant carried conditions that made closing  highly uncertain   Euronet has offered MoneyGram a breakup fee of  69 million if the deal is scuppered for antitrust reasons   approximately four times higher than the CFIUS termination fee that Ant Financial offered  Euronet had first attempted to acquire MoneyGram in 2007  but the bid was ultimately unsuccessful

180540,402056,WU,Somali expats fear bank curbs on sending money home,news,"By Mirjam Donath  NEW YORK  Reuters     This story  first published on 27 June 2014  is corrected in paragraphs 23 25 to delete statement that Dahabshiil has no arrangements with banks in Britain  also to change date of Barclays announcement to May 2013 from April and to add that Dahabshiil and Barclays reached settlement   Each month  42 year old Abdirizak Alibos shows up at a money transfer business in the heart of Minneapolis to send  500 to his three children in war torn Somalia    I send them money that they can pay for     groceries  school fees  that they can buy health insurance  medication   said Alibos  who escaped to the United States seven years ago and now has a business driving people to medical appointments    I can say that 50 or 60 percent of my children s lifeline is remittance   he said   But he and other Somali expatriates fear that they soon might not be able to give their families any more financial help  It is not money that they are about to run out of but the legal options for sending it home     About 40 percent of all Somali families rely on remittances from another country  and the estimated annual total of  1 3 billion is more than all foreign aid and investment in Somalia combined  according to a study published last year by human aid organizations Adeso  Oxfam and the Inter American Dialogue     For more than two decades  the African nation of 10 million people has been a land of chaos because of divisive clan fights during its civil war and more recent Islamist militant insurgents with links to al Qaeda   Commercial banking disappeared in the early 1990s  and Western money transfer companies such as Western Union Co  N WU  and MoneyGram International Inc  O MGI  do not serve most parts of Somalia   This leaves the significantly cheaper and more informal money service businesses  or MSBs  to serve as intermediaries between the foreign banks that make the wire transfers and the intended recipients of the money   As these transmitters attracted attention from U S  regulatory agencies that fear money launderers or militant groups would exploit them  banks around the world have been rapidly closing their accounts   These  de risking  moves affect all transmitters  including the most numerous ones for Latin American countries  but are most devastating for Somalia  where people have no alternative  affordable channel to get remittances   A decade ago  money transfer business owners could choose from several large banks to do international wire transfers  Today most no longer do so  even in the largest Somali expatriate hubs of Britain  the United States and Canada   The fewer the banks  the fewer locations get served in Somalia and in the cities of the expatriates  money transfer companies said   Less competition could also mean higher charges to send money to Africa  which are already twice as much as to South Asia and well above the 7 8 percent global average   Merchants Bank of California  the last large U S  bank specializing in check cashing and money transmission  has alerted a dozen of its money transmitter clients that it will close their accounts by July 31  due to the ever changing regulatory requirements and expenses    The news prompted Alibos and a few dozen Somali immigrants to protest at the U S  Treasury building of St  Paul  Minnesota  on Friday  This is the eve of the monthlong Ramadan holiday  when Muslims traditionally give extra money to the needy   Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison  a Democrat and long time supporter of money transfer companies  joined the rally  Ellison s Money Remittance Act  aimed at limiting regulatory barriers for MSBs  was approved by the U S  House of Representatives and is now with the Senate   Ellison said at the protest that the U S  war on terrorism is hindering people from sending money home    Treasury has been so aggressive at that they ve stopped good people from sending money to good people   he said    COMPLIANCE QUESTIONS  While U S  regulators do not prohibit banks from doing business with money transfer companies  they require them to have an adequate compliance program  said a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  which supervises banks   The challenge  bankers say  is that no one knows what an adequate compliance program is    From a business standpoint  it was cost prohibitive to continue to monitor these types of high risk accounts   said Matt Stenehjem  fraud and security officer of North Dakota s Bell State Bank  which recently closed all of its MSB accounts   The largest money transfer business in Somalia  Dahabshiil will continue banking with Merchants  It was less fortunate in Britain  one of its most important jurisdictions   The UK is the second biggest remittance source for Somalia at about  163 million a year  according to data cited in the human aid groups  study  Barclays Plc  L BARC   one of the last large banks handling MSB accounts there  announced in May 2013 that it would no longer do so   Dahabshiil was able to block the move temporarily on competition grounds and settled with the bank this past April  agreeing to shift the accounts to another institution by a certain date   Dahabshiil is in talks with other major banks in Britain and expects to complete that process later this year  said interim manager Mike Aynsley  a former chief executive officer of Anglo Irish Bank   In Canada  the number of MSBs serving Somalia fell to three from 11 during the last decade  said Abdirizak Omar Godane  an anti money laundering specialist based in Toronto   One bank that still offers wire transfer for them is the Royal Bank of Canada  TO RY    The bank does not disclose specific information about its approach to MSBs  a spokesman said  adding that it complies with the laws and regulations in the markets where it operates   The situation is about as serious as it can get  said Jorge Guerrero  co founder of the Great Neck  New York based National Money Transmitters Association and CEO of the Compass anti money laundering compliance consultancy   Closing MSB accounts actually exacerbates the risk of money laundering  Guerrero said  because expatriates may then try to send money to relatives through illegal channels  which are

 NEW YORK  June 27  Reuters    The euro rose on Monday as
investors bet Greece s parliament would approve a fiscal
austerity package needed for the country to receive emergency
aid and avoid defaulting on its debt 
 A French plan aimed at sorting out how banks will roll over
Greek loans to help the troubled euro zone country stay solvent
also boosted the currency  which climbed as high as  1 4293
after hitting an overnight low around  1 41   ID nLDE75P0BM 
  The euro is still seems to be topping out around  1 43 and
we re still negative on it in the longer run  but market
expectations are the austerity plan will be voted in   said
Mogens Hauschildt  senior dealer at Western Union Business

 An initial vote on Greece s 28 billion euro package of
unpopular spending cuts and tax increases is due on Wednesday 
Lawmakers then vote on Thursday on a separate bill containing
specific steps to implement it   ID nLDE75P0BM  
 Greece must agree to the plan to obtain its next slice of
international aid needed to make debt payments 
 Hauschildt said the euro could spike to  1 45 if the
package wins approval but would likely retreat from there  as
it remains vulnerable to fiscal woes in Spain and Portugal 
 Paresh Upadhyaya  senior currency strategist at
BofA Merrill Lynch  added   It could be a

will pass the measures but a weaker euro after that would not
surprise me

Greek ballot s outcome 
  Clearly  the volatility out there suggests people are very
nervous   said Steven Butler  head of trading at Scotia Capital
in Toronto   I think trade will continue to be very choppy  and
if the euro gets into the low  1 43s  that would be an area to
sell  
 The possibility of a Greek default has raised concerns
about the health of the European financial system and whether
it can withstand such a credit event  Such worries triggered a

 NEW YORK  July 11  Reuters    The euro plummeted against
the dollar and hit a record low against the Swiss franc on
Monday as worries the debt crisis in the euro zone could
infiltrate Italy prompted sweeping risk aversion 
 European Union finance officials discussed options for

 The euro hit a four month low against the yen and a
six week trough against the dollar  A Financial Times report
that some European leaders would consider letting Athens
default on some of its bonds added to market anxiety 
  A default by Greece would be enough to set off a
widespread sell off in the financial market but a default by
Italy would be worse than Lehman   said Kathy Lien  director of
currency research at GFT Forex in New York 
 European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini
Smaghi  speaking at a conference  said Italy is clearly able to
pay back its debt and will never default   ID nWEA7444 
 It is estimated that the top 91 banks have more than 100
billion euros worth of exposure to Italy  far more than
Greece s debt  while banks hold more Italian debt than Spanish
debt  Lien said 
  With that in mind  Italy has a more realistic financial
plan than Greece and is much better equipped to meet their debt
obligations   she said   However that may not be enough to stop
contagion fears which can be irrational at times

 At last year s meeting Bernanke hinted at what eventually

program  known as QE2

180570,402086,WU,RPT FEATURE Russia s neighbours feel pain of slowdown,news,"By Christian Lowe
 MOSCOW  Jan 14  Reuters    Until the financial crisis hit 
Shahin Kerimov sent money home from his job in Russia to his
family in Azerbaijan  Now his wages have stopped  they have to
wire him cash to buy food 
 Kerimov worked a tough  dirty job building apartment blocks
in Moscow so he could make a better life for his wife and
children  His employer promises to pay him what he is owed soon 
  I have two small children  They are waiting so I can earn
some kind of money and bring it home   he said in the
bare walled apartment where he and his workmates are squatting 
 The last time we were paid any money was two months ago  
 His experience illustrates how the pain of the global
slowdown has spread beyond the world s economic powerhouses into
developing countries that are far removed from the financial
markets and hedge funds where the crisis first emerged 
 Kerimov is one of an estimated 10 million migrants from
ex Soviet republics working in Russia 
 The cash they send to their families is a lifeline for the
economies of their home countries  in some cases accounting for
nearly half of gross domestic product  GDP  
 So when workers are laid off from construction sites or
factories in Moscow  the economic effects are felt thousands of
kilometres away in households in Armenia  Azerbaijan 
Uzbekistan  Tajikistan and elsewhere 
 
 MAKESHIFT BEDS
 Russia hosts the world s second largest number of migrants
after the United States  according to the United Nations 
International Organisation for Migration 
 It is a hard life  Many do not have proper work permits and
are regularly rounded up by police  The majority are
dark skinned Muslims  sometimes making them targets for attacks
by gangs of racist skinheads 
 Until now  the money made it worthwhile  Many of the
migrants went into construction  buildings were going up
everywhere and labour was in short supply 
 Since the financial crisis froze credit lines  that work has
almost ground to a standstill 
 In the wider economy  the global crisis has hit demand for
Russia s commodity exports  lopped over 70 percent off Moscow s
bourses and left companies strapped for cash and cutting jobs 
Rouble depreciations have pushed up the costs of refinancing
foreign currency debt 
 The man who employed Kerimov said he would pay him and his
colleagues the wages they are owed  but is struggling because
the whole sector has ground to a halt 
  Everyone is holding money up     everyone is on the alert  
said Valery Tishchenko   You don t know which way to turn  
 Tischenko s mobile phone numbers have since been out of
service 
 While they wait for the cash they are owed  Kerimov and
about five workmates from all corners of the old Soviet Union
live in a second floor apartment of the complex they had been
building  in the Moscow suburb of Lyubertsy 
 They sleep on beds nailed together out of spare pieces of
wood with polystyrene insulating slabs as mattresses  Heat comes
from a scavenged electric stove they hooked up to a wire poking
out of the wall 
 There is no plumbing so they fill buckets with cold water
from a tap outside and wash themselves in an alcove 
  We live by taking out loans  or sometimes a friend will
help   said Kerimov  as he watched a meal of onions and tomatoes
cook on the makeshift stove   Sometimes I even have to ring home
and ask my parents to help  
 He said returning home was not an option  In Azerbaijan
unemployment is high and the average monthly wage is about  300
   less than half the figure in Russia    according to
Moscow based investment bank Renaissance Capital 
  We will wait until the end  Until they pay the money 
Something has to be done   Kerimov said 
 
 REMITTANCE LIFELINE
 A November World Bank report ranking all the world s states
according to the share of their economies made up by remittances
puts two ex Soviet states at the top of the table 
 Tajikistan  a desperately poor country on Afghanistan s
northern border  received 45 5 percent of its GDP from this
source last year  Remittances accounted for 38 3 percent of the
economy of Moldova  on the eastern edge of the European Union 
 The global economic slowdown is curbing the flows of this
cash  which is usually sent via money transfer firms such as
Wells Fargo and Western Union  or through informal networks 
 The World Bank report forecast remittances to developing
countries in Europe and Central Asia will shrink slightly this
year after growing by 5 4 percent growth in 2008 
 Armenia  another big exporter of labour to Russia  says it
has agreed financing with the World Bank to help the economy
handle the drop off in remittances 
  If economic growth slows in Russia  then naturally the
incomes of our compatriots will also fall and the volume of
private transfers will fall as well   said Prime Minister Tigran
Sarskyan 
 Pulat Pulatov  a sociologist in a government linked
institute in Tajikistan  said employers in Russia would be
laying off Tajik migrant workers in large numbers 
  There then follows a reduction in financial transfers and 
as a result  the social condition of the population will
worsen   he said 
 The problems he described can already be witnessed at the
airport in Tajikistan s capital  Dushanbe 
 Nargis Abdurakhimova  a 25 year old nurse  was meeting her
husband Firuz off a flight from Moscow 
 He said he had been working on Russian construction sites
earning up to 40 000 roubles   1 310  a month  much better than
the  30 he said he could earn at home 
 His employer laid him off  citing financial problems  but he
planned to go back in a few months to find work 
  For now I do not want to think about not being able to find
work in Moscow in the spring   he said   For me and my family 
that would just be the end of the world

 NEW YORK  May 24  Reuters    The euro pulled away from a
two month low against the dollar on Tuesday after
better than expected German data  but traders said fears about
Greece s finances and Europe s spreading debt crisis continue
to cast a long shadow of doubt 
 One day after hitting a two month low of  1 3968  the euro

 The euro  however  is down 5 percent against the dollar
since early May  and traders said the chance that Greece may
restructure its debt would keep it under pressure  Markets were
also fretting about the finances of Spain and Italy 
  Concern about Spain and Italy might be overblown  but the
Greece issue is not going away  and if Greece restructures 
that may open the door for Ireland and Portugal   said Brian
Dolan  chief strategist at Forex com   So I look at this as a

 CONTAGION RISK
 Fears of euro zone debt contagion mounted after ratings
agencies downwardly revised outlooks for Italy and Belgium 
while Spain s Socialist Party lost in regional elections 
raising doubts about Madrid s commitment to fiscal austerity 
 Spain s  proposed budget cuts had kept the region s
fourth largest economy off the debt crisis radar until now  
said James Percival  market strategist at Western Union
Business Solutions in Victoria  British Columbia 
  Traders now fear this is a sign of things to come  as a
national level electoral turnaround that undoes the austerity
measures in Spain  or an outright rating cut in Italy 
threatens to bring about a crisis in a country too big to be
rescued  
 Spain has come under intense market scrutiny in recent
days  though it sold 2 3 billion euros of short term debt
easily on Tuesday with borrowing costs largely unmoved from the
last auction

 NEW YORK  June 13  Reuters    Worries over a Greek default
pressured the euro against the Swiss franc on Monday  while a
rating agency s downgrade of Greece compounded fears of more
economic turmoil and reduced energy demand  pushing U S  oil
prices lower 
 The single currency fell to a record low against the
safe haven Swiss franc as the cost of insuring Greek sovereign
debt against default soared to an all time high 
 Despite jitters over Greece  U S  stocks finished flat

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK  June 16  Reuters    The euro fell to a record low
against the Swiss franc and a three week trough against the
dollar on Thursday as political turmoil in Greece and
uncertainty over new aid for the heavily indebted country
intensified 
 More losses could be in store  and the euro looked set to
slide bellow  1 40  analysts said  as long as confusion
persists over how and when policymakers will seal a deal to
meet Greece s immediate funding needs and put the country s
finances on a sustainable path 
 Greek bond prices sank to record lows  while the cost of
insuring Greek sovereign debt for five years jumped to 1 900
basis points  the highest in the world 
 Pressure also grew in the interbank markets as the cost of
raising funds in dollars soared for euro zone banks on fears of
a Lehman llike lending freeze in the event of a  disorderly 
Greek default  See  ID nLDE75F1NR 
  The situation in Greece is starting to run away a little
bit and sort of feels like the Bear Stearns Lehman run up that
we saw in 2007   said Brad Bechtel  managing director at Faros
Trading in Stamford  Connecticut   The euro zone is setting up
for a similar situation where the coordinated answer they need
is not coming quick enough 
  We still feel that they can come to the rescue in time 
and it is not out of control completely just yet  but it is
getting dangerously close  All the risk indicators are starting
to show stress   he added 
 The euro fell as low as 1 1946 Swiss francs  on
electronic trading platform EBS before climbing back to 1 2026 
down 0 5 percent on the day 
 Seen as a safe haven currency  the franc brushed off
statements by the Swiss National Bank expressing concern about
its gains  as the bank gave no sign of action that would stem
the currency s upside   ID nZCHFHE79L 
 Against the dollar  the euro fell 0 2 percent to  1 4136
  after hitting as low as  1 4071 on Reuters data 
 The euro has lost 3 percent since its June 7 peak near
 1 47  though it remains up nearly 6 percent so far this year 
 Investors are increasingly unsure whether an agreement on a
Greek bailout plan will be reached in the near term  EU and
banking sources told Reuters that Germany wants the deadline
for a second rescue deal to be pushed back to September 
 ID nLDE75F0WQ 
 BEARISH ACTIVITY
 The euro broke below its 100 day moving average around
 1 4151  A close below that would send a bearish signal 
opening the door for a drop towards May s trough around
 1 3970 
 Analysts also noted bearish options activity on
CurrencyShares Euro Trust   the exchange traded fund
that tracks the euro dollar rate  The price of the ETF falls
when the euro weakens against the dollar 
 Traders exchanged about 44 000 options on the ETF  more
than double its average daily volume  according to options
analytics firm Trade Alert  The activity was led by heavy
action in puts  with the September  128 and  123 puts the
busiest options 
  It appears to be spread trading where traders are buying
the  128 strike put and selling the  123 strike put  which
would be a very bearish play   said WhatsTrading com options

 Karl Schamotta  senior market strategist at Western Union
Business Solutions in Victoria  British Columbia  said despite
the weak data   the reality is the U S  economy is in a more
stable position than its rivals 
  The situation in Europe is under appreciated  and the U S 
is set to outperform regardless of how negative things get  
 The yen also rose because of its perceived safe haven
status  pushing the dollar down 0 4 percent to 80 69 yen 
and driving the euro  to a one month low of 113 47

Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
One company to watch right now is Western Union  WU   WU is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and an A for Value  The stock holds a P E ratio of 13 76  while its industry has an average P E of 27 03  Over the past year  WU s Forward P E has been as high as 14 52 and as low as 8 53  with a median of 10 85 
WU is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1 12  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  WU s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 1 81  Over the past 52 weeks  WU s PEG has been as high as 3 27 and as low as 1 10  with a median of 2 22 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  WU has a P S ratio of 2 11  This compares to its industry s average P S of 4 91 
Finally  investors will want to recognize that WU has a P CF ratio of 8 31  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  This company s current P CF looks solid when compared to its industry s average P CF of 25 14  WU s P CF has been as high as 31 36 and as low as 5 87  with a median of 7 32  all within the past year

180585,402101,WU,Is MoneyGram Poised To Ride On Online Transaction Growth ,opinion,"MoneyGram International Inc    NASDAQ MGI   announced that its online platforms have witnessed record breaking transaction growth during the holiday shopping season 
To put this in perspective  between Dec 1 and Dec 25  MoneyGram branded online platforms reported a yearly transaction growth of more than 70   Moreover  80  of online transactions were made via mobile  reflecting the popularity of handheld devices to make money transfer 
Outside of the United States  online transactions during the holiday period increased nearly 120  on a year over year basis  Globally  all of MoneyGram s major online markets achieved double digit transaction growth during the holiday period 
This data set bodes well for MoneyGram given the fact that it has vociferously made investments to develop its digital money transfer platform  It seems that the company s investments are paying off well  It is well poised to see revenue gains from digital platform as consumers  preference for fast and safe money transfer via mobile phone is increasing 
An estimated 3 2 billion smartphone users along with changing global migration flows create huge business growth opportunity for MoneyGram 
MoneyGram has been facing stiff competition in recent years from new fintech players in the industry  reflecting decline in revenues since 2017 through the first nine months of 2019  It has been trying to keep itself grounded by focusing on product and channel diversification  and investing in digital business and key international markets 
MoneyGram realizes the need to stay technologically updated in this evolving technological period and to this end  it launched its re designed app in late 2018  Its app has received a good response and has since then been downloaded more than 1 6 million times 
MoneyGram has made additional digital enhancements over the past year such as expanding the loyalty program internationally  launching Visa  NYSE V  Direct  redesigning its website  and bringing digital capabilities to new countries so that consumers can remit money in over 60 markets The company s growing digital wing will provide it with a new identity 
Notably  it  has been facing increased compliance issues over the years  The company views its digital money remittance business as a startup backed by an old name 
In 2020  MoneyGram will further expand its digital business by investing in digital marketing and rolling out additional products to provide customer satisfaction 
We believe its digital growth will aid the company  which missed estimates in three of the four reported quarters  The stock has lost 3 9  in the past year against its  s growth of 16 5

180586,402102,WU,Earnings Preview  Western Union  WU  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Western Union  WU  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 11  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This money transfer company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 43 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 32 billion  down 5 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Western Union 
For Western Union  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Western Union will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Western Union would post earnings of  0 47 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 49  delivering a surprise of  4 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

180645,402161,WU,MoneyGram  Ripple Tie Up To Enhance Cross Border Payments,opinion,"MoneyGram International  Inc    NASDAQ MGI   has entered into a pact with Ripple  a provider of leading enterprise blockchain solutions for global payments  The partnership will allow MoneyGram to leverage Ripple s product named XRapid  in effectuating cross border payments  The same will be done at lower cost and higher speed by the use of RippleNet a network of more than 200 banks and payment providers which makes it easy to connect and transact across the world 
This two year deal will make Ripple a key partner of MoneyGram for all its cross border settlements using digital assets  As part of this partnership  Ripple has made an initial investment of  30 million in MoneyGram equity and share warrants 
The partnership with Ripple is a win for MoneyGram  which has been facing stiff competition from fintech players such as PayPal Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ PYPL   and Square  Inc    NYSE SQ    The company has been suffering from revenue declines for the past several quarters  In a year s time  the stock has lost 80  compared with the  s decline of 3 1  

 
The deal will reduce MoneyGram s cash needs  for which it relied on traditional foreign exchange markets to meet settlement obligations  This required advance purchases of most currencies and consequent locking of funds 
Through this partnership  MoneyGram will be able to settle key currencies and match the timing of funding with its settlement requirements  reducing operating costs  working capital needs and improving earnings and free cash flow 
The deal is in vein with the company s aim to grow its Global Funds Transfer segment  which is its primary revenue driver  It generated 49  of the company s revenues in 2018 
Blockchain technology is fast gaining ground in the payments industry  A prominent player like Western Union   NYSE WU   has forged partnership with Thunes to facilitate cross border payments via Stellar s distributed ledger technology  Western Union is also testing Ripple technology for remittances in certain corridors 
MoneyGram is also into the process of refinancing its existing first lien term and revolving facilities and expects to announce the closing of that transaction next week  This will further provide financial flexibility to it  We believe these recent developments will restore investors  confidence on the company to some extent

180646,402162,WU,Chart Of The Day  Western Union Slides As Libra Threatens Revenue,opinion,"Western Union  NYSE WU   the money movement and payment services company  dropped as much as 4 3  Tuesday  making it one of the worst performing stocks on the S P 500  as investors priced in the potential for free money transfers overseas with Facebook  NASDAQ FB  s newly announced cryptocurrency  Libra 
However  the social media giant  already under scrutiny for its monopoly and privacy law abuse  may find it takes somewhat longer to launch Libra than it had hoped  U S  lawmakers yesterday demanded Facebook halt its crypto plans pending Congressional approval  while their European counterparts were also quick to call for scrutiny of the project 
Still  the excitement around Libra raises the specter of whether Western Union will be seeing its main source of business erode dramatically  Consumer to consumer money transfers make up 79  of the company s revenue  according to its Q1 report published on May 7  This doesn t help the stock  which  as technical analysis suggests  could be set for a deeper tumble 

Western Union has been trading within an ascending channel since the beginning of the year  The pattern demonstrates that while there have been dips  they were profit taking corrections amid a rising trend  In other words  both buyers and sellers agree the stock is underpriced 
Even yesterday s plunge found support by both the channel bottom and the 50 DMA  However  both the RSI and the MACD triggered sell signals only the second time since the development of the rising channel 
While the 50 DMA crossed above the 200 DMA last month triggering a golden cross  a signal that s closely watched by many  not just technicians the 100 DMA lends credence to the channel bottom  In addition  the RSI fell below its uptrend line of the same period 
Since momentum tends to lead price  it raises the odds for the price to fall below its own channel bottom  retesting the 200 DMA for the first time in 6 weeks 
While the RSI is a leading indicator  the MACD is a lagging indicator  So  when its short MA crossed below its long MA  it demonstrated weakness in current prices  bringing up the rear to the leading indicator 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would wait for the price to complete a descending series of peaks and troughs before considering shorting the stock 
Moderate traders may risk a short position  if the price falls below the 200 DMA and demonstrates its resistance properties  with at least one long red  candle engulfing a green or small candle of either color 
Aggressive traders may short at will  providing they prepare a detailed trading plan they re committed to that fits their account and temperament  Also  they should expect volatility amid a Fed policy meeting

180647,402163,WU,Is Western Union  WU  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Western Union Company   NYSE WU   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Western Union has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 69  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 21  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Western Union  current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 10 83  over the past three years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Business Services sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 70  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Western Union Holdings has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 07  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Western Union has a P S ratio of about 1 58  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 29 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Western Union currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes WU a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 73  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 16 78  Clearly  WU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Western Union might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of F  This gives WU a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days and four lower  while the full year estimate has seen seven downward and two upward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen 4 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has fallen 3 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Western Union Company Price and Consensus    This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineWestern Union is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 12  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion

180652,402168,WU,Western Union  WU  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Western Union  WU  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This money transfer company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 48 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 34 billion  down 5 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Western Union 
For Western Union  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Western Union will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Western Union would post earnings of  0 42 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 39  delivering a surprise of  7 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

180671,402187,WU,Here s Why It Is Advisable To Avoid MoneyGram  MGI  Now,opinion,The stock of MoneyGram International  Inc    NASDAQ MGI   seems to have fallen out of favor with investors  given a host of headwinds faced by the company  such as a highly competitive money transfer market  loss of business in some corridors  high compliance cost and a weak balance sheet In the recently reported first quarter 2019 results  MoneyGram disappointed investors by sustaining a loss of 6 cents per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a huge 175   In the year ago quarter  the company reported earnings of 15 cents per share The company s total revenues declined 15  year over year and missed estimates by 4   Adjusted EBITDA  which reflects profitability  also declined 25  year over year This was the second consecutive quarter of earnings miss  In the fourth quarter of 2018  the company lagged earnings estimates by 90  The company s lackluster performance led to its share price dive by 74  in a year s time  significantly underperforming its  s decline of 7 8   The stock s performance looks all the more grave when compared with other similar companies in the money transfer space such as The Western Union Co    NYSE WU    which has declined only 2   On the contrary  Square Inc    NYSE SQ   and PayPal Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ PYPL   have gained 21  and 44   respectively  during the same time frame Given that all these companies operate mostly in the same market  there must be some company specific factors adversely affecting MoneyGram Let s see the factors draining the stockMoneyGram has been impacted by increasing compliance controls  which impose limits on certain transactions  Also  the effect of tighter restrictions in corridors such as Nigeria and the United States has brought the company s revenues under pressure   The U S  to U S  market is a persistent challenge with an increasingly aggressive market pricing and a variety of new competitors  Consequently  the revenues have been declining from past two years and continued to slide in the first quarter of 2019 Apart from weak revenues  MoneyGram also faces compliance risks associated with regulations governing money transfer companies  From 2014 to 2017  the company incurred nearly  39 million  on average  in its compliance enhancement program  In 2018  the company further incurred  12 9 million  up 34  year over year toward the same program  High compliance requirements have suffered loss of agents and customers in some of its corridors  thus eroding business MoneyGram s high leverage has been another concern  Its net debt to capital ratio is 120  compared with the industry average of 38   This high leverage is not favorable  especially at the time when the company s revenues remain stressed  Its interest earned ratio is 0 3 times which is extremely low compared with the industry average of 5 8  which reflects the company s vulnerability to cover interest cost  Default in this regard can cause another layer of issue such as credit rating downgrades from rating agencies What Lies Ahead Earlier this week  rating agency Moody s Investors Service downgraded MoneyGram s Corporate Family Rating  CFR  to B3 from B2 and existing senior secured credit facility rating to B3 from B2 The rating agency assigned a B2 rating to the proposed amended first lien credit facility and a Caa2 rating to the proposed second lien term loan facility  The outlook remains negative The company has recently taken a second lien term facility of  245 million which will be used to payoff balance under first lien term facility  Also  the proposed amendment of the first lien revolver and term facilities will include extension of maturities and an increase in interest rates  which will lead to an increase in interest cost  This might also lead to just the breakeven or very little positive cash flow over next 12 to 18 months Per Moody s  the company s revenues and EBITDA margin  are expected to remain under pressure till stabilization levels are achieved  which could be late 2019 or early 2020 The company also expects full year 2019 revenues to decline approximately 2  to 4  and adjusted EBITDA to decline by approximately 8  to 12   both on a constant currency basis The weak projections could dampen the stock s performance in the coming quarters

180672,402188,WU,Will MoneyGram s  MGI  International Digital Expansion Help ,opinion,"MoneyGram International Inc    NASDAQ MGI   recently introduced its digital capabilities in Chile and Canada 
These two regions offer attractive business growth opportunities due to their huge immigrant population  driving demand for money remittance services  In Canada  immigrants can now use the newly launched services  MoneyGram online and mobile capabilities  to send funds to their families back home  Funds can be moved quickly to any Canada Post location 
Demand for remittance in Chile has risen nearly 250  since 2010  To capture a pie of this growing market share  MoneyGram has launched mobile staging capabilities that will enable its customers and agents to process transactions quickly at point of sale 
The company is focused on digital expansion  The remittance industry is witnessing rapid change with the proliferation of technology  Several fintech players are also offering such services at affordable rates  thus intensifying competition for MoneyGram  Its peer Western Union Co    NYSE WU   faces the same ordeal  It has been developing its digital money transfer service moving away from its earlier concentration in  physical transfer via its numerous outlets across the globe 
Despite the fact that the company s online transactions outside the United States grew over 100  year over year in the first quarter of 2019  the pressure on the top line persists 
MoneyGram continues to be affected by increasing compliance controls  which impose limits on certain transactions  Also  the effect of tighter restrictions in corridors such as Nigeria and the United States has brought the company s revenues under pressure  
The U S  to U S  market is a persistent challenge with increasingly aggressive market pricing and a host of new competitors  Consequently  revenues have been declining over the past two years including the first quarter of 2019  The growth climate does not look promising this year as well  The company expects full year 2019 revenues to decline approximately 2  to 4  
Apart from weak revenues  MoneyGram also faces high compliance costs  From 2014 to 2017  the company incurred nearly  39 million  on average  in costs for its compliance enhancement program  In 2018  the company incurred further  12 9 million  up 34  year over year 
High compliance requirements resulted in loss of agents and customers in some of its corridors  thus eroding business  Plus  these expenses weigh on the company s margins  It issued a grim view of its margins with 2019 adjusted EBITDA expected to decline approximately 8  to 12  
Shares of the company have shed 75  in a year s time compared with its  s decline of 8  

 
Though MoneyGram is developing and expanding its digital platform to stay ahead in the rapidly changing money transfer industry  it will incur substantial costs  In contrast  newer fintech players with cutting edge technology are expected to have a competitive edge over MoneyGram 
It s likely to be a difficult ride for MoneyGram ahead  The stock has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Earnings estimates for 2019 have declined 39  in past 30 days  The same for 2020 has declined 22

180710,402226,WU,Western Union  WU  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Western Union  WU  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This money transfer company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 49 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  19 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 43 billion  down 0 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Western Union 
For Western Union  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Western Union will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Western Union would post earnings of  0 48 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 52  delivering a surprise of  8 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Western Union doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/western-union-wu-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200381995,200381995

What s Next for Western Union 
While Western Union has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

180748,402264,WU,Western Union  WU  Faces  60M Fine For Lapses In Compliance,opinion,"Western Union Co    NYSE WU   will be paying  60 million on account of lapses in compliance programs during 2004 2012 period  Earlier  the world s leading money transfer company accrued  49 million toward resolution of this matter
This payment will be made by Western Union to New York Department of Financial Services  NYDFS  to resolve violations of the state s law arising out of the facts set forth in the deferred prosecution agreement  DPA  with the U S  Department of Justice  DoJ  
The DoJ stated that during 2004 2012  Western Union violated U S  laws as it processed hundreds of thousands of transactions for agents and others engaged in an international consumer fraudulent scheme 
As part of this scheme  fraudsters made contact with victims in the U S  posing as family members in need or promised prizes or job prospects  The fraudsters compelled the victims to send money through Western Union to help their relative or claim a prize 
However  he NYDFS acknowledged that since 2012  the company made a concerted efforts toward enhancing compliance strategy  To this end  it has made significant investments in compliance spending  The company has also successfully navigated the Southwest Border Anti Money Laundering Compliance Program  which indicates its inclination toward checking illegal money laundering 
The enhanced compliance program is being undertaken by the company to protect its well established brand name Providing secure and legal transactions is one of the main purviews of a money transfer company and Western Union is trying its best to deliver on this This is also evident from a more than 200  increase in overall compliance funding by the company over the past six years  Western Union spends approximately  200 million per year on compliance and has more than one fifth of its workforce dedicated to these functions Apart from investing in compliance  the company is also spending on technology to keep pace with the rapid shift in the space from physical to electronic money transfer  High compliance and investment costs are expected to pressurize the company s bottom line  The company has also seen a weak top line growth since past many quarters due to soft volumes from oil producing countries  forex volatility  stiff competition and weak economy in some parts of the world These factors have cumulatively weighed on the company s share price which are down 8 7  against its  s rally of 37 7

180749,402265,WU,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  MoneyGram International  Visa  MasterCard And Western Union,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 22  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Business Services  including Western Union Company   NYSE WU    MoneyGram International Inc    NASDAQ MGI    Visa Inc    NYSE V   and MasterCard Inc    NYSE MA   Industry  Business Services  Part 2Link  Stocks in the Business Services sector have been strong performers of late  reflecting the group s favorable fundamentals  which we have listed below  This should give readers a good sense of the factors  expected to help these stocks over the near  to medium term Labor Intensive  The sector  which offers intangible products  has immense employment opportunities as it requires both skilled and unskilled labor for its smooth functioning Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the unemployment rate in December was 4 1  with non farm payroll employment increasing nearly 0 1 million in the month  Unemployment was 4 1  for three straight months  Jobs were added in health care  construction and manufacturing sectors  Unemployment decreased 60 basis points since December 2016  The professional and business service industry added 0 02 million jobs in December In 2017 payroll employment grew 2 1 million versus growth of 2 2 million a year ago Ushering in more good news for the sector  President Trump has hinted at creating more domestic employment  Trump had shown his discontent about moving jobs outside the United States during the election campaign  He said   I just want to let all of the other companies know that we re going to do great things for business  There s no reason for them to leave anymore  Per the Federal Reserve  unemployment is expected to be 3 9  in 2018 and 2019 Business reports indicate that the two most populated countries  China and India  are together expected to create 300 million placements in the global job market by 2030 Asset Light Business Model  By virtue of the nature of its operations  these companies provide services instead of products to others  This  in turn  frees them from producing goods that would otherwise need manufacturing facilities  As a result  business services do not have inventory or stock and thus  do not have to bear costs for such items Moreover  services can be tailor made for any situation  This is not possible or feasible for something tangible Global Reach  Companies can reach consumers or prospective buyers across the world when Advertising   Market Services and Direct Marketers act on behalf of such firms in informing consumers about new products or added features in existing products  Thus  these service providers help in widening a company s customer base and maintaining a better retention ratio alongside opening the door to international trade A key development in this regard has been noticed in the banking space  Online banking for transfer and collection of money from anywhere in the world  mobile money transfer and ATMs are fast gaining traction  The Western Union Company and MoneyGram International Inc  are among those that continuously offer cutting edge services via electronic channels to ensure smooth fund transfers  Fund transferors are also forming alliances with banks and mobile operators to launch their services Mobile payment is gaining popularity owing to its convenience and round the clock accessibility  We expect this channel will see a faster adoption rate than any other electronic channel  Western Union s Vigo and OrlandiValuta branded services are available through a network of more than 550 000 agent locations in 200 countries and territories and over 100 000 ATMs Importantly  90  of those locations are outside the United States  The company plans to add retail locations and more account based options  MoneyGram has 350 000 agent locations across 200 countries and territories The companies are continuously pursuing online money transfer growth initiatives  While MoneyGram launched MoneyGram MobilePass and MoneyGram Kameleon in 2016  a new digital money transfer service  Western Union  introduced WU Connect  which allows it to offer cross border money transfer services on third party platforms A large portion of the world market remains underpenetrated  With the strategic introduction of money transfer in these markets  service providers should enjoy ample business opportunities In addition  a continued shift toward electronic forms of payment from paper based forms has created a dependence on plastic money or debit and credit cards  This has encouraged card processors to ramp up their growth profile  Visa Inc  and MasterCard Inc  are among the companies  well placed to benefit from the tailwinds  riding on their respective fundamental strengths Cost Effective  All business operators prefer to minimize cost of operation and maximize margins  This sector offers cost effectiveness to companies that opt for services that would otherwise be far more expensive With specialized services  these providers reduce operational cost and in turn  lower the overall cost of companies  Notably  a higher number of companies opting for such specialized services would increase volumes for service providers  This would eventually lead to services at lower costs and a further reduction in costs for companies  thereby fueling margin expansion Our data shows that Business Services margins have consistently grown in the past few quarters  and will likely retain the momentum in the next few quarters too  Importantly  Business Services margin expansion is better than that of the S P 500 Index Follow us on Twitter   Join us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB

180750,402266,WU,U S  10 Year Surges On Opening  FOMO Is Back,opinion,"Hope you re having a fantastic day so far  All the markets went up yesterday for a special Valentine s Day miracle 
The FOMO is back with a vengeance and though we re nowhere near peak FOMO levels seen in November  we can clearly see that the FUD is fading fast and markets are getting excited once again 
Bitcoin is looking ready and willing to bust through 10k  possibly today  If it does indeed manage to do that  we may never look back 
That said  the usual disclaimers apply  These are super high risk assets so any cryptocurrency should not take up more than a small part of your overall portfolio 
Today s Highlights
Inflation is Coming
Chikun Leading the Way
XRP on Western Union
Please note  All data   are valid as of February 15th  All trading carries risk  Only risk capital you can afford to lose 
Traditional Markets There are two types of FOMO in this world  Healthy and unhealthy 
I must say that the FOMO in the stock markets yesterday was more than a bit concerning  The inflation numbers that every analyst and their brother were so hyper focused on came out way above expectations showing that inflation is coming to the United States at a rapid pace 
The initial reaction in the stock markets was down as expected  but what happened next was a total surprise  Once the lows were in  things started rising as Wall Street moved in to buy the dip 
Even more confusing is the reaction from the US dollar  The conventional thinking is that higher inflation would cause the Fed to hike rates faster  which in turn would strengthen the Buck 
Just like the stocks  the initial response was as expected and the dollar rose sharply on the announcement  However  just a few short minutes later the dollar started falling and continued to fall all the way until this morning 
Here s the USD JPY  The announcement is circled in yellow 

The only reaction that really made sense was in the bond market  Here we can see the yield on the US 10 Year surging at the market open and rising until the close 
So now the question becomes  If the markets are skyrocketing after this huge inflation data came out  then what the heck really caused the sell off over the last two weeks 
Chikun Leading the Cryptos
All the cryptos are firmly in the green today but none quite as much as   The world s first and most established bitcoin spinoff is up almost 60  over the last 7 days  half of which happened in the last 24 hours 
Here we can see a nice clean breakout in both the long term  blue  and short term  yellow  trendlines   

Though some are still speculating over the reasons for this massive rally  we can point to three main factors 
1  A scam hard fork called Litecoin Cash seems to have duped some  The founder of Litecoin himself has denounced this fork  but that may not have stopped some from trying to get in anyhow 

2  A new service called Litepay is planning to launch a product that will make it easier for business to accept the altcoin  Though  is a bit old  it may still be spurring speculation 
3  The FOMO is figgen back in the market 
Crypto investors have been sitting on their hands for weeks waiting for a rally  so as soon as they saw one starting they jumped on and and are currently riding it for all it s worth 

XRP Strikes Back
One more neat announcements that s adding to crypto enthusiasm today is a new pilot by the global fund transfer powerhouse Western Union 
Whilst many new pilots announced by Ripple Labs lately do not use the XRP tokens  this one will 
That means both Moneygram  and Western Union are now testing out XRP to do their cash settlements and currency transfers 
Imagine the possibilities  I ll let you guys draw the lines on this chart but I d like to see a moon in there somewhere

After the failure of the merger between Moneygram and Ant Financial  the industry participants are very closely anticipating the former s tie up with Euronet  Earlier  Euronet had failed to woo MoneyGram as Ant Financial s bid was comparatively more attractive 
If the Moneygram Euronet merger takes place it would make the market further concentrated by wiping out a major player

180823,402339,WU,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Western Union Company  MoneyGram International  Centene  Visa And MasterCard,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 29  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Business Services  Part 2  including The Western Union Company  NYSE    NYSE WU        MoneyGram International Inc   Nasdaq    NASDAQ MGI        Centene Corp   NYSE    NYSE CNC        Visa Inc   NYSE    NYSE V       and MasterCard Inc   NYSE    NYSE MA       Industry  Business Services  Part 2Link  Stocks in the Business Services sector have been strong performers lately  reflecting the group s favorable fundamentals  which we have listed below  This should give readers a good sense of the factors that are expected to help these stocks over the near  to medium term Asset light Business Model  By virtue of the nature of its operations  these companies provide services instead of products to others  This  in turn  frees them from producing goods that would otherwise need manufacturing facilities  As a result  business services do not have inventory or stock  and thus do not have to bear costs for such items Moreover  services can be tailor made for any situation  This is not possible or feasible for something tangible Labor Intensive  The sector  which offers intangible products  has immense employment opportunities as it requires both skilled and unskilled labor for its smooth functioning Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the unemployment rate in August was 4 4   with non farm payroll employment increasing nearly 0 2 million in the month  Jobs were added in manufacturing  construction  professional and technical services  health care and mining industries  Unemployment decreased 50 basis points since August 2016  The professional and business service industry added 0 02 million jobs in August Ushering in more good news for the sector  President Trump has hinted at creating more jobs and employment  Trump had shown his discontent about moving job outside the U S  during the election campaign  He said   I just want to let all of the other companies know that we re going to do great things for business  There s no reason for them to leave anymore  Business reports indicate that the two most populated countries  China and India  are together expected to create 300 million placements in the global job market by 2030 Global Reach  Companies can reach consumers or prospective buyers across the world when Advertising   Market Services and Direct Marketers act on behalf of such firms in informing consumers about new products or added features in existing products  Thus  these service providers help in widening a company s customer base and maintaining a better retention ratio alongside opening the door to international trade A key development in this regard has been noticed in the banking space  Online banking for transfer and collection of money from anywhere in the world  mobile money transfer and ATMs are fast gaining traction  The Western Union Company  NYSE       and MoneyGram International Inc   Nasdaq       are among those that continuously offer cutting edge services via electronic channels to ensure smooth fund transfers  Fund transferors are also forming alliances with banks and mobile operators to launch their services Mobile payment is gaining popularity owing to its convenience and round the clock accessibility  We expect this channel will see a faster adoption rate than any other electronic channel  Western Union s Vigo and OrlandiValuta branded services are available through a network of more than 500 000 agent locations in 200 countries and territories and over 100 000 ATMs Importantly  90  of those locations are outside the U S  The company plans to add retail locations and more account based options  MoneyGram has 350 000 agent locations across 200 countries and territories A large portion of the world market remains underpenetrated  With the strategic introduction of money transfer in these markets  service providers should enjoy ample business opportunities In addition  a continued shift toward electronic forms of payment from paper based forms has created a dependence on plastic money or debit and credit cards  This has encouraged card processors to ramp up their growth profile  Visa Inc   NYSE       and MasterCard Inc   NYSE       are among the companies that are well placed to benefit from the tailwinds  riding on their respective fundamental strengths Cost Effective  All business operators prefer to minimize cost of operation and maximize margins  This sector offers cost effectiveness to companies that opt for services that would otherwise be far more expensive With specialized services  these providers reduce operational cost and in turn  lower the overall cost of companies  Notably  a higher number of companies opting for such specialized services would increase volumes for service providers  This would eventually lead to services at lower costs and a further reduction in costs for companies  thereby fueling margin expansion Our data shows that Business Services margins have consistently grown in the past few quarters  and will likely retain the momentum in the next few quarters too  Importantly  Business Services margin expansion is better than that of the S P 500 Index Strong Stocks that Should

180856,402372,WU,The Case for Strengthening Financial Reform,opinion,"The case for strengthening financial reform
While the Dodd Frank Act recently   some critics have been gunning for the landmark reform  aiming to either water it down or gut it completely  This would be woefully misguided  as there is that the regulations set forth by Dodd Frank  which was enacted in the aftermath of the financial crisis  do not hamper lending or stifle economic growth 
On the contrary  this Republican talking point is not backed up by facts  As Paul Volcker  former chair of the Federal Reserve  Fed   a few months ago  bank profits are at record highs  returns on banking assets exceed 1 percent  loan growth is exceeding GDP growth and the economy is close to full employment 
Borrowing costs have decreased  making it easier for consumers to pay their personal loans and credit card balance  and high cost mortgages have become less common 
Close to 30 million Americans have received compensation from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau  CFPB  after suffering financial wrongdoing  another positive result of the Act 
Further  banks have substantially improved their capital position  with the largest U S  banks recently passing Fed stress tests 

 This year s results show that  even during a severe recession  our large banks would remain well capitalized   Jerome Powell  governor of the Fed  said in a statement   This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle  and support households and businesses when times are tough  

All 34 major banks that took these tests succeeded  the third time in a row U S  banks have generated this result 
Thus far  the Dodd Frank Act has built a strong foundation of regulations that have made our financial system safer and more robust  However  this progress has done little to deter critics 
Indeed  President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to dismantle the landmark reform  and since being elected  he has repeatedly spoken out against the act  In April  he signed executive orders aimed at limiting the power of regulatory agencies by having Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin look into certain authorities granted to these organizations 
In June  Mnuchin followed up by releasing a nearly 150 page report suggesting that several of the act s changes be eliminated 
That same month  the House of Representatives approved The Financial CHOICE Act  which would target many of the changes made by Dodd Frank  including the empowerment of the CFPB 
The legislation  which many have predicted has very low odds of passing the Senate  would remove many of the agency s powers  including its ability to prohibit arbitration and its authority to disallow bank products and services when deemed necessary 
Even if this legislation ultimately fails to receive the needed approval  Trump could potentially have the CFPB refrain from enforcing certain rules set forth as a result of Dodd Frank 
Any such efforts to water down the efficacy of the Dodd Frank Act could prove harmful to the financial services industry  The implications of paring back these regulations could be widespread  affecting areas ranging from lending to the capital requirements of banks 
A perfect example of an area that will suffer without the regulations created by Dodd Frank is the global remittances sector  This landmark reform has provided several payment related consumer protections  requiring banks to establish processes that provide greater transparency by ensuring customers receive full disclosure of the key information they need to make transactions 
Thanks to Dodd Frank  these financial institutions must disclose crucial information about remittances made to recipients outside the U S   including the monetary value of the transfer  the cost of the transaction and when recipients will be able to access funds 
Should these consumer protections disappear  it will only make it easier for the players in this particular market to gouge their customers with high prices  The global remittances sector already suffers from an anti competitive marketplace that drives up consumer costs 
As of 2015  Western Union  NYSE WU    Moneygram  NASDAQ MGI  and Ria Money Transfer  the three largest players in this space  had 35  of the market  Western Union  the market leader  commanded a 15  share at the time  To solidify its position  the company has had its agents sign exclusivity clauses that forbid them from working with other money transfer operators  MTOs  
More than 20 countries have reacted to these exclusivity clauses  which hamper competition and hurt consumers  by making them illegal for money transfers   but this concerted action has failed to change Western Union s business model 
In fact  Western Union has managed to pass its expensive fees and foreign exchange margins on to customers  People in sub Saharan Africa  which represent a major chunk of the estimated 800 million people worldwide who depend on remittances  can pay fees approaching 15  
While European and African leaders have pledged to cut the expenses charged for these remittances to less than 3  of the total payments sent by 2030  the average fees for sending remittances have remained largely unchanged 
All of these moves have taken place in an effort to show that economic growth is intrinsically linked to the welfare and amount of disposable income of consumers  If lawmakers gut Dodd Frank  it could help enable predatory lending  lessen the capital requirements designed to keep banks solvent and also help fuel the substantial commissions that MTOs collect for processing transactions ",2017-08-16,Charles Bovaird,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-case-for-strengthening-financial-reform-200207669,200207669

180860,402376,WU,Is Western Union A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Western Union Company   NYSE WU   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Western Union has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 78  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 95  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Western Union s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 27 37  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Western Union has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 77  so it is fair to say that a value oriented path may be ahead for Western Union stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Western Union has a P S ratio of about 1 65  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 13 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Western Union currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Western Union a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the PEG ratio for Western Union is just 1 08  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 74  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  WU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall  Though Western Union might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives WU a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower  while the full year estimate has seen ten up and one down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 3 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Western Union Company  The  Price and Consensus    
In spite of the slightly bearish analyst opinion  the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term 
Bottom Line
Western Union is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  among the Top 31   and strong Zacks Rank  Western Union looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past two year  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below 

So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick

180883,402399,WU,Western Union  WU  Loses 6  Since Q1 Earnings  Here s Why,opinion,"Since the earnings release on May 2  money transfer company Western Union Co    NYSE WU   has lost 6 1   in stark contrast to the gain of 0 5  of the Zacks categorized  industry 
What Has Made the Shares Bleed Change in share price reflects the performance of a company and the factors affecting it In the case of Western Union  shares seem to have taken a beating from the lackluster first quarter earnings performance  which disappointed investors  Earnings in the quarter missed estimates by 12 5  and declined 5 4  year over year The stock must have suffered from a bleak top line outlook which forecasts revenue growth at flat to down low single digits due to a strong U S  dollar  continued softness in oil markets and a number of global economic issues Other Factors Affecting the Stock
Western Union has been facing compliance related issues  which have resulted in several charges  After paying up 3 6  of revenues in 2016 as compliance charges  the company spent 3 7  in the first quarter of 2017  The company expects the same to be at the high end of the 3 5  4  of revenues range in full year 2017 
The company also coughed up  151 million to settle legal charges leveled by federal and state governments  It also has to pay the remaining  440 million of settlement charges in the second quarter  High compliance and investment costs are likely to weigh on the company s bottom line 
Intensifying Competition  The recent acquisition of Xoom by PayPal Hodings  Inc    NASDAQ PYPL   poses competitive threat to Western Union  The combined entity has a significant presence in the digital money transfer market  where Western Union is fast catching up by making substantial investments 
Also  the ongoing merger between Moneygram International Inc    NASDAQ MGI   and Ant Financial  an affiliate of Chinese Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd    NYSE BABA    will boost the market position of Moneygram  which has so far been lagging Western Union  The company commands a premium price in the market by virtue of its brand  reliability and almost monopolistic hold  However  consolidation within the industry might pose stiff competitive challenge to Western Union 
Global Headwinds and Forex Volatility  The company is faced with a number of global economic headwinds  including foreign exchange volatility  low oil prices and weakness in some of the economies  which have been limiting profits  Remittance flows from the oil producing countries will continue to be affected by the persistent weakness in oil price  thereby hurting revenues in the Middle East and Africa as well as part of Asia Pacific 
Notably  management expects the overall macro scenario in 2017 to be largely in line with 2016 levels  thanks to persistent challenges like the strengthening of the U S  dollar  soft economic conditions in oil producing nations and uncertainty in the global geopolitical environment 
The impact of currency translation  net of hedge benefits  impacted first quarter 2017 revenues by approximately  30 million as compared to the prior year  It expects adverse foreign exchange translation to have a 9 cent impact on earning per share in full year 2017 Given the adverse factors  we don t expect this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock to turn around anytime soon  You can see

180884,402400,WU,Will Increasing Employment Support Business Services Stocks ,opinion,"Having established its indispensability  the business service  BS  sector constantly looks for further growth  Business services  stocks have been delivering strong performances  In this write up  we highlight the sector s positives in order to appreciate its recent outperformance and provide an outlook for the near future 
Labor Intensive  The sector  which offers intangible products  has immense employment opportunities  as it requires both skilled and unskilled labor for its smooth functioning 
Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the unemployment rate in May 2017 was 4 3   with non farm payroll employment increasing slightly above 0 1 million in the month  Jobs were added in health care and mining  Unemployment decreased 50 basis points since Jan 2017  The professional and business service industry added 0 04 million jobs in May 
Ushering in more good news for the sector  President Trump has hinted at creating more jobs and employment  Trump had shown his discontent about moving jobs outside the U S    I just want to let all of the other companies know that we re going to do great things for business  There s no reason for them to leave anymore  
Business reports indicate that the two most populated countries  China and India  are together expected to create 300 million placements in the global job market by 2030 
Free from Inventory  By virtue of the nature of its operations  these companies provide services instead of products to others  This  in turn  frees them from producing goods that would otherwise need manufacturing facilities  As a result  business services do not have inventory or stock and thus  do not have to bear costs for such items 
Moreover  services can be tailor made for any situation  This is not possible or feasible for something tangible 
Global Reach  Companies can reach consumers or prospective buyers across the world when Advertising   Market Services and Direct Marketers act on behalf of such firms in informing consumers about new products or added features in existing products  Thus  these service providers help in widening a company s customer base and maintaining a better retention ratio alongside opening the door to international trade 
A key development in this regard has been noticed in the banking space  Online banking for transfer and collection of money from anywhere in the world  mobile money transfer and ATMs are fast gaining traction  The Western Union Company  NYSE WU   WU  and MoneyGram International Inc   MGI  are among those that continuously offer cutting edge services via electronic channels to ensure smooth fund transfers  Fund transferors are also forming alliances with banks and mobile operators to launch their services 
Mobile payment is gaining popularity owing to its convenience and round the clock accessibility  We expect this channel will see a faster adoption rate than any other electronic channel  Western Union s Vigo and OrlandiValuta branded services are available through a network of more than 500 000 agent locations in 200 countries and territories and over 100 000 ATMs  Importantly  90  of those locations are outside the U S  The company plans to add retail locations and more account based options  MoneyGram has 350 000 agent locations across 200 countries and territories 
A large portion of the world market remains underpenetrated  With the strategic introduction of money transfer in these markets  service providers should enjoy ample business opportunities 
In addition  a continued shift toward electronic forms of payment from paper based forms has created a dependence on plastic money or debit and credit cards  This has encouraged card processors to ramp up their growth profiles  Visa Inc  NYSE V    V  and MasterCard Inc   MA  are among the companies that are well placed to benefit from the tailwinds  riding on their respective fundamental strengths 
Cost Effective  All business operators prefer to minimize costs of operation and maximize margins  This sector offers cost effectiveness to companies that opt for services that would otherwise be far more expensive 
With specialized services  these providers reduce operational cost and  in turn  lower the overall cost of companies  Notably  a higher number of companies opting for such specialized services would increase volumes for service providers  This would eventually lead to services at lower costs and a further reduction in costs for companies  thereby fueling margin expansion 
Our data shows that BS margins have consistently grown in the past few quarters  and will likely retain the momentum in the next few quarters  too  Importantly  BS margin expansion is better than that of the S P 500 Index 

Gaining from Stronger Currencies  Companies in countries with stronger currencies can gain if they get their jobs or services from companies in countries that have comparatively weaker currencies  This is because the company will have to spend less and thus gain from currency translation  In turn  this will lower the cost of its goods or services and favor margin expansion 
Specialized Service The industry offers specialized services based on the latest technologies  This is crucial for security and consulting services  To safeguard data  companies are compelled to engage security service providers  which need the latest and most efficient technologies to persuade clients and win business contracts 
Also  increasing mergers and acquisitions across the globe have been improving the prospects of legal service providers  Consulting service is another wing of this industry that is rapidly gaining traction 
Business complexities are on the rise and companies are opting for expert advice before entering into any new venture rather than risking losses by trial and error  Thus  this service sector looks promising due to its indispensability to companies that are struggling to survive in a competitive market 
Consolidations  Mergers and acquisitions play a vital role in not only strengthening a company s foothold with more market share but also in helping it gain a competitive edge  Also  the inorganic route helps to insulate the industry from macro headwinds to a great extent  Since the sector is highly fragmented  a wave of mergers and consolidations is quite likely 
In March  WNS  Holdings  Limited  WNS   a leading provider of global Business Process Management  BPM  services  acquired HealthHelp  an industry leader in care management  to improve patient outcomes and drive long term sustainable cost savings for the healthcare industry 
In May  Core Mark Holding Company  Inc   CORE   one of the largest marketers of fresh and broad line supply solutions  agreed to acquire almost all the assets of Farner Bocken Company in Carroll  IA  This acquisition helped the company establish a strong foothold in the Mid West and provided it additional expertise in foodservice 
Bottom Line
The U S  economy is now improving and population continues to increase in the nation  This sector  being labor intensive  involves lower capital investments and confidently addresses the issue  While emerging nations are becoming important destinations for business services  these economies pose challenges to employment growth in developed economies 
Given the inherent strengths  the business service sector has enough steam left to drive the engine toward growth 
Investors can look at stocks like WageWorks Inc   WAGE   which flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   as well as and InnerWorkings  Inc   INWK   SPS Commerce  Inc   SPSC  and WNS  Holdings  Ltd  that carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

180885,402401,WU,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Western Union  MoneyGram International  Acacia Research  Avis Budget Group And PRGX Global,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 08  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Business Services  Part 3  includingWestern Union Company  NYSE WU   NYSE         MoneyGram International Inc   NASDAQ         Acacia Research Corp   NASDAQ         Avis Budget Group  Inc   NASDAQ        and PRGX Global  Inc   NASDAQ        

	Industry  Business Services  Part 3

	Link  

	Despite the positives in the Business Services  we cannot ignore the headwinds limiting the positives mentioned in     

	Discussed below are some inherent challenges faced by the Business Services sector 

Continuous Spending on Research and Development    Importantly  consulting service providers need to stay abreast of the latest technologies through continuous spending on research and development  The performance of these providers can be hampered if they do not acclimate to or adopt new services to cope with the latest developments 

Maintaining Skilled Workforce Involves High Costs   Since skilled workers are always in demand  there is a possibility of a high turnover rate in the sector  The training of unskilled workers or taking in new skilled workers increases operational costs  in turn affecting margins  This space needs to have a more skilled workforce to take advantage of technology that develops at a rapid pace 

Competition   Maintaining or increasing market share remains challenging for business service providers  As discussed earlier  the main business of one company can be a business service for another  So target customers for both may at times be the same 

	Therefore  a business service provider needs to be adequately equipped to win over customers  While larger providers bank on the broad variety of service offerings and can effectively take up difficult ventures  the relatively smaller players compete in an industry backed by specialized services 

Regulatory Hurdles   By virtue of having operations across the globe  service providers face regulatory hurdles and compliance related issues  The Western Union Company  NYSE       expects compliance costs to be at the higher end of 3 5 4  in 2017 

	MoneyGram International Inc   NASDAQ        is being probed by a federal grand jury in relation to its consumer anti fraud and anti money laundering programs for 2003 to early 2009  The company is also involved in many other government investigations and litigations  Any adverse results from the investigation might lead to potential liability against damages  which could put pressure on margins and cash flows 

	Based on an unfavorable Zacks Rank  we prefer to avoid Acacia Research Corp   NASDAQ        Avis Budget Group  Inc   NASDAQ        and PRGX Global  Inc   NASDAQ         which carry a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  

	You can see   

To Conclude

	The dearth of skilled labor in the business services sector can affect its prospects  Non availability of quality workforce at a reasonable rate might increase overall operational costs 

	In addition  the highly fragmented nature of the industry makes it difficult for such companies to set a distinct trend or predict a concrete future for it 

Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside 

	Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana  Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look

180887,402403,WU,Western Union Stock Continues To Lose Value  Here s Why,opinion,"The stock of Western Union Co    NYSE WU   seems to have fallen out of favor with investors owing to a number of headwinds plaguing the company  These include softer revenues  forex volatility  macroeconomic woes  and high compliance and investment costs These have taken a toll on the company s share price which has plunged 14  year to date  significantly underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 15  The company has become been suffering from soft transaction growth in its Consumer to Consumer  C2C  segment which contributes nearly 80  to its total revenues  Low volumes from the Middle East and Africa  and APAC markets due to a decline in oil price have been the main culprits behind the softness The stock must have suffered from a bleak flat to down low single digit top line view due to a strong U S  dollar  continued softness in oil markets and a number of global economic issues 

The company also is suffering from foreign exchange volatility  given its huge international business  The impact of currency translation  net of hedge benefits  impacted first quarter 2017 revenues by approximately  30 million as compared with the prior year quarter  It expects adverse foreign exchange translation to have a 9 cent impact on earnings per share in full year 2017 
Western Union has also been facing compliance related issues  and has paid 3 6  of revenues in 2016 as compliance charges  It spent 3 7  in the first quarter of 2017 for the same  The company expects compliance related charges to be at the high end of the 3 5  to 4  revenue in full year 2017 
Western Union is also faced with intensifying competition  given the consolidation taking place in the payments industry  The recent acquisition of Xoom by PayPal Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ PYPL   and the ongoing merger between Moneygram International Inc    NASDAQ MGI   and Ant Financial  an affiliate of Chinese Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd    NYSE BABA   might pose stiff competitive challenges to the company  which commands a premium price in the market by virtue of its brand  reliability and almost monopolistic hold

180962,402478,WU,Now May Not Be The Time To Speculate In Bitcoin,opinion,"In short  no speculative positions 
The current banking system is global  at least in theory  but it definitely seems that the term  global  does not actually apply to all parts of the payments space the way we would like it to  International wire transfers still tend to be slow and costly  It is perhaps irritating that sending an email takes seconds but sending  5 abroad is slow  expensive or altogether impossible  This is why companies like Western Union  NYSE WU  still charge hefty fees for overseas transfers  As it turns out  Bitcoin and other digital currencies might offer a way forward for making the remittance industry more accessible  On Quartz  we read 

Worldwide  230 million people send  500 billion in remittances each year  primarily using firms like Western Union  Moneygram  and RIA  which together control 1 1 million retail locations and account for more than 25  of the world s annual remittance volume     
    Transferring  20 from the US to the Philippines via Viber and Western Union incurs a flat  4 fee  along with a 4  foreign exchange fee  After being converted to the Philippine peso  the money arrives at its destination as  15 15  a loss of nearly  5 
That may not seem worse than an average ATM fee  but the vast majority of Asian migrants are domestic helpers  crewmen  and construction workers  Most send home the equivalent of  200 each month often more than a quarter of their personal income  The roughly  12 in fees they must pay to transfer that amount is equivalent to half a day s wages 
For more than a year  startups have been working on this problem by building Bitcoin alternatives to traditional money transfer methods     
The nascent industry has spawned at least three new players in the past year Payphil  Sentbe  and SCI and more established Bitcoin exchanges like Korbit and Coinplug are also entering the market  They seem to be having an impact that  12 charge on a  200 transfer is more like  6 with Bitcoin  Insiders estimate that Bitcoin powered transactions now account for 20  of the remittances flowing between South Korea and the Philippines each year 

There are still a lot of problems with adoption  though  The article points out that a lot of the people sending money back home are not really interested in what Bitcoin is  Their main interest is to transfer the funds without a hitch and at a reasonable price  Bitcoin  as a new technology  might raise brows  The ultimate test will be whether the funds can remain secure and the fees can remain low  Our general sense is that digital currencies will not put Western Union  NYSE WU  out of business as the penetration is still very weak and if Bitcoin turns out to facilitate the exchange  money transmitters would generally be willing to include it as a technological solution  At the same time  a lot of development has to happen both on the technological side and as far as the law is concerned  Bitcoin is still very much in the grey zone in many countries and its status would have to be clarified for money transmitters to embrace the currency 
For now  let s focus on the charts 

On BitStamp  we saw Bitcoin lose some steam and temporarily dive below  600  Does this mean that the situation is back to bearish  Let s recall our previous comments 

The most important part now seems that Bitcoin is only partially above the Fibonacci retracement levels  If we look at the retracement levels based on the May June rally  Bitcoin is currently at the 50  level and actually a little below this level  In this case  we don t see much support for a break to the upside  If we look at the levels based on the decline from the July top to the early August low  Bitcoin is above the 38 2  retracement level but we haven t yet seen three daily closes above this level  At the same time  the recent move to the upside didn t take place on huge volume  It seems that the move up on relatively low volume might be a fake breakout 
Bitcoin didn t move much until today  Today  we ve so far seen a move similar to the one we saw last Saturday      The change is that what we re seeing now looks less like a fake breakout  There is at least one consideration which weakens the bullish implications of the move 

The situation changed again yesterday  Bitcoin went down  quite visibly compared with the previous days  and the same can be said about the volume  The action was not explosive but Bitcoin went below  600 for a time before coming back above this level  Does this mean that the situation is now bearish  We think that it is more bearish but not necessarily extremely bearish at the moment 

On the long term BTC e chart we again see a dip toward  600  Recall our previous comments 

The currency might be on the verge of a breakout above the recent downward trend based on the June top and the precipice of the late June early August decline  At the same time  the move above the trend is not confirmed  at least not yet  and the move hasn t taken place on significant volume  This makes us doubtful about the possible breakout 
Another thing we seem to see now is a series of lower highs  This is a bearish indication  which counterbalances some of the possibly bullish indications  The situation still looks bearish  in our opinion 
From the long term perspective the perspective is not that different from what we had previously  The short term perspective discussed earlier makes us cautious at the moment  The one factor that weakens the bullish implications we mentioned before is the relatively weak volume  The magnitude of the volume is nothing like what we used to see during strong upswings in the past  An additional factor which might limit the move up is the proximity of the overbought level in the RSI indicator  This factors might suggest that the move up is about to be over  At this time  however  a further move up is still likely  and as such  we would prefer to wait before reentering our hypothetical short positions 

What we wrote previously is still up to date  The recent move to the downside tilts the situation back toward bearish territory  The move is not pronounced enough  in our opinion  to change the outlook  Bitcoin is back below the 50  Fibonacci retracement level based on the June August move down but not below the 38 2   The situation is currently close to bearish but not really there  It wouldn t take much for Bitcoin to get back to bearish  Stay tuned 
Summing up  in our opinion not having speculative positions might be favorable at the moment 
Trading position  short term  our opinion   no positions ",2016-09-13,Mike McAra,https://www.investing.com/analysis/now-may-not-be-the-time-to-speculate-in-bitcoin-200153296,200153296

180979,402495,WU,Business Services Well Poised To Create Employment,opinion,"Business services stocks have lately given strong performances  with the players among the S P 500  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  up more than the index both in the year to date and trailing 12 month periods  In this write up  we highlight the sector s positives in order to appreciate its recent outperformance and give an outlook for the near future 
Labor Intensive  The sector  which offers intangible products  has immense employment opportunities as it requires both skilled and unskilled labor for its smooth functioning 
As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  unemployment rate has trended down in the past two months  notably below the year ago period   Apr 2016 saw the unemployment rate at 5   versus 5 4  in Apr 2015  while the same in May was down to 4 7   versus 5 4  in May 2015   Despite the slowdown in headline job gains over the last few months  the expectation is that nonfarm payrolls will continue to growth this year and next 
Business reports indicate that the two most populated countries  China and India  are together expected to create 300 million placements in the global job market by 2030 
Free of Inventory  By virtue of the nature of its operations  these companies provide services instead of products to others  This in turn frees them from producing goods which would otherwise need manufacturing facilities  As a result  business services do not have inventory or stock  which would again involve costs  for later use 
Moreover  services can be tailor made for any situation  This is not possible or feasible for something tangible 
Global Reach  Companies can reach their consumers or prospective buyers across the world when Advertising   Market Services and Direct Marketers act on behalf of these in informing consumers about new products or added features in existing products  Thus  these service providers help in widening a company s customer base and maintaining a better retention ratio  apart from opening the door to international trade 
A key development in this regard has been noticed in the banking space  Online banking for transfer and collection of money from anywhere in the world  mobile money transfer and ATMs are fast gaining traction  The Western Union Company  NYSE WU   WU  and MoneyGram International Inc   MGI  are among the stalwarts that are continuously offering cutting edge services via electronic channels to ensure smooth fund transfers  Fund transferors are forming alliances with banks and mobile operators to launch their services 
Mobile payment is gaining in popularity  owing to its convenience and round the clock accessibility  This channel will see a faster adoption rate than any other electronic channel  Western Union with its Vigo and OrlandiValuta branded services were available through a network of more than 500 000 agent locations in 200 countries and territories and over 100 000 ATMs  
Importantly  90  of those locations are outside the United States  The company plans to add retail locations and more account based options in 2016  MoneyGram has 350 000 agent locations spread over 200 countries and territories 
A large portion of the world market remains underpenetrated  With the strategic introduction of money transfer in these markets  service providers should enjoy ample business opportunities 
In addition  a continued shift toward electronic payments from paper based forms has created a dependence on plastic money or debit and credit cards  This has encouraged card processors to ramp up their growth profile  Visa Inc  NYSE V    V  and MasterCard Inc   MA  are among the primes that are well placed to benefit from the tailwinds riding on their respective fundamental strengths 
Cost Effective  All business operators prefer to minimize cost of operation and maximize margins  This sector offers cost effectiveness to the companies that opt for services which would otherwise be far more expensive 
With specialized services  these providers reduce operational cost and in turn lower the overall cost of companies  Notably  a higher number of companies opting for such specialized services would increase volumes for the service providers  This would eventually lead to services at lower costs and a further reduction in costs for companies  thereby fueling margin expansion 
Our data shows that Business Services margins have consistently grown in the trailing four quarters  and will retain the momentum in the next three quarters too  Importantly  Business Services margin expansion is faring better than that of the S P s 

Gaining from Stronger Currencies  Companies in a country with a stronger currency can gain if it gets its jobs or services done by companies from another country that have comparatively weaker currencies  This is because the country will have to spend less and thus gain from currency translation  In turn  this will lower the cost of its goods or services and favor margin expansion 
Specialized Service  The industry offers specialized services based on the latest technologies  This is crucial for the security and consulting services  To safeguard data  companies are compelled to engage security service providers  which need the latest and most efficient technologies to persuade their clients and win business contracts 
Also  with increasing mergers and acquisitions across the globe  the prospects of legal service providers look good  Consulting service is another wing of this industry that is fast gaining traction 
Business complexities are on the rise  and companies are opting for expert advice before entering into any new venture rather than risking losses by trial and error  Hence  this service sector looks promising owing to its indispensability to companies that are battling to survive in a competitive market 
Consolidations  Mergers and acquisitions play a vital role in not only strengthening a company s foothold with more market share but also in edging out competition  Also  the inorganic route helps to insulate the industry from macro headwinds to a great extent  Since the sector is highly fragmented  a wave of mergers and consolidations is quite expected 
Core Mark Holding Company  Inc   CORE  acquired Pine State Convenience  a division of Pine State Trading Company for  88 million in cash to penetrate the market and expand capabilities in vendor consolidation and data driven selling  PFSweb  Inc   PFSW   a global commerce service provider  acquired Conexus Limited  a U K  based eCommerce system integrator to expand in Western Europe 
In April  Cardtronics Inc   CATM  purchased 2 586 cash dispensing ATMs from Chase  located primarily in high traffic retailers  In May  Cinedigm  CIDM  acquired StoryBox tv  a multi platform family friendly streaming service 
Bottom Line
The economy is now improving and population increase is never a problem in the U S  This sector  being labor intensive  involves lower capital investments and confidently addresses this problem  While emerging nations are becoming important destinations for business services  these economies pose challenges to employment growth in developed economies 
Given the inherent strengths  the business service sector has enough steam left to drive the engine toward growth

	Chicago  IL   June 27  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Business Services  Part 2   including Western Union Company  NYSE WU      MoneyGram International Inc      Visa Inc  NYSE V      and MasterCard Inc      

	Industry  Business Services  Part 2 

	Link  

	Business services stocks have lately given strong performances  with the players among the S P 500  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  up more than the index both in the year to date and trailing 12 month periods  In this write up  we highlight the sector s positives in order to appreciate its recent outperformance and give an outlook for the near future 

Labor Intensive   The sector  which offers intangible products  has immense employment opportunities as it requires both skilled and unskilled labor for its smooth functioning 

	As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  unemployment rate has trended down in the past two months  notably below the year ago period  Apr 2016 saw the unemployment rate at 5   versus 5 4  in Apr 2015  while the same in May was down to 4 7   versus 5 4  in May 2015   Despite the slowdown in headline job gains over the last few months  the expectation is that nonfarm payrolls will continue to growth this year and next 

	Business reports indicate that the two most populated countries  China and India  are together expected to create 300 million placements in the global job market by 2030 

Free of Inventory   By virtue of the nature of its operations  these companies provide services instead of products to others  This in turn frees them from producing goods which would otherwise need manufacturing facilities  As a result  business services do not have inventory or stock  which would again involve costs  for later use 

	Moreover  services can be tailor made for any situation  This is not possible or feasible for something tangible 

Global Reach    Companies can reach their consumers or prospective buyers across the world when Advertising   Market Services and Direct Marketers act on behalf of these in informing consumers about new products or added features in existing products  Thus  these service providers help in widening a company s customer base and maintaining a better retention ratio  apart from opening the door to international trade 

	A key development in this regard has been noticed in the banking space  Online banking for transfer and collection of money from anywhere in the world  mobile money transfer and ATMs are fast gaining traction  The Western Union Company     and MoneyGram International Inc     are among the stalwarts that are continuously offering cutting edge services via electronic channels to ensure smooth fund transfers  Fund transferors are forming alliances with banks and mobile operators to launch their services 

	Mobile payment is gaining in popularity  owing to its convenience and round the clock accessibility  This channel will see a faster adoption rate than any other electronic channel  Western Union with its Vigo and OrlandiValuta branded services were available through a network of more than 500 000 agent locations in 200 countries and territories and over 100 000 ATMs 

	Importantly  90  of those locations are outside the United States  The company plans to add retail locations and more account based options in 2016  MoneyGram has 350 000 agent locations spread over 200 countries and territories 

	A large portion of the world market remains underpenetrated  With the strategic introduction of money transfer in these markets  service providers should enjoy ample business opportunities 

	In addition  a continued shift toward electronic payments from paper based forms has created a dependence on plastic money or debit and credit cards  This has encouraged card processors to ramp up their growth profile  Visa Inc     and MasterCard Inc     are among the primes that are well placed to benefit from the tailwinds riding on their respective fundamental strengths

180981,402497,WU,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Western Union  MoneyGram International  SouFun Holdings And Everi Holdings,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 27  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Business Services  Part 3   including Western Union Company  NYSE WU      MoneyGram International Inc      SouFun Holdings Ltd    and Everi Holdings Inc      

	Industry  Business Services  Part 3 

	Link  

	Despite having its hands full of positives  the Business Services sector is nevertheless faced with a number of headwinds that tend to partially offset the positive impact of the catalysts mentioned in         The recent slowdown in the U S  jobs market and heightened uncertainty about the U K  and European economies following the Brexit surprise are some of the other clouds on the horizon for this sector 

Discussed below are some inherent challenges faced by the business service sector 

Continuous Spending on Research and Development    Importantly  consulting service providers need to stay abreast of the latest technologies through continuous spending on research and development  The performance of these providers can be hampered if they do not acclimatize to or adopt new services to cope with the latest developments 

Maintaining Skilled Workforce Involves High Costs   Since skilled workers are always in demand  there is a possibility of a high turnover rate in the sector  The training of unskilled workers or taking in new skilled workers increases operational costs  and thus affects margins  This space needs to have a more skilled workforce to take advantage of technology that develops at a rapid pace 

Competition   Maintaining or increasing market share remains challenging for business service providers  As discussed earlier  the main business of one company can be a business service for another  So target customers for both may at times be the same 

	Therefore  a business service provider is always required to be adequately equipped to win over customer demand  While larger providers bank on the broad variety of service offerings and can effectively take up difficult ventures  the relatively smaller players compete in an industry backed by specialized services 

Regulatory Hurdles   By virtue of having operations across the globe  service providers face regulatory hurdles and compliance related issues  Western Union     incurred compliance expense of about 3 6  of revenues in 2015 and expects the same to be about 3 5  to 4  in 2016 

	Moneygram International Inc     is being probed by a federal grand jury in relation to its consumer anti fraud and anti money laundering program matters for the period during 2003 to early 2009  among many other government investigations and litigations  Any reverse results from the investigation indicate a potential liability against damages  which could put pressure on margins and cash flows 

	Based on unfavorable Zacks Rank and negative earnings trend over the last four quarters  we prefer to avoid SouFun Holdings Ltd    and Everi Holdings Inc       Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and has four quarters of average negative surprise  Also  these stocks witnessed negative estimate revisions over the last few weeks 

To Conclude

	The dearth of skilled labor in the business services sector can affect its prospects  Non availability of quality workforce at a reasonable rate might increase overall operational costs 

	In addition  due to the highly fragmented nature of the industry  it is difficult to set a distinct trend or predict a concrete future for it

181001,402517,WU,The Telegraph Is Long Dead  And Western Union Did Not Notice,opinion,"The telegram has long ago seen its peak  Probably somewhere between the time of the pony express and then turn of the Century  The internet has done it in  But one of the classic telegram delivery companies  Western Union Company  N WU   has been able to weather that storm and continue on as a money transfer service  Now setting up inside Wal Mart Stores Inc  N WMT   it is doing just fine thank you 
And the stock is looking good as well  After a run higher the first 1 2 of the year  it started to pull back in June  That culminated a better than 78 6  retracement of the up move  But after consolidating the stock is now making a series of higher highs and higher lows 

Last week it pushed through resistance and over 19 30  It also briefly moved over the 200 day SMA for the first time since mid August Friday  Now pulling back toward the 100 day SMA  in a bull flag it is setting up for a good reward to risk trade  Watching for the support at 19 30 to hold and the price to reverse  it can then be used as a stop loss level to trade against for the upside  With over 14  short interest to act as fuel behind the rising momentum indicators it could be the start of a good run higher

181002,402518,WU,PayPal  PYPL   Western Union  WU  Double Performance of Broader Tech,opinion,"PayPal Markets Itself as New Money and Outperforms Anemic Tech Sector 
PayPal  NASDAQ PYPL  has certainly been playing it relatively cool since its split from eBay last year  They had a fantastic advertising campaign for the SuperBowl that branded them as the critical component to  new money   which is a great play on the same term used to describe self made wealthy individuals  even if they are sometime known to be flashy and smug  So far PayPal s  PYPL  share price is up 8  this year  hovering around  38 98 with a market cap of  47 68B 
Smart Acquisitions and New Currencies
In a  and is currently down more than 5  since the start of the year  an 8  gain in a tech stock looks incredibly healthy  Part of PayPal s  PYPL  magic  as I discussed previously  was in their acquisitions of both Braintree and Venmo  This has insulated them from the liability involved with offering virtually free money transfers on mobile platforms  and Braintree has a gigantic reach into merchant transaction processing  even pushing the boundaries by opening up their terminals to support Bitcoin  if merchants choose to enable the feature 
Western Union  WU  Inks International Deal
Another financial services tech company that gets taken for granted is Western Union  NYSE WU     Western Union  WU  has invested heavily in taking their traditional business  centered around local independent agents  and moved it online  They ve even been competing with PayPal in the prepaid debit card space  offering customers the ability to spend the funds transferred to them automatically  as soon as the transfer clears  Their strength is the physical presence they have internationally  something PayPal noticeably lacks in their online business model 
Western Union has also rapidly expanded their international logistics  recently inking a very well received deal with Thomas Cook India  NS THOM  and DCB Bank  Business intelligence shows us that interfacing with outside partners around the globe while strengthening in house assets is the key to strong global growth 
PayPal  PYPL   Skrill  Privately Held   and Interac  Privately Held  Among Favorite Transaction Servicing Providers in Canada 
To be fair  PayPal also has a strong international presence  They ve added 100 jobs at their campus in Dublin  and they ve been recognized as one of the preferred Canadian online casino banking methods  The online casino business is booming  and its growth in Canada has necessitated new universal payment servicing for both physical and virtual gaming  Interac is one of the largest players in Canada  providing debit cards to most Canadian citizens through a partnership with 5 major banking institutions  forming a near monopoly on debit card issuing and processing  Skrill  privately held  recently acquired uKash  another major player in online transaction processing throughout Europe 
For PayPal and Western Union  achieving market penetration in international banking systems is crucial to their long term growth  Their strong  steady performance has been rewarded in the markets  as other tech stocks falter ",2016-03-08,Faizan Raza,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/paypal-(pypl),-western-union-(wu)-double-performance-of-broader-tech-200120812",200120812
181003,402519,WU,MasterCard  MA  Vs  Western Union  WU   Which Stock Is Better ,opinion,"The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is one of the top sectors in the Zacks Industry Rank  Of the 265 different sectors  the Financial Transaction Services is ranked 20th  which is in the top 8  of the Zacks Industry Rank 
Two of the most recognizable names in this sector are MasterCard Inc   MA  and The Western Union Company  NYSE WU   Both companies have a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   With that in mind  let s take a deeper look at some key company metrics to determine which one is potentially the better investment to add to your portfolio 
Earnings
Over the past four earnings quarters  MasterCard outperformed our estimate three times  whereas Western Union outperformed four times  It should be noted that the one time MasterCard did not outperform the estimate  it actually met the estimate figure 
Starting with the second quarter of fiscal 2015  MasterCard surprise percentages for outperforming our estimate were 0   3 41   16 18   and 1 18   respectively  Starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2015  Western Union s surprise percentages were 2 63   5 13   2 27   and 2 44   respectively  Western Union is set to report its fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings report on May 3rd 
Earnings revisions for the companies  fiscal 2016 second quarter and for the fiscal 2016 year are more promising for MasterCard compared to Western Union  MasterCard has a total of four positive earnings revisions for the upcoming quarter   two each that have been revised in the past thirty and sixty days   and another nine positive earnings revisions for the fiscal year 
Western Union has had two total earnings revisions with both of them being positive  one each in the past thirty and ninety days  Regarding earnings revisions for the fiscal 2016 year  Western Union has had three positive ones  two in the past sixty days and one in the past thirty days 
 Growth
Both MasterCard and Western Union have not had exceptional figures for EPS   sales growth  MasterCard had earnings losses versus the previous quarter of 13 19  and gains versus the previous year of 9 72   The credit card financers also had sales losses versus the previous quarter of 0 51  and marginal gains versus the previous year of 4 18  
Western Union s EPS   sales growth figures were not better than MasterCard s  in that Western Union did have any positive figures in these categories  Western Union had earnings losses versus the previous quarter of 6 67  and 0  versus the previous year  The money wirers had sales losses versus the previous quarter of 1 37  and losses versus the previous year of 2 12  
Value
Of the two companies  Western Union has the better PE ratio  12 24  compared to MasterCard s 27 48  The companies  return on equity  ROE  and return on asset  ROA  figures are also not very impressive  MasterCard s ROE quarter to quarter change is 4 48  and its ROA quarter over quarter change is  0 15   Western Union s ROE quarter over quarter change is  2 97  and its ROA quarter over quarter figure remained the same 
Final Thoughts  
MasterCard did report a solid   which does somewhat help with the decision between it and Western Union  Of the two competitors in this latest versus installment  the victor is MasterCard by a hair  The difference in each companies  key metrics are quite marginal  so much of your final decision will come to personal preference

181016,402532,WU,Here s How To Look At  Bitcoin,opinion,"Tuesday afternoon Marc Andreessen   pmarca  tweeted  My actual quote   Track record of old white men who don t understand tech crapping on tech they don t understand still at 100    The clarification came after the Andreessen Horowitz founder s comments at bitcoin conference  CoinSummit  set off a financial media firestorm  Andreessen s controversial reply came as he was asked to respond to legendary investor Warren Buffett calling the cryptocurrency a  mirage   As Andreessen later made clear on Twitter  the point of the comment was not to disparage Buffett  but while everyone is entitled to their own opinions  people shouldn t make bold claims as an expert in areas outside their own realm of understanding  To drive the point home Andreessen ended his barrage of tweets with the quote   I myself know nothing about railroads  Correspondingly have no view on them   And not many people know all that much about bitcoin  but everyone seems to have their own opinion on it  Since not everyone has a grasp of the technology behind bitcoin  not everyone yet understands what it s capable of The Issue Of fees
One of the defining features of bitcoin  in addition to the fact that its digital and pseudonymous  is that transaction fees are very low  Its extremely easy for someone to transfer bitcoin to another party and costs are nonexistent  While everyone  not just the technologically inclined and brave early adopters of bitcoin  would love to transfer money through Automated Clearing Houses  ACH  at no cost  few actually have the stomach to hold bitcoins because of the fear associated with the cryptocurrency s volatility and currency risk  That s why they there is a massive need for more apps and services to be built on top of the underlying the bitcoin protocol and why Andreessen is betting big as a bitcoin venture capitalist Think of the bitcoin protocol like the internet  It s just another way to transfer information  The internet doesn t let you search for things  that s Google s job  The internet doesn t let you buy music on iTunes either  Apple does  In order for bitcoin to achieve mainstream success  useful apps and services will need to be built on top of the underlying bitcoin protocol just as apps and services have been built on top of the internet protocol A Bitcoin ACH
One of the most logical places to start would be to have an ACH that transfers large amounts of funds using bitcoin between two parties willing to identify themselves to the ACH and make a real time transfer with US Dollars  Through this type of service it s possible that two parties could transfer tens of thousands of dollars for only pennies and never need to get their hands dirty with the nuts and bolts of actually using the bitcoin protocol themselves  What would have to happen is that a bank  or highly regulated financial institution creates bitcoin wallets for both parties  immediately converts cash from party A into bitcoin then automatically and instantly sends the bitcoin from party A to party B  and finally instantly exchanges the bitcoin back to cash for party B  This way the transferer can send dollars to a receiver who can also accept dollars  Only the ACH needs to touch the bitcoins  and money can be transferred at a very low cost  Only 3 obstacles stand in the way of a this type of service going bitcoin mainstream The first is that someone needs to the build the app to automatically create public wallets for both parties  exchange dollars and bitcoins  and move the coins from party A to party B  
The second challenge is that a trustable and regulated financial services company would need to get involved and store a large supply of bitcoins to make the transfers possible in an instant  To avoid liquidity problems the company would need to hold about 2 times the largest allowed transfer worth of bitcoins  Maybe that means they hold  2million of bitcoin and cap individuals to transferring a maximum of  1 million once per minute each 
Hedging Risk
The final and perhaps most daunting barrier is that the transfer company will need to find a way to mitigate or hedge the currency risk of holding all the bitcoins  No one wants to take on a couple million of dollars of currency risk for only a few cents on every transaction  But it seems obvious that  30 wire transfers will soon be a thing of the past  Check out the Western Union Company  NYSE WU  EPS graph  this thing could wipe them off the map ",2014-03-26,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here’s-how-to-look-at--bitcoin-207496,207496

181036,402552,WU,Has The Labor Market Hit A Wall    Again ,opinion,Weekly claims for new unemployment benefits are in a holding pattern these days  But holding for what  For the third straight week  new claims hovered at just under 390 000 on a seasonally adjusted basis last week  the Labor Department  That s the highest since January and it s a sign that recent revival in the labor market has slowed  That was certainly the case with the  which reflected a sharp slowdown in jobs creation  The modest rise in jobless claims in recent weeks implies that there may be more to the new sluggishness in the labor market than one drab month for payrolls But if the recent rise in jobless claims is worrisome and it is there s still room for debate about what it means on a broader scale for the weeks and months ahead  Even with last week s seasonally adjusted 388 000 tally  new claims are still near the lowest levels in nearly four years  As the chart above reminds  weekly filings have been falling fairly persistently for most of the past year  A few weeks of modestly elevated numbers doesn t erase this progress  but the question is turning to whether the progress has hit a wall  It s just so hard for companies to be confident and start hiring   Yelena Shulyatyeva  an economist at BNP Paribas in New York  tells Bloomberg   We believe that March is probably not the end of the modest readings on payrolls  It s surely troubling that the year over year momentum has faded recently  The annual percentage change for the raw  unadjusted jobless claims numbers has moved dangerously close to zero in the last two weeks  That s a signal that something has changed  if only on the margins  Two weeks falls well short of definitive proof that the game is over  but a few more numbers like this and it ll be time for a sober reassessment of the labor market s prospects for continued growth  Meantime  there s a growing collection of troubling signs elsewhere on the macro landscape  starting with today s  of the Chicago Fed National Activity Index   All four broad categories of indicators that make up the index deteriorated from February  with the production and income and personal consumption and housing categories both making a negative contribution to the index in March   advises the accompanying press release    The retreat only feeds the anxiety after yesterday s  The ongoing  in personal disposable income growth and the recent  in industrial production aren t cheering anyone either    On the bright side  consumers continue to spend at a brisk pace  based on the  for retail sales  But Joe Sixpack may not be reading the economic reports as closely as yours truly  Eventually  however  the word will drip out    What s beyond debate is that a strong labor market is the critical factor  particularly now  It s premature to assume the worst  but unless there s convincing evidence to the contrary soon it s going to be increasingly difficult to think optimistically  Once again  for the third year in a row  spring has left us betwixt and between     This was a disappointing number and offers more evidence that the labor market continues to lose traction    Joe Manimbo  an analyst at Western Union Business Solutions via Reuters    The priority now is looking for economic news that refutes the recent gloom surrounding the latest batch of numbers  The next opportunity for at least partial statistical redemption arrives tomorrow  with the government s first guess at first quarter GDP  Alas  the consensus forecast sees only a 2 5  gain for the U S  economy in the opening three months of 2012   or down from 3 0  in last year s Q4 ,2012-04-27,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/has-the-labor-market-hit-a-wall...-again-121449,121449
181037,402553,WU,Forget QE3  America Needs A Real Road And Job Stimulus ,opinion,How is the condition of roads that you drive On  Well  the roads that I drive on are so bad that they require a large truck or SUV to navigate at anything close to normal speeds  The potholes are alignment killers  and the horrible patches were slapped on so poorly that they become uneven speed bumps  And I reside in one of the top 5 largest cities in the U S  with a lot of petro money that has done much better than most of other cities  e g   the newly bankrupt Stockton  CA  during the financial downturn in the economy  It gets better yet  I m talking about the better part of town instead of the lower revenue districts  So the question is how did we get to this state  And what are the likely solutions   I think a lot of City  County and State revenue which ought to be going towards upkeep and proper maintenance of the roads is being diverted to other areas of government  i e   administrative and higher than market salaries of government employees  Include benefit calculations into this equation   In short  big government spending is out of control  and it is so bad  that revenue which is supposed to go towards basic services like quality roads to drive on is being circumvented by other factions of big government which should be further down the line on the need food chain   This fact really points out what a disaster the first  900 Billion stimulus was  and how if we cannot get these roads fixed when that money was on the table  when will we ever be able to drive on quality roads again like in the 1950 and 1960 s  It literally has been that long since some of this infrastructure was originally built  and is long overdue for a full replacement cycle of CAP EX spend  and not more ad hoc patch jobs   One solution is to do another round of stimulus  this one dedicated strictly to mainstream road and infrastructure projects like bridges and basic utilities  This means 100  infrastructure spend  not 5  like the last stimulus with the majority of the rest going to either special interest or pork barrel projects  This will be expensive  in the Trillion dollar range  but yes the roads are that bad  However  with the economy lacking any true growth prospects  and the ad on effects of true job creation  which a legitimate infrastructure package brings  this expense can in part be paid for with increased tax revenue reaped from a healthier economy   But there is a caveat  and a large one  these jobs need to be for existing American citizens  These jobs cannot be offshored or outsourced  As the current projects are outsourced to private firms  who then maximize profits  and sacrifice quality of product by hiring illegal immigrants to do the bulk of the physical labor  The country doesn t reap the entire benefits if the existing model of road construction outsourcing of these jobs ultimately just sends a substantial sum of this money out of the country via Western Union  the figures over the last decade have been staggering to say the least    The other solution is for governments to slim down and cut the wasted bureaucracy  so that funds which should be going towards maintaining quality roads are actually used for this purpose  This probably would only occur if the voting public starts demanding better roads  to the point where it actually becomes a campaign issue that politicians have to make public stances on  and be voted out of office for not delivering upon said objective   Unfortunately  I don t think voters really care about this issue  and would rather have their local pork barrel spending projects  and just drive heavy duty SUV s to traverse the roads  Compare our roads with German roads and you can visualize the quality of product produced  and commitment to infrastructural needs in this country   By the look of our roads you would never guess we are a first rate Super Power in terms of Capitalistic revenue generation  Again traversing roads that seem like roads in some third world countries  I have to ask where is all the money going  And whoever decided this wasn t a high priority for the last stimulus package needs to be voted out of office for dereliction of duty ,2012-06-28,EconMatters,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/forget-qe3,-america-needs-a-real-road-and-job-stimulus-127903",127903
