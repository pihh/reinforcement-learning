2  Jobless Claims  Fed Speakers in Spotlight
The U S  economic calendar is somewhat light for Thursday  with jobless claims and a handful of Fed speakers due 
At 8 30 AM ET  the Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Nov  2 
Economists forecast that initial jobless claims fell to 215 000 from 218 000 previously 
On the monetary policy front  speeches from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan at 11 05 AM ET  16 05 GMT  and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic at 12 10 PM ET  17 10 GMT  will also be watched for further insight into the Federal Reserve s thinking 
Fed chairman Jerome Powell last week hinted that rates would remain low for as long as the outlook on economy stays the same and inflation continues to undershoot the central bank s 2  target 
On Wednesday  Chicago Fed president Charles Evans also raised expectations that the Fed is ready to stand pat on rates  saying that the fed funds rates is close to neutral   one that neither stimulates nor stifles economic growth 
3  Sterling on Watch as Bank of England Rate Decision Due
The Bank of England will deliver its interest rate decision at 7AM ET  12PM GMT   with many expecting the United Kingdom s central bank to keep rates steady amid Brexit and political uncertainty 
The Bank of England is expected to leave its benchmark  base rate at 0 75   The rate has been at that level since August 2018 
The focus then  will shift to the central bank s growth and inflation forecasts  both of which are at risk of getting trimmed  potentially strengthening the case for a rate cut next year   
Traders will also keep an eye on BoE governor Mark Carney  s press conference for further clues on monetary policy 
With a no deal scenario averted  for the moment at least  the pound has been one of the outperforming currencies in recent months  but further upside is limited   
 We don t expect any further significant unwinding in sterling s Brexit discount as all options remain open with regard to how Brexit is resolved    ranging from no deal to Brexit cancelled  depending on the results of the December 12 general election and any referendum after the election   Action Economics said ",2019-11-06,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-2013795,2013795

120363,341878,TTWO,Take Two s  Grand Theft Auto  Is Still Putting Up Incredible Performance  What s Next For Investors ,news,"Take Two Interactive  NASDAQ TTWO  has hit the jackpot with its latest casino focused expansion for Grand Theft Auto V s  GTA V  online mode  The game s multiplayer mode had its best ever monthly player count in December  an incredible feat given that the game has now been on the market for over six years  
Most video game sales are front loaded  meaning they put up the majority of their sales within the first few months after release and then see relatively quick declines  That s changed somewhat over the last decade  as developers have aimed to move games closer to a services type model and put heavy emphasis on online multiplayer and downloadable content expansions  but it still holds true  Grand Theft Auto V is the extreme outlier  and continued sales for the base game and strong player spending on its multiplayer mode have helped Take Two post stellar stock performance 
The company s shares are up roughly 650  since GTA V s release  What comes next 

A good problem to have
Grand Theft Auto V first released on Microsoft s Xbox 360 and Sony s PlayStation 3 in September 2013  The game broke records upon release  managed to ship more than 34 million units less than a year after its release  and its incredible run was just getting started  Take Two released an updated version of the game featuring better graphics and other improvements for the more advanced Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles in November 2014 and then brought the game to PC in April 2015 
This staggered release schedule proved enormously successful  and the level of attention to detail and generally high quality in the core game combined with well timed updates for the title s much loved online multiplayer propelled Grand Theft Auto V to incredible performance  GTA V not only came in as the best selling game of the last decade  it s also the best selling game of all time and the single most profitable entertainment release in history  according to some calculations  It came in as 2019 s 11th best selling game overall in the U S   and record setting engagement for the game s online mode in December proves the title still has plenty of life in it  
With GTA V s online mode still putting up such tremendous results  Take Two actually has a bit of a predicament on its hands  As I detailed in an article published in December  the publisher has an incentive to replicate the release schedule that helped turn Grand Theft Auto V into a record shattering sales success  However  the company may be hesitant to debut a sequel while the most recent series installment is still breaking records  
GTA V s online mode is hugely profitable because it s much cheaper for developers to add new content to the existing game world then build an entirely new title  Take Two would likely prefer to avoid crimping that cash stream prematurely  
Killing the golden goose 
As a Take Two shareholder  my hope is that the new Grand Theft Auto installment is on the near horizon and will debut only on Sony and Microsoft s current console hardware before eventually getting an updated release on next gen platforms  Grand Theft Auto V and its online mode have had tremendous runs  and while the game is still putting up great performance  there s a unique window of opportunity to repeat GTA V s release timing success that could prove very rewarding for the company and its shareholders 
New consoles from Sony and Microsoft are set to launch near the end of 2020  Take Two Interactive could release its next Grand Theft Auto game for each company s current gen hardware platform and wait roughly a year before launching an improved  next gen version of GTA VI for the new console platforms and PC  This would allow the company to take advantage of the large combined user base of the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One  which will have been on the market for roughly six years and amassed a combined installed base north of 150 million 
Take Two could conceivably sell more than 40 million units of the next Grand Theft Auto between just the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms across the game s first year on the market  Using this strategy would also allow Take Two to start with a large addressable market for GTA VI s online mode instead of having to wait for the user bases of the next generation PlayStation and Xbox consoles to scale up  The company could then capture repeat sales from players who want to experience the upgraded version of the game on next generation consoles and PC 
It s virtually certain that the next GTA game will be a huge hit  The franchise s developer has a fantastic history of quality releases  and no gaming franchise in the current industry has bigger brand clout  However  for Take Two and its shareholders  there is the question of timing  
What s Take Two s outlook outside of GTA 
Grand Theft Auto remains the single most important property for Take Two  but the company has done an admirable job of filling out its franchise catalog  The company reported that the online mode for its Western action game Red Dead Redemption 2 tallied record engagement in December  and its NBA 2K basketball franchise has been putting up phenomenal unit sales and online spending 
Recent hits like The Outer Worlds and Borderlands 3 have also been a boon for Take Two  and an upcoming game in the company s critically acclaimed Bioshock series gives the publisher another title on the horizon with triple A potential  In addition to its console and PC offerings  Take Two has also been ramping up its development for mobile and has big room for expansion in the space  
So  while the company s next moves for the Grand Theft Auto franchise will likely be the biggest factor in its performance over the next five years  it s also fair to say that the business has never looked stronger as a whole ",2020-02-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pq3ut,2073942
120364,341879,TTWO,Take Two s  Cheat Code  for the Video Game Business,news,"Companies operating in hit driven industries like big budget movies and video games are difficult to manage from a business perspective  A big hit or lack of one can make or break an entertainment company s entire fiscal year  Movie studios have tried to solve this problem through diversification  Release dozens of movies each year and hope that a few land 
A spray and pray model may work for some game developers as well  but for Take Two Interactive  NASDAQ TTWO   its approach has been to develop other streams of monetization for its existing releases    effectively a  cheat code   gamer jargon for a character chain that changes a game s behavior  for its business model 

Recurrent spending has taken off for Take Two
Before gaming platforms connected to the internet  game developers generated all their revenue when people purchased their titles at the retail store  Microsoft s Xbox online store and Sony s PlayStation Network created online environments where publishers could connect directly to the gamer and sell additional services online 
With an online connection  publishers can now not only sell games as direct downloads  skipping the retail store  but also sell additional content for purchased games  For example  a game maker can sell additional levels  new characters  or gameplay modes for direct download online 
Take Two refers to this add on content as recurrent spending  and the company has seen it take off over the past five years  Sales from recurrent spending have risen to over  1 billion per year and now represent 40  of total company revenue 

Data source  Take Two Interactive 
Recurrent spending has a few benefits from a business standpoint  Because it is less onerous to create an expansion pack to an existing game versus developing an entirely new game  publishers can release game add ons at a greater frequency  This helps stabilize a publisher s earnings between game releases  Recurrent revenue also tends to be higher margin because it requires less resources to develop  
And recurrent revenue can help create a more engaged fan base because it encourages gamers to play a game long after it is released  Engaged fans are more likely to buy a game s sequels and be interested in related activities like esports 
Grand Theft Auto Online
You can t discuss Take Two s business model without discussing its massive success with Grand Theft Auto Online 
The most recent installment of the game  Grand Theft Auto V  was released in 2013  yet it remains a large contributor to Take Two s financial results due to healthy recurrent in game spending  In fiscal 2019  Grand Theft Auto  GTA  generated  685 million in revenue    not bad for a 6 year old game  
The company s secret to maintaining GTA s relevancy and earnings potential has been a steady drip of new content  GTA s game studio has released new downloadable content for the game every year since its release  
For 2019  the Diamond Casino   Resort update was released  This featured the opening of a casino in the Grand Theft Auto Online world  which enabled players to wager on casino games such as roulette and on horse racing  purchase new clothes for their character  and buy a high end penthouse  The update also features a casino heist level where groups of players work together online to rob a casino  similar to something out of the movie Ocean s 11 
The game s latest update was very popular and helped deliver those strong results for fiscal 2019 
The future of gaming
The video game development business is a tough one within the tech industry  Games are expensive to make and require years of planning  development  marketing  and support  The complexity of games is only increasing as players demand more content and features 
Take Two s strategy of pushing recurrent revenue feels like an effective cheat code  Adding on content post release of a popular game is a convenient way to extend the game s life while the company buys time to make the next release even better 
Perhaps this means that entire new games will be released less frequently  Fans appear to be fine with that as long as they are still having fun with the current crop of games ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqwy4,2075471

120370,341885,TTWO,Earnings Preview  Take Two Interactive  TTWO  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Take Two Interactive  NASDAQ TTWO  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This publisher of  Grand Theft Auto  and other video games is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  57 3  
Revenues are expected to be  917 70 million  down 41 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 47  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Take Two 
For Take Two  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 41  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Take Two will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Take Two would post earnings of  1 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 89  delivering a surprise of  13 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Take Two doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-taketwo-interactive-ttwo-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200503292,200503292

120524,342039,TTWO,Analysts Estimate Take Two Interactive  TTWO  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Take Two Interactive  NASDAQ TTWO  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This publisher of  Grand Theft Auto  and other video games is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 03 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  84 2  
Revenues are expected to be  354 47 million  up 22 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 3  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Take Two 
For Take Two  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  100  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Take Two will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Take Two would post earnings of  0 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 86  delivering a surprise of  11 69  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Take Two doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-taketwo-interactive-ttwo-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200446513,200446513

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 700   A quarter ago  it was expected that this publisher of  Grand Theft Auto  and other video games would post earnings of  0 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 86  delivering a surprise of 11 69

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Take Two shares have added about 18 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17  
What s Next for Take Two 
While Take Two has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Take Two was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 71 on  863 57 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 37 on  2 65 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

120539,342054,TTWO,3 Things Under the Radar This Week,news,"Investing com   Here s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week 
1  Home Improvement Sector in a Fix
There s about a month to go until home improvement titans  Home Depot   NYSE HD  and Lowe s  NYSE LOW  deliver results  but data this week may have given investors a reason to shun the stocks before their numbers hit the tape 
To start  there s Stanley Black   Decker s  NYSE SWK  lackluster fourth quarter results and full year guidance 
The toolmaker said its full year revenue would fall short of analysts  estimates  blaming weaknesses in the auto and residential construction sectors 
The ominous outlook from Stanley hit shares of Lowe s and Home Depot  as the toolmaker s report is used as a proxy for the underlying health of the housing sector 
Whatever optimism may have remained in the wake Stanley s dour report was hammered hours later  The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell to their lowest level in more than three years 
Loop Capital analyst Laura Champine downgraded Lowe s to hold earlier this week and lowered her price target for the shares to  99 from  125 on expectations for industry demand to moderate this year 
Champine said Lowe s will need to ramp up promotional activity to achieve expectations for 3  sales growth  but this could also compress margins at a time when input costs continue to rise owing to labor shortages and the U S  China trade dispute 
2  Gender Pay Gap Barely Budges
The gender pay gap remained around 20  in the latest quarter  showing no appreciable change since 2010  leaving public companies with plenty of work to do in addressing the issue 
Women earned 80 3  of what men earned in the fourth quarter of 2018  the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported  Women earned a seasonally adjusted median weekly salary of  796  compared with  991 for men 
In constant 1982 1984 dollars  women earned about 80 4  of what men took home 
The gap is slightly wider than the third quarter  where women earned 80 9  of what men did 
Going back to the start of the decade  the gap is just slightly down from the first quarter of 2010  when women earned 79 2  that of what men earned 
Pressure will continue on companies to give opportunities to women in higher paying positions  as well as ensuring equal pay for equal work  The banking sector in particular is in the spotlight for its disparity in wages 
Last week  Citigroup   NYSE C  revealed its gender pay gap is at 29  for women  well above the U S  average 
 We know we need a comprehensive approach to our diversity initiatives to make the progress we want to see   Citi Global Head of Human Resources Sarah Wechter wrote  
 We should obviously be at 100  parity  and that s what we re striving for   Wechter said  according to Bloomberg 
Earlier this month HSBC announced its pay gap widened to a whopping 61  from 59  the year ago  as it remained the major bank with the biggest gender pay disparity 
3  Getting Granular on Video Games
Investors seemingly hit pause on video game stocks this week  Take Two  NASDAQ TTWO  and Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  slipped to a weekly defeat  while Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  snapped its four week winning streak 
But for those watching carefully  data showed there s still plenty left to play for  The hours of button smashing keep piling up and video game spending has never looked this good 
Video game revenue reached a new high in the U S  last year  jumping 18  to  43 4 billion from a year ago  according to the Entertainment Software Association  ESA  and The NPD Group 
Revenue has been bolstered by a recent wave of smash hit games 
 Red Dead Redemption 2  was red hot as it notched record sales in the U S  last year  And Activision s latest addition to the Call of Duty Franchise   Black Ops 4   was No  2 on the best seller list 
On the periphery  Logitech s  NASDAQ LOGI  results also cut short any notion that we re approaching game over  While many know Logitech for its computer mice  its gaming accessories make up a quarter of the total revenue  And sales from its gaming divisions soared 23  in its fiscal third quarter 
 Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  also delivered its maiden verdict on the big three video game stocks  It wasn t buy  buy  buy  But it was mostly positive 
Deutsche liked Take Two the best  initiating coverage with a buy rating and  130 price target on the stock  Take Two should outpace its rivals  supported by possible blockbuster releases over the next three years  including Bioshock and Grand Theft Auto 6  Briefing com reported 
Electronic Arts received a hold rating and a  100 price target  Deutsche said strength included the company s sports video game franchises  but did express concerns about other game titles like Star Wars 
Deutsche Bank rated Activision a hold with a price target of  54  highlighting many transitions the company is going through 
As it stands  video gaming stocks remain in vogue  so is this week s slip a sign of more red to come or does redemption beckon ",2019-01-26,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3-things-under-the-radar-this-week-1758397,1758397

120602,342117,TTWO,Will Take Two  TTWO  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Take Two Interactive  NASDAQ TTWO   which belongs to the Zacks Toys   Games   Hobbies industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this publisher of  Grand Theft Auto  and other video games has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 31 33   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Take Two came out with earnings of  4 05 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 75 per share  representing a surprise of 47 27   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 91 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 05 per share  delivering a surprise of 15 38  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Take Two lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Take Two currently has an Earnings ESP of  7 94   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on May 13  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

120606,342121,TTWO,Take Two Interactive  TTWO  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Take Two Interactive  NASDAQ TTWO  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 13  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This publisher of  Grand Theft Auto  and other video games is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 78 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13  
Revenues are expected to be  506 98 million  up 23 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11 36  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Take Two 
For Take Two  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 73  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Take Two will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Take Two would post earnings of  2 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 05  delivering a surprise of  47 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Take Two appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/taketwo-interactive-ttwo-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200417360,200417360

Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for TTWO  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability

120640,342155,TTWO,Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Wednesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  May 16 
1  Macy s Quarterly Report In Focus
Macy s  NYSE M  is one of the last notable names slated to report fiscal first quarter results before U S  markets open Wednesday  as the earnings season continues to wind down 
The retailer is expected to report earnings of 40 cents per share on revenue of  5 42 billion  according to estimates 
Investors will likely be particularly interested to hear how adverse winter weather across much of the U S  in the first three months of the year affected same store sales 
Market players will also be closely watching Macy s comments regarding its real estate portfolio 
Shares of Macy s were trading 0 5  lower in premarket  The stock is up 13 1  for the last three months  and up 18 8  for the year to date 
Other headliners expected out today include  Take Two Interactive   NASDAQ TTWO   Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   and Jack In The Box  NASDAQ JACK  
2  U S  Housing Data  Fed Speakers On Tap
Market players will focus on U S  housing sector data to gauge the strength of the world s largest economy and how it will impact monetary policy in the months ahead 
The Commerce Department at 8 30AM ET is expected to report building permits fell 2 3  from a month earlier to 1 347 million units  while housing starts are forecast to fall 0 7  to 1 310 million units 
Wednesday s calendar also features industrial production data at 9 15AM ET 
On the central bank front  a speech by Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic at 8 30AM ET is also likely to warrant attention as investors seek an insight into Fed s thinking on monetary policy 
Fed official James Bullard rounds off the day with a speech at 6 30PM ET 
Data on retail sales for April released Tuesday broadly met expectations while prior months  results were revised higher  indicating U S  consumer spending will likely bounce back in the second quarter after a tepid start to the year 
3  Dollar Firms Near 5 Month Highs  10 Year Yield At 3 06 
The dollar held firm near the prior day s five month high  as U S  Treasury yields remained near their recent peaks 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was last at 93 25  a shade higher on the day  It climbed to the highest since mid December at 93 35 on Tuesday 
Meanwhile  the U S  10 year Treasury yield stood at around 3 06  in early action  after surging to a seven year peak of 3 095  in the last session 
The Fed sensitive 2 year yield was at 2 58   not far from its highest level since August 2008 
The recent bounce in the dollar and yields came as strengthening inflation prospects added to expectations of a more hawkish approach from the Federal Reserve this year 
Investors have fully priced in a rate rise at the Fed s next policy meeting on June 12 13  However  Wall Street is divided over how many more times the central bank will raise interest rates after that  with some expecting two more hikes  while others are forecasting three more 
4  Dow Futures Point To A Quiet Start
U S  stock futures were little changed  indicating the Dow could struggle to rebound from its 200 point decline on Tuesday 
The blue chip Dow futures shed 22 points  or about 0 1   the S P 500 futures declined 2 points  or nearly 0 1   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a drop of 5 points  or roughly 0 1  
U S  stocks fell sharply on Tuesday  with the Dow posting its first loss in eight sessions after  Home Depot   NYSE HD  reported quarterly sales that fell short of Wall Street s expectations and interest rates breached new highs 
Elsewhere  in Europe  the continent s major bourses inched lower in mid morning trade  as investors continued to focus on Italian politics 
Earlier  in Asia  markets in the region closed in negative territory  as geopolitics returned to the forefront after Pyongyang abruptly called off talks with Seoul  throwing a U S  North Korean summit into doubt 
5  Oil Slips Ahead Of EIA Supply Report
The U S  Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended May 11 at 10 30AM ET  1430GMT   amid forecasts for an oil stock drop of 763 000 barrels 
Analysts also forecast a fall of 1 4 million barrels for gasoline stockpiles  while distillate inventories are expected to drop by 2 1 million barrels 
After markets closed Tuesday  the American Petroleum Institute said that U S  oil inventories climbed by nearly 4 9 million barrels last week 
New York traded WTI crude futures shed 25 cents to  71 05 per barrel  while Brent futures declined 37 cents  78 06 per barrel 
Despite the dips  both oil benchmarks remained close to their November 2014 highs of  71 92 and  79 47 a barrel respectively  reached the previous day  amid concerns that U S  sanctions on Iran may restrict crude exports from a major producer ",2018-05-16,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-wednesday-1449407,1449407

quarter financial results last week  Despite top and bottom line beats and impressive sales from its newest video game offering  Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  stoked fears that free to play power Fortnite is set to harm the paid gaming industry  Take Two s downturn might  however  set up a solid buying opportunity Recent News Take Two crushed top and bottom line Wall Street estimates last Wednesday and its highly anticipated sequel to Red Dead Redemption has sold 23 million units since its October 26 launch to blow past Electronic Arts  Battlefield V s just over 7 million copies  Overall  Red Dead Redemption 2  NBA 2K19  Grand Theft Auto Online  and a few other titles helped Take Two s net bookings soar 140  from the year ago quarter to reach  1 569 billion Still  shares of TTWO have plummeted roughly 13  since last Tuesday as investors grow worried about the possibility of Fortnite grabbing more mark share  Electronic Arts  disappointing results  which came out a day before Take Two  seemed to cause much of the recent industry downturn Electronic Arts said that it faced  significant challenges  during the quarter and expects them to continue in the current period  EA CEO Andrew Wilson mentioned  on his company s earnings call  but never directly mentioned Fortnite   This year  battle royale modes became incredibly popular in shooter games   Wilson said Stock Price Movement As we touched on briefly already  shares of TTWO have suffered over the last week as Wall Street assess what s next for the industry amid increased competition from the free to play

Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  and some of the firms we have already mentioned  during the last five years  Overall  TTWO shares rest roughly 33  below their 52 week high of  139 91 a share Outlook Take Two will have to address concerns about Fortnite  which is owned by privately held Epic Games  But we should remember that nothing last forever  and the Fortnite fad  which has exploded over the last year  could fizzle out just as quickly as it started   We continue to have stellar results despite the fact that there are competitive titles in the market  including Fortnite   CEO Strauss Zelnick said on Take Two s earnings call  And just by a way of example just to look at the last fiscal year  we had record results for Grand Theft Auto  we had record results for Grand Theft Auto Online and Fortnite was booming  So  there is room for plenty of hits in the marketplace  We ve just had stellar third quarter  Take Two also raised its full year adjusted revenue forecast to between  2 89 billion and  2 94 billion  which did come in below Wall Street estimates of  2 98 billion  Looking ahead to the company s fiscal fourth quarter  revenues are projected to surge 29 2  from the year ago period to

Take Two s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to soar 52 2  to reach  1 05 a share  Meanwhile  the firm s first quarter 2020 EPS figure is expected to skyrocket over 268  Investors should note that the company s earnings picture has turned more negative for the current quarter and Q1 recently  But the company s full year 2019 and 2020 earnings picture has turned more positive over the last

Zacks Earnings Estimates  This marks a discount to Take Two s one year high of 43 9X and its 52 week median of 30 1X and means the stock presents solid value at the moment  Las Vegas Sands Corp stock has climbed 4  since it reported its Q4 and fiscal 2018 financial results on January 23  Despite the casino and resort firm s post earnings jump  shares of LVS have fallen 17  in the last year as Wall Street s concerns about the broader industry heat up Overview Las Vegas Sands owns The Venetian and The Palazzo resorts in Las Vegas  along with a property in Singapore and multiple properties on the Cotai Strip in Macau  The company has continued to invest in all of its markets and has remained positive about its opportunities in Macau  Las Vegas Sands executives said the firm is moving forward with investments in the many of their operations in Macau In Macau  like in Las Vegas  the firm also operates retail businesses and entertainment attractions  which LVS thinks will help it grow in Macau for years to come  But Las Vegas Sands is set to face a possible slowdown in Macau as the broader Chinese economy suffers  Many industry  the southern Chinese territory  which is currently the world s largest gambling region  to see revenues fall slightly in 2019 after two years of double digit growth Even the smallest downturn in Macau could hurt casino operators since the region pulled in  37 billion in 2018 against  6 6 billion in Las Vegas  More specially  the region s high rollers  which account for nearly half of global gambling revenues  might decrease their spending  But Las Vegas Sands  portfolio of properties in the area are said to be better positioned than others as they also accommodate more casual gamblers Stock Price Movement As we touched on at the top  shares of LVS are down roughly 17  over the last 12 months  which falls below its peer group s which includes MGM Resorts  MGM   Caesars Entertainment  CRV   Wynn Resorts  WYNN   Melco  MLCO   and others roughly 15  average decline  The S P 500 has climbed approximately 2  during this stretch We can also see that LVS stock has lagged its industry over the last five years  Las Vegas Sands shares closed regular trading up 1 00  to  59 60 a share Monday  which marked a roughly 27  downturn from their 52 week high of  81 45 per share Kick the Can Down the Road  Global Week Ahead In the Global Week Ahead  what should traders make of U S  trade negotiators in Beijing and a Brexit showdown at the House of Commons In short  it s  kick the can down the road  time for the U S  and U K  When one is led by delusional thinking  there can be no stomach for reality Psychology Todayhas keen insights into such folk  The Delusional Belief is something very important for those who hold them  That is why they are blind to counter evidence because they do not want to change their belief  Delusional reasoning can be described by an over reliance on instinctive  rapid and non reflective  thinking and an under reliance on analytical thinking  deliberative  effortful   Ahem On we must go  Now  let s consult our neighbors to the North  for a keen perspective on politics in both the USA and the U K  On these  analytical  excerpts  I am in agreement Here s how Canada s Scotiabank put the U S  China trade situation  The resumption of the US China trade negotiations happens  as a top US delegation travels to Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday  Setting a date for a potentially decisive Trump Xi summit could follow this  That date has been pushed out to sometime after March 1st when the US tariff moratorium expires  The most likely scenario is probably for the tariff deadline to be pushed out  in keeping with the observed experiences during NAFTA negotiations when the Trump administration was routinely if not laughably too aggressive with its deadlines given the complexity of the negotiations  In the end  the expedited timeline resulted in the Trump administration largely caving on its core early demands  leaving NAFTA 2 0 resembling much of NAFTA 1 0  Again  a Canadian view on Brexit another time delay the likely outcome  Thursday s Brexit vote may inform next steps on the path to otherwise crashing out of the EU on March 29th  but as yet they don t know what they ll be voting upon  That in itself may indicate that the vote could well be to delay the deadline if not revisit it altogether given the low likelihood of finding a workable solution to the Irish border  Let s move on to Reuters in London s five big world market themes  These likely dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the Global Week Ahead  1  Doves  Doves  EverywhereIt s just over a week since the U S  Federal Reserve formally paused its rate rise campaign but central bankers around the world are falling over themselves to emulate Chair Jerome Powell s dovish turn Australia s Philip Lowe  having said for a year the next rate move was up  suddenly declared rates could go either way  The European Central Bank can hardly cut its minus 0 40 percent rate but a new round of bank funding stimulus is now widely expected The rate cycle has turned across emerging markets  too   India has cut rates for the first time in 18 months  several others including Brazil have hinted at cuts ahead  And upcoming central bank meetings in New Zealand and Sweden are sure to highlight growth concerns The shift is showing up on currency markets  The dollar fell in December and January as the Fed pause was priced in  Now it s everyone else s turn  the Aussie has lost more than 2 percent since Lowe s  NYSE LOW  Feb 6 comments  the euro has had its biggest weekly drop in four months and MSCI s emerging currency index is retreating after rising three months straight  If everyone joins the Fed in the doves camp  the greenback  with the highest interest rates in the G10 group  may resume its ascent  Analysts reckon it has stalled  but only time will tell  2  Less than 50 Days to BrexitLess than 50 days before Britain s EU departure date  markets  conviction that a no deal Brexit will be avoided may be starting to fade There is not that much Prime Minister Theresa May can update UK lawmakers on when she addresses them on Feb  13  This will be followed by debate in parliament where lawmakers can propose changes  known as amendments There are signs that going into that session  currency traders are ramping up their cautious bets on the pound Shorter dated risk reversals  ratios of calls to puts on the pound  indicate investors are now more inclined to buy options to protect against a deeper fall in the pound versus the dollar  rather than anticipate big gains That demand for puts has also put a floor under implied volatility  a gauge of expected swings in the currency and a key input to option prices  One month and one week implied vols  as they are known  have risen in the past week  after falling steadily in January That caution has rippled into cash markets  The pound has fallen back below a key technical market level   the 200 day moving average  an indication investors are no longer bullish on the currency s prospects  In fact  sterling has traded below that average since May 2018  only briefly popping above that in January  3  Hard Data on China Trade Out on ThursdayAs Chinese markets reopen after the Lunar New Year  they may get more hard evidence on the damage done by the Sino U S  trade war Data on Thursday is expected to show exports as well as imports contracting  with the latter taking an extra punch from slowing domestic demand If March 1 passes without a trade agreement with Washington  Chinese exports to the United States will be subject to additional tariffs  So hopes are pinned on the U S  trade delegation  which travels to Beijing on Monday  led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  But President Donald Trump has somewhat dampened hopes of a breakthrough  saying he had no plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming month If talks collapse and tariffs increase on March 2  it will spell more pain for China s economy   and the rest of the world  In turn it will increase pressure on Chinese policymakers to ramp up stimulus at next month s parliamentary summit  4  A Recession in Europe For months  the question on a lot of people s lips has been whether the U S  economy is headed for recession  but it looks like the Eurozone could get there first The European Commission shocked markets by slashing growth and inflation forecasts for the bloc  Thursday s release of the  flash  GDP data is likely to show the region grew 0 2 percent in Q4  Evidence is already piling up that Germany  the bloc s largest economy  was teetering on the brink of recession towards the end of 2018 due to global trade headwinds and a cooling Chinese economy The picture beneath may be even less rosy  German industrial output has fallen for four months straight  reinforcing expectations the economy actually contracted in Q4  That would translate into a recession after GDP fell in the third quarter Markets have taken notice  German 10 year bond yields now are just 10 basis points away from zero percent   territory that in bond markets reflects dire concern about economic conditions  5  What Did the U S  Shutdown Cost Clouds are gathering on the horizon for the world s top economy   global growth headwinds and the trade war are taking a toll while another government shutdown may be lurking around the corner Markets will be scouring various U S  consumer and producer inflation data out in the coming days to see just how accommodative the Federal Reserve can be after Chairman Powell said in January the case for raising rates had  weakened   The Fed s post meeting statement had also dropped its earlier expectation for  some further  tightening Latest jobs data showed workers  wage gains dipped slightly on a year over year basis  pointing to further reprieve from rate hike concerns The U S  government has also endured a 35 day government shutdown that ended on Jan  25  cost the economy at least  3 billion and inflicted hardship on unpaid workers  Lawmakers are resisting President Trump s demand for funds to build a Mexican border wall  They have until Feb  15 to find a compromise Top Zacks Stocks Unilever  With the Eurozone possibly heading into a recession

120660,342175,TTWO,If The Video Game Industry Is On Fire  What s Pressuring Sector Shares ,opinion,"The video game industry is on fire  According to a Newzoo report  the segment is expected to grow from  137 9 billion in 2018 to more than  180 1 billion in 2021  It appears to be a lucrative and potentially ever expanding market since gamers seem to be endlessly hungry for new games  At first glance  it isn t showing any signs of slowing down 
But last week investors were given a glimpse beneath the kimono  when game studios Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  and Take Two Interactive  NASDAQ TTWO  reported  EA missed badly  recording an EPS of just  0 86 per share on revenue of  1 3 billion  versus expectations of  1 93 EPS on  1 8 billion of revenue  Take Two fared better  It reported EPS of  3 89 on  1 2 billion in revenue  compared to consensus estimates of  2 72 and  1 5 billion  respectively 

Nonetheless  shares of both dropped dropped steeply  down 13  last Wednesday after the results were released  Of note  they dragged Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  shares down as well  It lost 10  on industry wide concerns 
Activision reported on Tuesday  and beat earnings expectations by one cent per share  The company also announced a  1 5 billion share buyback program  but added it would cut 800 jobs to focus more on game development  The news sent ATVI shares 3  higher in after hours trading 
But there s yet more to the story  Over the past 12 months  shares of Activision  EA  and Take Two lost 40   18  and 16  respectively  compared to the S P 500 s 4  gain over the same period 

Something unexpected has taken the wind out of established video game studios  sales  And if that weren t enough  additional potential headwinds for the industry have cropped up 
Segment Disruptor  Microtransactions  Government Regulations
The entire segment has been disrupted by Fortnite  a free to play offering from privately held Epic Games  whose Battle Royale surprised the market  It also earned a hefty  3 billion dollars in profit in 2018 with 125 million registered players 
That s the most prominent current risk for this group of publicly traded companies  Government regulators  however  could also become an issue 
One of the revenue streams gaming studios have successfully used to boost profits from existing games are microtransactions  in game sales of random content that allow users to buy additional enhancements per game for fiat currency  It s a lucrative and broadly accepted practice  of EA s  1 28 billion in revenue made during 2018   480 million  or 37  came from extra in game purchases  Indeed  it s become the biggest revenue segment on EA s income statement  However  there s an element of surprise attached to the standard microtransaction since purchasers don t always know exactly what they ll be receiving 
In April of last year  regulators in the Netherlands and Belgium declared the practice a criminal violation of their respective gambling laws  EA fought the ruling but lost  Similar video game gambling regulation hasn t spread to other countries yet  but if it does  game studios will likely have a big problem 
Quality and Originality
Perhaps more challenging for the studios is the endless player appetite for ceaseless innovation  All three game studios have popular lineups but many of the titles are new iterations of older games  Customers are vocal about growing bored with some of the newer versions of older titles 
It s for this very reason we believe the Fortnite threat is only temporary  Once the Battle Royale fever ends and it will the publicly traded game studios  which have more experience in the market and a broader diversity of titles  will be in a better position to adapt to the next big trend  As well  all the major studios now have their own version of Battle Royale games so it s likely Fortnite s days are numbered  Indeed  on Friday  EA reported that its own newly released version of Battle Royale gained 10 million players in three days  catapulting the company s stock higher by 16  to close the trading week 
Bottom line
From a price perspective  EA shares are nominally the most expensive  trading for  102 33  compared to 89 25 for Take Two and  41 67 for Activision  However  from a P E perspective  EA and Take Two are relatively cheap with price to earnings ratios of 21 and 30 while Activision clocks in at a much higher 50  Forward P E ratios  based on estimates for the coming year  are 24 for EA  20 for Take Two  and 17 for Activision Blizzard  The average P E ratio for the industry is 27  so EA and Take Two are relatively inexpensive growth plays 
Revenue TTM numbers are the highest they ve ever been for all three companies  Activision leads with  7 1 billion  EA is next with  5 3 billion  Take Two came in  2 5 billion  As for Net Income TTM  EA is now leading the way with  1 4 billion  its highest figure ever  Activision is at  577 million  after a drop in earnings of 50  in the past two years  and Take Two is at  367 million  near all time high levels 
Since Electronic Arts is the most established of the three gaming studios  with more games as well as deeper pockets  and its shares are the cheapest of the group after the recent drop  we d recommend it for buying and hold investors looking for a good entry who d also like to get some exposure to a growing industry  Likewise  Take Two is a promising video game studio at a reasonable valuation  and we d recommend them as well 
Though Activision shares are the cheapest nominally  they are most highly valuated of the group  and they ve also seen more serious declines this past year  While still a potentially good investment within an expanding industry  it isn t nearly as attractive as its peers ",2019-02-13,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/video-game-sector-200386665,200386665

Are Video Game ETFs Safe 
If investors are worried about the building competitive pressure on leading video game companies as indicated by Electronic Arts  the basket approach of ETFs could be a solution 
These funds offer exposure to semiconductor stocks too that have put up a better performance on Feb 6 and thus the portfolio approach mitigated some of the losses caused by video gaming stocks 
Investors can also tap the success of Fortnite through the ETF format  The company has Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings Ltd  as a major shareholder and Tencent is the top holding  8 14   of ESPO

120695,342210,TTWO,Tap Potential Earnings Beat With 5 Top Stocks ,opinion,"It is not surprising that before an earnings season  every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectation  This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high quality in nature 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
Meanwhile  after much brainstorming and analysis of companies  financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  They in fact club their insights and a company s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Find Stocks That Can Beat 
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors  dream but not an easy job  One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company 
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that raise the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat  per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to nine 
Here are five out of the nine stocks 
Take Two Interactive Software Inc     NASDAQ TTWO     This company is a leading developer  publisher and marketer of interactive entertainment for consumers around the globe  It belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 12    The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

What s Next for Take Two 
While Take Two has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

This publisher of  Grand Theft Auto  and other video games has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 21 03  
For the most recent quarter  Take Two was expected to post earnings of  0 91 per share  but it reported  1 05 per share instead  representing a surprise of 15 38   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 15 per share  while it actually produced  0 19 per share  a surprise of 26 67  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Take Two lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Take Two currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 94   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 6  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-taketwo-ttwo-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200378500,200378500
120742,342257,TTWO,Take Two Interactive  TTWO  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Take Two Interactive  NASDAQ TTWO  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This publisher of  Grand Theft Auto  and other video games is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 75 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  118 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 48 billion  up 126 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 20 55  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Take Two 
For Take Two  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 36  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination indicates that Take Two will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Take Two would post earnings of  0 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 05  delivering a surprise of  15 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

Turtle Beach s latest bout of momentum comes on the same day that one of the year s hottest games  Red Dead Redemption 2  is beginning to roll out its online mode  This multiplayer launch is being labeled as a beta because there are more features and modes to be released  including a battle royale option  according to

travel site for the first time in years to get in on the social media craze   This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is expected to see double digit earnings growth in 2018 TripAdvisor is one of the world s largest travel sites with 702 million reviews  Its sites are available in 49 markets and sees over 490 million average monthly unique visitors It also operates 20 other travel media brands including airfarewatchdog com  flipkey com  thefork com  cruisecritic com  gateguru com  housetrip com  jetsetter com  oyster com and viator com  among others Big Earnings Beat in Q3On Nov 7  TripAdvisor reported its third quarter results and blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate by  0 25  Earnings were  0 72 versus the consensus of  0 47 Revenue rose 4  to  458 million although Hotel  its largest segment  fell 2  year over year to  305 million  while non Hotel  which includes Experiences and Restaurants  rose 20  50  153 million It s Experiences and Restaurants segments saw accelerating growth out of the second quarter Revenue per hotel shopper also gained  rising 5  New Immersive Site ExperienceTripAdvisor is finally recognizing just how valuable and loyal its audience is  In Nov 2018  it announced a new social feature which allows users to post their own experiences in an interactive social media feed This type of feed allows for links back to sites and articles created by users  It should encourage content generation on the site by those in the travel industry  including Instagram influencers and travel bloggers As of the third quarter  users had uploaded 153 million photos with over 700 million reviews  Why not upload other content like travel articles Other than the Forums section  there s little else interactive on the TripAdvisor site that might keep people coming back for more  This new social feature could do the trick Analysts also believe it could be a money generator a few years from now with sponsored posts fit into the feed It s too soon to know its full impact  however Estimates Revised HigherThe analysts like the changes they are seeing in the site and with the growth 13 estimates have been revised higher for both 2018 and 2019 in the last 30 days  None have been lowered The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to  1 73 from  1 44 in that time  That s earnings growth of 69 6  compared to 2017 For 2019  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has also soared  up to  1 82 from  1 58  however  that s just another 5  growth Shares Soar in 2018After a tough 2017  the shares have finally turned around and are up 76  year to date They aren t cheap  TripAdvisor trades with a forward P E of 33 8  That s pretty pricey  Beazer Homes USA is facing rising mortgage rates and high home prices in 2019  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  has seen its stock plunge in 2018 and is now trading for just 5x forward earnings Is the worst over Beazer Homes is one of the largest single family homebuilders in the United States  It offers homes in Arizona  California  Delaware  Florida  Georgia  Indiana  Maryland  Nevada  North Carolina  South Carolina  Tennessee  Texas and Virginia With a market cap of  352 million  Beazer is headquartered in Atlanta Another Beat in the Fiscal Fourth QuarterOn Nov 13  Beazer reported its fiscal fourth quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus by  0 21  Earnings were  1 15 versus the consensus of  0 94 It was the 7th consecutive earnings beat in a row Revenue was up 14 4  to  761 5 million as the average selling price rose 6 6  year over year to  372 600 It delivered 2 044 homes  up 7 4  Gross margin fell 40 basis points  however  to 21 6   And unit orders were down 0 8  to 1 305 but that was impacted by Hurricane Florence It s marketing itself as a first time and active adult home builder  which it hopes should help it weather the higher mortgage rates  This is about 80  of its total sales First time homes are in strong demand  Additionally  many older adults buying in an active adult community pay with cash so the impact of rate increases may be muted Debt Reduction and Share RepurchasesWith the solid cash flow over the last year  the company retired the remaining  96 4 million of outstanding 5 75  unsecured Senior Notes due 2019  This was part of its 3 year  250 million debt reduction plan It has no debt maturities until 2022 It s putting more money to work in fiscal 2019  however  It intends another  50 million in debt repurchase and  50 million in share repurchases Estimates CutWith flat order growth expected in fiscal first quarter and worries remaining over next year  it s not surprising that the analysts have adjusted their estimates in the past month 2 estimates were cut for fiscal 2019 and one was cut for fiscal 2020 over the last 30 days  Zacks only has 2 estimates for fiscal 2019 so the analysts are in agreement Beazer made  1 99 in fiscal 2018  It s expected to make  1 95 in fiscal 2019 which is an earnings decline of 2  Analysts are a little more bullish about a recovery in fiscal 2020  though  as the Zacks Consensus is at  2 37  up 21  from 2019 Additional content Here s Why Turtle Beach  HEAR  Soared on TuesdayShares of Turtle Beach were up

In fact  the stock popped up on Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White s list of 20 mid cap stocks that have attracted the highest options volume during the past 10 trading days   Names highlighted in yellow are new to the list   While Take Two call volume was more prevalent on an absolute basis  options traders have been more put skewed than usual lately

Shifting gears to today  a flurry of options traders have flocked to puts  More than 4 600 Take Two puts have changed hands today    three times the intraday norm  and volume on track for the 98th percentile of its annual range  Leading the charge is the September 100 put  where it appears new positions are being opened  If this is the case  options traders are banking on TTWO s pullback to continue  with the shares breaching the century mark before September options expiration  The video game stock hasn t been south of  100 since early May 
Those wanting to bet on TTWO with options are in luck  considering the stock has consistently rewarded premium buyers over the past year  This is based on its elevated Schaeffer s Volatility Scorecard  SVS  reading of 82  out of a possible 100   which indicates the equity has tended to make outsized moves compared to what the options market was expecting 

Just last week  on July 25  Take Two stock peaked at  128 70    within striking distance of its Feb  1 all time high of  129 25  Since then  however  the stock has sharply pulled back  shedding more than 10   The security is on track today for its worst single day loss since Feb  8 

Take Two stock has a rather upbeat history of post earnings reactions  The video game maker has enjoyed positive earnings reactions in seven of the past eight quarters  including a 12 2  jump last August  On average  the equity has moved 6 1  the day after earnings over this two year time frame  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a bigger than usual 12 7  single session post earnings swing ",2018-07-31,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/options-bears-pile-on-taketwo-stock-ahead-of-earnings-200334749,200334749

120853,342368,TTWO,Should You Be Buying  Esports Stocks  Right Now ,opinion,"Perhaps no entertainment medium is as universally beloved as video games  From the days of arcade cabinets to the console revolution and the advent of virtual reality gaming  people around the world have always loved video games 
Today  the global gaming industry is adjusting to its latest trend  esports  Video games tend to be competitive by nature  but esports bring the intensity of this competition to the next level  And just like a traditional physical contest like a soccer game or boxing match  esports require high level training  sportsmanship  and clutch performance 
Competitive gaming at a professional level is a relatively new concept  but money is already flowing into the industry at a rapid pace  Pro gamers are now facing off in international tournaments  racking up corporate sponsorships  and battling for multi million dollar prizes 
But is this just another quirky trend  or should investors consider esports a legitimate growth industry  There are certainly plenty of publicly traded video game companies  but will any of them feel the effects of esports  Is there any money to be made here  Let s take a closer look 
Market Size
The global esports economy is expected to grow to more than  905 million in 2018  according to market research firm   That figure would represent year over year growth of roughly 38  
About 77  of this cash will be generated directly through sponsorships and advertising and indirectly through media rights and content licenses  Game publisher fees are expected to account for 13  of this year s economy  while merchandise and event ticketing will bring in about 10  
 As a business  esports is now entering a new and critical phase toward maturity  Big investments have been made  new league structures have been launched  sponsorship budgets have moved from experimental to continuous  and international media rights trade is starting to heat up   said Newzoo CEO Peter Warman 
But as one would expect with any young business  rising revenue does not necessarily mean profits are being realized yet 
 Profitability and return on investment is  for many organizations at the heart of the Esports Economy  a challenge   Warman added 
Nevertheless  we can see that the scope of the esports industry and its rapid rate of growth should put it every investor s radar  With this much money pouring in  people need their own strategies if they want to be among the first wave that profits from esports 
Investment Ideas
One low exposure method for investing in esports is buying shares in Wall Street darling Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA    This trendy company makes high end graphics processing units  GPUs  that are marketed towards PC gamers  These GPUs are a top choice for professional gamers  who understandably need their machines to perform at the highest level 
Nvidia has attracted attention because of its investments in machine learning  artificial intelligence  and self driving cars  but gaming is still the company s core business  The rise of esports promises to generate even more interests in its GPUs  and the stock is already sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
The more direct approach to investing in esports is through the video game publishers  Millions of people are tuning in to watch professional gamers play some of the world s most popular games  which increases brand awareness and drives licensing fees for these companies  And these brands are certainly looking for ways to cash in further from this business 
For example  Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA   recently launched its  EA Competitive Gaming Division   This new group focuses on operating professional leagues for games like FIFA  Madden NFL  and Battlefield  Meanwhile  Take Two Interactive   NASDAQ TTWO   partnered up the National Basketball Association to launch the  NBA 2K eLeague   which will feature a team operated by each of the NBA s 30 franchises  also read    
Another video game publisher that stands to benefit from esports is Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI    Activision recently purchased a major esports company  Major League Gaming  for  46 million   ATVI also just started a professional league for its immensely popular Overwatch game  The new  Overwatch League  is the first pro league of its kind  with 12 teams representing cities from around the globe 
But one of the most promising  esports stocks  right now is Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings   OTC TCEHY    Tencent owns Riot Games  the developer of one of the world s most popular games  League of Legends  According to Newzoo  League of Legends was the second most watched game on Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   Twitch streaming platform during the month of January 
Tencent is also uniquely positioned to succeed in Asian markets  which continues to be the hottest region for esports  Tencent is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

120896,342411,TTWO,Direxion Launches Leveraged Mid Cap ETF ,opinion,"Direxion launched a new fund on Feb 15  2018  focused on providing 1 25x exposure to the mid cap space of the U S  equity markets 
Portfolio  S P Mid Cap ETF  tracks the S P Mid Cap 400 Index   125   and provides leveraged access to the mid cap space of the U S  equity markets 
Fund Characteristics
The fund s index seeks to provide investment results that closely track the performance of mid cap companies in the U S  markets  The S P Mid Cap 400 Index measures the performance of 400 American mid sized companies and is a float adjusted market capitalization weighted index  It has amassed AUM of  25 million within a few days of trading and has a moderate expense ratio of 40 basis points a year 
From a sector look  Information Technology  Financials and Industrials are the top three allocations of the index  with 17 5   17 1  and 15 8  exposure  respectively  From a top holdings perspective  the index has 0 7  exposure each to Take Two Interactive Software Inc   NASDAQ TTWO    SVB Financial Group   NASDAQ SIVB   and NVR Inc   NYSE NVR    However  investors should note that investing in mid cap stocks requires a steady appetite for risk  as they are more volatile than their large cap counterparts 
How Does it Fit in a Portfolio 
U S  markets recently suffered a sell off owing to fears of rising interest rates  The S P 500 entered correction territory  as it declined more than 10  from the record high set in January 
However  mid caps appeal to investors as they still have some growth potential and are relatively less risky than their small cap counterparts   U S  economic fundamentals seem to be strong with a slew of upbeat economic data  strong corporate fundamentals and President Donald Trump s tax reform signed into law  Mid caps have less international exposure compared to large caps and are expected to benefit greatly from the tax reform and provide diversification benefits to investors 
Competition
The fund faces a lot of competition from other funds in the space  Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to the mid cap space of the U S  equity markets  see

120950,342465,TTWO,3 Momentum Stocks To Buy Right Now,opinion,"Momentum investing is built on the belief that once a trend is established  it is more likely to continue in that direction than to reverse the trend  Overall  the current bull market has been a momentum investor s dream  and this belief has been confirmed by our major indexes  which have broken into new highs several times this year 
As 2017 starts to wrap up  an optimistic global economy and strong earnings growth seem to indicate that our long running bull market will continue  There are certainly a number of domestic and international political sagas that could threaten this bullishness  but until our fundamental picture changes  stocks should keep surging 
With that said  it s time for investors to focus in on strong momentum stocks that have continued to test new highs  Luckily  our proven Zacks Rank works in conjunction with these specific stock trends  and our Style Scores system includes a  Momentum  category that highlights these surging stocks 
Today we have highlighted three stocks that are all currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Momentum grade of  A   Check out these three momentum stocks to buy now

In the last year alone  Take Two Interactive Software s revenue has grown by 30 54   That s a solid sign for Take Two Interactive Software stock owners 
We like to invest in companies that grow their sales  A growing top line is a sign of a healthy business 
For now  Take Two Interactive Software will continue to pull in revenue  So let s take a closer look at the company s total financial health 
One of the best way to do that is by looking at its balance sheet    Take Two Interactive Software s cash comes in at over  1 billion and the company s debt is only  252 million  

Take Two Interactive Software s cash pile is larger than its total debt  The company is financially sound for now and can take on new projects 
What is Take Two Interactive Software Stock Worth 
Let s look at a few key ratios to determine the value of Take Two Interactive Software stock 
Price to Earnings  P E   This ratio comes in at 100 92 for Take Two Interactive Software  That s high  A high P E ratio shows that investors are already expecting high earnings growth 
Price to Book  P B   This ratio is a cornerstone for value investors  A lower number here indicates a better value play  And at 9 08  Take Two Interactive Software looks reasonable  but P B varies greatly based on the industry 
These are two great metrics to start with when valuing a company  But company analysis should go much further

Review 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked if the current momentum trend is really your friend  and then pointed out the benefits of blending multiple trading approaches  If you missed it  a glance at your news feed will show that the key points remain relevant 
This Week  Do You Know When To Fold Your Trades 
One of the worst mistakes you can make as a trader is to be stubborn  For example  a common mistake among new traders is refusing to cut your losses when the market is moving significantly against you  Convincing yourself that the market will eventually move in your direction if you just hold on to your position a little longer can often lead to disaster  According to professional trader  Nial Fuller   one of the most challenging decisions that  traders  are faced with on a day to day basis is knowing when to hold on to a trade and when to close it   In his recent article    Nial explains how to manage your trades in various market conditions  His advice includes using stop loses  and also trailing those stop loses in a rising market 
Another  appeared in the Wall Street Journal this week regarding the large amount of short interest  i e  people betting against  on RH     formerly Restoration Hardware  this year  Of course RH is a stock we ve written about often in this weekly Stock Exchange series  for example  here  here and here  and it s also a trade that our trading models have had a lot of success with by being long  The Wall Street Journal article suggests as much as  1 billion dollars may have recently been lost by short sellers betting against this stock  which is a lot considering the market cap of RH is still less than  2 billion even after the shares have risen more than 195  this year   Despite the big gains  which have been fueled in part by massive share buybacks   plenty of short sellers remain unconvinced considering about 35  of the company s shares are still currently sold short  Several of our models are on the other side of that trade  however our models have stop loss orders in place to prevent us from giving back our big gains 
Model Performance 
Per reader feedback  we re continuing to share the performance of our trading models  as shown in the following table 

The sharp eyed may have noticed some small changes in the performance table  We want it to be a reflection of actual client accounts  Sometimes there are some new accounts or changes that were not originally included 
Importantly  we find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 

Expert Picks From The Models 
This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by Blue Harbinger  Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas  
Holmes  I have no new purchases this week  however I did exit my position in Sally Beauty Holdings Inc  NYSE SBH  on 12 22 after entering the trade back on 10 24 

Blue Harbinger  Interesting  Holmes  I do recall discussing your purchase of Sally Beauty during the week of 10 24 in this Stock Exchange  And I think it s nice to review sells once in a while  Why exactly did you finally decide to  fold  this trade 

Holmes  I typically only hold for around six weeks  so this was a longer hold for me  I had a stop loss in place and macro conditions were changing  It was finally time to exit this trade  and I did so at a profit 
BH  Glad you made a little money on this one  I realize your dip buying strategy has been good  but it hasn t been as  hot  as some of the momentum models lately  How about you RoadRunner what have you got for us this week 
Road Runner  This week I like Take Two Interactive Software Inc  NASDAQ TTWO   Are you familiar with this stock  Blue Harbinger 
BH  Yes  Road Runner  This is your fourth Take Two trade since May  The company makes interactive entertainment  i e   video games   

RR  Well then as you also know  I like to buy stocks that are at the bottom of a rising channel  and if you look at the chart below  you can see why I like TTWO again this week 

BH  Yes  Road Runner I can see why you bought it  and I can also see this stock has been in a rising channel for most of this year  which helps explain your success on your earlier Take Two trades  Remind us  how long do you typically hold your positions  and how do you know when it s time to exit 
RR  My typical holding period is about 4 weeks  I give my trades time to work  and if they aren t working in my time period then I exit my position 
BH  Well you have a decent track record over the last six months  Thanks for sharing this idea  How about you  Felix do you have any trades this week 
Felix  No new trades this week  but I did exit my position in Freeport McMoRan on Wednesday 12 27 

BH  Interesting Felix  Based on the above price chart  I think I know why you sold  i e  the shares are up big this month   but why don t you tell us why did you sell this copper and gold mining company  Felix 
Felix  I typically hold my positions for about 66 weeks which is much longer than the other models  I exit when my price target is hit  and I use stops and macro considerations to control risks 
BH  That makes sense 

Felix  Also  this week I ran the entire Russell 1000 index  large cap stocks  through my model  and you can see the top 20 rankings in the following list 

BH  Thanks Felix  I know you are a momentum trader  so that list is interesting  How about you Oscar what have you got for us this week 
Oscar  This week I m sharing my top ranked global ETFs  The following list includes my top 20 

BH  Thanks Oscar  That is a very diverse group of ETFs on your list  I recall from our previous conversations that you are a momentum trader  you hold for about 6 weeks  and you control risks with stops and by rotating into a new sector  I suppose I am not surprised to see the Bitcoin Investment Trust  OTC GBTC  at the top of a momentum list  We discussed Bitcoin in more detail a few weeks ago in this article  Do Not Invest In Bitcoin  Trade It  Bitcoin s price has pulled back in the last week  but it has been on a wild ride over the last month  as shown in the following chart 

Conclusion

120953,342468,TTWO,Overwatch Esports League Lifts Activision  ATVI  To New High ,opinion,"Shares of Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI   surged to a new all time high on Thursday after the video gaming powerhouse debuted its new  Overwatch  esports league to much fanfare on Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   live streaming site Twitch on Wednesday night 
The inaugural matches of the regular season of the 12 team Overwatch league kicked off yesterday  Fans were able to take in the three match slate on   Major League Gaming platforms  as well as OverwatchLeague com and its new app 
Overwatch team owners reportedly paid  to purchase franchises  Ownership groups include Robert Kraft  owner of the New England Patriots  along with other owners of mainstream U S  professional sports franchises  also read    
Esports have been on the rise for the last few years  but Activision Blizzard s Overwatch league is one of the first major tests of a model similar to that of other professional sports  In the first season  the league features 12 city based teams split into two divisions 
Teams from Los Angeles  Dallas  London  Shanghai  Seoul  and other major metropolitan areas are set to compete in the six month regular season that runs from Jan  10 until June 16  A postseason and an all star weekend are also scheduled 
Game days currently feature three different head to head matchups a night  Teams are set to play twice a week during a slate of games that run Wednesday through Saturday nights 
The Overwatch league s long and packed schedule  with an array of different viewing options for fans  should give Activision Blizzard the chance to cash in from advertisers  Wednesday night s slate has already been viewed a total of 4 4 million times on Twitch If you missed any of the  matches today  we re rebroadcasting right now at    Overwatch League   overwatchleague  Activision Blizzard  along with the likes of Take Two Interactive   NASDAQ TTWO   which is set to tip off its NBA franchise backed NBA 2K esports league later this year hope that these more polished products  which feature official teams in uniforms with fans in attendance and multiple broadcasts in different languages  will attract the average sports fan 
Yet  even if just esports fans and video game players tune in  the Overwatch league could easily be a hit  According to market research firm Newzoo  the average esports fan is between 21 and 35  which is a highly sought after advertising democratic and much younger than the NFL and MLB s audience on average  On top of that  the firm projected that around  people around the world would watch at least one esports competition a month in 2017 
Activision Blizzard stock surged over 3  to reach a new all time high of nearly  69 per share on Thursday  as investors seem pleased with the prospect of a potentially massively popular world wide esports league  Before today s climb  shares of Activision Blizzard had soared over 70  in the last 52 weeks

120993,342508,TTWO,Small Cap ETFs In Focus As Domestic Growth Picks Momentum,opinion,"Large Caps vs  Small Caps
U S  small caps have been continuously lagging their large cap counterparts this year  Large cap stocks have been growing on stepped up global economy  owing to their high international exposure  Small cap stocks on the other hand are more domestically focused and exhibit higher volatility than their large cap counterparts 
The largest small cap ETF tracking the Russell 2000 index  iShares Russell 2000 ETF is up 10 7  so far this year  while the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  is up about 15  
The primary reason for this underperformance can be attributed to investors piling onto blue chips and shunning the small caps  However  with robust domestic economic growth and rising hopes of President Donald Trump s tax reform  small cap stocks are expected to perform well 
Economic Data
U S  equities have been rallying owing to multiple factors  GDP increased 3  annually in the July September period compared with a 3 1  increase in the third quarter  Also  it surpassed expectations of a 2 5  increase  read    
Trump is expected to announce his decision on the Federal Reserve chair this week  Markets believe that Trump is expected to choose Fed governor Jerome Powell as Janet Yellen s replacement  Powell is being seen as a dovish candidate who will not steer much from the current Fed policy  Markets widely expect the Fed to hike rates in its December meeting 
On Oct 19  the Senate passed a budget of  4 trillion in a 51 49 vote which will allow the Republicans to move ahead with the tax cuts with a simple majority instead of the 60 vote supermajority that is generally required  read    
The tax reform is expected to significantly boost earnings  This led to a rally in the stock markets as investors grew more optimistic about Trump delivering on his campaign promises  Moreover  it will significantly boost the performance of small caps owing to their domestic focus 
However  the markets are worried about the tax cuts rolling in gradually  instead of an immediate cut  This will be contrary to Trump s wishes and markets  expectation of an immediate cut

120996,342511,TTWO,4 Impressive Liquid Stocks For Marvelous Returns,opinion,Investors seeking strong returns may allocate their assets in stocks with favorable liquidity positions  Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash A company with a favorable liquidity position always has the potential to provide higher returns as liquidity drives growth  However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in using cash So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always reflect the condition of a company s financial health Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary  to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see    Growth Style Score less than or equal to B  Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks  These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only eight Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screen Tampa  FL based WellCare Health Plans Inc    NYSE WCG   is a leading managed care company  It primarily focuses

121040,342555,TTWO,4 Top Liquid Stocks To Buy For Stellar Returns,opinion,The liquidity position is indicative of whether a company s business is heading in the right direction  Favorable liquidity may help a company see strong business growth  which in turn may drive its price performance  Liquidity is a measure of a company s capability of meeting its debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash So  a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company s financial health Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary  to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see    Growth Style Score less than or equal to B Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks  These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only nine Here

121081,342596,TTWO,Why Did Video Game Stocks  ATVI  TCEHY  EA  Sink Today ,opinion,"Shares of video game giants including Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI    Take Two Interactive   NASDAQ TTWO    and Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA   sank on Monday after a bearish analyst report on the state of the industry 
Today s cautionary take comes from Cowen  The investment banking firm downgraded several industry giants  including Take Two and Activision  as well as Ubisoft Entertainment   OTC UBSFY   
Shares of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard dropped by over 3   while industry peer Electronic Arts stock fell by more than 1 50   Shares of Take Two Interactive  which makes NBA 2K and other big name video game titles  tanked by over 4  
Interestingly enough  Cowen s note comes in contrast to other recent analyst coverage  Just last week  Barclays  analyst Ryan Gee  on four of the biggest video game companies  Gee gave Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA   an  Overweight  rating and a price target of  129 a share  which marked a roughly 7 42  upside to last week s closing price 
Part of the reason for Gee s initial bullish coverage is because he thinks EA s Live Services  revenues will grow over the next two years 
The analyst also initiated coverage of Take Two Interactive with an  Overweight  rating and a  115 price target  Take Two s  115 per share price target marked a nearly 7 25  upside compared to Friday s closing price of  107 23 a share  Gee noted that Take Two is monetizing popular video games more effectively compared to its peers 
Gee also initiated coverage of video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard with an  Equal Weight  rating along with a  65 a share price target  which marked a 2 77  upside to Friday s closing price 
Still  despite these recent relatively bullish Barclays  rating  shares of all four of these companies sunk on Monday 
Sales Projections
This downgrade and brief investor retreat comes just a few days before market research firm NPD Group is set to release its September video game sales report 
Stifel Nicolaus analyst Drew Crum  that the Oct  12 report will be very important for investors  as it includes some the industry s biggest games including NBA 2K18 and FIFA 18  The analyst projects overall video game sales will gain about 20   while hardware and console sales will fall year over year 
Crum expects Activision Blizzard s September sales will be  90 million up from  20 million a year ago  due in large part to the recent release of Destiny 2  He projects Take Two Interactive s sales will fall in the high single digits to  100 million  while Electronic Arts sales are projected to gain slightly to hit approximately  80 million

121121,342636,TTWO,Get Ready For E Sports,opinion,"In early May  we wrote a piece on the out performance of video game companies  in which we noted how the unexpected demographic broadness of video game appeal is helping drive sales and engagement  We also mentioned e sports   another aspect of video gaming that s garnering investors  attention 
E sports is on the way to becoming a huge business  rivaling established sports leagues both globally and in the U S   E sports  refers to multiplayer online games  such as League of Legends  Call of Duty  Counter Strike  Overwatch or StarCraft  as competitive sports   complete with leagues  professional players  spectators  sponsors and box office and advertising revenues  While the largest and oldest e sports league organization is ESL  originally an acronym for  e Sports League    there are many events and organizers  still largely fragmented along game  and manufacturer specific lines  While e sports first took off in Korea  where they are already mainstream  they are expanding rapidly in the U S   Europe and China 
How big is e sports  now  and is competition with established sports  such as soccer  American football and basketball  becoming visible  Numbers are hard to come by for many events  but the 2016 League of Legends World Championship  organized by Riot Games  had 43 million unique viewers for its final game   compared to 40 million for game seven of the 2016 baseball World Series  League of Legends may have global reach compared to the relative parochialism of American baseball  But advertisers and sponsors will love the eyeballs  no matter where they re found 
Trickle Down Benefits
Direct e sports market revenues   including sponsor  advertising revenues and ticket sales   were  900 million in 2016  That figure is relatively small  but it fails to capture some of the significant promotional benefits for game companies like Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  and Take Two Interactive  NASDAQ TTWO  in terms of the impact on game sales 
Recognition of e sports is also rising  In 2013  the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  began issuing athlete visas to event participants in League of Legends events  The Asian Games will include e sports as medal events beginning in 2022  Major European soccer clubs  including Paris Saint Germain  have created e sports teams and participated in e sports events  The National Basketball League has announced that it will partner with TTWO to launch the company s NBA 2K game as an e sports league in 2018 
The main online outlet for e sports viewing is Twitch tv  which Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  bought in 2014  accounting for about 20  of all e sports online viewing time in 2015  Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  s  NASDAQ GOOG  YouTube won ESL broadcast rights early this year  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  struck a deal to live stream Valve s Counter Strike  But it isn t just the internet giants getting involved  cable channels ESPN and TBS have also established e sports programming 
The growing clout of e sports will be a boon for game companies  Titles that gain popularity as e sports venues will see extended game and franchise lifespan and higher sales  e sports will become one of their main promotional tools  The impact on game producers can be profound  independent game studio Pyronix saw unit volumes of its Rocket League game exceed 10 million  largely thanks to e tournament exposure 
Sports are changing  One Twitch channel had more than 200 000 000 views 
For the companies that broadcast and promote events  e sports will create new sources of monetization through sponsor and advertising revenue  as well as through direct sales of event tickets and merchandising  If the 2016 numbers for League of Legends are an indication  e sports are nearing a critical inflection point 
Investment implications
In our opinion  investors who want to benefit from the rapid rise of e sports should concentrate in two areas  first on the game studios themselves  and second on the platforms that will bring e tournaments to the new masses of fans  As we noted in May  the largest pure play gaming companies are Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  Take Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard  Hong Kong based Tencent  OTC TCEHY  is the major gaming company in China  getting about half its revenue from gaming  supported by its other robust social and communications platforms  Amazon  Alphabet and Facebook are positioned to be major platforms for e sports viewing and we would currently favor them above established cable broadcasters   
Our Global Outlook
After some end of the quarter volatility  markets have settled down and continued to move ahead  offering investors a typical seasonal July rally 
The U S 
We like the U S   and in the U S  we continue to prefer large capitalization technology companies with disruptive stories and visible  long term growth prospects 
Europe And Emerging Markets
We are neutral to slightly positive on European stocks  We are most enthusiastic about Asian stocks in manufacturing economies    particularly China  Hong Kong  Taiwan  Thailand  Singapore  and India  Here as well  we like technology  and view some Chinese internet stocks favorably   As usual  we caution investors that most of the Chinese stock market is driven by retail investor sentiment rather than by fundamentals  
We find Brazil interesting in light of former president Lula da Silva s recent conviction on corruption charges   although the long running corruption scandal is still ongoing  President Temer remains under a cloud  having avoided impeachment thus far  Both the Brazilian stock market and the Brazilian currency could rally if and when market participants believe that the corruption scandal has reached its nadir 
Gold
Gold remains in a trading range  It has moved above 1240  but according to technical analysts  a close for gold above  1275 would signal the potential for a more significant rally ",2017-07-21,Tim Shirata,https://www.investing.com/analysis/e-sports-leagues-hitting-the-big-time-200202543,200202543

121164,342679,TTWO,The Week Ahead  Should Investors Fear Another Watergate ,opinion,"We have a very quiet week coming up for economic reports  The housing data are quite important  but it will be a Tuesday story without legs  The White House drama will be compelling for the media  Whether investors like the idea or not  we should expect another week of news that is mostly political  My mission at WTWA has two parts 
Recognize the reality   like it or not 
Find the investment implications   however modest 
In a light week for data  it will be easy for the punditry to jump on the Comey firing story  Expect everyone to be asking 
Is this like Watergate  Should investors be afraid 
Last Week
Last week the economic news was good  but mostly ignored 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted that a bored punditry  lacking fresh data  would be looking at tea leaves to find a message from the markets  That proved to be my worse forecast of the year  After a day of analyzing Mr  Buffett and the Sohn Conference  President Trump grabbed the spotlight  I hope people benefitted from the discussion  even though it never became the focus for the week 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500  via Jill Mislinski  She notes the weak Friday trading  the narrow range  and the closeness of the all time high 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read the entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
Once again  the economic news last week was good  but there was little market reaction  Of course  there were other considerations 
The Good
The EIA s energy outlook suggests stable prices  People seem to regard different prices as  good   These levels are fine for consumers  The distress in the oil patch has been mitigated     
Hotel Occupancy increased again matching a record pace  This chart from  provides a nice comparison 

Corporate earnings have been strong on all fronts  improvement over last year  beating expectations on earnings  and beating expectations on revenues   this important story for investors  illustrated by the chart below  Brian Gilmartin makes a key point  highlighting the modest revisions in earnings expectations 
The question we should ask for readers is what sectors  using the above data listed in 2nd set of bullet points  are seeing the smallest negative revisions as we approach Q2  17 


Real Estate   3 6  today vs   3 5  on April 1  17 


Financials   9 5  today vs   10 5  on April 1  17 


Industrial s   1 1  today vs   1 3  on April 1  17 


Technology   9 6  today vs   11 5  on April 1  17 


Health Care   2 2  vs   3 3  on April 1  17


Readers should remember  that Technology  Financials and Health Care   those 3 sectors alone   comprise about 50  of the SP 500 by market cap 




Port traffic strength continues at a better rate than the economy  Steven Hansen  GEI  takes his expected deep dive into the data 
Initial unemployment claims dropped to 236K   provides this interesting  long term chart  It is consistent with the tighter labor market conditions in last week s JOLTS report 

The Bad
Retail sales disappointed  Core sales increased 0 4   less than expectations  This was somewhat mitigated by revisions to prior months  The data are not adjusted for inflation  notes Steven Hansen     so the picture is a bit worse 

Retail same store sales also disappointed  The entire sector is challenged      J C  Penney  NYSE JCP  hit a record low and big name department stores were also hit 

The Ugly
Some stories do not die  perhaps illustrating why they qualify for the  ugly  category  This week a major ransomware meltdown occurred   asks whether it might be the long awaited  big one  

North Korean nuclear and missile development is another regular concern in this section  As I write  there is   but few details 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  No award this week  but I welcome nominations  The investment world is full of misleading information and bogus conclusions 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
We have a normal week for economic data  but with few important reports 
The  A  List
Housing starts and building permits  T   Continuing strength expected in the April data 
Leading indicators  Th   Popular economic summary remains in solid growth range 
Initial jobless claims  Th   Continues with record low levels 
The  B  List
Industrial production  T   Will the rebound continue 
Philly Fed  Th   Moves markets  perhaps because it is the earliest read on a new month 
Crude inventories  W   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
FedSpeak is down a little after last week s heavy schedule  I don t care much about the Empire State index  There are still some earnings reports  including Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  
This Coming Week s Theme
As I noted last week  when there is not much important news  it creates a vacuum  It does not change the need to fill on air minutes or column space  If nature abhors a vacuum  the punditry hates it even more  I was right about that  but wrong about what the news would be 
The Comey firing  the suggestion of recordings of Oval Office conversations  and the Kissinger picture have fueled plenty of speculation  Everyone is asking 
Is this like Watergate 
Financial media might also ask 
Do events increase risk for investors  What does it mean 
Expect to be bombarded with speculation  beginning with the Sunday shows 
Some will emphasize Watergate parallels  while others will cite differences  I have a list of such sources  but the arguments are mostly political 
The investment implications are much more difficult to follow  The early theme is that the controversy will derail the Trump agenda  Since recent market gains assume Trump tax cuts  etc  the stock rally is threatened 
This is certainly a big story  but it is not yet a market story 

The Comey firing is  more of a political story than a markets story Implications directly for the market are pretty muted   Chris Zaccarelli  chief investment officer for Cornerstone Financial Partners  told MarketWatch     

As usual  I ll have more in my Final Thought 
Quant Corner
We follow some regular featured sources and the best other quant news from the week 
Risk Analysis
Whether you are a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  Think first about your risk  Only then should you consider possible rewards  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
The Indicator Snapshot

The Featured Sources 
Bob Dieli  The  C Score  which is a weekly estimate of his Enhanced Aggregate Spread  the most accurate real time recession forecasting method over the last few decades   His subscribers get  including both an economic overview of the economy and employment 
Holmes  Our cautious and clever watchdog  who sniffs out opportunity like a great detective  but emphasizes guarding assets 
RecessionAlert  Many  for both economic and market analysis  While we feature his recession analysis  Dwaine also has several interesting approaches to asset allocation  Try out his new public  
Georg Vrba  The  and much more   for an array of interesting methods  Georg  Bob Dieli s enhanced aggregate spread  considering when it might first give a recession signal  His interpretation suggests the probability creeping higher  but still after nine months 
Brian Gilmartin  Analysis of  for the overall market as well as coverage of many individual companies 
Doug Short  The   and much more   His  is the single best method to monitor the key indicators used by the National Bureau of Economic Research in recession dating 
 has his inimitable take on the VIX   clear  common sense  and accurate 

I have a slightly heterodox view on the VIX  You ll often hear the VIX discussed on the financial news as if it s the market s heart rate  It s not 


In fact  the VIX is largely tied to what the market is doing  When the market is up  volatility drops  When the market falls  volatility rises 

 has another analysis of Selling in May  Returns are lower  but still positive   as I think readers know  He also comments on the possible reasons for how this persists in the face of arbitrage 
 provides a careful explanation and a good example of how to use market maker hedging data to find solid stock values  Even if you do not accept the market makers as the  smart money   this is interesting information about the perceptions of big players  Here is an interesting example 

And an application to the overall market

Best Advice for the Week Ahead
The right move often depends on your time horizon  Are you a trader or an investor 
Insight for Traders
We consider both our models and the top sources we follow 
Felix  Holmes  and Friends
We continue with a strongly bullish market forecast  Most of our models are fully invested  RoadRunner is fussy about entry criteria  The group meets weekly for a discussion they call the    In each post I include a trading theme  ideas from each of our five technical experts  and some rebuttal from a fundamental analyst  If you followed my recommendation last week  you had a chance to evaluate the unusual agreement among our models    and with guest expert   I hope that some readers  after doing their own research  could join in the post earnings gains 
This week was much different   no consensus at all  in their discussion of some big name stocks  We try to have fun  but there are always fresh ideas  RoadRunner plays upward trending channels and likes Take Two Interactive Software  NASDAQ TTWO  
Top Trading Advice
Brett Steenbarger is required reading for traders  posting many great ideas almost daily  He has two posts this week that are required reading 
What should you do if you have   Brett has great practical advice  explaining how to be open to fresh ideas and how to leverage your strengths 
He  why traders should always be updating their methods   and provides a fresh idea 
The other post is of special interest for me and my colleagues   He distinguishes between successful approaches and pseudo quants  His experience lets him identify the imposters easily  There is a solution 

The answer to the limitations of pseudo quant strategies is not to abandon mathematics altogether  but rather to employ rigor in the application of mathematics  Just as medicine has evolved from a discipline dominated by village doctors to more of an evidence based science  finance is doing the same 

As a bonus  he also cites   There is plenty of information for identifying the pseudo quants  and a respectful refutation of the  that sparked the discussion 
Insight for Investors
Investors have a longer time horizon  The best moves frequently involve taking advantage of trading volatility 
Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be the  from this year s Buffett fest  The topics cover a wide range  including both methods and specific stock ideas  Plan to take some time and enjoy these 
Stock Ideas
Bad luck for Blue Harbinger  writing a great post within a few days of Warren Buffett s big week  Mark s   NASDAQ FTR  is excellent  It covers the fundamental analysis and the stock history  but that is just a start  Should you consider the stock  the bonds  or the options  These are important questions which investors rarely consider  It is a first rate article 
 recommends buying Europe and emerging markets  providing a list of ETFs  I m not so sure  but it is worth a look   I get exposure to these markets through stocks trading in the U S  and following accounting rules  
Dana Lyons also  

The Sohn Conference raises money for charity by featuring big name hedge fund managers to present their ideas  The audience pays five grand for a ticket  nearly all of it going to charity  and trades from their smartphones during the presentation  The speakers talk their books  Barron s has a nice discussion of how it works and the volatile stock movements during a presentation 
With that background  readers might wish to consider some of the ideas   Diana Britton    has a video and slideshow 
Our  always has some fresh ideas  There are ideas from five different approaches  To my surprise  Felix  our long term investor proxy  likes Valeant  NYSE VRX  
Personal Finance
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  If you are a serious investor managing your own account  this is a must read  Even the more casual long term investor should make time for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his  As usual  investors will find value in several of them  but my favorite is about   It raises several interesting questions   not just financial calculations 

Watch out for 
Whole Foods  NASDAQ WFM    and  both raise questions 
Stone Fox also raises  about ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  
TV pitches for questionable IPOs  Dan Bobkoff and Rachael Levy    highlight a Seinfeld actor pitching this one under the latest SEC rules  For the record  every stock idea I have ever seen on TV or heard on the radio has been a disaster  These pitches raise my blood pressure  since good  working people are the targets 
Final Thoughts
The Watergate analogy makes a good story  but the similarities are superficial   so far  I do not see a great downside risk  but the hoped for growth from tax cuts has a lower probability 
The key differences from Watergate include the state of the economy  especially pressure on prices   turmoil over the Vietnam war  and the VP controversy regarding  
Investors must get past the political theater and ask how much this matters to the economy and their investments  So far  not much  There are many sources  but let us highlight something old and something new 
 that his investments do not depend upon who is President  He does not call them  He does not send messages 
Josh Brown cites the     a theme familiar to WTWA readers  and  that the market would rally if Trump resigned 
 the story that investors would be watching  were it not for the sideshow   housing 
He shows this chart and then writes as follows 


We re still near a level associated with previous bottoms  The only other times since World War II that housing investment has been as low as it is now was during or near recessions  And that s not because we ve declined to these low levels  but because the rebound since 2009 has been so meager 


Which is promising  It s a humble suggestion that we re not as close to the top of this nine year expansion as you might think 

I see daily evidence in my own contacts  other wealth managers make similar reports  People are sitting on cash  out of the market  chasing yield  or turning to real estate and gold  Many expect a violent end to the current slow and long term economic expansion   just as they did three or four years ago  It is a time when investors can expect a reward for careful analysis instead of blind fear  The  calls it a market in search of a catalyst  Maybe so  but catalysts are not always easy to predict ",2017-05-14,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-should-investors-fear-another-watergate-200188956,200188956

121203,342718,TTWO,5 Stocks With Solid Sales Growth To Buy Right Now  revised ,opinion,Amid the daily roller coaster ride in the stock market  there is no set rule for successful investing  However  knowledge of some of the basic strategies should help investors in taking smart investment decisions Among numerous stock picking strategies  we chose a rational down to earth investment approach   one that focuses on the sales growth of a company Sales growth is an important measure for any corporate  as it is vital to growth projections and strategic decision making  However  investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to picking stocks  This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum Interestingly  revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business  It s worth keeping in mind that when companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues  as sales growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance Hence  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  Notably  this metric s importance lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales unlike earnings Focusing solely on sales growth is  however  not enough  Considering a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments The Right StrategyA careful selection of stocks considering certain factors should help investors to not only build wealth but beat the market as well In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we added 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our primary screening parameters However  sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added a few other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric measures the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than

121244,342759,TTWO,3 Video Gamers To Watch,opinion,"Video games are the highest grossing form of entertainment  even larger than the movie and music industry  With this in mind  it is not surprising that the video game publishers have also become great financial investments  Many of the industry s biggest studios have seen their stocks skyrocket on new content  strategic acquisitions and a transition toward digital offerings  With earnings season less than a month away  investors should keep an eye on reports from Electronic Arts  Activision Blizzard and Take Two Interactive 

Electronic Arts  EA  Information Technology   Software
Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  started the year on a hot streak thanks to the overwhelming success of Star Wars  Battlefront  That has since cooled off and Electronic Arts is coming off a weaker than expected FQ1  printing a 53  decline on the bottom line and 2  on the top  Fortunately  the second quarter covers the annual release of FIFA and Madden video games  These games are often two of highest grossing games year after year  which will help jump start revenue growth  Furthermore  smartphone owners can expect to see new versions of FIFA and Madden  This is a new facet that Electronic Arts had previously never recognized but is now a huge source of revenue  The biggest factor  however  is growth in digital sales and in game purchases  This new wave of digital offerings are not only convenient they also generate the highest margins  If Electronic Arts can continue to see strong growth in digital offerings then expect to see more favorable price movement  The Estimize consensus is still down on Electronic Arts this quarters  Analysts are expecting 42 cents per share on  1 08 billion in revenue  down 28  on the bottom line and 4  on the top 
Activision Blizzard  ATVI  Information Technology   Software
Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  has been the most promising of the three video game publishers  The company is firing on all cylinders and should have no problem topping expectations this quarter  Strong revenue growth is expected to be driven by a number of new and old sources  They include past success such as Overwatch  Call of Duty  COD  and Candy Crush with more recent ones  including expansions for World of Warcraft and Destiny  Activision is much more than a video game publisher though  The company has made efforts to develop a more broad based media portfolio which features e sports  The Call of Duty World Championships earlier this month was the most viewed COD event in history  surpassing more than 20 million views  With so much working in Activision s favor  the bar might be set too high this quarter  Analysts at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of 45 cents on  1 59 billion in revenue  Compared to a year earlier that represents a 106  increase on the bottom line and 51  on the top

Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  Information Technology   Software
Electronic Arts started the year on a hot streak thanks to the overwhelming success of Star Wars  Battlefront  That has since cooled off and Electronic Arts is coming off a weaker than expected FQ1  printing a 53  decline on the bottom line and 2  on the top  Unfortunately  the second quarter doesn t fully cover the annual release of FIFA and Madden video games  These games are often two of highest grossing games year after year  which will help jump start revenue growth  but investors will have to wait until the third quarter  Furthermore  smartphone owners can expect to see new versions of FIFA and Madden  This is a new facet that Electronic Arts had previously never recognized but is now a huge source of revenue  The biggest factor  however  is growth in digital sales and in game purchases  This new wave of digital offerings are not only convenient they also generate the highest margins  If Electronic Arts can continue to see strong growth in digital offerings then expect to see more favorable price movement  The Estimize consensus is still down on Electronic Arts this quarters  Analysts are expecting 43 cents per share on  1 08 billion in revenue  down 28  on the bottom line and 4  on the top

121375,342890,TTWO,Trading Take Two Interactive s Breakout,opinion,"Take Two Interactive Software  NASDAQ TTWO  has been moving higher since the beginning of 2013  There have been periods of consolidation along the way  which have proven to be good entry points  One such point happened last week  On May 18 the company reported earnings after the close  The next day the stock opened down over 10   But it climbed all day ending up over 4  on the day  The chart below shows the long green candle 
Notice that the candle touched below the 200 day SMA  If you follow the 200 day back  you see a couple of touches and very little time spent under that level  Each touch has been a buying opportunity  So if this was the sign to enter why am I talking about it today  Because there are many ways to trade  A second method is to trade a break above resistance 

That break is happening right now  The upper end of the main part of the chart shows price breaking resistance  This gives a natural stop loss to trade against    the breakout level  So if you missed the 200 day SMA this time  consider the breakout trade  Momentum remains strong and bullish with the RSI and MACD both rising  If the breakout fails  stop the trade for a small loss and put in a bid to buy at the 200 day SMA ",2016-05-26,Gregory W.

SanDisk Corp   NASDAQ SNDK  is falling down despite takeover rumors  It spiked down  formed a bear flag  spiked down again  formed a bear wedge  and now it s coming down again right on support  If it gets through 63 63 1 2  then it should see the mid 50 s  maybe even 52 3

The video game industry is usually pretty black and white in terms of earnings and revenues  Hits drive growth  profits  and ultimately investor confidence  Take Two has had its fair share with GTA and 2K and has seen tremendous growth  However  in 2Q2016  there are no hits to work off  merely just further information on NBA and WWE 2K16 sales  Investors want to see the same success that EA posted  but Take Two does not have any highly anticipated titles set to hit shelves soon 
The NBA 2K series has established itself as one of the most dominant and powerful video game franchises out on the market  The company promises every year to deliver the best and most advanced basketball video game and according to its loyal fan base  Take Two delivers  To illustrate this  within a week of release  NBA 2K broke its record and sold 4 million copies worldwide 
Activision And King Digital  A Puzzling Move
Take Two interactive is the 3rd largest video game and entertainment company in the industry and it is commonly known amongst video game aficionados and investors that the firm is significantly behind Electronic Arts Inc  O EA  and Activision Blizzard  O ATVI   The New York City based video game publisher suffers from long development times and unclear release schedules  For example  the release time between GTA IV and GTA V was 5 years  Though both extremely popular  5 long years was a time where EA and Activision were able to capitalize with fresh new concepts  The next GTA installment is set to reach shelves in 2017  still a 3 year gap 

Recently  Activision acquired Candy Crush maker  King Digital Entertainment  N KING   for a whopping  5 9 billion  Activision is currently attempting to breach the mobile gaming sector and through King Digital  has the means to do so  However  the  5 9 billion could have been better served by working a deal to acquire Take Two  In 2014  both of the companies had a mutual interest in a merger  but nothing materialized  In 2008  EA attempted to purchase Take Two for roughly  2 billion  The offer was rejected  However  a mega merger between Activision and Take Two could have been monumental and game changing to the industry  Both companies have titles with cult followings  leading to possible opportunities to create films based off the popular stories  Given each company has something the other does not  the possibilities would have been endless  Do not rule out the idea behind a future merger  as both companies would benefit ",2015-11-05,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-watch:-video-game-juggernaut-on-deck-270413,270413

121462,342977,TTWO,The Blockbuster Game Activision Blizzard Is Banking On,opinion,"Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  is set to report third quarter earnings on Tuesday  November 4 after the market closes  The gaming industry has been on fire this season and analysts on Estimize are predicting that Activision Blizzard will announce much more attractive results than Wall Street is forecasting 
One title in particular is expected to do much of the heavy lifting this quarter  On September 9  three weeks before the end of the fiscal quarter  Activision Publishing released Destiny  a game made in partnership with the studio that produced the Halo franchise  Bungie 
Destiny did over  500 million in sales on day 1  making it a blockbuster launch and instantly among the most valuable franchises across the industry 
However  not all the spoils go to Activision Blizzard  Destiny was produced by Bungie and the intellectual property remains under Bungie s control  Either way  publishing the game is still a huge win for ATVI 

So far this has been a great earnings season for the large video game producers  Last week Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  reported profits of 75 cents per share compared to the Estimize consensus of 55 cents while the Street was at 53 cents  Take Two Interactive Software  NASDAQ TTWO  also beat expectations losing only 44 cents per share while the Estimize community forecast  46 cents and Wall Street was at  48 cents 

Analysts on s and Wall Street are both expecting a huge uptick in Activision Blizzard s 3rd fsical quarter  although the Estimize community is significantly more bullish on the bottom line than the Street is 
Activision Blizzard owns a slew of recognizable franchises that have been great performers over the past decade including Call of Duty  Warcraft  and Diablo 
An expansion for Diablo 3 on Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox consoles was also released this quarter which is expected to be a hit  World of Warcraft will continue to be a steady stream of income for ATVI and relatively young freemium virtual trading card game  Hearthstone  has also been a tremendous success on desktop and tablet 

As of the time of writing this piece Activision Blizzard has 4 of the top 10 most popular games on online streaming platform Twitch TV which was purchased by Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  for  970 million this summer  Activision Blizzard s Call of Duty  Advanced Warfare and HearthStone are both in the top 3 right now each with over 90 000 concurrent viewers 
These games are just one way to indicate how popular ATVI s titles are with online audiences  and Twitch viewership could serve as a proxy for the lucrative earnings release which might be around the corner  Destiny isn t the type of game that would amass a viewership on Twitch  but it should still be a huge catalyst for Activision Blizzard s quarter ",2014-11-04,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-blockbuster-game-activision-blizzard-is-banking-on-231233,231233
