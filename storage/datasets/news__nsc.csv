175077,396593,NSC,Norfolk Southern  NSC  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Norfolk Southern  NSC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 29  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 69 billion  down 7 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 45  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Norfolk Southern 
For Norfolk Southern  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 36  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Norfolk Southern will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Norfolk Southern would post earnings of  2 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 58  delivering a surprise of  0 39  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Norfolk Southern appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/norfolk-southern-nsc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200500672,200500672

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGreetings  and welcome to the Norfolk Southern Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions  At this time  it is my pleasure to introduce Pete Sharbel  Director of Investor Relations  Mr  Sharbel  you may now begin Peter Sharbel    Director of Investor RelationThank you  Rob  and good morning  everyone  Please note that during today s call  we may make certain forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results  Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important  Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern com in the Investors Section along with our non GAAP reconciliation  Additionally  a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call  It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern s Chairman  President and CEO  Jim Squires James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  everyone  and welcome to Norfolk Southern s Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call  Joining me today are Alan Shaw  Chief Marketing Officer  Mike Wheeler  Chief Operating Officer  and Mark George  Chief Financial Officer  2019 was a remarkable year of transformation at Norfolk Southern  We launched our TOP21 operating plan to transform our railroad while fulfilling our commitment to dramatically improve our service product as we become more efficient  We ve made tremendous strides on both of those fronts and delivered progress on our strategic plan  In the face of a challenging volume environment  we re pleased to share our results today that demonstrate this organization s strong momentum in streamlining our operations and making substantial progress toward our long term commitments  thanks to the hard work and significant efforts by our workforce and leaders Slide four highlights those results  For the quarter  EPS was  2 55  and the operating ratio was 64 2   For the full year  income from operations reached record levels at nearly  4 billion  resulting in a record operating ratio of 64 7   a 70 basis point improvement over 2018  Earnings per share increased 8  to  10 25  We ve now achieved record operating ratio results for four consecutive years  This year s improvement is particularly impressive against the backdrop of contracting volumes  These records demonstrate our commitment to continuous improvement  And underscore our steadfast dedication to creating shareholder value  Despite volumes deteriorating throughout the year  culminating in fourth quarter and full year volume declines of 9  and 5   respectively  we remained focused on running our railroad as efficiently as possible and with a high level of customer service  achieving our locomotive and T E workforce productivity goals despite having less freight to haul These efforts contributed to the record full year results I mentioned a moment ago  and the core margin improvement accomplished during the fourth quarter  which Mark will discuss shortly  demonstrates the significant momentum we re carrying into 2020 and beyond  As we enter 2020  we continue to build on the strategic plan initiatives we launched in 2019  While rolling out Phase three of our PSR based operating plan  TOP21  which will drive additional productivity across our resource base  all while maintaining the high quality service product established in 2019  The team will provide additional details regarding these initiatives as well as further details on our fourth quarter and full year results  Alan will cover trends in revenue  Mike will cover operational performance  and Mark will go over the financial results I ll now turn the call over to Alan Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerThank you  Jim  and good morning  everyone  Macroeconomic headwinds challenged volume in 2019  particularly in the second half of the year  With these tough conditions  we continued our focus on margin improvement  supported by the value that our outstanding service product creates in the market  On slide six  excess truck capacity  trade and economic uncertainty and manufacturing weakness negatively affected our markets  driving a 9  decline in volume  We partially mitigated the impact of declining volumes with stronger revenue per unit excluding fuel in all three of our business units  including quarterly records in our Merchandise and intermodal business groups  Norfolk Southern s revenue per unit has increased year over year for the last 12 quarters despite the market cycles over that period of time The weak manufacturing environment and low commodity prices drove down Merchandise volumes in all groups  except chemicals  led by a 17  decline in steel  Import steel tariffs affected the traffic flows and lower steel prices reflected weak demand  Merchandise volume declines were partially offset by an increase in crude oil  which more than doubled its volume year over year  Intermodal revenue declined 8  due to excess truck capacity in a weak freight environment  International comparisons were difficult as the inventory pull forward drove a spike in fourth quarter 2018 volume  Coal volume and revenue were down 21  year over year  with the largest volume decline in utility coal  Our Northern utility portfolio was impacted by low gas prices and combined cycle capacity  Export was influenced by falling seaborne met prices and Chinese tariffs  while export thermal prices remained at low levels  making it difficult for U S  coals to compete globally Turning to slide seven  In 2019  revenues decreased 1   despite a 5  decline in total volume  evident from our margin improvement strategy  revenue declines were partially offset by a 3  increase in revenue per unit  Merchandise revenue reached a record  6 8 billion in 2019  while volume declined 3   Volume headwinds occurred from weakness in the manufacturing economy  the lose truck market and declines in steel and natural gas liquids  We were favored by fuel price differentials that boosted crude oil demand to East Coast refineries  and we secured increased aggregate volume  Intermodal revenue decreased 2  on a 4  volume decline as gains in international were offset by domestic declines Lower spot truck prices and excess capacity in the trucking industry  reduced domestic intermodal demand in this weak freight environment  Turning to coal  Revenue declined 8   Utility volume declines were predominantly in the north  where low natural gas prices suppressed coal burn  while southern utilities benefited from inventory build in the first half of the year  Depressed seaborne coking coal and thermal prices led to lower export volumes and prices that were further impacted by production issues  While uncertain economic conditions negatively impacted revenue and volume in 2019  we maintained our focus on improving our service and creating a product that will enable our customers and Norfolk Southern to grow when the freight environment improves This approach supports our strategy of margin improvement  which is reflected in our increasing revenue per unit  providing opportunities for operating leverage when demand improves  Moving to our outlook on slide eight  We are closely monitoring developments in the macro economy and its impact on the industries and business segments in which we compete as well as our customers  expectations as we execute our strategy  GDP growth is expected to be in the 2  range in 2020 with the majority of that growth from personal consumption  creating opportunities in our consumer driven intermodal and Merchandise markets  Continued weakness in manufacturing  low commodity prices will impact our coal franchise in other segments of our merchandise markets  Overall  we have not seen an inflection point in volume trends and a high degree of uncertainty exists We see growth potential as we move into the second half of 2020 due to forecasted improvement in the trucking and industrial sectors and easier comparisons  U S  light vehicle production is forecast to improve more than 5  in 2020  Improved price differentials are predicted to sustain fourth quarter 2019 crude volume levels through 2020  Overall  we expect total Merchandise revenue improvement enabled by our strategy with continued support from our consistent  reliable and quality service product  The truck market remains lose with spot rates leveling off  yet our customers and data providers forecast some tightening later in the year  Based on this information and new business initiatives  our intermodal revenue and volume are expected to grow in 2020  In coal  additional gas and renewable generation capacity continues to erode coal share of electricity generation Coking and seaborne thermal coal indices are substantially below prior levels  impacting both export volume and pricing  In summary  as headwinds persist in the freight environment  we expect 2020 revenue to be flat with the first quarter similar to the fourth quarter of last year  and conditions improving as the year progresses  We remain focused on a disciplined pursuit of efficiency while recognizing the value our consistent  fast and reliable service product creates for our customers  In light of continued economic uncertainty and with our demonstrated willingness and ability to adjust to market conditions  this approach provides the platform from which we will further enhance value for both our customers and shareholders I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations Michael J  Wheeler    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerThank you  Alan  Today  I will update you on the state of our operations  In the fourth quarter  we continued to deliver strong service for our customers and significant cost savings  which drove a record operating ratio for the year  This operational leverage is driven by our relentless execution of the core PSR principles and our TOP21 operating plan  Moving to slide 10  Our network is running fast and on time  Record train performance and record terminal dwell drove near record car level velocity and strong asset utilization for Norfolk Southern and our customers  These achievements support our strategy to meet our customers  expectations while eliminating costs and prudently managing our assets  Our momentum has continued into 2020 and will be a tailwind to our initiatives this year As seen on slide 11  our operational performance is driving strong service levels as evidenced by our customer facing metrics  Intermodal availability  which measures our customer commitment to grounding of the box  shipment consistency  which measures trip plan adherence for merchandise traffic and local operating plan adherence  which measures execution of the critical First Mile and Last Mile of service  All of these metrics were at or near record levels  We have been sharing our metrics with our customers for well over a decade  and we use them to have data driven discussions to confirm the value of our service product  We remain committed to providing a high level of service for our customers while achieving our productivity goals  Turning to our service and productivity metrics on slide 12 These metrics align with our strategic plan as they measure key productivity and customer service levels  We have been aggressively reducing our resources to meet our productivity goals despite the drop in our GTMs  Starting with the service delivery index  which is the on time delivery performance of our scheduled shipments indexed to 2018  This is a customer facing metric that combines shipment consistency and intermodal availability  which were detailed on the previous slide  We exceeded our 2019 goal and actually achieved our 2021 goal two years earlier  We will maintain this high level of service by continuing to execute our TOP21 plan  We exceeded our 2019 T E productivity goal despite a significant drop in GTMs We are at our lowest T E headcount on record while still providing exceptional service  We are realizing the benefit of our TOP21 plan  which has the added benefit of capacity in the train plan to allow for growth on the existing trains  While we missed our 2019 train weight goal for the full year  we actually met the goal in the second half of the year with the implementation of our TOP21 plan  We have  however  taken another look that our 2021 train weight goal in light of the continued change in the coal market  We believe the new goal of 6 700 tons  which is 5  higher than our baseline  reflects the improved productivity of our TOP21 operating plan  while taking into account the projected mix  We also met our goal for locomotive productivity for the year by aggressively rationalizing our locomotive fleet  which is 20  lower than 2018 As mentioned in our previous call  this has allowed us to significantly rationalize the resources associated with the maintenance of these locomotives  including a reduction of 600 positions last year and an additional 135 positions this year  Regarding fuel  we will benefit from our lower locomotive fleet size  our aggressive implementation of energy management technology and our DC to AC conversions  And the cars online continues to be a positive story for Norfolk Southern  As we noted throughout the year  we exceeded our original 2021 goal  thanks to our fast and consistent service product  To that end  we have established a new goal of 129 000 cars going forward  which includes cars in storage that can be deployed as market conditions warrant In summary  we are confident we will meet our productivity goals for this year as we will now have the momentum of full year benefits of our previous rightsizing of our workforce and locomotive fleet  This will get us more than halfway to our 2021 productivity goals this year  As you can see on slide 13  we accelerated our progress in reducing crew starts during the fourth quarter  We continued to build on the success of TOP21 with phase two of the plan  which included an initial consolidation of some bulk movements into the manifest network and dividends from our yearlong Clean Sheeting program  This improved fluidity is allowing for the continued reduction in yard and local assignments  This quarterly year over year improvement accelerated in the fourth quarter  with the majority of these improvements being long term structural gains As previously mentioned on the other slide  we have capacity in the new plan to accept additional volumes without a commensurate rise in crew starts  We anticipate continued strong year over year comparisons as we begin to roll out phase three of TOP21  completing delivery of the promised three phases of the program in 1 5 years instead of the anticipated three years  Going forward our network planning and operations group will be evaluating the plan and the network for further optimizations  In closing  this has been a critical year for Norfolk Southern  We started the year by detailing our implementation of the core PSR principles  We have successfully executed on these principles despite a challenging market  Our service is at record levels  We achieved a record operating ratio and our serious injury ratio was the lowest in the last five years  We are carrying this momentum into 2020 I will now turn it over to Mark  who will cover the financials Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Mike  and good morning  everyone  Before we get into the detailed P L  I want to point to a chart in the appendix that specifies for you some large and unusual items that impact the results and comparisons versus 2018  I d like to talk to those impacts upfront on slide 15 for the sake of clarity  This chart illustrates the effect of those items on the OR and EPS for the quarter as well as for the year  The reported changes to OR and EPS are reflected on the bottom row  and we distill those drivers in the white rose above  The first item  as you may recall  relates to a property sale in the Atlanta area in the fourth quarter of 2018  That particular gain was  112 million and creates an OR headwind of 380 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 100 basis points for the full year  with a headwind to EPS of about  0 30 Next was the  32 million receivable write off arising from a legal dispute that we called out in the third quarter  This reduced the 2019 OR by 30 basis points and EPS by  0 09  The final headwind involves the non operating impairment that we booked in the second quarter related to the natural resource assets we have been actively marketing  In the fourth quarter  we took an additional  21 million impairment related to those same assets  and that had a  0 06 impact to EPS in the quarter  And when added to the two    the second quarter impairment loss  the EPS impact for the full year was  0 14  You ll note we had a low effective tax rate in the quarter  This was driven by certain income tax credits authorized by Congress in December of 2019  which were retroactive to 2018  The impact to the fourth quarter EPS was  0 07  and for the full year  it was  0 04 Beyond these unusual items  the core improvement in the OR was 240 basis points for the quarter and 200 basis points for the full year  while core improvement to EPS was  0 28 for the quarter and  1 23 for the year  Now moving to the fourth quarter  slide 16  Revenue was down 7  in the quarter  driven by a 9  volume contraction  partially offset by RPU improvement  Operating expenses  as reported  were 5  lower  including five points of headwind from the absence of the prior year land sale  Drilling into the expense categories on slide 17  As Mike illustrated earlier  our TOP21 PSR based operating plan has reduced the amount of resources we need to run the network  resulting in fewer trains and lower crew starts manifesting in substantial cost savings across multiple expense categories  Starting with compensation and benefits We drove a  127 million reduction in expenses in the fourth quarter  That s a decline of 17  on a 16  reduction in employees  Our employment levels declined throughout the quarter  and this  along with lower overtime  health and welfare benefits as well as less re crews  saved us  86 million  This favorability was partially offset by  17 million of additional expense due to inflation in pay rates  In the quarter  incentive compensation expense was lower by  57 million  due largely to last year s higher payout that disproportionately impacted the fourth quarter of 2018  So we drove average headcount down by approximately 1 500 employees from last quarter and have reduced by 4 200 compared to the last year  Run rate benefits from this will continue into 2020 on top of additional efficiency actions  Moving to fuel Reduced consumption and lower prices drove a  52 million decline in fuel expense  We improved on our fuel efficiency as fuel consumption declined by 11  on the 9  decrease in volumes  despite adverse mix from weaker coal where our fuel efficiency is strongest  Here in 2020  fuel efficiency is getting intense attention through various initiatives  including continued locomotive upgrades and deeper energy management penetration as Mike mentioned  Moving over to purchase services  rents and materials  Our initiatives to improve asset utilization are also driving a reduction in expenses  The increased network velocity  improved fluidity  and fewer locomotives and freight cars on the network drove  15 million in savings associated with equipment rents and  12 million in savings of material cost  These expenses    sorry  these savings were partially offset by increased detouring costs due to a bridge wash out and derailment expenses that amounted to  13 million collectively The fast response and strong execution by our operations team limited the financial impact of the derailment to only half of the  25 million we signaled at the last earnings call  So when looking at the big picture  the underlying change to our cost structure accelerated in the fourth quarter as we continue to drive resource reductions through the end of the year  The full year effect of those savings will be realized in 2020  Moving to slide 18  Let s take a look at our summarized fourth quarter financial results  Other income included  31 million of favorability from investment returns on our corporate owned life insurance  where we had positive returns in Q4 2019 versus losses in Q4 of 2018  We also had  50 million of higher gains on the sale of non operating properties than prior year  These amounts were partially offset by the additional  21 million asset impairment loss that I mentioned earlier  The lower effective tax rate  19 6   was driven by both the retroactive tax credits as well as higher non taxable returns on the corporate owned life insurance  Income taxes will represent some headwind in 2020 as we expect the tax rate to be between 23  and 24  Shifting to the full year on slide 19  We delivered impressive results for the year in the face of accelerating declines in revenue and the net headwind items we discussed on slide 15  We reduced railway operating expenses by  192 million  We set company records for operating income and operating ratio  Our railway operating ratio improved 70 basis points over 2018  Net income improved by 2   but diluted earnings per share grew 8  to  10 25 for the full year aided by a 5  reduction in our average share count  Achieving the cost reductions while pushing delivery performance for our customers to record levels  demonstrates our commitment to long term value creation  Recapping on slide 20  our full year cash flows from operating activities was  3 9 billion  and free cash flow for the year was a record at nearly  1 9 billion  Dividends and share repurchases for the year totaled over  3 billion  So to close  we clearly have created momentum on the cost side  despite the volume challenges and obstacles that were unforeseen at the beginning of the year  It s that momentum  plus new initiatives  which provides us with strong leverage going into 2020 to continue to drive profit growth and margin expansion Thank you  and I ll turn the call back over to Jim James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Mark  As you ve heard on the call today  the Norfolk Southern team made tremendous strides in executing the strategic plan we laid out a year ago  Amid a rapidly changing macroeconomic landscape  we pivoted our productivity initiatives and achieved a locomotive fleet reduction of 20  and a workforce reduction of 8  for the full year average  with those figures accelerating to 22  and 16   respectively  in the fourth quarter  These resource adjustments significantly outpaced the volume declines  demonstrating strong cost momentum while maintaining exceptionally strong customer service levels  Turning to slide 22  I ll wrap up with our 2020 expectations  First and foremost  we will continue to execute our strategic plan with the top priority of running the most efficient railroad possible while being a best in class supply chain partner for our customers As you heard  we are modeling net overall revenue to be flat for the year  with persistent headwinds in coal to be offset by improving comparisons in Merchandise and intermodal as the year progresses  Despite    and within that environment  we have confidence that our productivity and efficiency formula will result in significant operating ratio improvement this year that will get us more than halfway to our committed 60  OR in 2021  Lastly  as we continue to execute our highly effective locomotive fleet modernization program  we re targeting a capital expenditures program between 16  and 18  of revenues  We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through a 1 3 dividend payout ratio  with remaining cash and borrowing capacity used for share repurchases This disciplined capital allocation strategy represents our commitment to enhanced shareholder value through returning capital and ensuring Norfolk Southern is positioned for continued success  Before we turn it over to questions  I want to thank each and every NS employee for their hard work and commitment to the strategic transformation of our railroad  Thank you for your attention We ll now open the line for Q A  Operator Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna  With us go ahead Bascome Majors    Susquehanna    AnalystMark  you ve been in the CFO seat for about three months now and have had some time to get the lay of the land  Could you just take a step back and kind of give us versus your expectations coming in  Kind of what s as expected  maybe what has surprised you  And are there any changes that we should expect to see as investors with you leading the finance organization versus how assets handled things historically Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThanks for the question  Yes  coming in from the outside  a different industry  a culture that clearly is different than the one I ve come from  I would say that I m surprised that we see a great blend here of long tenured industry experts  who are very passionate about not just the business  but the industry itself  and the infusion of new talent that come from different walks of life and different industry experiences and that they re actually being welcomed with their new ideas  including my own  frankly  coming from the outside  So that s been kind of a pleasant surprise  I would say  I was not expecting such a welcoming with regard to the new ideas and new concepts being brought in I m also kind of impressed by the speed and agility of an old company  so to speak  to react to a very rapidly changing economic environment  You see the charts that Mike showed on how quickly we ve taken resources out to respond to volume declines  And then nimbleness  I would say  has surprised me  And coming in  another big observation is just how capital intensive this business is compared to where I ve come from  We  obviously  spend a couple billion dollars a year in capex  We ve got over  30 billion of fixed assets  And so it s certainly an area that I need to drill into a little bit more on understanding why we spend so much  certainly  half of that is related to maintaining this big infrastructure to serve your customers and to do it safely But I do want to understand the rationale for the spends that we have  The justification financially for them and the prioritization process  So it s something that I expect to dig into a little bit  And maybe you ve seen a little bit on this call  too  We just want to be transparent with the investment community about the path that we re on of which is to get to a 60  OR by 2021 OperatorOur next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research  Please share with your questions Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystSo Mark  I m hoping you can help us with a little bit more clarity on some of the numbers here  So can you give us the    what the real estate gains above the line were in the fourth quarter  And any expectations for this year in terms of what s assumed in the guidance  And then similarly  with incentive comp  I know it was down in  19 versus  18  Any way to think about is 2020 a year of the headwind tailwind or normal  Any help there Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerSorry  The second question  Scott Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystWas just on incentive comp  should we think about that as a headwind in  20  Or is it  20 versus  19  sort of just a normal year on incentive comp Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerNo  We would hope that incentive comp is a headwind because we re hoping to have a better year in 2020 than we did  obviously  this year  where we fell a little bit short  So clearly  that will be a little bit of headwind for us  With regard to the real estate  excluding the big one that we carved out for you  gains in the year were a little bit higher than they were last year  less than  20 million  In the fourth quarter  roughly half of that benefit we saw in the fourth quarter of this year So we had about  10 million of additional gains in  19 versus the fourth quarter of  18  excluding the big one that we carved out  And the guidance  Scott  on real estate  In any given year  we re expecting  40 million to  60 million of gains  It s going to be lumpy  be back loaded  It could happen middle of the year  with real estate  you never are quite sure when you can get things to close and get over the finish line  But we ended this year excluding    sorry  we ended last year excluding the big gain in that range  And the same thing this year  we ended within that range Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then    so on the revenue guidance of flat  maybe if you have a thought on our volumes down and yields up  And then it does feel like you guys are losing some share on the volume side  but clearly doing well on the yield side  Are you OK with that  yield up strategy and the trade off of better yields  but weaker volumes than maybe your peer  Or do you feel like you ve pushed it too far  Or just some thoughts how you re approaching the market James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerScott  it s Jim  Let me take the second part of that  The market share question  and then I ll turn it over to Alan to give you some more color on the components of our revenue guidance for this year  We are targeting the truck market  That s the market share opportunity  That s the big opportunity for us  And that is the linchpin of our growth strategy  is getting trucks off the road onto the railroad  So    and there are opportunities there when it comes to our growth engine  intermodal  And there are also opportunities in the Merchandise round  So    and we are also certainly committed to achieving value for the services we provide  which value is quite strong these days  We ve got a great service product out in the marketplace  And we re very proud of that and think that we can create value for our customers through that service  So Alan  a little bit more color on the 2020 revenue outlook Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerYes  Scott  coal is going to be a drag throughout the year  And it s going to be a drag both in volume and in price  We ve got a great service product out there  And we re taking a long term view of our markets  We take a long term view of our approach with our customers as well and so we re very disciplined in securing the value and understanding the value that our service product creates for our customers  As Jim noted  our eyes are on that  800 billion truck market  And that s where the growth opportunities are  And that s where we re going to see improvement as the year progresses  It s    it requires fierce competition and putting new products out there  new logistics services that our customers value And we re doing it from a platform in which I ll remind you  we went out in front of our customers  and we told them what we were going to do with our operating changes with PSR  And then we did it  And there we ve created a lot of credibility with our customers for our no surprises approach to our operating plant changes  We implemented it flawlessly  And what s unique about Norfolk Southern is that as we implemented PSR  our service got better  And so we re in a great position to grow as we move forward  And if you think about truck and the opportunities there  it aligns perfectly with the unique strengths of our franchise  We have a powerful intermodal franchise  And we have a very broad and diverse Merchandise franchise as well  and we re focused on opportunities to take business from truck and merchandise as well OperatorNext question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with GR Energy Services  Let s just hear their questions Allison Poliniak    GR Energy Services    AnalystIt s Allison  Just a question  I just want to circle back to the cars online commentary  If I heard you correctly  I think you said that  that number included a level of storage so that there is some flex on flying or expected to up group  Can you just go through that again  sorry James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  That s right  Allison  That s how we calculate that number  And we do it that way because we want to focus on the velocity of our entire car fleet  including those that are in storage  So that we re    that s an asset that remains on the books  and we want to make sure that it  too  is being taken into account as we think about utilization of the freight car asset Michael J  Wheeler    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  This is Mike  Of that 129 000  we have 17 000 cars in storage that is available to us to flex up when the business arrives  and we re pretty excited about that Allison Poliniak    GR Energy Services    AnalystGreat  And then just  obviously  you re well into your strategic plan  Looking back over the past few months  what s been your greatest surprise in terms of your ability to perform in this environment James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI think Mark did a good job describing the progress that we have made  the core operating and core earnings improvement that we made in the fourth quarter  So the momentum stands out for all of us  I think  and that s not a surprise  and that we ve been driving it  We ve been focused on accelerating the improvements as we move throughout the year  and we did it in fourth quarter  and that will carry over into 2020 and beyond OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch  Please proceed with your question Ken Hoexter    Merrill Lynch    AnalystJim  maybe just expanding on that target or    of the 235 basis points year over year  or maybe for Mark  But does that include the headwind of the incentive comp for turning the  40 million to  60 million real estate gains  And then maybe just your thoughts on what s going to happen with the employee base moving forward  Is this    are you    is this kind of the run rate level  Do you still see more productivity on the employee side James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerMark Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Ken  look  I think in terms of headcount  we ve taken a lot out this year  There s actually more to come  So not only will we enjoy the benefit of the full year effect of those employees that came out in the back half of this year  but there are more to come in the beginning part of this year  And then frankly  we just have to see how volume shakes out and determine how much further we can go and absorb the volume that we re assuming to get returned in the back half of the year  Sorry  the first half of your question  Ken Ken Hoexter    Merrill Lynch    AnalystWas just to ensure that the 235 basis points improvement  which is great  but does it include the headwind of incentive comp   Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerIt does Ken Hoexter    Merrill Lynch    AnalystAnd the real estate gains that you mentioned  That s all baked in  right Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerIt s all baked in  Ken  So the incentive comp returning to normal and the real estate gains being in that  40 million to  60 million in range  It s all part of the calculus Ken Hoexter    Merrill Lynch    AnalystIt s a big number  And then I guess my follow up for Mike  Just note  it looked like you had no targeted improvement in the service delivery Index  Are you changing it to tighten your range  Or why would there not be given all the moves you re making in  I guess  a target for improvement there Michael J  Wheeler    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerSo overall  we re pretty happy with our customer service levels  and our customers are as well  I will say we are targeting tightening some of our windows for delivery to customer and be better on the consistency part  So that s a part of it  but it doesn t roll up necessarily into changes at the macro level  But yes  we re pleased with our service but we re going to continue to dial it in  get better and better in the trucks Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerKen  if I could add something  we collaborate with our customers on our service targets  And Mike noted that for years  we ve been putting service targets out there with our    for our customers and sharing with them our performance  In 2019  we upped the ante  We went out in front of our customers and said  here s what s going to change  With PSR implementation  and here s how your service is going to improve  And then we delivered it  And as you re going to see  our PSR implementation continues to evolve  We continue to make improvements and we re putting a product out there that helps us compete with truck  And as the truck market tightens as we move throughout the year  it s going to be a growth driver for us  We re very confident in the quality of the product that we re delivering  and we re pricing to that effect OperatorThe next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS  Please just use your question Tom Wadewitz    UBS    AnalystWanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on two of the segments where you have not seen improvement yet  So I m thinking your purchased services  would you expense    would you expect that line to improve in 2020 or 2021 as a result of phase three and TOP21 or the terminal improvement program  how do we think about that line  And also maybe a little more on fuel efficiency James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerMark Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I ll take that  Tom  So look  purchased services  Clearly  there is intermodal terminal operating costs that are in there  I wouldn t call them strictly volume variable  There is an element of fixed cost in there as well or committed cost in there  But bear in mind that in our purchase services category  we ve also got other things that are not volume variable  For example  a lot of the maintenance cost for the network that you don t capitalize flow through this line  So when you have repairs to rails and you have to maintain the trees and ensure that the lines are clear  A lot of the costs for maintenance of the infrastructure cannot be capitalized  It goes into this category  Building leases and rental costs are in there  And then the other piece that you have to bear in mind  Tom  is there s a fair amount of technology cost that flows through there  similar to what I described with maintenance  There is a lot of the IT spend that can t be capitalized  runs through this line category  And frankly  it s a growing category The good news  however  is a lot of those investments we re making in technology are delivering returns in other words in the P L  as you saw through the call today  So we re investing in things like automation  It allows us to leave ourselves of some headcount related to more transactional tasks  And we expect to continue to invest in this technology element as well  So that s  in large part  why purchased services is not moving as quick as we like  All of that said  I ve got to dig in there a little bit  and we ve talked about it quite a bit  We ve got to look at this bucket for opportunities in 2020  It is an area where I think it s right for us to dig into a little bit more Your second question on fuel  We made progress in Q4 with some levels of efficiency  and we re really relying on a step change improvement going into 2020 in fuel  The team has organized well  We continue the upgrades from DC to AC  That provides a lot of benefits to us in many ways  including fuel  but on top of that  we re having deeper energy management penetration  And so it s clearly an area in 2020 that we hope to see significant progress on Tom Wadewitz    UBS    AnalystJust    if I can get a brief follow up  Jim  I think there is maybe a little increase in discussion in December on volume sensitivity of the  60 million OR target for 2021  Your guidance for 2020 seems to indicate there s not a lot of concern about volume  But how should we broadly think about the volume sensitivity of getting to  60 million  Do you need to improve volume growth in 2021  Or how do we broadly think about that James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  let me say first  this is a cost structure  cost reduction based plan  particularly in 2020  where we forecast flat revenue  So it s always all about achieving the efficiencies that we ve tried to lay out for you that we have achieved already in 2019 and then rolling into this year and next  As far as 2021 is concerned  maybe get a little bit of a tailwind from some growth at that point  But we re not factoring in a lot  It s    it remains fundamentally in an efficiency oriented financial plan even as we move into 2021 OperatorOur next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi  Please state your questions Chris Wetherbee    Citi    AnalystI wanted to dig in a little bit on the coal outlook  if we could  specifically maybe exports  Can we    Alan  can you help us understand a little bit better  how we should be thinking about I think there s two impacts here  probably one on the volume side and then on the yield side  Maybe sequentially on the yield  should we see    expect a step down in 1Q as some of these contracts get reset based on commodity prices  And then how should we think about the volume  Just trying to put some numbers around the coal headwinds we re looking at in 2020 Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerAll right  Chris  let s refresh where we were as we move through 2019 and first quarter and second quarter 2019  Net coal prices were above  205 a metric ton  And then they started cascading down to around  160 in the third quarter and a closer to  140   145 in the fourth  And so as we ve talked about frequently  we saw sequential declines in both volume and in price in our met coal franchise  which is    export franchise  which is about 2 3 of our export coal  which makes up about 25  of our overall coal volume  Right now where coal prices are now  it s in the low  150s  You re going to see a lot of pressure on price  And just recall  Chris that our RPU and export coal met was at its highest point in the first quarter of last year as prices were at the highest point And so you    comps  Comps are most difficult in the beginning of the year  There s not a lot of demand in Europe  And as a result  you re seeing coals sourced from other locations globally are being put out onto the water  And so there s increased competition for us there  Then of course  you know what s going on with thermal  That is going to have a market impact on export thermal volumes  So you re going to see volume pressure in both met and thermal exports  and you re going to see particular price pressure on net exports Chris Wetherbee    Citi    AnalystOkay  And the yield pressure is toughest in the first part of the year 2020 Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerRelative to last year  yes Chris Wetherbee    Citi    AnalystGot it  Okay  All right  No  That s helpful  And then  Jim  maybe a bigger picture question  coming back to the last one about OR in 2021 and some of your thoughts there  So some significant improvement this year and expectations for 2020  When we think about maybe some of those tailwinds that you could get from revenue growth  potentially returning in 2021  And given the progress you ve made so far  how do you think about sort of the potential of the business  So I think a lot of us spend time focusing on your performance relative to peers  Is that the right way we should be thinking about it  So some of the numbers that we re seeing from some of the other rails out there  Are those the types of potential ORs we can expect from Norfolk over time  Just want to get a sense of how you re feeling about it kind of partway through this PSR initiative James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerShould we see upside in the top line  we would expect much of it to flow through operating income and to the bottom line because there will be significant operating leverage in that growth  That s not our base case as we ve been through  but the growth will return and resume at some point  We think we get a lot of operating leverage because we have restructured our costs and believe that we can handle volume growth with the resources on hand  Now there will be areas where we have to increase spending to handle the volume growth depending on how much it is  But by and large  we believe we can handle the volume when it returns with our existing resources OperatorOur next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays  Please just use your question Brandon Oglenski    Barclays    AnalystI guess  Jim  maybe following off that line of questions  As we look at phase three of the TOP21 plan  is that going to drive pretty significant operational changes here  and that s why you guys have the confidence on the cost outlook and the OR improvement in 2020 James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThat will contribute to it and for all the reasons that the last major iteration of TOP21 drove efficiencies  So yes  that s a piece of this  In the next iteration of TOP21  we will continue to focus on train consolidations  on decreasing circuity on running longer  heavier trains to meet the goals that we put out there for those things  So it s really    it s further to the types of goals that we were pursuing in the previous versions of the plan  I think at some point going forward  this becomes continuous improvement  And really  in a way  we re already there  We are looking every day  every week at shorter trains and working on a plan in consultation with our customers in the field to fold those trains into the network and achieve those efficiencies on an ongoing continual basis Brandon Oglenski    Barclays    AnalystOkay  I appreciate that response  And not to get too specific on this call  But Mark  can you talk to the other expense line item  Because I think if we look at it  the last few quarters  it was running around a  60 million run rate  Is that the right level to think in 2020 Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerOther expense Brandon Oglenski    Barclays    AnalystYes Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerHang on  Yes  That s about the right level to be thinking about it  Brandon OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens  pleasers what s your question Justin Long    Stephens    AnalystSo maybe to start with the quarter  there were some onetime items that you ve called out in the prepared remarks  So I was wondering if you could just help us understand if all of these items were baked into the guidance that you gave for 2019  I just wanted to get a better understanding of how things performed operationally in the fourth quarter versus what you expected James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerRefer to Mark s opening slide for the components of the OR change and the EPS change  some of which were nonrecurring  others of which represent core earnings production during the quarter  Mark Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So the    when you go back to the appendix chart  basically  the property sale  we    in 2018  we knew when we were building the 2020    sorry  the 2019 plan that we wouldn t be having a similar sale of that size  But the receivable write off and the two asset impairments that we incurred in Q2 and Q4 were unforeseen  So those impacts are clearly not contemplated when the 2019 guidance was given James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd there were some other things that the taxes were lower Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd tax rate was lower in the fourth quarter  That was not how we projected when we gave the guidance on the quarter Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerSo basically  think about it as those three roads  the receivable write off asset impairment and the retroactive income tax credit were the surprises to us at the time of guidance a year ago Justin Long    Stephens    AnalystOkay  Great  That s really helpful  And then secondly  I wanted to ask about Intermodal  Would love to get your thoughts on domestic intermodal growth this year  And what you re expecting  And then just from a margin perspective in Intermodal  as PSR gets fully implemented  And how do you expect incremental margins within Intermodal to stack up relative to the rest of the business  I know historically  you ve talked about intermodal incrementals being lower than general merchandising coal  I m just wondering if that rank order could change post PSR James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAlan Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerJustin  we are expecting some growth in our intermodal franchise as the year progresses  As I noted  we re collaborating with our customers to look for logistics solutions that fit their needs  And we re really fortunate because we re aligned with the best channel partners in the business  and they re focused on growth  They understand our network  And so we re collaborating to see where we can compete with truck  We re encouraged to see an inflection in spot rates and truck  We haven t seen like a big up tick in it  So the first order    or first derivative isn t all that great  but the second derivative is  I mean it s certainly stabilized and is improving  and that s going to provide some headroom for incremental volumes for intermodal as the year progresses  In addition to new service projects    products that we re launching  And as we go through TOP21 V 3  we re going to look at consolidating some business  We re also going to look at reopening some lights and introducing new businesses for us James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd Justin  in terms of the incrementals within the intermodal sector  I would say this  for the last couple of years  the incrementals have actually been excellent during periods in which we were growing volume  The    just looking back historically  one of the things that did hold intermodal incrementals back a little bit was fixed costs associated with the intermodal volume growth I e  terminals and equipment costs  There    as Mark went through  we re very focused on asset cost in this plan  And in the case of intermodal  making maximum use of the assets that we have  the terminals  the equipment that we have today  And keeping to a minimum  the growth capex that we re putting into that business  So lots of initiatives around terminal improvement processes and particularly in the environment we re in  keeping a lid on equipment costs OperatorOur next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets  Please just see with your questions Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystSo just going back to the materials and other line item  forgetting for now    I just want to be clear  forgetting for now the fourth quarter 2018 impact  And just looking at your quarterly run rate through 2019  you were averaging anywhere from  190 million  196 million  and you stepped down to  130 million in the fourth quarter  Is that all due to the gain that you had in the fourth quarter  And can you tell us exactly what the gain was  the amount of the gains in the fourth quarter Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThat was the property gain  The absence of the property gain from last year  which was  112 million Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystYes  No  I m talking    forget last year  I m just talking the cadence of the materials and other line expense in the    through 2019  was  190 million  and it stepped down to  60 million in the fourth quarter  I m just trying to understand what caused the quarter sequential step down from what was  190 million per quarter through 2019 to drop to  130 million James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSome of that was the efficiencies that we achieved in material spending in the fourth quarter  as Mark went through  This is one efficiency pickup by virtue of having a smaller locomotive fleet  And a car fleet out there  where we incur lower equipment maintenance expense Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystSo what was the gains in the quarter  I guess  is the question I m asking James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerMark Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerIt was around  40 million     45 million Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystSo you were guiding at the beginning of the year for  30 million to  40 million for the full year  and you did  45 million in the fourth quarter  Is that    am I getting that right Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer 40 million to  60 million Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerWell  we re guiding now  40 million to  60 million  I don t know what was said in the beginning of the call James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI mean we ve always said that this is going to be lumpy and unpredictable  And now you do tend to get more real estate closings at the end of the year  I think that probably is a pattern that you see a little bit better gain in the fourth quarter  But it is    we ve produced about  40 million to  60 million  excluding one off gains like we had in the fourth quarter of 2018  That s about what we d like to do going forward  But it will vary by quarter from time to time Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  So you were at  30 million to  40 million embedded in your guidance for 2019 at the beginning of the year  And now it came in  as I understand  at  40 million to  60 million  of which  45 million was included in the fourth quarter James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerRight  Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerCorrect Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  Got it  Okay Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerSo we ended the year kind of at that closer to  60 million Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst 60 million  OK  of which  45 million was all in the fourth quarter Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThat s correct Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  Okay  And then on the tax side or the tax  I ve got    is it    so  19 of retroactive tax adjustment would get your effective tax rate back up to around 22   still trending fairly quite a bit below where    was there anything else in the quarter versus the guidance that you were giving before  23  to 24   Or is that just a lower tax rate Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  We had more benefits than we assumed from the coal gains  which are tax exempt  In addition  we have the 45G tax credits that we just talked about and disclosed  but there was also higher deductions from stock based compensation  So everything kind of just went in the right direction for us this year  So that s why the ETR ended a little bit lower than what we would typically guide Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystIs there something that you would call out as just kind of an exceptional number because I don t mind lower taxes on lower expenses  But that tax    retroactive tax adjustment  Is there anything else that was onetime in that quarter that would   Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerNo  there was nothing out of period in the quarter  No Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  Okay  OK  And last question here is on the revenue    so your revenue s flat for next year  The guidance that you had given through the year  last year was a little bit more on the optimistic side  Obviously  a lot of things happened unexpectedly  What confidence do you have that  while you re giving flat guidance  It is above your peer  Are you being a little bit more optimistic  Is there just the coal markets that you serve are just a little bit more advantageous  Can you give us a sense of what comfort you have that flat and rebounding off  I think you said Q1 will be the same as Q4  which is coming off a minus 7  base  That suggests it s going to be a pretty hefty growth rate  offset in the back half of the year James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAlan Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerYes  We are    Walter  our growth is targeted toward the back half of the year  and it s reflecting the strength of our intermodal franchise and some revenue growth within merchandise  and it s about launching new products that generate revenue growth with our customers  We re confident that we re going to be able to execute it OperatorOur next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan  Please shoot your questions Brian Ossenbeck    JP Morgan    AnalystA question for Mike on train ways  Can you just clarify    if you said that the second half met the target when you put anything plan  Was that the new or the old target that you were tracking against  And then if you can just comment on the level of confidence you have in meeting new target  especially if coal declines more than expected  maybe have some mix shift that goes toward the lighter intermodal or even if volumes come in lower than you would think at this point Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerYes  So that was against our 2019 goal  And the    so for the full year  we met that goal for the back half  like we said we would on the calls with just TOP21 rolled in and drove train weight increases  particularly in the Merchandise market  So our Merchandise trains continue to be strong and growing in train length  Intermodal is not  and that s an area we have to continue to focus on  And the phase three of the TOP21 plan does that Brian Ossenbeck    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  So despite the lower mix of coal  the key is really phase three in terms of building bigger and longer trains  even if volumes are flat or approximately down Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerSo it s phase 3  And it s what Jim talked about  this continued optimization of the network  We continually look at trains that aren t running its size as we want them to and find ways to make them bigger and without affecting service  And we re doing that as we speak Brian Ossenbeck    JP Morgan    AnalystA quick follow up for Mark  if I could  Just on the capex  You mentioned you re taking a look at some of the line items  trying to figure out the spending level  Obviously  it s a short time in the seat for now  but just want to make sure I wasn t reading too much into that because clearly Norfolk has a heavy locomotive rebuild program  but clearly  your peers are spending  in some cases  quite a bit less from a capex intensity  So maybe you can just expand on that a little bit Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Look  right now  the way we spend our capex budget  as Jim said  it s between 16  and 18  of revenue  Roughly 60  of that is supporting the core network  It s the maintenance of way and it s the rail replacement ties and ballast  We put roughly 20  for the locomotive upgrades  And that s  again  the DC to AC conversions  And as I ve learned  this replacement approach is actually generating very reliable product that s performing very well in the field  and it s actually much cheaper than buying newer locomotives  So that s logical  And then the other 20  bucket is comprised of a lot of other things  but primarily IT spend and digital technology spend  So that s kind of how we break down our capex I m getting in  and I m just trying to understand it because it s    obviously  it s a big use of funds for us  and we want to just    I want to understand the disciplines around it and just pressure test a lot of the assumptions that have been in there on the adequacy and how much we need to spend  I m not    we re not    that s not to say that we re going to change the guidance anytime soon  I m just letting you know that coming in fresh  because it was in response to that question  what are the things that surprised me  it was looking at this level of spend and as I learned the industry  I m understanding it better  but it doesn t mean I m not going to bring a different lens to it and push a little OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company  Let s just hear their question Jason Seidl    Cowen and Company    AnalystWant to go back to international intermodal  Clearly  there were some headwind pull forward in 4Q  But if I recall that actually pushed into 1Q a little bit  When should we see the inflection point of those volumes turning up  And does the uncertainty of the coronavirus actually impact you guys at all  Or is that too early to tell yet James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAlan Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerJason  you re absolutely correct  We did see elevated international intermodal volumes in the first couple of months of 2019  And so as the year progresses  comps will get a little bit easier for us  And then that s where we re expecting to start seeing growth  With respect to the coronavirus  it doesn t help  There s no doubt about that  We ve talked to our customers about that and the level of impact that they re anticipating is unknown at this point  It s all speculation  So we re paying close attention to it as are the steamship lines that we serve Jason Seidl    Cowen and Company    AnalystOkay  And my follow up is going to be on the domestic side of things  A couple of railroads  let s call it  the last 1 5 years  pulled back a little bit on some of the lanes that they serve with PSR  Do you think that there is a need for more lanes going forward once the market does tighten up in the U S  truckload  Or do you think the lanes that the industry currently has are good enough to service and get that freight back from the highways onto the railroads Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerWell  Jason  I think there s both  I think we re going to see  as the truck market tightens  we re going to see the benefits of our powerful intermodal franchise and organic growth in the lanes that we serve  And then as I noted  we re working feverishly with our interline partners and with our customers to look at new lanes that offer value to our customers and offer value to our shareholders  So this is not static  It s a dynamic review of our overall franchise  finding areas where we can provide value  and we can support our channel partner s growth  And as I noted  we re aligned with the best channel partners in the industry  So I m pretty confident that collaborating together  we re going to find avenues for growth OperatorOur next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein  Please take your question David Vernon    Bernstein    AnalystI wanted to ask a little bit about where we should be expecting headcount to come in  in 2020  Ended the year down pretty considerably  And should we be expecting that kind of run rate level  Or should we be expecting further reductions from that from where we ended the year on headcount James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerMark Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerWe re not going to provide a specific headcount number  We are coming down again from the    where we re going to end 2019  for sure  But as I mentioned  we re going to keep pushing it  and then we re going to see where volume goes  As we talked about  we re expecting volume to start turning a little bit for us a little bit in the back half  And if it s not there  we re going to continue to push on employment levels  But we don t have a specific number to share with you David Vernon    Bernstein    AnalystNothing in the budget that you could give us a sense for how much additional sort of headcount reduction there should be in the year Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I mean we clearly have a budget but it is not going to be something that we talk about because we will flex  just like this year  depending on where volume is  we may go heavier James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSo you certainly saw  David  in the fourth quarter when we had to flex we do  and we did  And we pick up the pace throughout the second half  particularly in the fourth quarter  So we will do what s necessary David Vernon    Bernstein    AnalystOkay  And then  I guess  maybe just kind of sequentially  Mark  the other expense line came in at  11 million for the fourth quarter from  95 million in 3Q  60s in one and 2Q  Is there anything that explains that sort of sequential step down in the other expense line for 4Q Mark R  George    Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerI think    yes  it s a little bit of the land sale  is the gains that we had that were back end loaded from the property sales that we talked about  So we had more land sales that came through in the fourth quarter compared to the prior 3 OperatorOur one final question coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystJust a quick question  A lot of talk on the domestic intermodal front  But I m just curious can you talk about international  what proportion of your intermodal franchise is international  whether it be volume or revenue  And how do you think about that as we approach 2020  given still the noise around tariffs  And I m just sort of curious also what the how that    the international franchise actually performed in 2019  Just a relative sense for looking forward Alan H  Shaw    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing OfficerJordan  our International Intermodal franchise is about 35  of our overall intermodal franchise as measured by volume  As I noted earlier  it    we re running up against some pretty tough comps to start the year with the pull forward of activity in the fourth quarter of 2018 that bled over into the first quarter of 2019  We re expecting that it will    the comps will improve as the year progresses  But as with all of our markets  we re generally not expecting growth until the second half of the year OperatorThis concludes our question and answer session  I will now turn the call back over to Mr  Squires for closing comments James A  Squires    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  everyone  We appreciate your questions this morning and look forward to talking with you again when we announce our first quarter 2020 earnings Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  75 minutesCall participants Peter Sharbel    Director of Investor RelationJames A  Squires

Norfolk Southern s fourth quarter results

Data source  Norfolk Southern   

Important details

Norfolk Southern s revenues suffered from a 9  drop in rail volume  in line with the recent trend of weaker shipments due to international trade disputes  declining coal production  and moderating U S  economic growth 
Merchandise shipment revenue dipped 3  to  1 63 billion  while intermodal revenue slipped by 8  to  697 million  Revenues from coal  the railroad s smallest segment  slumped by 21  to  363 million 
Rail operating expenses decreased by 5  to  1 7 billion   Declines in fuel expenses as well as in compensation and benefits were slightly offset by an increase in outlays for purchased services and rents 
The company s admirable expense control manifested in its operating ratio of 64 2   Operating ratio is a measure of a railroad s productivity  and is derived by dividing total expenses by revenue for a given period   The lower the ratio  the better   For the full year  Norfolk Southern achieved a record operating ratio of 64 7  
The company declared a regular quarterly dividend of  0 94 per share    stretching its streak of payouts to 150 consecutive quarters 

Why Norfolk Southern shares rose  and may continue to rise
Though its revenue dropped by 7   Norfolk Southern avoided an even steeper top line slide due to its recent productivity efforts    specifically  its implementation of Precision Scheduled Railroading  or PSR  PSR is a disciplined framework that aims to improve a railroad s operational efficiency through optimizing rail assets  enforcing strict scheduling  improving network routes and fluidity  and working more closely with rail customers to efficiently move cargo 
Norfolk Southern has completed two out of three phases of its PSR effort  In the earnings press release  CEO James Squires observed that the railroad has achieved its initial PSR goals through close communication with customers to avoid disruptions  and that it achieved an  all time best delivery performance  during 2019  This is impressive as the initial steps of PSR projects can often result in delayed shipments as rail carriers begin to tweak their network routes 
Commonly watched metrics used to gauge operational efficiency illustrate the railroad s progress through the year  From January to December  average train speed increased from 21 8 miles per hour to 23 8 miles per hour  Even better  average terminal dwell time during the same period decreased from 23 4 hours to 18 9 hours 
The effect of PSR on the company s financials boosted Norfolk Southern stock on Wednesday  Investors were enthused by the company s bottom line  which exceeded expectations given its volume woes  and they re equally enticed by the probability that Norfolk Southern will wring more productivity from its operations  Competitors CSX and Union Pacific both recently reduced their operating ratios to the 60  level  indicating that Norfolk Southern can potentially boost profitability handsomely in 2020 
The ability to offset a tepid revenue situation with long term operational improvements    as opposed to temporary cost cutting    is prized among investors in industrial sector companies  Norfolk Southern  which pays a dividend currently yielding 1 7   offers a relatively safe option for income seeking investors in the transportation industry  with the promise of accelerated earnings growth once rail industry volumes revive ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pomcc,2071168

Based in Norfolk  Norfolk Southern  NSC  is in the Transportation sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 16 49   The railroad is paying out a dividend of  0 94 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 16  compared to the Transportation   Rail industry s yield of 1 54  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 92  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 76 is up 23 7  from last year  Norfolk Southern has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 8 74   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Norfolk Southern s current payout ratio is 33   meaning it paid out 33  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
NSC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  10 67 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 12 20  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  NSC is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-08-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-norfolk-southern-nsc-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200457689,200457689

175167,396683,NSC,Norfolk Southern  NSC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Norfolk Southern  NSC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 78 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 94 billion  up 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 29  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Norfolk Southern 
For Norfolk Southern  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Norfolk Southern will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Norfolk Southern would post earnings of  2 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 51  delivering a surprise of  15 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Norfolk Southern doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/norfolk-southern-nsc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200440714,200440714

175189,396705,NSC,Norfolk Southern  NSC  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Norfolk Southern  NSC   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Norfolk Southern currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if NSC is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this railroad holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For NSC  shares are up 2 8  over the past week while the Zacks Transportation   Rail industry is up 0 68  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 71  compares favorably with the industry s 2 7  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Norfolk Southern have risen 20 81   and are up 43 18  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 9 4  and 13 29   respectively 
Investors should also take note of NSC s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  NSC is averaging 1 226 529 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with NSC 
Over the past two months  8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost NSC s consensus estimate  increasing from  10 42 to  10 73 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that NSC is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Norfolk Southern on your short list ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/norfolk-southern-nsc-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200413689,200413689

175206,396722,NSC,Norfolk Southern  NSC  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Norfolk Southern  NSC  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 17 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 80 billion  up 3 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 77  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Norfolk Southern 
For Norfolk Southern  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 18  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Norfolk Southern will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Norfolk Southern would post earnings of  2 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 57  delivering a surprise of  11 74  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Norfolk Southern doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/norfolk-southern-nsc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200407731,200407731

Norfolk Southern shares have added about 34 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17  
What s Next for Norfolk Southern 
While Norfolk Southern has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Norfolk Southern was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

175261,396777,NSC,Railroad Sues Maryland To Keep Crude Oil Shipment Routes Secret,news,"By    A major rail company is suing Maryland to block national media organizations from learning about crude oil shipments through the state  and another railroad may soon file such a lawsuit  The privacy tussle comes as regulators ramp up their scrutiny of the industry amid rising concerns about crude oil train derailments and spills 
Norfolk Southern Corporation  NYSE NSC   an eastern rail company from Norfolk  Va   filed a lawsuit in a Baltimore City court this week to stop the public release of information about the shipments  Two weeks earlier  the publishing company McClatchy Company  NYSE MNI  and the Associated Press had filed state Public Information Act requests  which Maryland officials indicated they would fulfill  McClatchy s Washington bureau reported 
A similar lawsuit from CSX Corporation  NYSE CSX   a rival eastern rail company  is reportedly likely to also file suit in Maryland 
While railcars have moved crude oil in the past  shipments are reaching unprecedented levels amid the oil boom in North Dakota s Bakken shale region  The area lacks sufficient pipeline infrastructure  forcing oil companies to move supplies via rail tankers instead of underground  Last year 415 000 rail carloads of crude moved through the United States  compared to just 9 500 loads in 2008  according to a new report by the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT    
The uptick in rail activity has led to a spate of derailments and several serious oil accidents  In July 2013  an oil train in Lac Megantic  Quebec  exploded and killed 47 people  Most recently  an oil carrying freight train in May derailed in Lynchburg  Va   and spilled 30 000 gallons of oil into the James River 

In response  the DOT has pushed to improve the safety of rail tankers carrying hazardous materials  On Wednesday  the department proposed rules that include phasing out older and more vulnerable cars and replacing them with stronger cars  reducing operating speeds and upgrading braking systems  And in May  the DOT issued an emergency order requiring rail companies to alert state emergency management officials about shipments of 1 million gallons or more of crude rail shipments within state borders  The notifications were meant to help fire departments better prepare for potential derailments  McClatchy reported 
Rail companies asked state officials to sign confidentiality agreements  arguing that sharing the data with the public could threaten security and market share  The DOT found that no federal law protects the information from public disclosure  and several states   including California  Washington  Illinois and Florida   have fulfilled open records requests  McClatchy noted 
The Norfolk Southern lawsuit appears to be the first time a rail company has gone to court to keep the information confidential ",2014-07-25,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/railroad-sues-maryland-to-keep-crude-oil-shipment-routes-secret-298051,298051

175282,396798,NSC,Why Norfolk Southern  NSC  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Norfolk Southern in Focus
Based in Norfolk  Norfolk Southern  NSC  is in the Transportation sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 13 65   The railroad is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 86 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 02   This compares to the Transportation   Rail industry s yield of 1 36  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 44 is up 13 2  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Norfolk Southern has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 6 76   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Norfolk Southern s payout ratio is 34   which means it paid out 34  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for NSC for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  10 24 per share  with earnings expected to increase 7 68  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  NSC is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-norfolk-southern-nsc-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200383677,200383677

175309,396825,NSC,Norfolk Southern  NSC  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Norfolk Southern  NSC  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  36 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 85 billion  up 6 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 69  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Norfolk Southern 
For Norfolk Southern  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 27  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Norfolk Southern will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Norfolk Southern would post earnings of  2 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 52  delivering a surprise of  3 28  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Norfolk Southern doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/norfolk-southern-nsc-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200376682,200376682

175598,397114,NSC,Should Value Investors Consider Norfolk Southern  NSC  Shares Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Norfolk Southern Corporation   NYSE NSC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Norfolk Southern has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 55  This level compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 04 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Norfolk Southern s current PE near highs over the observed period  This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its own historical levels Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 27  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Norfolk Southern has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 18 93   lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Norfolk Southern stock in the near term too PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Norfolk Southern has a P S ratio of about 3 43  This is lower than the industry average  which comes in at 4 81x right now NSC is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Norfolk Southern currently has a Value Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Norfolk Southern an apt choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 12 13  which is slightly better than the industry average of 12 22  Furthermore  the EV EBITDA for Norfolk Southern is 10 35  a level that is lower than the industry average of 10 9  The EV EBITDA multiple  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  is capital structure neutral  as it takes into account the level of debt on a company s balance sheet  not just its equity Clearly  NSC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Norfolk Southern might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives NSC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to seven lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward revisions and four downward revisions in the same time period This has had a small but meaningful impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased 3  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Norfolk Souther Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNorfolk Southern is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a formidable industry rank  Top 2  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past year  the respective industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below Meanwhile  we are impressed by Norfolk Southern s efforts to reward investors through share buybacks and dividend payments  The company  which has paid dividends for 139 consecutive quarters  shelled out  700 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth  800 million in 2016 Nevertheless  value investors might want to wait for the NSC s price to correct downward a bit as well as estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars This proven stock picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing  You can apply it to your portfolio starting today ,2017-08-16,Zacks Investment

Catalysts Behind the Upsurge
The company s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks are very encouraging  Over the last couple of years  Canadian Pacific has increased its annual dividend over 20   In May 2017  the company raised its quarterly dividend per share by 12 5  to C 0 5625 per share The board cleared a new share buyback program as well 
The railroad operator expects earnings per share to grow in high single digits in 2017  led by a projected increase in volumes and cost control efforts  In fact  Canadian Pacific is working hard to bring down its operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues on an adjusted basis   The measure  which came in at 61 3  in the first quarter of 2017  is now expected to improve by the rest of the year 
It is to be noted that the improvement in the coal related scenario has also aided this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company similar to its fellow railroad operator Canadian National Railway Company   NYSE CNI   
Based on the above tailwinds  we expect Canadian Pacific to perform well in the second quarter of 2017  detailed results of which will be out on Jul 19  Our view is supported by the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the second quarter has climbed over 1  to  1 97 per share in the last month 
Additionally  Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year 2017 earnings has moved up almost 1  to  8 59 per share in the same time frame  In fact  the bottom line is projected to expand 23 84  and 10 55   year over year  in second quarter and full year 2017  respectively 
Notably  the company boasts earnings per share growth rate of 11  over the next five years  The figure compares favorably to the industry average of 10 5   Furthermore  the company s  of  B  highlights its short term attractiveness and indicates when the timing is right to grab a stock  and make the most of its momentum

In such a sticky situation  investors must want to be prepared and in the lookout for low risk products  Due to this sentiment  Cambria recently introduced a fund  namely The Cambria Core Equity ETF  
Inside CCOR
The actively managed fund uses a host of strategies to offer capital appreciation while lowering risk quotient across market conditions  Under normal market conditions  at least 80  of the basket will be invested in equity securities   The fund intends to invest the remaining value of its net assets in options where pricing provides favorable risk reward models and where gains can be attained independent of the direction of the broader U S  equity market   as per the  
 The fund invests in high quality companies across all industries and sectors  that have prospects for long term total returns  as  a  result  of  their  ability  to  grow  earnings  and  their  willingness  to  increase dividends over time   as per   The  fund  also  buys  index  put  options that  can  guard  the  fund  from  any market crash

How Does This Fit in a Portfolio 
Volatility has become the name of the investing game  Either ongoing or expected changes in monetary policy in various regions and the resultant impact on global markets as well as mixed bag data on otherwise recovering developed nations are suggesting volatile trading ahead for world markets  Overvaluation is the added worry  read    
This has caused many investors to seek refuge in low risk products rather than sticking to highly volatile options and waiting out the storm  Against such a backdrop  the newly launched product could be intriguing for those who want to stay invested in equities  but like the idea of focusing on minimum risk  The fund has the potential to outperform the broad market  especially if market uncertainty persists in the coming months 
Competition 
The low volatility ETF space is almost packed  thus apparently leaving not much room for the funds to garner investors  money  There are several low volatility ETFs  namely iShares Edge MSCI Min Volatility USA ETF   PowerShares S P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio   PowerShares Russell 1000 Low Beta Equal Weight Portfolio   and Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF  FDLO   read    
However  still the newbie can give others a run for their money thanks to its actively managed nature and a novel investment objective that sets it apart  However  First Trust Horizon Managed Volatility Domestic ETF  HUSV  can be a true competitor as it also follows active management

175752,397268,NSC,5 Transportation Stocks To Take Off On Likely Q3 Earnings Beat,opinion,"Despite being plagued by multiple headwinds  the transportation sector has seen quite a few companies in the space reporting better than expected earnings per share in the ongoing Q3 earnings season  The impressive performance with respect to earnings is reflected by our latest  report  which shows that a healthy proportion of S P 500 members   approximately 69 2    have outperformed on the bottom line front  
Even more companies  92 3   have outperformed in terms of revenues  The impressive performance of the sector can be attributed to outperformance by key sector players like American Airlines Group  AAL  and Norfolk Southern Corp   NYSE NSC  
In fact  the current earnings season is likely to see bottom line expansion by 1 4  in the S P 500 space for the first time after earnings decline in five consecutive quarters  The widely diversified transportation space is projected to end the third quarter with revenue growth of 0 4   which compares favorably with the comparable second quarter figure of  1 4  
Despite the favorable scenario with a number of earnings and revenue beats as well as top line growth  the scenario is not too impressive as far as bottom line growth is concerned  According to the above report  the sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  is expected to end Q3 with earnings contracting 13 6  on a year over year basis 
The multiple headwinds confronting the space like declining travel demand due to surge in terror attacks  weak coal market  labor strife and Brexit induced uncertainty have resulted in the disappointing year over year earnings performance  The waning impact of cheap oil is also not favorable for transportation companies 
The bearish Zacks Industry ranks of most of the sub groups of the transportation industry are also reflective of the headwinds confronting the space  For example  the Transportation Airline  Transportation Truck and the Transportation Ship units carry a bearish Zacks Industry Rank of 241  2238 and 210  respectively  among more than 260 groups Lowered Bar Facilitates Earnings Beats
We suspect that the reason for the high proportion of transportation companies reporting better than expected Q3 earnings despite the headwinds lies in the conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Earnings estimates have been moving south for quite some time due to the challenges confronting this sector 
In this context  let s consider the case of American Airlines  The Zacks Consensus Estimate third quarter 2016 for the carrier was  1 68  much lower than the year ago figure of  2 72  The conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate has made it easier for transportation companies to surpass them in the quarter 5 Likely Transportation Winners
Even though a high proportion of transportation players have already revealed their quarterly numbers  quite a few players are yet to announce their results  Though we expect some of these companies to outperform  the prospect of year over year growth in earnings appears bleak 
Given this backdrop  we have zeroed in on five transportation players that are likely to outpace expectations  according to our proven model  According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold    to increase its odds of an earnings surprise

The railroad industry has not been seeing the best of times for a while  As had been expected  second quarter earnings also failed to reinstate hopes of an improvement for most companies  Although most railroad companies like Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU   Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC    NSC   Canadian National Railways Corp  CNI  and Canadian Pacific  CP  beat their Zacks Consensus Estimates  a majority of the companies saw a decline in earnings from year earlier levels 
Overall  the top line was hurt by the economic slowdown which resulted in low coal demand and a decline in freight volumes across majority of transported goods  However  companies are still hopeful of an uptick in performance in the second half of 2016 as economic growth might pick up  Some companies have also planned new investments which is a major positive  While railroad companies are figuring ways to deal with declining volumes  new regulations have been proposed which might not favor the industry 
Reciprocal Switching Proposal
A recent proposal by the Surface Transportation Board  STB  of the U S  has irked railroad companies and groups  Per this proposal  the STB plans to implement a new rule which will allow shipping companies  without access to other modes of transport  to switch their freight to competing rail lines  This reciprocal switching regulation is applicable only to  captive shippers  which are shipping companies with access to only one rail line 
The National Industrial Transportation League  NITL   which represents such shipping companies  had proposed this change to the STB in Jul 2011  As expected  the railroad industry is opposing this proposed change vehemently  Thus  there are three different perspectives of the shipping companies  railroad operators and the STB that need to be considered to evaluate this proposal 
Shippers believe that reciprocal switching will help them save millions as it will open up additional options  make operations easier and reduce freight movement costs  Shippers claim that due to existing regulations  rail freight rates have climbed up steadily over the years  Implementation of the reciprocal switching regulation is likely to intensify competition which in turn is expected to reduce prices 
The shipping industry has been going through a rough phase owing to low demand for industrial and consumer goods  Thus it is comprehensible why shippers actively support the new proposal  which is sure to boost their earnings 
Meanwhile  the STB is trying to ensure that it passes a fair judgment  keeping the welfare of both the parties in mind  In addition to making operations easier for shippers  the regulatory body intends to make certain that the law doesn t hurt railroads much  According to a Logistics Management article  if approved  shippers will be required to prove that the arrangement is  practicable and in the public interest  or  necessary to provide competitive rail service  
What s Bothering the Railroads 
Railroad companies and groups do not see any positive outcome from this proposal  As per the Association of American Railroads  AAR   forcing railroads to open their lines to competitors will be a major contradiction to the deregulation stance adopted years ago  Railroads expect revenue losses to run into billions of dollars and investments are also likely to take a beating 
Moreover  it may also increase costs for railroads although the companies will be allowed to charge a switching fee  Companies fear that the regulations would lead to a decline in operational efficiency  In 2014  CSX Corporation  NASDAQ CSX  had stated that such a proposal would make it tough for companies to take decision related to allocation of resources like locomotives and train crews in addition to causing congestion of interchanges between railroads  Also  the company believes that this switch may affect the reliability and cost effectiveness of rail freight services 
Railroad stocks  including the big players  are currently in no position to take on any revenue cut and declining revenues can hurt future investments  We believe that any move which threatens to hurt the top line and operational efficiency could counteractive actions from railroad companies  Moreover  it is to be noted that investments by railroad companies are essential for the maintenance and continued improvement of the country s rail network 
Proposal to Increase Crew Size
Besides reciprocal switching  the railroad industry has received another new proposal by the Freight Railroad Administration  FRA  requires at least two crew members for freight railroads instead of one in order to ensure railroad safety  The FRA  however  has no data to prove that the number of crew members is directly related to safety  Railroad companies are clearly against this proposal as well 
Notably  changes in railroad industry regulations require intense deliberation as the industry s operational efficiency is essential for the economy 
Railroad Industry s Economic Impact
In a report released by the AAR  it has been highlighted how railroads have a significant impact on the economy  The report comprises research findings from Towson University s Regional Economic Studies Institute  RESI  which states that seven key railroads executed approximately  274 billion worth of economic transactions  around  33 billion in revenues and supported almost 1 5 million jobs in the U S  in 2014  Moreover  investments valued at around  28 billion went into the industry 
Railroads are almost like the lifeline of an economy as they transport bulk of the major products for industrial and personal use across the country  The transported goods include agricultural and food products  chemicals  coal  consumer durables  paper  lumber and motor vehicles  Thus  the performance of the industry lends an insight into the factors charting the economy s growth or slump during a period

175850,397366,NSC,3 ETFs   Stocks To Fly High On Busy Summer Travel ,opinion,"A higher number of Americans are gearing up for the summer travel season this year encouraged by accelerated job gains  moderate wage growth  and cheap fuel that will lead to more trips through road and air  With just a few days left for the sunny season  the frenzy for trips during the holidays is really more this time than in many years 
In fact  the latest survey from GasBuddy com shows that drivers are expected to pay the lowest gasoline price since 2005  The average national price of gasoline is  2 23 per gallon currently  down 50 cents per gallon from last year  As a result  GasBuddy com expects more than 75  of the Americans to travel this summer  up 2 2  from last year  Of this 79  will be traveling by car  read    
Another report from the U S  airlines group  Airlines for America  A4A   shows that air travel is expected to reach an all time high this summer  June August   though travelers could face longer airport security lines  About 231 million passengers  2 51 million per day  would fly over the three month period  up 4  from last year  Out of these  30 5 million travelers  331 000 per day  will board international flights 
In order to accommodate an increased number of passengers  the U S  airlines will likely add new flights and increase the number of seats  A4A expects airlines to offer 109 400 more seats compared to last summer  bringing the total to 2 78 million seats a day 
Huge travel demand should boost revenues and profitability for the airlines and railroads  thereby leading to higher share prices  Investors  shouldn t miss this opportunity and could tap this trend through ETFs and stocks that stand to profit big time from the upbeat summer travel trend How to Play with ETFs 
Below  we have highlighted three ETFs that belong to the transportation world and could see immense upside in the coming months  although a couple of them have a Zacks ETF Rank of 4 or  Sell  rating

ETFs   Stocks to Fly High on Busy Summer Travel

A higher number of Americans are gearing up for the summer travel season this year encouraged by accelerated job gains  moderate wage growth  and cheap fuel that will lead to more trips through road and air  With just a few days left for the sunny season  the frenzy for trips during the holidays is really more this time than in many years 

In fact  the latest survey from GasBuddy com shows that drivers are expected to pay the lowest gasoline price since 2005  The average national price of gasoline is  2 23 per gallon currently  down 50 cents per gallon from last year  As a result  GasBuddy com expects more than 75  of the Americans to travel this summer  up 2 2  from last year  Of this 79  will be traveling by car  read     
	Another report from the U S  airlines group  Airlines for America  A4A   shows that air travel is expected to reach an all time high this summer  June August   though travelers could face longer airport security lines  About 231 million passengers  2 51 million per day  would fly over the three month period  up 4  from last year  Out of these  30 5 million travelers  331 000 per day  will board international flights 
	In order to accommodate an increased number of passengers  the U S  airlines will likely add new flights and increase the number of seats  A4A expects airlines to offer 109 400 more seats compared to last summer  bringing the total to 2 78 million seats a day 
	Huge travel demand should boost revenues and profitability for the airlines and railroads  thereby leading to higher share prices  Investors  shouldn t miss this opportunity and could tap this trend through ETFs and stocks that stand to profit big time from the upbeat summer travel trend How to Play with ETFs

175871,397387,NSC,70 RSI Pullback For Now  No Distribution Yet,opinion,"When markets get overbought  they will ultimately need to pull back  The pullback can feel very bad since they can be intense due to the very overbought nature of all the key oscillators from RSIs to stochastic s to MACDs  When markets are strong and they get overbought  since the market behaved so well  most aren t prepared for the type of selling a simple overbought pullback can bring  Today surely didn t feel good  Nasty  Strong selling from the opening bell through the rest of the day  A rumor of a buyout of Norfolk Southern Corporation  N NSC  by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited  N CP  got the rails rocking and bought up the iShares Transportation Average ETF  N IYT  naturally after we sold  That was it for the good news today  The market was feeling the heat all day long  There wasn t much in terms of the usual rotation  You won t get much rotation once the market has decided it needs to sell from overbought conditions  No one wants to step in and be overly brave knowing the unwinding process has begun  You need to go from being a bit aggressive to being totally patient  which doesn t come easily for most traders 
While the masses show patience  the bears know they can seize the moment  and indeed do just that  which again  makes the selling seem worse than it really is from a technical  longer term perspective  Today s selling shouldn t be enough to get things unwound  Many oscillators are just crossing down  but you never know for sure  When looking to buy you want deeper unwinding  but more importantly  you want to see bottoming candles on the daily index charts down the road to tell you things are safer from a risk reward perspective  While the market doesn t always flash a classic bottoming candle  it s still safer when overbought to wait for a candle stick that says there s at least some evidence the buyers are catching back up to the sellers  Today was simply a classic pullback from extremely overbought oscillators across the board  Nothing bad about this type of good selling  Good because it lets the market breathe a bit  Overbought that stays overbought becomes more and more unhealthy  A good start today  Hopefully  some further selling to unwind more deeply is ahead of us 
The key to all selling in a bull market is to understand what type of selling we re getting to the best of our abilities  Nothing is etched in stone  meaning you don t always have to have something occur to make it official  If we had big volume or distribution volume  then that would tell us a bigger  more important message about the market  It would mean the bear is rearing its ugly head  That said  you don t have to have distribution to begin a bear market  but it s very rare not to have that process take place in some shape or form  Normally you begin to distribute out when the big money has said enough is enough about the bull  They gradually sell their positions  but they do it slowly so as to not shock the markets  which over time allow them to sell at higher prices 
If they kill it too quickly  they ll scare away the weak hands and they won t buy the market back up  If they do it gradually  the weak hands will buy the market back up  and then the big money will  once again  distribute a little more  and so on  and so on  until they ve sold all the need to  At that point  they re ready to short and send those they gave their shares to  to a not so good place for a long time to come  That s the normal process of how a bull transitions to a bear  thus  this is what I m watching for  Today we saw nothing of the kind  No distribution off this top  which tells me there s a good chance that over time  we will see the market surge back up again  No guarantee of course  but that s what I took out of today s action  Only time will tell if I am right  Whether we ever get back up again before this bear takes over 
There are NEVER any guarantees in this crazy game  but those long term  monthly index charts are about as bearish looking as I have ever seen in my career  Maybe this is the one time that they don t play out as I suspect they will  or even have to  but when I study them  they are totally bearish and quite nasty  Again  I would be hard pressed to ever find monthly index charts that looked this bearish  and  thus  it tells me to be on guard for an eventual top in the not too distant future  Hopefully  from new markets highs so as to be able to escape near the highs  That s a hope  but no guarantee  but  again  since today saw no distribution I could see us making that one more last new high over time  At least that s my hope 
Nothing is easy from here  and won t be for a very  very long time  but we take things one day at a time  2052 is strong support down to 2034  and then the breakout at 2020  If we lost 2052 that would be annoying  but acceptable  Losing 2020 would not be acceptable  and tells me the bear is already upon us with regards to price  A day at a time  with my best guess being we hold 2020 on this selling episode  Go slow and easy here ",2015-11-09,Jack Steiman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/70-rsi-pullback-for-now...no-distribution-yet.-270784,270784

175938,397454,NSC,7 Best Dividend Stocks For July 2013,opinion,In this period of low interest rates  investors have been chasing yield  Dividend stocks therefore have been in great demand  The best dividend stocks not only offer a great yield  the companies also have a history of responsibly managing the dividend payout and rewarding the shareholders with a consistently increasing dividend  The following 7 dividend paying stocks offer great yields  some of the best dividend growth rates in their respective industries  as well as reasonably low payout ratio indicating dividend increases in the future are likely  Here they are in no particular order 1  Validus Holdings Ltd  VR  You want your reinsurer to understand and manage risk prudently and at the same time reward the shareholders  Validus Holdings is a Bermuda based reinsurer offering products and services in property  marine and specialty lines markets worldwide  Started in 2005  initial backers included private equity firms of Acquiline Capital Partners  Goldman Sachs Capital Partners  Vestar Capital Partners  New Mountain Capital and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity  The company has consistently raised its dividend since its IPO in 2007 and currently offers an yield of 3 45   Capital appreciation has been reasonable  if not spectacular  The current fear of potential clients shunning traditional reinsurance in favor of catastrophe bonds has pressured the stock to attractive levels and could be a great opportunity to take a meaningful position   2  American Railcar Industries Ind  ARII  American Railcar Industries manufactures hopper and tank railcars in North America and in India through a joint venture  These railcars are used to transport grains  mineral ores and other commodities including petroleum  ethanol  chemicals  etc  The company also makes parts  Carl Icahn owns 55 60  of the stock through Icahn Enterprises L P  Between 2010 and 2012  the company has increased its revenues by 2 6 times  160   and delivered a dividend growth of 53  on average over the past 5 years  If you are bullish on rail transportation in the US due to increased NAFTA trade as well as shale oil boom  it may make sense to buy a picks and shovel stock for the industry like ARII  At a P E below 10  the price is right   3  Western Union Co  WU  Western Union provides money movement and payment services worldwide through its network of 510 000 agent locations  The stock is reasonable cheap at 10 25 times earnings and the company offers a solid dividend of 2 93  yield  Sales growth has not been spectacular but the company has an abundant cash flow with Return on Equity exceeding 100   Private Equity firms such as Carlyle and TPG group are circling MoneyGram  Western Union s largest competitor  so there is great interest in this segment from well qualified buyers  A solid boring company with a solid dividend in a business that is to a large extent immune from the economic ups and downs  What is not to like   4  Safeway Inc  SWY  Safeway is a grocery store operator in the US with over 1600 locations  The company has been steady growing  With the recent acquisition of Harris Teeter by Kroger  there is a sense of consolidation sweeping through the grocery segment in the United States  However  the bigger creator of value for Safeway is this  It has recently entered into an agreement to sell its Canadian outlets to Empire Company Limited of Canada  Sobey s chain  for  5 8 Billion in cash  Compare this to Safeway s current market cap which is  5 8 Billion  The deal is being reviewed by Canada s competition board  and if approved  it means that the market is valuing Safeway s US assets at a big fat zero  The Canadian deal includes 300 standalone stores  compared to Safeway s US store count of 1600    For your reference  Safeway is the 2nd largest grocery store operator in US after Kroger   The value here should be simple to see  While you wait for this to play out  the stock pays you a 3 3  yield for twiddling your thumbs   5  Ford Motor Co  F  Ford Motor Company has shown tremendous resilience during the auto downturn and seems to have found the sweet spot in the market with its offering of small and fuel efficient cars as well as its dominance of the US pickup truck market  June 2013 sales were up 13  and while the stock is up 77  in the last 52 weeks  currently trading at close to its 52 week highs  the valuation still remains reasonable at 11 32 times earnings  The company reinstated its dividend in 2012 after a break of 6 years and in a measure of its confidence going forward  doubled it to  0 10 share per quarter in 2013  The payout ratio is at 17  so there is further scope for an increase  There is a lot to look forward with Ford and it remains an American icon   6  Norfolk Southern Corp  NSC  Norfolk Southern is a rail transportation company operating 20 000 miles of route in 22 US states and District of Columbia  It mostly takes commercial freight  transporting raw materials  commodities and finished goods  While the dividend growth has not been significant  the company pays a solid 2 77  dividend supported by a business that is a critical part of the country s economic infrastructure  The stock is reasonably valued and if you are looking for a long term dividend stock for income  this stock can be a great option  One of the reasons to follow rail stocks is that they are often leading indicators of a broader economic recovery  or growth    Of the 6 stocks mentioned above  I am adding 2 of them to the Value Stock Guide Premium Watch List purely for valuation reasons  If your goal is dividend income  any and all of these 6 stocks should be a great addition to your portfolio if they pass your own due diligence

175964,397480,NSC,Services Sector Dividend Stocks,opinion,The services sector is still an attractive investment field  The whole sector has 844 companies listed  of which 350 pay dividends  The total market capitalization of all services stocks combined is  58 896 trillion  An average stock from the sector has a P E ratio of 24 94 and yields 1 66   I personally don t like services stocks because of the low margin business  I love stocks with big margins and strong competitive advantages  High margins also show that the company owns and distributes products that are unique  Apple has huge margins because it has created a unique product that people love and are willing to pay nearly any price for it  It sounds easy  but the Apple story is much more complicated and is also a product of excellent brand marketing  I personally will never buy Apple shares because of the fast product cycle  If you lose your consumer focus  you lose the battle  However  there are some services stocks with a strong consumer loyalty and huge growth potential  which is still attractive for many investors  Think about the payment provider MasterCard  MA  and Visa  V    Today I want to highlight some

175979,397495,NSC,Get Your Dividend Portfolio Rolling With Norfolk Southern,opinion,Like most railroads  concerns regarding the coal industry have driven Norfolk Southern Corp  s share price to one of its lowest levels since 1998  Nevertheless  strength in other areas of their business seems to support continued confidence in long term earnings growth  Therefore  current weakness in the share price may represent an excellent long term opportunity    This article looks at Norfolk Southern Corp   NSC   a Dividend Contender  through the lens of the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool  Since a picture is worth a thousand words  the reader will be provided the  essential fundamentals at a glance  expressed vividly in pictures      A Dividend Contender is defined as a company that has increased its dividend for a minimum of 10   24 straight years  Norfolk Southern Corp  is a Dividend Contender that has raised its dividend every year for 11 consecutive years  The complete Dividend Contenders list is compiled    Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Contender list   Norfolk Southern Corporation is one of the nation s premier transportation companies  Its Norfolk Southern Railway subsidiary operates approximately 20 000 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia  serves every major container port in the eastern United States  and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers  Norfolk Southern operates the most extensive intermodal network in the East and is a major transporter of coal and industrial products     Norfolk Southern Corp   A Dividend Contender with 11 Consecutive Years of Dividend Increases   Learning from the Past   Looking at Earnings Only   Since dividends are paid out of earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots Norfolk Southern Corp  s earnings per share since 1998  A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that Norfolk Southern Corp  has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 6 5   see purple circle on graph  per annum  Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line  Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1    The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide  2    The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs  Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance  Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values  Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income Norfolk Southern Corp The associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 5 3  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of Norfolk Southern Corp  would have received an additional  37 118 28 in dividends that increased their total return from 5 3  to 6 5  per annum  Note   Since this is a Dividend Contender it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 10 24  years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Norfolk Southern Corp  is 1 85  which is historically normal Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsTherefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  Norfolk Southern Corp  represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Contender at a reasonable price  The important factor is that Norfolk Southern Corp  has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is

175982,397498,NSC,Precious Metals Update  Part II  ,opinion,Market NotesSNB currency peg  Fed s ZIRP   Twist  ECB s LTRO  Chinese Repurchase Operations  ECB s  whatever it takes  Bond Plan and finally Bernanke s QE   These types of interventions have completely crushed the VIX since it s last spike in August 2011  With the VIX left nowhere to go but up  Merrill Lynch claims that U S  Yield Curve tends to predict what it could do next Various equity sentiment surveys continue to uptick toward extreme bullish levels  These include the Investor Intelligence survey  Consensus survey  NAAIM survey and Hulbert Stock survey  However  the one that really stands out from the bullish perspective is the Market Vane survey  which last week recorded the highest level of bullishness since the 2007 market peak Even though I have updated it few times already  it is still important to follow   with the Transports currently down 5  this week despite QEuphoria  Major components of the Transports are breaking down in price action due to deteriorating fundamentals  These include  FedEx  UPS  Norfolk Southern and CSX amongst others While low Treasury yields are the main point of discussion these days  it is actually the riskier Emerging Market bonds that represent the dangerously overbought technical picture  GEM bonds have grossly outperformed their equity counter parts by a wide margin over the last two decades  while fund inflows are reaching record high exuberance  You ve been warned Draghi s  whatever it takes  bond buying plan  followed by Bernanke s QE  and ZIRP until mid 2015 was a one two punch that knocked the wind out of the U S  Dollar uptrend  From a technical perspective  the uptrend line has been broken and the price has recently fallen to the major support level  With sentiment extremely low and the price levels oversold  a counter trend rally is in progress Last Friday s Commitment of Traders report by CFTC showed that risk taking continues to stay at extreme levels  Hedge funds and other speculators are holding close to record net longs on high beta risk assets  with Crude Oil   250 000 net longs  Commodity Currencies    19 billion net longs and Nasdaq 100  mini    145 000 net longs  Crude has now began unwinding those bets The last few weeks has seen central bank intervention promises push risk assets out of oversold levels  The Euro has experienced a 10 cent rally from its previous bottom around  1 20 while Copper is attempting to break above its 200 MA on a sustainable basis  The Emerging Markets  saviour of global growth in the post Lehman recovery  continue to lag other equity indices indicating that not all is well with the BRICs  Currencies and precious metals have technically broken out to the upside on the news of QE   but the real test will come as volatility returns to global risk assets and whether the US Dollar starts to rally again  Most importantly  one major pocket of weakness is the Crude Oil correction unfolding this week  down by over 8  The trend with the Citigroup Economic Surprise Indices remains similar to previous weeks  as we continue to see a mean reversion  Essentially  the majority of global economic data continues to surprise economist s expectations to the upside  but the overall economic activity is nothing to write home about  Let us focus on the main three economies  as we always do  U S   Eurozone and China  Chinese Flash PMI numbers released this morning in Asia  continue to show that Asia s largest economy is still in a manufacturing contraction mode  One of the key takeaways from the preliminary reading is the fact that the Output Index came in at a 10 month low  Interestingly  all subcomponents are contracting apart from Finished Goods  which indicates inventories continue to build as exports weaken due to falling global demand  Commenting on the Flash China Manufacturing PMI survey  Hongbin Qu  Chief Economist said   China s manufacturing growth is still slowing  but the pace of slowdown is stabilising  Manufacturing activities remain lacklustre  thanks to weak new business flows and a longer than expected destocking process  And this is adding more pressures to the labour market and has prompted Beijing to step up easing over the past weeks  The recent easing measures should be working to lead to a modest improvement from 4Q onwards  Sticking with China  it was interesting to see electricity output increased only slightly by 2 7  year on year in August  Thermal power output continued to contract as readings decreased by 6 3  year on year in August  worse than  4 5  yoy in July  Current weakness is offset by hydroelectric power output  The chart above  showing a 3 month moving averages  indicates that Chinese economy is at stall speed at present Euro zone Flash PMI numbers released today continue to show a deterioration in the manufacturing cycle  which does not bode well for the economy overall  PMI readings have now come in at their lowest levels since June 2009  with France and the Rest of the Eurozone leading the way lower  Commenting on the flash PMI data  Chris Williamson said   The Eurozone downturn gathered further momentum in September  suggesting that the region suffered the worst quarter for three years  The flash PMI is consistent with GDP contracting by 0 6  in the third quarter and sending the region back into a technical recession   Continued weakness across Europe is being confirmed by other indicators  like ZEW German Investor Sentiment  which shows conditions are now reaching their lowest levels in two years  Interestingly enough  as central banks inject the heroin addicts with another dosage of stimulus  the DAX 30 has completely disconnected from fundamental reality Moving along to United States  last night s Philly Fed Index contracted for the fifth month in a row  but at a much slower pace of  1 9 from the previous months contraction of  7 1  The three month moving average seen in the chart above has made a lower low  while the S P 500 has recently made another higher high  A disconnect between the price action and fundamentals like we can see in the chart above  tend to be warning signals many market participants disregard  In the meantime  it is also important to note that the Empire State Manufacturing Index disappointed earlier in the week and alongside the Philly Fed most likely confirms that US manufacturing will keep contracting for the fourth straight quarter in a row  One of the better indicators tracking consumer spending is the U S  Restaurant Performance Index  As we can see in the chart above  recent data showed a huge drop in performance  It should be well noted that the Restaurant Performance Index has a high correlation with the U S  GDP readings  Having said that  consumer spending isn t the only indicator pointing to a weak GDP print  Economic bellwether companies like FedEx are in the midst of a serious slowdown  with a large contraction in its shipments also pointing to broad economic weakness  It has been awhile since we had a look what the U S  Jobless Claims are doing  The recent two prints came in at 382 000 today and 385 000 last week  The four week moving average  which I prefer to use as it removes volatility  currently stands at 377 750 which is the highest reading since early July  The chart below shows that for months Jobless Claims have trended sideways  while the stock market has moved towards higher highs   Finally  from the long term point of view  I constantly hear how the equity market is climbing a wall of worry  I would like to remind investors that the wall of worry existed in its full force around early 2009  when the Jobless Claims four week moving average was above 600 000  Today at 378 000 we have seen a dramatic improvement in Jobless Claims and investors are acting like there isn t too much to be worried about  Featured Article  of a two part Precious Metals Update  we looked at the way Gold  Silver  Platinum and other Precious Metal assets broke out above various technical resistance levels  We also covered sentiment and fund flows  while we discussed a huge   All in all  the conclusion stated that   Precious Metals have come back into favour with investors recently  as market focus turns to the possibility of the Federal Reserve starting another round of Quantitate Easing or monetization of the US government debt  While no one can be one hundred percent certain Precious Metals have seen a major low  the technical evidence together with a potential fundamental trigger  do speak of positive price action ahead   Regardless of whether we have seen a major low or not  in the second part of the update I would like to focus on the long term Precious Metals picture  while eliminating short term market noise  So to do that  we should re focus on why we are investing into Precious Metals and how to value the asset  Let us begin  Everyone has their own reasons for investing in a certain asset class  but instead of covering them all and getting side tracked  I will just explain the reason why I invest in the Precious Metals sector  I have my own wealth and also the wealth of my clients to manage  These people have worked hard for the last few years to acquire  save and create their wealth  Their main priority  as well as my own  is not to lose it  In these uncertain times with high volatility and limited growth  the basic linear way of thinking is that the safest investment would be cash  After all  that is usually considered the most risk free asset class  While conventional wisdom like that might hold some truth to it  one has to pay close attention to current events  and also those throughout history   because one of the easiest ways to lose wealth during turbulent economic periods  is through monetary devaluation or money printing  You see  in plain English  global central banks throughout history have always tried to stimulate economies via currency devaluation during periods of low economic growth  They have always failed  because printing money does not create prosperity  but nevertheless they always seem to have  another crack at it  and this time is no different   The chart above shows major central bank balance sheet expansions from the beginning of the Global Financial Crisis in 2007  Do keep in mind that the chart is slightly outdated  because in recent times the Fed  ECB and BoJ have all announced new  money printing  programs  Federal Reserve s QE   infinity  has already started as of last Friday and plans to print money until the unemployment rate moves below 7  and closer to 6  in the US  In other words  the printing of money will continue as far as the eye can see  It is during these periods that Precious Metals like Gold and Silver retain their purchasing power and act as an alternative currency to the fiat paper system  In Human Action  on page 401  Ludwig von Mises states that   Money is a medium of exchange  It is the most marketable good which people acquire because they want to offer it in later acts of interpersonal exchange    This is its only function  All other functions which people ascribe to money are merely particular aspects of its primary and sole function  that of a medium of exchange   As a matter of fact  I think the current currency devaluation programs are just the tip of the iceberg  Now  I am not saying that the current programs will get automatically expanded in the near term  After all  I didn t even think the Federal Reserve would start QE until there was a catalyst for it  I elected a stock market pullback first   but it seems that Bernanke   Co are just too eager  The chart above shows that the Federal Reserve voting members are extremely dovish in 2012 and even more so in 2013  That essentially guarantees Precious Metal investors that the Fed will not tighten dramatically  Furthermore  as the economy continues to weaken  it could also mean that the Fed will stimulate even more  Here on the Short Side of Long blog  we regularly track global leading indicators  Let us summarise recent posts regarding the state of global economy OECD s Leading Economic Indicators are contracting in all major Developed and Emerging economies apart from US and Japan  both of which now show growth slowing rapidlyGlobal Manufacturing PMIs are in contraction when it comes to all major Developed and Emerging economies  with the downtrend intensifying in the Eurozone as of yesterdayECRI s Weekly Leading Index continues to display anaemic performance at best  even with trillions and trillions of stimulus via central banks and government deficitsMerrill Lynch s Global Wave shows that the most important economic data from all major global economies is pointing to another slowdown or even the beginning of synchronised recessionGlobal Business Confidence  Railroad   Air Cargo Traffic  Falling Company Revenues   Profits plus many other leading indicators  all point to stall speed growthWe are on the edge of another global recession  Basically  the worse that the data gets  the more money will be printed  and the lower stock markets go  the more money will be printed  and when geopolitical tensions escalate around the world  more money will be printed  and finally as governments run larger and larger deficits    you guessed it    even more money will be printed  In other words  fundamentals continue to improve from Precious Metals and continue to deteriorate for the stock market  money printing doesn t help earnings forever   Furthermore  the last point mentioned above was Government deficits  which brings me to another major fundamental positive for Precious Metals  In his recent article dating back to July  Chris Puplava concluded that the top 10 global economies have over 15 trillion dollars  with a capital T  maturing into 2015  chart above   He concluded that   Looking at the outstanding debt for the top 10 combined shows that just between now and the end of the year more than  5 trillion in debt will mature  or 17  of their total outstanding debt  and by 2015 nearly 50  of the top 10 debtor nations total outstanding debt will come due  That is more than  15 trillion in debt coming due in the next two and half years  Because we are going to see trillions and trillions of sovereign debt come due over the next two and a half years I believe gold may be entering the mania phase of its secular bull market that began in 2001  There is just too much debt maturing over the next couple of years for capital markets to absorb and it is highly likely we will see global quantitative easing occur as central banks step in to be buyers of last resort to help suppress interest rates and keep debt servicing costs low   Interestingly  not only Mr Puplava  but quite a few other wise investors talk about Gold s  mania phase  as the main reason they continue to stay long this asset class  Basically  to simplify the theory and eliminate a lot of when  why and what  we are currently in an inflationary monetary phase  as opposed to a stabilising monetary phase  chart above   What usually occurs during monetary inflation  fancy world for currency devaluation  is that Gold tends to move rapidly higher in value until it reaches a price where it essentially backs the monetary system  This historical phenomena  which occurred in 1933 and in 1979  is created through investor fear  a primary component of human emotion which tends to spike Gold prices towards dizzying heights  Based on the monetary expansion by central banks  if Gold was to back the system as of today  the price would essentially rise towards  8 000 per ounce Moving away from Gold s valuation linked with the monetary base  we turn to valuing Gold relative to other financial assets such as stocks  Personally  this is a much more preferred measure  because market participants buy and sell these assets everyday  free market   In the chart above  we can see how Gold and the Dow Jones Industrial performed in nominal price during the 1970s  While equities stayed flat for more than a decade  Gold entered a  mania phase  in the latter parts of the 1970s and then went parabolic into 1979  and finally touching the nominal value of the Dow Jones in the early parts of 1980 True die hard Gold bugs will argue that we are in for a 1 1 Dow Gold ratio again  Rather than try to guess what will happen in the future  I prefer to leave that to weather forecasters  card readers  crystal ball fortune tellers and astrologists  I am not the one to agree or disagree  but if this event was to occur in a similar time span as during the 1970s  then Gold has a lot of catching up to do  because today the Dow Jones Industrial trades at 13 597 points  Even if the Dow Jones was to experience a 30  bear market  which is quite possible during a secular sideways trading range just like the 1970s  Gold would still have to reach at least  9 500 per ounce to arrive at the 1 1 ratio Another way to value Gold relative to the stock market is comparing the ratio of S P 500 and Gold  Because most investors only look at one side of the ratio  S P 500 vs Gold  black line   they easily arrive at a conclusion that stocks are extremely cheap relative to Gold as of today  and therefore Gold must be extremely expensive  This could not be further from the truth  Since every story has two sides  one cannot just focus on one and disregard the other  By simply switching the ratio over to Gold vs S P 500  gold line   we can see that Gold is extremely undervalued relative to the S P 500  Overvaluation tends to occur when Gold trades at 3 to 4 times the value of the S P 500  however in 1979 80 mania it went as far as 6 times the value  Today  the S P 500 trades at 1 460 so even if stocks were to experience a 30  bear market  as already stated above   Gold could move towards  4 000 per ounce  Higher targets could occur if the ratio was to move to 6 times or more  However  stocks are not the only overvalued asset class  relative to the last Gold peak in 1980  Bonds  which have experienced a super powerful secular bull market since 1981  are also extremely overvalued relative to Gold  even more so than stocks   The chart above shows just how cheap Gold is relative to its 1980 nominal ratio against Stocks and Bonds  If you are a believer that Gold will spike back to its former glory days of the late 1970s  then in percentage terms Gold is still more than 80  below its ratio all time high  That is still extremely cheap  despite Gold rising 500  in the last 11 years  Having said that  Gold might only reach this stage for a short amount of time  before financial assets once again start to outperform  In their July Gold report  which is a must read for any investor  Erste Group writes   The Pareto distribution  80 20 distribution  describes the statistical phenomenon of an uneven distribution that can be seen in many areas  e g  in the distribution of income   Interestingly  it can also be applied to bull markets  80  of the price performance tends to occur in the last 20  of the trend  The third and last phase is the phase of euphoria and ends in a  blow off   i e  a parabolic increase  It is dominated by excessive optimism and a  this time it s different  attitude  Gold would probably be increasingly traded in backwardation during this phase  which would be a clear sign of a buying frenzy  At the end of this cycle the smart money will have distributed   The chart above explains that quote from the report rather well  If the price action was to track the Pareto distribution  or also known as the 80 20 rule  then we could expect some serious Gold movements in the coming months  quarters and years as we witness a fast parabolic movement towards the sky  and much higher   In the last several years of this secular bull market  Gold could accelerate rather quickly and approximately hit a target of  8 000 per ounce or even higher  according to the chart above While we can talk about the Precious Metals bull market for days on end  especially if true die hard Gold bugs are present in the discussion  the main point is that Precious Metals are still a good investment today  Furthermore  in my opinion we haven t even seen the major phase of the current secular bull market just yet  If you consider the chart above  you can see that all of the largest daily percentage changes on both the upside and downside occurred during the last great bull market of 1970s  Days when we see Gold rise 5  or even 10  in a single day are still in front of us  Consider that these prices movements could be  100 to  300 per day in the future  These will be the days when retail investors and dumb money  as well as all the current bull market disbelievers and remainder of the general public  start piling into Precious Metals  Finally  the question that I get asked all the time regarding my Silver investment   how high could it go  The short answer is I do not know  but the longer answer would state that if history is any guide  Gold s smaller cousin Silver  could move toward its historical ratio of at least 16 Silver ounces for 1 Gold ounce  You can do the maths yourself     Trading Diary  Last update 05th of September 12 Outlook  The Global economy continues to slow rapidly towards a recession  The United States GDP has grown below 2  for 5 out of the last 6 quarters  German GDP is also at stall speed  while China   India are slowing meaningfully with an increasing risk of a hard landing  U S  corporate earnings and gross profit margins are at record highs  so mean reversion is likely  Corporate revenue growth is already slowing Important Indicators  Cash levels within mutual funds  retail investors and money market funds are at extreme lows  financial stress is starting to rise  volatility is at very complacent levels and credit spreads are very narrow relative to fundamentals Long Positioning  Long focus is towards the secular commodity bull market  with positions in Precious Metals and Agriculture  The largest commodity position is held in Silver  due to central banks gearing to print money  as the global economic activity deteriorates  If a negative reversal occurs and global risk asset volatility rises  reducing positions will be appropriate  NAV long exposure is about 100  Short Positioning  Short focus is towards the secular equity bear market due to deteriorating global economic activity  Exposure is held short in Junk Bonds  Technology  Discretionary and Dow Transportation  Tech stocks like the Apple parabolic and Amazon have been shorted with long dated OTM puts  Put options have also been purchased on the Pound and the Loonie  long USD   NAV short exposure is about 70  Watch list  A major short in due time will be U S  Treasury long bonds  as they are extremely overbought and in a midst of a huge bubble mania  While Grains have exploded up  Softs still present amazing value for long term investors  with Sugar being my second favourite commodity  after Silver   Japanese equities are down about 80  from their all time high over two decades ago and offer some great value What I m Watching,2012-09-21,Tiho

176007,397523,NSC,Forex News Trading US Nonfarm Payroll  NFP ,opinion,We ll be trading the US NFP  Nonfarm Payroll  Employment Change  it is the focus news release for the week  Here s the forecast  8 30am  NY Time  US NF Employment Forecast 150K Previous 120K 8 30am  NY Time  US Unemployment Rate Forecast 8 5  Previous 8 5  ACTION  220K SELL EURUSD   80K BUY EURUSD The Trade Plan Todays NFP Employment Change release is forecasted at 150K  The ADP employment report came out slightly worse than expected at 170K vs 190K  The Unemployment Rate is expected to remain at 8 5   If we get a significantly lower release on the NFP  80K or worse  and slightly higher Unemployment Rate  8 7  or worse   I d be looking to BUY the EURO  or go long on EURUSD  On the other hand  if we get a positive NFP release  220K or better  and the Unemployment Rate remains below 8 5   USD should strengthen immediately and I would SELL EURUSD   If we get a conflicting release  then well wait and see how the market reacts first  If there is an overwhelming sentiment driving the market  well get plenty of opportunities for an entry if we just wait for 5 minutes after the release  you ll get a much clearer view  Please read my detailed trading strategy for this release below  The Market Most analysts believe that today s NFP release will be positive  but there is still a long way to go before these job gains start to impact the overall economy  and as previously mentioned     many analysts agree that in order to see 0 5  drop in unemployment rate  we ll need to have a minimum average of 150K new jobs created monthly for an entire year  which explains why the Unemployment Rate remains at around 9 0  for the longest period since 1948   Here are some positive negative points to consider today s NFP release Wednesday s ADP employment report showed that the private sector created a net of 170K new jobs in January  instead of 190K   Negative ISM Manufacturing PMI came out at 54 1 vs 54 6   Neutral 4   week Unemployment Claims show that unemployment is around 373K  same as last month   which supports the unchanged forecast of the Unemployment Rate at 8 5   Neutral Challenger Gray   Christmas Job Cuts report showing slightly higher with expectation  53 5K vs 41 8K prior  scheduled job cuts compared to December 2011  Negative Estimated 40 000 temporary workers hired by Fedex and other delivery companies are expected to be dismissed this month  Negative Various manufacturing companies are expected to hire this month  including Norfolk Southern Corp  second biggest railroad in the Eastern U S   Positive Most likely than not  we ll get an inline with expectation release  since the forecast is very conservative to begin with  150K headline forecast and 168K private payroll  which corresponds to the ADP release on Wednesday  NFP Trading Strategy Let s talk about how to trade this release  We ll wait for the numbers to come out but continue to hold on a trade  Even if we get our tradable figures  220K to 80K   Wait for a possible revision of the previous release number of 0K as the market usually overreacts with the Revision and chances favor that a solid trade will present itself if we dont get a conflicting releases between the revision and the actual release  at this point  still stay out of the market Then the next step is to wait for the Unemployment Rate  which is expected to remain unchanged at 8 5   If the Unemployment Rate were to surprise higher  were faced with an imperative decision at the time of the release After all of the numbers have been released  wait for the market to push and wait patiently for a decent retracement before getting in  Look for recent support resistance areas for entry as a high impact news with various components are extremely volatile  and those who are patient will always get a chance to enter with a much better entry Additional ThoughtsUSD is likely to be the focus today  and EURUSD should be the main pair to trade   Last NFP was the first time in a long time that the market decided to trade in the direction of the news instead of risk sentiment  therefore I believe today s release will be the same Pre News ConsiderationI strongly suggest that any pre news trade be closed at this moment  As with NFP releases  liquidity will die down from now until the actual release time because most traders are likely to sit on the sideline  However  with that being said  we could see some buying of USD based on the assumption above DEFINITIONMeasures the change in number of employed people during the previous month  excluding the farming industry  A rising trend has a positive effect on the nation s currency  Job creation is an important indicator of economic health because consumer spending  which is highly correlated with labor conditions  makes up a large portion of GDP  This report is the first of the month that relates to labor conditions  making it susceptible to big surprises
