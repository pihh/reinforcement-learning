106719,328234,AGNC,Is AGNC Investment Corp  a Great Dividend Stock ,news,"Good dividend stocks are an important pillar of a sound portfolio  Their major benefit is that they stockholders a dividend    a share of company s earnings    typically every quarter or month  which provides a steady stream of income  The payouts can then be used to build wealth or reinvest in the stock  The higher the dividend rate  the more income the investor earns  In addition to the dividend payments  investors can earn through the stock s long term capital appreciation 
In a time of market uncertainty  where many believe stocks could pull back a bit  a steady dividend from a solid  stable company could help offset potential losses in the portfolio 
As this is the start of a new year  it may be a good time to reassess your portfolio  As a part of that review  you may want to consider a dividend stock that has been paying investors well in recent years  AGNC Investment Corp   NASDAQ AGNC   

Yield ahead
AGNC is a mortgage real estate investment trust  REIT  that invests primarily in government agency mortgage backed securities  MBS   such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  through repurchase agreements  It actively manages a portfolio of about  102 6 billion in securities  of which about  99 billion is in residential mortgage backed securities  The company  based in Bethesda  Md   generates income primarily from the interest earned on its investments 
Over the past year  the stock has been a solid  if not spectacular  performer  up about 11   It has benefited  in part  from falling interest rates  In general  falling and low interest rates are good for residential mortgage REITs  When rates fall  net interest margin    which is the difference between interest generated and paid out    typically expands  Conversely  when interest rates increase  net interest margins are negatively affected 
AGNC trades around  17 75 per share and lately has been paying out  0 16 per share every month  for a dividend rate of 10 8   Dividend yield rates over 10  are considered relatively high  as most dividend stocks pay out in the single digits  But REITs typically pay out higher dividend rates because they are required to pay out 90  of their taxable income  Case in point  AGNC s payout ratio is 89 7   
So AGNC s dividend yield is certainly attractive at 10 8   The question is  Can it stay there 
Good outlook for AGNC
I think AGNC remains a solid dividend stock for investors in 2020 for a few reasons  To begin  the company invests primarily in agency backed loans  which are protected against default by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac  so that makes it a relatively low risk investment 
The interest rate environment also looks better than expected for 2020  Last year s rate cuts and the progress made on a trade deal with China have reduced some of the economic risks  At the Fed s last meeting in December  the board indicated that monetary policy would remain unchanged  for a time   citing a still healthy outlook for the economy in 2020  As mortgage REITs are affected by rate changes  the forecast should provide stability for the dividend rate  which has remained in the 10  to 12  range over the past few years 
While the company s payout has been steadily going down over the past few years    from  0 22 per month in 2014 to  0 16 today    I believe that will stabilize and perhaps even bump back up as AGNC is well positioned for continued growth  The company generated net spread income    which is net interest income minus operating expenses    of  0 59 per share in the third quarter  an increase of  0 10 over the second quarter  On the third quarter earnings call  President and CEO Gary Kain said he believes the majority of that increase is sustainable in the near term due to the optimization of its MBS holdings and the repositioning of its hedge portfolio  That metric is an important measure of dividend decisions  Kain said on the call    as are other factors  like market conditions  Since last August  the stock price has climbed about 22   and that s due in large part to the rate cuts 
Bottom line  AGNC still pays out a really solid dividend and  by its nature  it has to pay out a high percentage to investors  It s come through a rough patch and seems to be moving in the right direction  so it should continue to provide investors with a solid dividend in the near term ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfi21,2055161

call over to Gary Kain Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerThanks  Katie  and thanks to all of you for your interest in AGNC  We are extremely pleased with AGNC s performance in the fourth quarter as our economic return totaled 9 6   This was our strongest quarterly performance in over five years  It also brought our full year 2019 economic return to 18 7  During the fourth quarter  risk assets performed extremely well with most U S  equity indices hitting new highs  Credit spreads also tightened during the quarter with many sectors trading at or near multiyear types On the interest rate front the yield curve steepened with the 10 year treasury increasing about 25 basis points to 1 92   Swap spreads widened significantly across the curve as the Fed s massive treasury bill purchases and the commensurate improvement in GC repo funding expectations drove a material repricing of government bonds Against this backdrop  spreads on agency MBS tightened close to 10 basis points on average with specified collateral continuing to trade well  While the magnitude of the move was impressive  the strong performance of Agency MBS was completely consistent with the views we discussed on our Q3 earnings call As we noted on that call with spreads near multiyear wides  we expected Agency MBS to outperform given the improving funding backdrop  Importantly  despite the strong fourth quarter performance  we remain optimistic about the prospects for our business as we enter 2020 Spreads on Agency MBS are close to multi year averages while most credit based fixed income assets are back to Technical Issues OperatorExcuse me  This is the conference operator  We do apologize   Indecipherable  appears to be a technical difficulty at this moment  but please hold the line and the meeting will begin shortly  Again please continue to be patient and the meeting should restart shortly  Thank you Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer   in 2019  The coronavirus is clearly a risk to the global economic backdrop in a worst case scenario  but it s impact on interest rates is likely to be both temporary and limited in magnitude Lastly  as Peter will discuss shortly  the funding backdrop  a critical component of AGNC s levered investment strategy should be a material tailwind going forward  a welcome reversal from the headwinds we experienced over the past 18 months 2019 was a tremendous year for AGNC  And it reinforces the benefits of best in class asset selection and active portfolio management  For example  the model based interest rate sensitivity and basis risk tables that we provided at the start of the year would have predicted a very different outcome for our portfolio than what actually occurred given the sharp rally in rates and the MBS spread widening in 2019 The sensitivity tables which assume no intra year changes to our portfolio would have predicted a decline in book value of more than 10  based on applying simplifying assumptions of an 85 basis point rally in interest rates and a 10 basis point widening of Agency MBS spreads  inputs that approximate the moves we experienced in swaps and TBAs In stark contrast  our book value increased more than 6  in 2019  Two major factors drove the outperformance relative to the model  The first is asset selection and opportunistic changes to our asset portfolio  Specified collateral  which comprised a large percentage of our portfolio significantly outperformed TBAs given elevated concerns about prepayment speeds as rates fell  Additionally  our avoidance of higher coupon TBAs early in the year and opportunistic purchases of lower coupons later in the year also boosted our returns The second major factor was active management of our hedge portfolio  As interest rates began to rally  we proactively adjusted both the duration and composition of our hedges  These changes  some of which we highlighted on our second quarter earnings call  had a significant impact on our actual interest rate sensitivity as compared to where we began the year and explained a lot of the difference between our actual book value gain versus the loss projected by the model In summary  we are extremely pleased with AGNC s performance in 2019  especially in light of a less than ideal operating environment  And given our expectations for a relatively benign interest rate environment and more favorable funding conditions it is hard not to be optimistic about AGNC s future as we enter 2020 At this point  I ll ask Bernie to review our financial results for both Q4 and the full year of 2019 Bernice E  Bell    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Gary  Turning to Slide 4  We had total comprehensive income of  1 59 per share for the fourth quarter  Net spread and dollar roll income excluding catch up am was  0 57 per share maintaining much of the improvement from the third quarter  The  0 02 decline for the fourth quarter was primarily due to slightly lower average invested assets and year end adjustments related to incentive compensation expense Looking ahead  the temporary nature of these factors and the improved funding conditions that Peter will discuss should provide a positive tailwind to net spread and dollar roll income over the next couple of quarters Tangible net book value increased 6 7  for the quarter as our asset valuation significantly outperformed interest rate hedges recovering much of the spread widening experienced earlier in the year  Including dividends our economic return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 9 6   We will report our January month end net book value in a couple of weeks  but our current estimate is that  it is unchanged from year end Turning to Slide 5  our investment portfolio increased by  5 3 billion during the fourth quarter to  107 9 billion as of the end of the quarter  Despite the increase  our ending leverage was  9 4 times tangible equity  down from 9 8 times as of September 30th  due to the combination of book value appreciation and increase in preferred equity  Our average leverage was also lower for the quarter at 9 5 times compared to 10 point    compared to 10 times for the third quarter Forecasted CPRs declined to 10 8  from 13 4  during the quarter  due to the combination of higher rates and changes in asset composition  Actual prepayments for the quarter averaged 15 4  compared to 13 5  for the third quarter Moving to Slide 6  for the year  we had total comprehensive income of  3 08 per share and  2 16 of net spread and dollar roll income excluding catch up am  And lastly  as Gary  mentioned  despite challenging market conditions  we generated an 18 7  economic return for the year With that  I ll turn the call over to Chris to discuss the agency market Christopher J  Kuehl    Executive Vice PresidentThanks  Bernie  Let s turn to Slide 7  In contrast with the third quarter  interest rate volatility trended lower in the last three months of the year with intermediate and longer term rates moving higher during the quarter  More specifically  10 year treasury yields ended the quarter at 1 92   up from 1 66  at the end of Q3 In contrast  two year treasury yields fell five basis points to 1 57  on the heels of another rate cut by the Fed and improving expectations for government repo stemming from the Fed s bill purchases and other actions to improve liquidity in the funding markets  These same dynamics also pushed swap spreads wider by 8 basis points to 10 basis points Risk assets traded well throughout the quarter with Agency MBS performing especially well in the month of December  Higher rates  a steeper curve  expectations for lower interest rate volatility  and improvements in the funding markets were all factors that led to the strong performance late in the fourth quarter Let s now turn to Slide 8  You can see that the investment portfolio increased by approximately  5 billion to  108 billion as of year end During the quarter  we continued to take advantage of attractive spreads on production coupon 30 year MBS  while reducing exposure to higher coupon holdings most exposed to pre payment risk  With the continued outperformance of specified pools  we allowed our spec pool percentage to decline a little and focused our incremental purchases in more generic production coupon MBS TBA roll implied financing rates remained weak relative to historical norms versus repo during the fourth quarter  However  since year end rolls have been trending somewhat better with improvements in other funding markets Lastly  on the top right of Slide 8  you can see that our prepayment speed slowed over the last two months given a combination of portfolio repositioning  higher rates and slower seasonal factors for housing activity Despite the recent decline in interest rates  we continue to expect prepayment speeds on our portfolio to remain below the peak speed seen last quarter in the absence of a further bond market rally I ll now turn the call over to Aaron to discuss the non agency sector Aaron J  Pas    Senior Vice PresidentThanks  Chris  Please turn to Slide 9 and I ll provide a quick update on our credit investments  Credit markets exhibited some volatility in spread widening early in the fourth quarter  while the Fed was still grappling with repo related issues  However as Gary mentioned  credit spreads firmed and ended the year at or close to multiyear types in many cases As an example over the quarter investment grade and high yield CDX indices were basis points 15 basis points and 69 basis points tighter respectively both ending the year at the tightest levels we ve seen in over five years  This translated into tighter spreads on many of our non agency holdings  As a result  we continued to shrink our non agency portfolio marginally At quarter end the portfolio totaled slightly under  1 6 billion which translates to between 3  and 4  of equity  The decline came predominantly in our credit risk transfer portfolio with a focus on the run paper  CRT has continued to perform well throughout January even with robust new issue supply Due to the lag between mortgage originations and CRT issuance supply in the first half of this year will remain elevated given origination volume in the second half of last year  While the backdrop for residential mortgage credit performance continues to be quite favorable  investments in CRT are becoming less attractive to us in light of the increased supply a material tightening throughout the capital structure over the last several months  With that  I ll turn the call over to Peter to discuss funding and risk management Peter J  Federico    President and Chief Operating OfficerThanks  Aaron  I ll start with our financing summary on Slide 10  Our weighted average repo funding cost in the fourth quarter declined to 2 12   down 36 basis points from the prior quarter  This was a big improvement from the third quarter  but still higher than it should be given the current Fed funds target As we discussed last quarter our expectation was for repo rates to remain elevated in the fourth quarter  but then gradually improve as the market repriced to the additional liquidity provided by the Fed  This liquidity was indeed very significant with the Fed adding close to  420 billion over year end through a combination of open market operations and outright treasury bill purchases  And to the Fed s credit  overnight repo at year end did in fact trade very close to the Fed funds target The term repo market  however  was more challenging  These rates remained elevated throughout the quarter due mainly to uncertainty about the Fed and how bank regulatory requirements would adversely impact year end funding rates  For example  term repo prices implied an overnight funding rate of between 4  and 8  for year end substantially above where the turn actually traded  We were reluctant to lock up longer term funding at these rates and as such shortened the weighted average maturity of our funding somewhat in anticipation of better funding opportunities later in the quarter As we show on Slide 11 funding levels did improve materially throughout the quarter  In the chart on the top  you can see the gradual improvement that occurred in three month repo rates relative to the overnight index swap rate  From its peak in early October  repo rates by this measure improved by about 25 basis points as the Fed added in an increasing amount of liquidity  Importantly  repo rates have remained favorable so far this quarter The chart on the bottom shows one month repo rates relative to OIS  This rate was obviously much more volatile given the timing and uncertainty associated with year end  The spike in December for example corresponds with when 30 day repo first crossed over at year end  The key takeaway  however  is that 30 day repo has also improved significantly and is now back to the level of April of last year Looking ahead  we expect our funding to improve further over the next couple of quarters and to be a tailwind to our earnings  But that said  the next six months will be particularly important for the repo market as the Fed transitions away from its initial stop gap measures to more permanent measures which will focus on treasury bill purchases  but may also include a combination of regulatory reform  a permanent repo facility and open market operations as needed  We are confident this will happen as the Fed has clearly demonstrated its commitment to resolving this repo issue Turning to Slide 12  we provide a summary of our hedge portfolio which totaled  99 billion  a slight increase from the prior quarter and covered 102  of our funding liabilities  At quarter end  close to 90  of our swap portfolio was indexed off OIS or SOFR  These swaps we believe will better track our actual funding  and therefore should provide for a more stable aggregate cost of funds over time Finally  on Slide 13 we show our duration gap and duration gap sensitivity  Given the increase in longer term interest rates and our minimal rebalancing activity  our duration gap increased slightly to 0 4 years  With the rally that we ve had in January  our duration gap today is now back to flat With that  I ll turn the call back over to Gary Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerThanks Peter  And at this point  we d like to open up the lines to questions Questions and Answers OperatorLadies and gentlemen  at this time  we ll begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Our first question today comes from Doug Harter from Credit Suisse  Please go ahead with your question Douglas Harter    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks  Just wondering how you re thinking about kind of balancing the portfolio risk between potential refi risk or if this is short lived and rates kind of snap back  And kind of how you re thinking about the portfolio and hedging in that context Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerSure  I mean  first off  I think from a big picture perspective  as we said in the prepared remarks  we do think 2020 at least up until we ll say the election start to potentially affect financial markets  we do expect interest rates to be kind of to remain in a relatively tight range That said  we ve obviously had this rally in January  that s brought us to kind of what we believe is the lower end of that range  But big picture  we don t expect a breakout to the high side in other words with tenure rates getting much over 2   So that s a risk that we re sort of willing to take in the portfolio  And when we make those decisions  we re obviously cognizant of the fact that we re a levered portfolio and we can t make big bets But the thing we usually focus on in these environments to make kind of decisions in terms of how we bias the portfolio is how we expect mortgages  our major asset  to trade in different    if interest rates move in different directions  And clearly the risk to mortgage underperformance is biased to a down rate scenario  And for that reason  I think we re definitely more focused on making sure the portfolio is not over hedged into a rally  So that s    that is our priority among these two And Peter  I don t know if you want to add something Peter J  Federico    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Doug  I would just add to that in this environment given where rates are now is sort of similar to where it was in the third quarter  And although  as Gary pointed out  we are worried obviously about mortgages in the down rate scenario we re always cognizant of extension risk in our portfolio  And if you look at our sensitivity table  we actually have a significant amount of extension risk And so what we ve done like in the third quarter and likely again given where rates are today is to opportunistically add potentially more option based hedges to our mix  even though it is not our base case scenario that rates go up  we obviously want to protect against that move up in rates  And so options tend to be a good choice for us often in environments like this Douglas Harter    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  And then just following up on your commentary that book value is relatively flat  I mean  it looks like Agency spreads have definitely widened this month  I guess could you just talk kind of about what you re seeing that s kind of led to that kind of better performance in book value Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerSure  I think it relates somewhat to what you saw this quarter where the performance of our portfolio outperformed  let s say just TBA spots  And higher coupons and in particular  higher coupon specified collateral have performed really well year to date And I think that s the biggest driver of maybe the difference in our actual portfolio performance  or what I should say is our estimate of our actual portfolio performance which as Bernie said is essentially unchanged  versus maybe what a generic calculation might kick out Douglas Harter    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Bose George from KBW  Please go ahead with your question Bose George    Keefe  Bruyette   Woods    AnalystHey  good morning  Actually  I don t know if you mentioned this but  where do spreads currently stand and just the levered ROEs  if you re running it at whatever 9 5  leverage Christopher J  Kuehl    Executive Vice PresidentYeah Hey  This is Chris  So 30 or 3s  Phonetic  or production coupons as an example yield around 2 5  with nominal spreads to the swap curve around the 100 basis points or so depending on the prepayment assumption So do you round numbers with 10 time leverage that would generate a gross spot ROE of around 12 5  before convexity cost  And specs as we ve talked about have performed well  And so  spreads are a little tighter there  But ROEs are still in the low double digits  But there s a range depending on the category Bose George    Keefe  Bruyette   Woods    AnalystOkay great  Thanks and then  just given that backdrop and where you re trading on price to book can you just give us updated thoughts on capital    new capital Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerSure  I mean  as you guys know  in 2019 we did not do a common offering  And we    early in the year the decision there was based on the fact that we really wanted to avoid higher coupon TBAs  And we talked about that on our first quarter call  And that was at a time when there was a lot of capital being raised  I think  in this environment  some of those concerns are    have been mitigated  We re comfortable with lower coupon TBAs That being said  this is an environment where you re going to want to look at the economics  And if there are opportunities for accretive equity and if we re comfortable with what we can add to the portfolio and the fact that we can do it within a reasonable amount of time  we re willing to raise equity But as we said last year  we    the benefits in terms of raising equity in terms of our operating efficiency are still there  But they re definitely lower than they were a couple of years ago  given our current size and scale And so therefore  for us to raise equity  we have to believe that it s accretive to shareholders and make sense kind of just from an economic perspective Bose George    Keefe  Bruyette   Woods    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Rick Shane from J P  Morgan  Please go ahead with your question Richard Shane    J P  Morgan    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for taking my questions this morning  First of all  Gary    and I apologize  part of your initial comments got cut off  So I m not sure you re aware of that  If you guys want to post a transcript that might be helpful And with that in mind  I was curious if during that part of the commentary you provided an update on direction of book value quarter to date Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerWe did provide that  I m sorry if there were issues with the call  But quarter to date book value is what Bernie talked about that is essentially unchanged  That s our best estimate today  Obviously  we haven t run through all of our processes and so forth But our best estimate is unchanged  In response to an earlier question I think the performance of specified collateral is a big driver of that versus maybe what some of the projections are Richard Shane    J P  Morgan    AnalystGot it  OK  I must have missed that in Bernie s comments  Those did come through  That s my fault  Second question  you had talked about not wanting to be over hedged in a down rate environment  And when we look at the hedge ratio it is approaching as high level  as you ve been at over the course of the time we followed you guys  Is the way to bring that hedge ratio down basically at this point to grow the book as opposed to reverse the swaps Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerSo  one thing is it s really important not to focus on the hedge ratio and focus more on the duration of the hedges versus the duration of our assets because as we talked a lot about and it s something that really helped us last year is even though we were raising our hedge ratio  we were significantly shortening the duration of our hedges  And so  the key really around not being over hedged is managing not the number of one to three year swaps that you have  it s more around longer term hedges and that s much more of our focus  Obviously  the duration gap is a good indicator of that  but it even goes beyond just the duration gap  The thing that will hurt you in terms of book value and in terms of really being over hedged is hedges that are outside of three years and in particular closer to 10 years and that s really the area that we re focused on and by having reduced those positions pretty substantially beginning really in the second quarter of last year  I think that s our biggest area of protection Peter J  Federico    President and Chief Operating OfficerAnd Rick just to round that out and to go home back to your point about the hedge ratio  if you look at our hedge portfolio  we ll likely have something like about  10 billion worth of swaps just or you know have a maturity of less than a year  So  naturally if you think about it  that hedge ratio would come down about 10  or so if we did nothing just allowing those shorter term hedges  to Gary s point  just run off Richard Shane    J P  Morgan    AnalystGot it  And you won t use    you won t    with the curve starting to normalize again  you won t be using swaps as and forgive this in artful word but as offensively as you did last year to generate income Peter J  Federico    President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  Well  yes  that s essentially right because what we saw last year is you needed to put on the swaps in order to lock in all of the Fed eases that were being priced into the market and that turned out to be at this point a good trade because the Fed is now    looks like it s on paused at three  Phonetic   So  as those swaps mature  funding should stabilize  And in essence you don t have to replace your those hedges in order to get the same benefit of ultimately our repo rate is going to decline and it should stabilize down around the Fed effective  So  we won t need to replace those in order to take advantage of the funding opportunity Richard Shane    J P  Morgan    AnalystTerrific  I ve taken too much of your time  Thank you Peter J  Federico    President and Chief Operating OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Trevor Cranston from JMP  Please go ahead with your question  Hi  thanks  You guys have mentioned a couple of times the tailwind you see to earnings in 2020  particularly on the funding cost side  I guess when we look back at earnings over the last couple of quarters  they ve been substantially higher than they were when you set the  0 16 dividend level and I guess in light of that and the tailwinds you ve talked about  can you share any current thoughts you guys have around the dividend level as you look forward into 2020  Thanks Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerYes sure  I ll be happy to address that and it s a logical question  And yes  I think you re right  we do expect our net spread and dollar roll income to be substantially above the dividend for the foreseeable future  That said  we don t have any plans to raise the dividend and the bottom line is we are definitely focused on trying to optimize shareholder returns and maximize them  but we re much less focused on which pocket in a sense that money goes and we actually think it s best to have some retained earnings and therefore  we have a tailwind to book value as we look ahead and we think that s the optimal place for shareholders OperatorOkay  got it  That s helpful  Thank you  Our next question comes from Brock Vandervliet from UBS  Please go ahead with your question  Hello  good morning  Thanks for taking the question  Obviously  I think you remarked on the coronavirus and the move in the 10 year  Can you just kind of refresh us  Gary  on where the 10 year would need to be and probably more importantly  where it would need to stick to really change some of your prepay assumptions Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerYou know that s a good question and it s certainly    it would have to be probably sub 1 40  Phonetic  on 10s before we get to kind of    we get materially lower in terms of mortgage rates than what we saw in September ish  September October  So  I think big picture we do have some cushion there  It s not a huge cushion  but on the other hand  we ve seen a pretty healthy rally in interest rates and this really does feel somewhat temporary  So I think big picture  the prepayment picture if we re in the    we ll call it 1 25  Phonetic   1 30  Phonetic  on 10s does start to get a more dicey and certainly in heading down there  we would expect mortgages to underperform in terms of price  One thing to keep in mind is this sort of a built in hedge there as mortgages tend to underperform in price  it obviously negatively impacts book value in the short run  but on the other hand  it actually gives us some protection around the actual cash flows on our mortgages because the prepayment picture is better than it otherwise would be  but that gives you sort of a feel for what we expect The one other thing I d add is that unlike  let s say the first part of the rally last year or let s say the second or third leg of the rally last year  we ve had more time at this point to optimize our portfolio for a low rate environment and if you look across the board almost    essentially all of our higher coupons are prepaid protected that have gone through the environment of last year and then the rest of the portfolio is low coupon brand new TBAs that are also going to perform reasonably well and then they are straightforward mitigating strategies to use such as downing coupon and swapping back into newer mortgages that we can use to further protect that part of the portfolio  So  the other thing to keep in mind is that the portfolio is much more kind of suited for the environment that I just described if it were to materialize OperatorGot it  Okay  And another big picture question on the GSEs  It s often tough to separate some of the policy suggestions as opposed to what may actually happen  Is there anything that you see coming down the pipe in the next year or so in terms of a structural change or a policy change that could affect your business in the GSEs Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerIn short  no  There s going to remain noise  but we don t see anything fundamental that s going to change  I guess the one thing that could change over the next couple of years is that it would be based on kind of what we ve heard publicly  I think there s a reasonable chance that REITs get access back to the flubs but no guarantees on that  But that looks like it might be in the cards and not in the near term  but let s say over a two year period which would be a benefit  Other than that  I think other changes look like they re going to just be on the margin OperatorOkay  great  Thanks for the questions  Nice quarter Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes fro m Henry Coffey from Wedbush  Please go ahead with your question  Yes good morning  everyone and it s great to be back listening to your call  Gary  Great quarter  A couple of issues  number one  going back to the dividend  Given some dynamic around taxable earnings  is there any specific pressure on the tax side that would either cause you to have to increase the dividend or even allow you to tick it lower Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerSo  no  I mean our taxable income for a number of reasons one of which is dollar rolls and one is accumulated other income losses is materially below our economic earnings and net spread and dollar roll income  So  taxable income which historically has been a constraint for REITs and kind of forced them to pay these very high dividends and dividends that kind of equal essentially the totality of your potential earnings isn t a problem for us for the foreseeable future  So it does give us a lot of flexibility with respect to where we set the dividend  That being said  as the earlier question related to we anticipate that our net spread and dollar roll income and our economic earnings are likely to exceed the current dividend for the foreseeable future  As such  they re really    that s a comfortable place for the company and I think we do think about this and we think about it intellectually  It s nice to have a positive tailwind for book value and we think that s a good thing for shareholders  So  we like the current situation and we would    and over time  we d like to stay in a position where there s a positive tailwind to book value and where we are able to retain some earnings  We do think that that s the right place to be over the long term  but in this environment  it looks like we re going to be able to do that OperatorNo  I think that s a great strategy if you re soliciting votes  The other thing is the success of the company has been around your ability to outperform TBAs with specified collateral  Is there anything you can do from an operating perspective and I don t even know what that would be to broaden your ability to in essence create assets whether it s on the side of the CRT bonds  which buying them in the open market doesn t look that attractive or somehow partnering with an originator or some sort of flow arrangement  I know you don t want to get too complex on the operating side  but given the importance of that part of the strategy  are there any thoughts you might have on what you could do from an operating perspective to positively impact that side of the business Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerWell  I think    look  first off  it s a good question  What I would say is  I think a component of our success or our alpha or our performance relative to the space over the last 10 years has clearly been asset selection  But one thing I would want to say is that asset selection is broader than just specified collateral  I think it starts and most importantly with avoiding the worst  which is something we re very good at and where you don t need let s say specific access to collateral or unique access to collateral in order to do that  The other area where I think we add alpha and that s helped us over the long run is around the hedging side of it  So one thing is specified collateral is important  but I d say  it s a component of that active management that I think has distinguished AGNC Now with respect to specified collateral or with respect to kind of moving closer to origination  it is something that we look at  We pay attention to potential opportunities over time  but I think we also have to be practical about our size and scale  which brings significant benefits to the company both in terms of operating efficiency and in terms of realistically the way the stock trades  And so those kind of strategies have to be really scalable and that s definitely something that we view as a challenge along those lines  So it s something we ll pay attention to  It s something if there were significant market disruptions that we pay more attention to  but we are comfortable in a sense being an Agency Mortgage Bond investor as we are today  still provides a substantial opportunity to outperform and actively manage the portfolio OperatorGreat  Thank you very much Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  And our final question today comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays  Please go ahead with your question  Yeah  Thank you  Peter in your prepared comments you alluded to kind of upcoming transition to more permanent measures by the Fed to stabilize liquidity in the repo markets  Could you talk a little bit more about kind of what you expect from those measures  What impact it could have to your repo costs and what if anything you can do to kind of hedge any volatility you might see in those repo costs Peter J  Federico    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure  Thanks for the questions  Good question  Mark  First  I think  the Fed deserves a lot of credit for adjusting and adapting over the quarter to the market s needs and really getting control of the repo situation  The challenge in the fourth quarter was that we knew the Fed was taking action  Generally  the market knew that  but it was hard to quantify because the Fed was involving its own position and ultimately as I said by the end of the year they really had a significant positive impact on the market  but it didn t get fully reflected into term prices  It s starting to get reflected now and I think the Fed is on the record and this is the important thing  It s not whether the Fed is going to handle this issue  it s how are they are going to handle this issue  The Chairman s comments yesterday I think gave us more confidence about that  right And I think what the Fed is going to do is transition to in its permanent measures using asset purchases as its primary tool which they were clear about yesterday buying at least  60 billion through May and then continuing importantly to grow its balance sheet  So I think what the Fed is essentially saying is that they re going to initially address this issue by making the excess reserves so significant in the system that they really won t have to worry too much about the transition mechanism problem  but also willing to do open market operations on an as needed basis  The two other things that I mentioned I think are still on the Fed s agenda which include potentially regulatory reform and a permanent repo facility  Those two things could have a very significant impact on the transition mechanism meaning it will make money flow a little easier than it flows today through the Fed s purchases or through it s open market operations  but I think the Fed is going to do that  I think the comments yesterday make it clear that they re committed to doing that in a gradual way and making sure that the markets continue to operate efficiently and if that s the case and we believe it s the case I think you ll see our funding costs come down to a much tighter spread relative to the Fed funds target  I think that s the easiest benchmark to think about for us as the Fed funds target and the natural spread in a sort of stable environment  it s probably closer to 15 basis points or 20 basis points not 50 basis points like it was in the fourth quarter  So that gives you an order of magnitude of where we think the improvement is going to go OperatorOkay  So it sounds like you don t expect the transition to create any kind of added volatility which could push those spreads back out at all Peter J  Federico    President and Chief Operating OfficerNo I don t and in fact what the Fed has already done is they ve already provided a calendar of open market operations through February  So we have certainty around that with overnight and term operations and as of yesterday the Chairman committed to open market operations through April now  So we know that they are going to continue to provide liquidity to the system while they grow their balance sheet which gives them sort of the permanent injection of liquidity OperatorOkay  That s great  Thank you Peter J  Federico    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen  with that we ll conclude today s question and answer session  At this time  I d like to turn the conference call back over to Gary Kain for any closing remarks Gary D  Kain    Director  Chief Executive Officer and Chief

204634,426150,AGNC,Will a Friendly Fed Fatten AGNC Investment s Dividend ,news,"AGNC Investment Corp   NASDAQ AGNC  reported earnings of  1 59 a share for the fourth quarter  the strongest since the second quarter of 2014  Many of the headwinds that bedeviled the company earlier in the year    like uncertainty about the Fed and trade    abated during the quarter  which boosted tangible net book value per share by 6 7  to  17 66 
A benign Federal reserve  and a return to calm
AGNC had a rough start to the year  missing estimates in the first and second quarters  largely due to the Fed tightening cycle that ended in December 2018  A tightening cycle means the Fed is raising interest rates  usually in hopes of controlling inflation  But by the middle of 2019  the Fed embarked on an easing cycle  and in July made the first of three decreases 

This change in policy benefited mortgage REITs  real estate investment trusts  in general  and increasing calm in the financial markets added to their returns  AGNC also benefited from improved sentiment in the financial markets  The company s year end earnings release quoted CEO and CIO Gary Kain as saying 

 Our economic return of 9 6  in the fourth quarter represents AGNC s best quarter since the second quarter of 2014 and drove a total economic return of 18 7  for the year  Looking ahead  we believe AGNC remains extremely well positioned to continue to generate attractive risk adjusted returns as a more benign interest rate environment and favorable developments on the financing front should serve as a positive tailwind for levered investors in Agency MBS as we enter 2020  

Brief primer on mortgage REITs
Mortgage REITs can seem like complicated instruments  and investors have to wade through a bunch of bond geek lingo when they read the earnings releases  That said  they really aren t all that complicated  Mortgage REITs like AGNC borrow money to invest in mortgages guaranteed by the U S  government  If that sounds a lot like what a bank does  you would be correct 
The main difference is that mortgage REITs borrow money in the money market  while banks generally take deposits  Since mortgages generally pay 4  to 5  interest  the REITs have to use leverage  borrowed money  to pump up the returns  
AGNC reported 18 7  economic return on tangible common equity in 2019  which encompasses the  2 00 per share it paid in dividends plus its tangible net book value per share  Comprehensive earnings per share were  2 16  so the payout ratio is 92   which is typical for a REIT 
Double digit dividend yields are rare these days  so it is worth it to take the time to understand AGNC s business 
In a nutshell  when the Fed is hiking rates  AGNC s cost of borrowing goes up  and the value of the asset portfolio generally falls  This takes a bite out of earnings and can cause the company to cut the dividend    which AGNC did last spring  lowering it from  0 18 a month to  0 16 
On the other side of the coin  when the Fed is cutting interest rates  the company s cost of borrowing falls  and the value of the assets on the balance sheet increase  In other words  it pays to keep tabs on what the Fed is doing and how things look in the future  Fortunately  there are ways to gather clues about future Fed intentions  
A benign Fed means fatter profits and dividends
With the Fed expected to be finished with rate increases for the foreseeable future  the environment is favorable for the mortgage REIT sector as a whole  The market currently anticipates at least one more rate cut by December  These probabilities are based on the trading prices of the Fed Funds futures contracts and are available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange website  Below is a snapshot of the current state of play 

This graph shows the current level of the Fed Funds rate  it is given in a range  which is how the Fed likes to express things   The market is assessing a 16 5  chance of no further moves by the Fed this year  a 34 4  probability of a 25 basis point cut    that is  a cut of 0 25     a 30  probability of a 50 basis point cut  and an almost 20  chance of something bigger 
This indicates that the market environment will be favorable for mortgage REITs like AGNC Investment Corp  for the next year ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psllj,2079587

204649,426165,AGNC,What s In The Cards For Two Harbors   TWO  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Two Harbors Investment Corp    NYSE TWO   is slated to report second quarter 2019 results on Aug 6  after market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year decline in its net interest income  NII  and core earnings per share In the last reported quarter  this hybrid mortgage real estate investment trust posted core earnings  including dollar roll income  per share of 49 cents  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents Over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed in the other  the average positive surprise being 4 19   The graph below depicts this surprise history Two Harbors Investments Corp Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderTwo Harbors  portfolio consists of a rates strategy and a credit strategy  The former includes Agency residential mortgage backed securities  MBS   Agency derivatives  mortgage servicing rights  MSR   to be announced securities  TBAs  and associated notional hedges The credit strategy consisted of legacy non Agency securities and their associated notional hedges During the second quarter  mortgage REITs witnessed expansion of pipelines  while origination activity began to pick up  Specifically  the 30 year mortgage rates declined from 4 08  at the beginning of the second quarter to 3 73  at the end of the quarter  according to figures released by Freddie Mac  This marked the lowest level of the 30 year rate since late 2016  Following suit  the 15 year fixed rates and 5 year fixed rate declined to 3 16  and 3 39   respectively Lower rates boosted issuance and originations during the quarter  with issuance of agency MBS surging 43  sequentially  Also  non agency MBS  backed by seasoned collateral  accounted for 54 3  of new issuance during the June end quarter  This buoyed aggregate issuance by Fan nie Mae  Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae that hit  330 65 billion Given the strength in the MBS sector  we anticipate the company to have increased investments in Agency and non Agency portfolios           Although significant decline in interest rates buoyed originations  it resulted in yield curve steepening and higher interest rate volatility  Furthermore  prepayment activity increased on account of lower interest rates  This is expected to have adversely impacted transactional activity and valuations for MSRs  thereby dampening the company s core earnings  Further  it is expected to have thwarted spreads on Agency MBSs during the quarter under review Amid these  Two Harbors  MSR portfolio is anticipated to have witnessed headwinds in the form of asset writedowns in the second quarter  Also  for second quarter 2019  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s NII is pegged at  63 2 million and suggests a 63 3  year over year slump In addition  unfavorable U S  treasury rates and weaker U S  economic fundamentals might act spoilsport for the company in the to be reported quarter  dragging down Two Harbors s net interest margin Additionally  due to the widening of agency and credit spreads  we anticipate the company to have registered a decline in its second quarter book value Lastly  prior to the second quarter earnings release  the company has been witnessing downward estimate revisions  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter to be reported has been revised marginally downward to 42 cents over the past month  reflecting analysts  bearish sentiments  Also  it represents a year over year decline of nearly 21  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Two Harbors is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earning ESP  Two Harbors  Earnings ESP is  2 38  Zacks Rank  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4  Sell   which decreases the predictive power of ESP It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank of 4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions You can see Performance of Other REITsAGNC Investment Corp    NASDAQ AGNC   reported second quarter 2019 net spread and dollar roll

of 63 cents per share Annaly Capital Management  Inc    NYSE NLY   posted second quarter core earnings  excluding premium amortization adjustment  PAA   of 25 cents per share  missing the Zacks

204650,426166,AGNC,AGNC Investment  Not Suitable For Retirement Accounts   Part 3,opinion,"Introduction
This is the third in a series of articles where I will be covering the historical performance and operating results of popular and highly recognized mREITs  mortgage REITs   In my first installment  I covered Annaly Capital Management  NLY  found here  in my second installment I covered Dynex Capital  DX   with this installment  I am covering AGNC Investment Corp AGNC 
Hopefully  for anyone that has followed this series  they would recognize by now that although these are all mortgage REITs with very high current yields  they are far from high return investments   In my previous two examples  I did illustrate that these companies generate a lot of cumulative dividend income over time  but simultaneously have been destroying principal   Additionally  they all have histories of cutting their dividends significantly and doing it numerous times in lockstep with their falling earnings   Consequently  despite their high current yields  they have produced rather anemic total return track records 
As a result  I have personally suggested that I do not consider them suitable instruments for retirement accounts   However  I want to clarify my position as well as clearly state why I don t consider these suitable for retirees looking for or needing income to live off 
Characteristics of Suitable Investments for Retirement Accounts
In my personal experience working with and talking with retired investors I believe I have a pretty good handle on what most retirees want   and perhaps more importantly   need   Retirees have generally worked long and hard for their money  and their retirement accounts generally represent their life savings 
Consequently  most retirees that I have talked to and worked with have given a clear message regarding what they want and what they need   For starters  they would like to think that they could get their hard earned money to now work for them as hard as they worked for it 
Additionally  and contrary to what many might suggest  retirement doesn t need to mean a reduced standard of living   This notion is often associated with another notion suggesting that retirees should choose fixed income over equities   Therefore  when and if the retiree does overweight fixed income  their fixed future incomes will be ravaged by inflation  and therefore  their standard of living will potentially diminish with time 
Of course  the idea of recommending fixed income is further predicated on the notion that it is safer than equity   At first glance  this seems to make sense  because most retirees that I talked to also stress a need and desire for safety   They intuitively and intelligently understand that they will not have the luxury of many decades of time to recoup losses if they should occur   As a result  the concept of safety is most often attached to preservation of capital  not losing their principal  
Furthermore  retirees often also associate safety with predictability   Retirees want and need to believe that their portfolios are producing a stable and preferably growing level of income   In my opinion  this is precisely why so many retirees are attracted to dividend growth investing as a strategy that can meet their goals and needs   Therefore  as a general statement  companies with long histories of increasing their dividend every year are desirable  and companies that reduce or cut dividends are considered undesirable 
Finally  most retirees understand that if it sounds too good to be true  it probably is   Consequently  the most prudent  and I would argue most intelligent retirees are smart enough not to chase yield

Since mortgage REITs don t own real estate  they are appropriately valued utilizing operating earnings   The following graphic clearly illustrates why I don t believe that mortgage REITs are suitable for retirement portfolios based on the criteria stated above  
The reader should note that operating earnings  the orange line on the graph  have been in a steady freefall since the beginning of 2011  and dividends  the white line  have fallen suit   This is a vital perspective that in my mind  clearly demonstrates why these are not suitable for prudent retirement accounts   Unfortunately  most investors don t have this perspective   All they see are statistics telling them that the valuations appear low  P E ratios  and the dividend yields high  current yield 12 17   





AGNC Investment Corp  Performance By The Numbers
However  when you evaluate long term performance by running the numbers  a more somber perspective comes to light  For starters  even though the current yield appears high at first glance  the long term reality tells an entirely different story  AGNC has reduced their dividend at a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of  11 2  since 2011 
To put this into perspective  had an investor put  10 000 in the stock on December 31  2010  they would have received  1948 52 in dividend income that year   However  their income would have fallen to  751 56 by year end 2018 and is forecast to fall another 4  in 2019   That s not your money working hard  that is your money hardly working 
Furthermore  this is significantly more severe than inflation eating away at fixed income   This is destruction of your income on top of inflation   Consequently  if you are living off your dividend income  your standard of living would be severely reduced 
As this relates to safety  not only has dividend income fallen since 2010  your principal would have been ravaged as well   That original  10 000 investment made on December 31  2010 would only be worth  5490 65 through yesterday s close   That is not price volatility  nor is that cyclicality  that is protracted financial destruction   Since I postulated that safety relates to preservation of capital  this mortgage REITs hardly meets that criteria 
Finally  the only thing that has been predictable with this company so far has been weakening fundamentals and dividend income   That is not the kind of predictability that retired investors are looking for   Instead  prudent retired investors want to see a steadily rising level of income   They might be able to withstand some volatility along the way  but volatility is not the same as a steadily falling stock price for more than 8 years in a row   Consequently  I would not call this mortgage REIT a cyclical investment  instead  I would call it a financial instrument of capital destruction 





General Dynamics  Earnings and Dividends Only
For perspective  I offer the following Dividend Aristocrat  General Dynamics  which is a high quality dividend growth stock that I do consider suitable for retirement accounts   Allow me to list the primary differences I see 
First and foremost  General Dynamics has grown earnings at an average rate of 7 13  since the beginning of 2011 in contrast to AGNC whose earnings were reduced by  11 34  per annum   Therefore  we have a consistently growing A  rated dividend growth blue chip that is steadily increasing shareholder value versus a mortgage REIT that is not rated that has been steadily diminishing shareholder value 
But perhaps most importantly  as it relates to retired investors relying on their dividend income to live off  General Dynamics has consistently increased its dividend each year   Consequently  retired shareholders have and can continue to look forward to seeing their dividend income increase each year 





General Dynamics  Performance By The Numbers
Moving on to a performance comparison we see that our blue chip dividend growth stock has provided its retired shareholders with a consistent dividend growth rate averaging 10 5  per year   Although our dividend income was admittedly less than what our mortgage reproduced  it did have the advantage of growing steadily every year rather than being reduced each year   Consequently  retired shareholders received a consistent and reasonably predictable income increase each year   That s analogous to getting a raise in pay each year  
Furthermore  our dividend growth stock has also increased our principal 2 7 times over this timeframe  whereas AGNC reduced our principal by over 45   shrinking our original  10 000 investment into a mere  5483 69   Moreover  when dividends are included in the total return calculation  assuming they were spent not reinvested  we also discover that our Dividend Aristocrat also outperformed the general market over this timeframe 





mREIT AGNC Investment Corp vs Dividend Aristocrat General Dynamics  FAST Graphs Analyze out Loud Video
The primary focus of the following video will be to illustrate why I do not consider AGNC a suitable choice for the retirement accounts of investors that are already retired   I will accomplish that by providing a perspective beyond current statistics  AGNC was founded in 2008  and it could be argued that our long running bull market since that time has been a worst case environment 
Nevertheless  it has brought more than a decade of subpar total return performance despite the stock offering high current yields   Therefore  my objective is to take the blinders off the reader s eyes thereby moving from a narrow minded look at current statistics to a broader and I believe clear longer term view and perspective   I believe a good way to accomplish this is by also contrasting AGNC and its long term performance with the blue chip Dividend Aristocrat General Dynamics 
Summary and Conclusions
I am hopeful that this series has opened investors  eyes to the reality that high yield does not imply high return   In fact  in most cases  just the opposite is true   On the other hand  high yield typically does imply high risk and often leads to below average total returns   Taking on high risk to get a lower rate of return is the exact opposite of what taking on high risk should be about   In theory at least  we should only take on higher risk with the expectation of earning higher returns as our reward 
Additionally  I am hopeful that this series has also opened investors  eyes to the reality that statistics don t always tell the complete story   Statistically speaking AGNC looks quite attractive   Their blended P E ratio is only 7 5 which would normally indicate a very low valuation   Their current yield of 12 17  is extremely high relative to current interest rates and yields on most securities 
However  this high yield is very misleading considering how often and how drastically this mortgage REIT has cut its dividend   Regarding what appears to be a low P E ratio  that is only true if the business is growing   As clearly illustrated  that has not been the case for AGNC since it was founded in 2008 
In closing  for all the reasons stated above  I do not believe that high yielding mortgage REITs are suitable investments for prudent retirement accounts where the retiree needs their dividend income to live off   I would acknowledge that there might be ways to trade these mortgage REITs and or speculate in them   Nevertheless  I do not consider them prudent and conservative long term buy and hold investments as I believe retirees should strive for   Caveat emptor

204657,426173,AGNC,A Look At Mortgage REIT ETFs Post Q4 Earnings,opinion,"Flattening of the yield curve acted as a deterrent for mortgage REITs  mREITs  in the fourth quarter  This is because mortgage REITs borrow money at short term interest rates and when they buy mortgages  they lend it at rates near the higher long term rates 
Against this backdrop  we have highlighted the earnings performance of a couple of major players in the mortgage REIT sector  AGNC Investment Corp   NASDAQ AGNC   andAnnaly Capital Management Inc   NYSE NLY    which reported at January end and mid February  respectively 
Having said this  we would like to note that the U S  treasury yield curve has been steepening this year owing to dovish Fed comments  This should work in favor of the sector  Investors should note that key mREIT ETFs have gained around 8  this year  see  here  
Earnings in Detail
AGNC Investment reported fourth quarter 2018 net spread and dollar roll income  excluding estimated catch up premium amortization benefit  of 53 cents per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents  Moreover  the figure was lower than the prior year 62 cents 
Fourth quarter comprehensive loss per common share was 90 cents against comprehensive income per common share of 3 cents in the prior quarter  Net interest income  NII  of  186 million was lower than the prior quarter  188 million 
Annaly Capital Management reported fourth quarter 2018 core earnings  excluding premium amortization adjustment  PAA   of 29 cents a share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  However  the figure compares unfavorably with the year ago tally of 31 cents 
NII totaled  272 9 million  down around 13 5  sequentially in the fourth quarter  Probably this is the reason why shares of the company declined 1 2  in the trading session following the release of fourth quarter 2018 results

204669,426185,AGNC,Should Value Investors Pick AGNC Investment  AGNC  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put AGNC Investment Corp    NASDAQ AGNC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AGNC Investment has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 4  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts AGNC Investment s current PE ratio equivalent to its midpoint  which is also 7 9  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 9 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that AGNC Investment has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 9  equal to the company s trailing twelve months PE ratio P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  AGNC Investment s P CF ratio of 4 3 is slightly lower than the industry average of 5 4  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AGNC Investment currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AGNC a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though AGNC Investment might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of D  This gives AGNC a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 1 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AGNC Investment Corp  Price and Consensus    Despite having a somewhat bullish trend  AGNC carrries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   This indicates that analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future  Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAGNC Investment is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 40  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite positive estimate revision activity  investors should wait for industry trends and broader factors to turn around first   When they do  this stock could be a compelling value pick Investor Alert  Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating substantial revenue  and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight  and so are big potential profits for early investors  Zacks names 5 stocks to buy now ,2018-01-02,Zacks Investment

204670,426186,AGNC,Mortgage REIT ETFs Head To Head  REM Vs  MORT,opinion,"The real estate sector has been attracting a lot of investor attention lately  Concerns over Fed s stance on monetary policy have been bothering the sector because if the interest rates are hiked faster than anticipated  it will weigh on people s ability to borrow 
Mortgage REITs borrow money at short term interest rates and when they buy mortgages  they lend it at rates near the higher long term rates  Their lucrative dividends set them apart from traditional fixed income and money market securities  However  they underperform in a rising rate environment  as an increase in mortgage rates hampers the performance of the sector  as home loans become costlier and demand falls 
Economic Scenario
U S  markets recently suffered a sell off owing to fears of rising rates  The S P 500 entered correction territory  as it declined more than 10  from the record high set in January  Strong wage growth and jobs data introduced fears of inflation making a comeback and led investors to bet on aggressive rate hikes 
Consumer prices increased 2 1  year over year in January  unchanged from the previous month but above economists  forecasts of 1 9   Moreover  President Donald Trump s tax reform and spending deal might add further pressure on prices  Hence  the Fed is expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation  Given this  markets are betting on the Fed to hike rates more than three times suggested earlier  Per the  Fed Watch tool  there is an 83 1  chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in March  read    
Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector 
iShares Mortgage Real Estate ETF 
This fund seeks to provide exposure to the mortgage REIT space and tracks the FTSE NAREIT All Mortgage Capped Index  It has AUM of  1 0 billion and charges a fee of 48 basis points a year  It has 37 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as more than 70  of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings 
The fund s top three holdings are Annaly Capital Management REIT Inc   NYSE NLY    AGNC Investment REIT Corp   NASDAQ AGNC   and New Residential Investment REIT Co   NYSE NRZ   with 17 9   11 1  and 8 2  allocation  respectively  as of Feb 16  2018    The fund has returned 6 0  in a year but has lost 5 4  year to date  REM has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold   with a Medium risk outlook 
VanEck Vectors Mortgage REIT Income ETF   NS MORT  
This fund seeks to provide exposure to mortgage REIT space and tracks the MVIS Global Mortgage REITs Index  It has AUM of  133 1 million and charges a fee of 41 basis points a year  It has 26 holdings and bears concentration risk as more than 63  of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings 
The fund s top three holdings are Annaly Capital Management REIT Inc  AGNC Investment REIT Corp and Starwood Property Trust Inc   NYSE STWD   with 14 0   8 5  and 6 0  allocation  respectively  as of Feb 16  2018   The fund has returned 6 3  in a year but has lost 5 7  year to date  MORT has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  with a Medium risk outlook 
Bottom Line
REM is more popular than MORT  as is evident from its higher AUM  However  MORT may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio   
At the same time  both the funds have had relatively similar year to date performance  REM has lost a mere 0 3  less than MORT so far this year  whereas in a year  it underperformed MORT by 0 3   U S  housing starts increased 9 7  to 1 326 million units in January  the highest since October 2016  per the Commerce Department  However  rising mortgage rates and housing prices may weigh on the momentum

Economic News The Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate Wednesday in a vote of confidence in the U S  economy s durability while signaling that it plans to continue a gradual approach to rate hikes for 2018 under its new chairman  Jerome Powell 
The U S  dollar posted its largest loss in two months when the Federal Reserve turned out to be less hawkish than anticipated  The Fed raised interest rates on Wednesday and forecast two more hikes for 2018 in its first policy meeting under new Fed Chairman Powell 
 Since some investors had expected it to project 3 more rate hikes  the guidance was perceived by some as less hawkish than anticipated  a positive factor for risk assets in general  though analysts noted the Fed was upbeat on the economy on the whole 
They also forecast three hikes next year and two more in 2020 and clearly revised up the growth forecast as well  
 The effects of the Federal Reserve interest rate hike on Wednesday will extend beyond corporate America to household budgets  Most people will see at least a minor impact on their credit card statements in the next few billing cycles  while those with adjustable rate mortgages  home equity lines of credit  auto loans and other loans with variable rates of interest will be hit hardest 
Fixed rate mortgages are also going to become more expensive  which could have a chilling effect on the real estate market  Higher interest rates typically depress home values by making monthly mortgage payments more expensive 
The average rate on a five year Treasury indexed adjustable rate mortgages is currently about 3 67 percent  according to Freddie Mac  ARM rates are modified annually  so a 0 25 percentage point increase in the rate in March wouldnt have an immediate effect  But when it does kick in  it could add up to  1 250 a year to interest payments on a  500 000 mortgage  That mortgage owner could pay an additional  312 50 a month  or  3 750 a year  in interest if the Fed follows through with the three quarter point hikes that it forecast for 2018 at its December policy meeting  For every 100 basis point increase in the fed funds rate  historically  it has been the case that the adjustable rate mortgage rate would go up by 70 basis points   Source  Reuters 
Existing home sales rose 3  to a 5 54m annualized rate  ahead of forecasts  The Leading Economic Indicators index rose for the 5th straight month  and eight of the 10 indicators that make up the leading index advanced  with the largest gain in average weekly mfg  hours  Building permits and stock prices lagged

204680,426196,AGNC,What The Recent Fed Meeting Means For Mortgage REITs,opinion,At the end of the two day meeting on Wednesday  the Federal Reserve noted that it will commence its balance sheet normalization program this October  However  the central bank refrained from raising the benchmark interest rates for now The central bank will downsize its  4 5 trillion bond portfolio by allowing maturity of up to  10 billion of mortgage backed securities and Treasury bonds every month  without reinvesting the proceeds  The monthly cap will gradually increase until it reaches  50 million     Since an outright sale could cause major turbulence in the bond market  the Fed has resorted to the above mentioned steady and gradual run off process  This action is anticipated to put upward pressure on the long end of the yield curve Moreover  the Fed s decision to keep the short term interest rates unchanged will help steepen the yield curve This is a sign of relief for mortgage real estate investment trusts  mREITs   which typically borrow significant amount of short term debt and invest in longer term real estate debts  like mortgage backed securities  MBS  and mortgages  It will also enable these companies to earn higher yield spread Further  the prospects of a steepening yield curve will result in capital rotation from stocks to safe haven bond markets  This is primarily because these markets will provide attractive returns at lower risks  This too can improve the performance of mREITs That being said  year to date  the  has outperformed the broader   The industry rallied 11 6  versus the 9 6  growth of the broader sector Additionally  shares of Annaly Capital Management  Inc    NYSE NLY    AGNC Investment Corp    NASDAQ AGNC   and ARMOUR Residential REIT  Inc   NYSE ARR   have substantially outperformed the broader finance sector  year to date While Annaly carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   AGNC Investment and ARMOUR Residential carry a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   You can see 5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ,2017-09-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-the-recent-fed-meeting-means-for-mortgage-reits-200214928,200214928

204683,426199,AGNC,Life Is Good For Mortgage Reit ETFs,opinion,"Real estate stocks have taken a beating in recent months as rising interest rates derail the momentum of this beloved income sector  Yet despite the dip in traditional housing and commercial REITs  one high yield segment of the market is still seeing surging prices 
Mortgage REITs  or mREITs  have largely ignored the trend in Treasury bonds and instead focused on the continued strength in overall credit conditions  This has translated into new all time highs for the small group of exchange traded funds that track these investments 
To review  mortgage REITs are an alternative income generating vehicle versus traditional stocks or bonds  These companies borrow short term money at cheap interest rates and use it to buy long term mortgage related debt  This enables them to pocket the spread on interest rates and distribute the majority of earnings to shareholders as income  They also use embedded leverage to increase their capital at risk 
The largest fund by a wide margin in this arena is the iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped  NYSE REM   which as  1 2 billion in total assets  This ETF is home to a diverse basket of 36 mREITs with top holdings in well known names such as Annaly Capital Management Inc  NYSE NLY  and AGNC Investment Corp  NASDAQ AGNC   The index is market cap weighted  which gives the largest share of assets to the biggest companies  As such  NLY and AGNC make up over 28  of the total asset allocation 

REM is one of a very select group of ETFs that offers a yield north of 9   For comparison purposes  junk bond indexes currently yield 6   investment grade bonds 3   and Treasuries in the low 2  range  During dips in price  REM has even been known to offer investors an income stream that touches double digits  That s an extremely wide spread to Treasuries and other high quality debt instruments  It s also worth noting that income is paid quarterly to investors in these funds  rather than monthly as many bond funds do 
The thing I always caution investors about when they get googly eyed over yield is to remember that there is no free lunch in the income world  The larger the income stream  the greater risk of volatility and capital deprecation  That is why these tools should be used in moderation and with the understanding that they are at the upper end of the risk scale 
For comparison purposes  REM has recently  like you would find in the Vanguard REIT  NYSE VNQ   The chart below shows how these two funds were maintaining a fair degree of correlation prior to the jump higher in rates 

Historically these mREITs can be sensitive to changes in both interest rates and credit conditions  Although in today s market they appear more fixated in the strength of stocks and high yield bonds  Any meaningful contraction in those areas will likely result in a concomitant pullback in REM as well 
For those that like a menu of options at their disposal  the VanEck Vectors Mortgage REIT Income  NYSE MORT  is a direct competitor to REM  This fund own a concentrated mix of 26 mREITs with a greater percentage of assets spread to the smaller holdings  MORT also charges a moderated expense ratio of 0 41  versus 0 48  in REM  This fund currently has over  100 million in assets and a 30 day SEC yield near 10  
Lastly  for those who have an extremely high risk tolerance level and don t like to sleep much at night  there are exchange traded notes in this field with a built in leverage component  The UBS E TRACS Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged Mortgage REIT  NYSE MORL  tracks an index of mREITs with a 2x daily price magnification  This fund has a current listed yield of 20 49  and income is paid monthly to shareholders 
Keep in mind that leverage on leverage is a volatile recipe with high costs and potentially unpredictable tracking patterns over long periods of time  Funds of this nature should be very carefully examined and used with great caution 
The Bottom Line
It s always worth noting where the areas of strength or weakness are in the market and mREITs have certainly held a resilient path despite many obstacles  I don t currently own exposure to this segment of the market for my clients and would prefer to evaluate it again on a drop rather than buying up here near the highs  These types of funds would likely be appropriate as a small tactical play in the context of a  with the inherent expectation of above average yield and price volatility

204686,426202,AGNC,Is American Capital Agency Corp   AGNC  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put American Capital Agency Corp    NASDAQ AGNC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  American Capital Agency has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 02  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 97  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts American Capital Agency s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified REIT and Equity Trustindustry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 9 13  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that American Capital Agency has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 20  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in near futureP CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  American Capital Agency s P CF ratio of 3 44 is lower than the Zacks classified REIT and Equity Trustindustry average of 9 39  which indicates that the stock is somewhat overvalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  American Capital Agency currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes American Capital Agency a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though American Capital Agency might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives AGNC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  D    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current quarter has seen seven three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen five upward and no downward movements  in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 9  in the past two months and the full year estimate has grown by 7 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below American Capital Agency Corp  Price and Consensus   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmerican Capital Agency is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 40  out of more than 250 industries   it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks REIT and Equity Trustindustry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Best   Worst of ZacksToday you are invited to download the full  up to the minute

204687,426203,AGNC,3 Reasons Momentum Stock Investors Will Love American Capital Agency  AGNC ,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on American Capital Agency Corp    NASDAQ AGNC   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for AGNC s status as a solid momentum stock below Short Term Price Change for American Capital AgencyA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity  This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now  It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area With a one week price change of 3 4  compared to an industry average of 2 3   AGNC is certainly well positioned in this regard  The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large as well Longer Term Price Change for American Capital AgencyWhile any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of AGNC  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 11 1  to 5 4  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 14 7   Clearly  AGNC is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors American Capital Agency Corp  PE Ratio  TTM    AGNC Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with AGNC as of late too Over the past two months  five earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that four estimates have moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too   These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago AGNC was expected to post earnings of  2 24 share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of  2 45 for the full year now  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have AGNC as a security with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of  A   You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep AGNC on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services  Would you like to peek behind the curtain today and view them   Starting now  for the next month  I invite you to follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time from value to momentum   from stocks under  10 to ETF to option movers   from insider trades to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  we ve called them with 80   accuracy   You can even look inside portfolios so exclusive that they are normally closed to new investors ,2017-06-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-momentum-stock-investors-will-love-american-capital-agency-(agnc)-200196613,200196613

204693,426209,AGNC,ETFs To Watch As Mortgage REITs Beat On Q3 Earnings,opinion,"Mortgage REITs  mREITs  performed well for most part of the third quarter  which helped companies in the space to post encouraging earnings in the quarter  The Fed s decision to keep interest rates unchanged during the quarter played a significant role in boosting mREITs last quarter  These REITs finance their investments with equity and debt capital and generate profits through the spread between interest income on mortgage assets and funding costs 
Meanwhile  mREITs  concerted measures to reposition their portfolio as a hedge against interest rate uncertainty is also speculated to have a positive impact on the sector  Separately  their dividend payout ends up being more lucrative than yields on fixed income and money market accounts  This has helped them to attract significant investor attention in the recent times  read    
Below we have highlighted the earnings of some of the major players in the mortgage REIT sector 
mREITs Earnings in Focus
American Capital Agency Corp    NASDAQ AGNC   saw  2016 net spread and dollar roll income of 64 cents per share  excluding the estimated  catch up  premium amortization benefit   ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents  While this was the second straight quarter in which the company came up with better than expected income  the reported figure also came in higher than 51 cents in the prior year quarter  Though the company s net interest income   NII   of  219 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  235 million it was higher than  217 million in the prior year quarter  read    
As of Sep 30  2016  the company s net book value per share was  22 91  up from  22 22 as of Jun 30  2016  This rise was attributed to interest rate hedges outperforming agency mortgage backed securities   MBS    Separately  AGNC Investment declared monthly dividends of 20 cents per share for July  August and September 
Another key player  Annaly Capital Management  Inc    NYSE NLY   reported  2016 normalized core earnings per share of 29 cents  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent but lower than 30 cents earned in the year ago quarter  NII totaled  384 5 million  down 12 9  year over year and significantly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  248 million  read

204697,426213,AGNC,Havens And Traps If Rates Go Negative,opinion,"During recent Congressional testimony  Fed Chair Janet Yellen said she s looking carefully at moving to a negative federal funds rate 
As income investors  we must protect ourselves from this very real possibility  while also recognizing that some investments are much safer than others 
So let s start with one truly terrible investment group   banks 
Yes  banks will do very badly indeed under negative interest rates because they daren t risk passing the negative interest rates on to their depositors  If they did  deposits would vanish into cash piles buried under mattresses 
So long as banks don t pass negative rates on to their depositors  their profits will be badly squeezed  The cost of much of their funding will exceed what they receive on risk free assets 
And that s just one of many reasons why negative interest rates are a bad idea 
Such rates would also cause banks to reduce their leverage and cut back on their lending  because the spreads between deposit and lending rates would no longer be sufficient to cover overheads 
By pushing interest rates negative  central banks will achieve the precise opposite of their stated goals 
Of course  the world s central banks  along with various Keynesian pundits  are pushing the idea of getting rid of cash altogether  That would allow central banks to set rates at negative 20   or whatever crazy figure they feel like 
Thus  we have to hope that the combined power of  peasants with pitchforks    even in the EU and Japan  where the people have a  sheeple  quality about them   will prevent central banks from implementing this very bad idea 
In Japan  which has suffered with zero interest rates longer than any other country and recently went to a negative rate  fourth quarter GDP was down at a 1 7  annual rate and January exports were down 12 9  from a year earlier 
What s more  Japan Post Bank  T 7182  shares are down 18  from their flotation price in November because Japan s negative interest rates undermine the bank s business model  its assets are almost all low risk Japan Government Bonds  which now yield zero for a 10 year maturity  
Traditional Japanese retail investors are rightly annoyed at a government that lured them into a supposedly safe investment and then destroyed it with dozy policies 
A Silver Lining 
Fortunately  there s also some good news for income investors 
Negative short term interest rates will produce a few winners  including a group of stocks that pays spectacular dividends  residential mortgage real estate investment trusts  REITs  
Residential mortgage REITs fund themselves in the short term markets and invest in home mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  By leveraging  they aim to turn the 3  4  yields on mortgage bonds into 10  20  returns  most of which is paid out as dividends 
I d always been down on the mortgage REIT sector  regarding it as very high risk  If interest rates go up  the  gap  between short term funding costs and long term bond income disappears  and the value of the REIT s bond portfolio declines 
This happened in 2012 13  when American Capital Agency Corp   O AGNC  shares lost half of their value in six months 
But with negative interest rates  the opposite happens  The cost of funding  being based in short term money markets  declines   probably below zero  the REITs can borrow cheaply because they can  repo  their low risk bond portfolio  
At the same time  the yield on assets stays well above zero  And if mortgage rates do decline  the value of the portfolio increases  giving the REIT a capital gain  Thus  either net income increases or capital does  a double sided gain 
The two largest pure home mortgage REITs are AGNC and Annaly Capital Management Inc   N NLY  
AGNC  with a market capitalization of  6 1 billion  is trading at 79  of book value and offering a dividend yield of 13 7  based on quarterly dividends of  0 60 per share 
NLY  which has a market capitalization of  9 4 billion and is trading at 83  of book value  offers a dividend yield of 12 3  based on a quarterly dividend of  0 30 per share 
Neither of these companies earns enough to cover their dividends  based on trailing four quarters earnings  because short term rates have been trending upwards  narrowing spreads and pressuring capital value 
But if Yellen does decide to lower rates below zero  both companies are poised to benefit spectacularly  probably giving you a capital gain as they come to sell above book value 
Still  don t put too much in them   they remain high risk regardless 
For better sleep at night protection  there s always gold  As everybody sneers  it offers no yield  But if yields elsewhere are negative  zero begins to look like a good deal 
And there s no doubt it offers better capital protection than today s funny money  That s probably why it s up 15  since January 1

204698,426214,AGNC,Bill Gross s Take On Bonds Reflects What I m Buying Now,opinion,"Barron s did an interview with Bond King Bill Gross in this weekend s issue  see      While I find his incessant Fed bashing to be tiresome  Gross is still a living legend  and I take his views on markets seriously  Here are a few nuggets from the interview I liked 
On running an unconstrained bond fund 

A manager of an unconstrained fund not only has more choices  but has to accept more risk  The unconstrained universe was born six or seven years ago from the idea that interest rates would bottom at some point  and bonds no longer would provide a decent return  in fact  returns might be negative  From conception  these funds were relatively neutral  duration wise  To the extent that duration is minimized  a greater emphasis must be put on other elements of return  including credit  volatility  currency  and liquidity 

On the role demographics will play in the future 

Structurally  demographics are a problem for global growth  The developed world is aging  with Japan the best example  Italy is another good example  and Germany is a good  old society  too  As baby boomers get older  they spend less and less  But capitalism has been based on an ever expanding number of people  It needs consumers 
Another thing happening is deglobalization  whether it s Donald Trump building a wall to keep out Mexicans  or European nations putting up fences to keep out migrants  Larry Summers  former secretary of the Treasury  has talked about secular stagnation  or a condition of little or no economic growth  At Pimco  I used the term  the new normal  to refer to this condition  It all adds up  again  to very slow growth  The days of 3  and 4  annual growth are gone 

Interestingly  Gross and I are fishing in some of the same ponds  buying closed end funds and mortgage REITs

204700,426216,AGNC,ETFs To Watch Post Dull Mortgage REIT Earnings,opinion,"The year has been marked with ups and downs for mortgage REITs that provide real estate financing through the purchase of mortgages and mortgage backed securities  MBS   Volatile markets triggered by global growth worries and mixed numbers from the U S  economy weighed on these REITs 

	In fact  this turbulence along with seesawing oil prices led to the central bank lowering the projected number of hikes this year  The Fed now expects the federal funds rate to rise to 0 875  by the end of the year  instead of the previously expected 1 375   implying only two rate hikes as compared to the four projected in December  In its April meeting  the Fed kept the rates unchanged  read    

	A low interest rate environment is expected to benefit the performance of mortgage REITs  These REITs finance their investments with equity and debt capital and generate profits through the spread between interest income on mortgage assets and funding costs  Lower interest rates would certainly aid their borrowing cost  pushing earnings and dividends higher  Meanwhile  these companies are buying back shares and diversifying their businesses to beat market woes

204702,426218,AGNC,Avoid Leverage When Looking For REITs,opinion,"As the price of oil fell  master limited partnerships  MLPs  were devastated 
Income investors seeking to goose their monthly income had few alternatives to turn to  which led many to choose real estate investment trusts  REITs  
In general  REITs are a sensible choice  But within them lurks a hidden danger  leverage 
But as long as excessive leverage is avoided  REITs can make a sound long term income investment 
Here s how to do it profitably   and safely 
The Dangers of Leverage
There are two types of REITs 
Mortgage REITs  which invest in the mortgage debt of either residential real estate  generally guaranteed by   or  
And equity REITs  which invest in real estate stocks themselves 
Leverage is especially dangerous in mortgage REITs 
Whether in mortgage REITs subject to interest rate risk  or in equity REITs subject to illiquidity risk  leverage could increase the chance of a bankruptcy in a downturn 
Take mortgage REIT American Capital Agency Corp  NASDAQ AGNC   for example  Its debt is around six times its equity  The company finances its home mortgage assets in the repurchase agreement market  thereby picking up six times the spread between short term and long term interest rates 
It also has a peculiar income statement  with no operating income and substantial  other income  from its activity in the derivatives market 
This gives it a net income figure that fluctuates wildly  even when interest rates are relatively stable  That s why the company shows a net loss of  779 million in the first quarter of 2016  a relatively quiet time in the debt markets 
Add it all up  and even a dividend yield of 12 7  isn t enough to compensate us for the risks 
Those risks involve capital losses  due to American Capital s assets declining in value as interest rates rise  and a loss in income as short term rates rise and remove the profitable  spread  between its short term funding and its long term assets 
Another mortgage REIT  Resource Capital Corp  NYSE RSO   avoids many of American Capital s leverage problems  although it still isn t a solid investment 
Resource Capital invests in commercial mortgage loans  primarily with floating interest rates  so it doesn t have as much interest rate risk as American Capital 
Its leverage is also lower  with debt only 2 3 times equity   a reasonable level since its assets are mortgage loans  And it offers an even more spectacular yield   13 3  based on annual dividends of  1 68  and is trading at only 49  of net asset value  so there s a little cushion to take care of hiccups 
The problem is  if you look back  Resource Capital lost more than half its value in the 2008 09 downturn  and dropped again last year when some loans went wrong 
There s not much point in having a solid dividend yield if you have to give it up in capital  So although Resource Capital seems attractive  buyer beware 
Choosing a Safer Option
You ll also want to avoid high leverage on equity REITs  as well as areas where there are signs of overbuilding  which is due to eight years of ultra low interest rates  
Take the hotel industry  for example  It s enjoyed an excessively good run  with massive overbuilding of increasingly larger projects  The retail sector  however  is in the early stages of a massive shakeout  as more shoppers are spending their money online and major retail chains are struggling to survive 
I m also wary of the office segment  Companies are discovering that they can save money on office space by having employees who work mostly on the road or at home share desks 
In the equity REIT sector  you might want to consider EPR Properties  NYSE EPR   which specializes in entertainment  education  and recreation properties in the United States and Canada 
EPR has a monthly dividend of  0 32   a yield of 5 4   Those dividends are somewhat in excess of earnings  but are solidly covered by operating cash flow  which doesn t fluctuate very much  The company is a substantial  diversified REIT with market capitalization of  4 5 billion  And its balance sheet is in decent shape  with a debt to equity ratio of less than 1 to 1 
There s no reason why EPR s businesses should get in trouble anytime soon  unlike retail properties and office space 
Of course  a recession would cause difficulties  But EPR s stock price is currently four times its level in 2007  before the financial crisis hit  That  above all  is an assurance that the company isn t diluting its equity to pay dividends  as so many REITs do 
The REIT sector is filled with snares for the unwary  especially after so many years of ultra low interest rates 
But by avoiding leverage and the sectors most vulnerable to it  income investors can secure themselves a decent income and capital value that will at least spring back after any recession

204704,426220,AGNC,Calling For A Reversal In Income Stocks,opinion,There has been a lot of talk of the unwind of the yield stock  You have seen it in the sell off of monster REITs like American Capital Agency  AGNC  and stocks such as Verizon  VZ   Selling off dividend names because the Fed may stop buying bonds this year  and eventually move to raise rates in 2014 by 25  50 or 100 basis points seems insane to me  A 3  or 4  10 year bond yield or 50bp on a money market account is not going to be enough to make up for the yields on high quality stocks at 4 or 5  and REITs closer to 10   But hey what do I know  One thing I do know is that the price action in these names is showing signs that there are traders that have the same mindset as mine  So let s take a look and maybe we can all be wrong together  Starting with American Capital Agency  the move off of the high less than a month ago has reached 25   It printed a Hollow Red Hammer candle with a very long lower shadow  This is at the previous bottom from November  It is very extended below the Simple Moving Averages  SMA  and and the Relative Strength Index  RSI  closed under 20  These are conditions for a reversal  Look for a close back over Wednesday s high to confirm it  For you fundamental people  it is also now trading at a 9  discount to the book value  The move lower has raised the dividend yield back to 18   If you think that is not sustainable then what is  Half of that  Even at a quarter it would yield 4 5   You can t shake a stick at that  Verizon is of a different variety  But the technicals also point to a possible reversal soon  Having completed an extreme Crab pattern  it is nearing a 38 2  retracement of the move higher  It may continue lower 7 but this is the first price objective out of the Crab and the next is at 45 24  the 61 8  retracement  It suggests that it is time to see that the RSI is moving near the technically oversold level  and that there has been some historic importance at the 38 2  level from late March into April  Definitely wait for the bounce  but it has already raised the dividend yield up over 4   It could reach 4 5  at the 61 8  retracement  The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment  I or my affiliates may hold positions or other interests in securities mentioned in the Blog  please see my  page for my full disclaimer ,2013-05-29,Gregory W.

204705,426221,AGNC,4 Overlooked ETFs With Double Digit Yield,opinion,Though the broad U S  equity markets have been hitting multiple highs  concerns have cropped up over its continued bullish run in the second half of the year  This is primarily due to expensive stock valuations  uneven global economic recovery  geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Iraq   and new threats from Portugal s banking sector that are looming large across the globe  In addition  economists reduced the growth outlook from 2 5  to 1 6  for this year  according to the recent survey by the National Association of Business Economics  Further  Treasury yields are declining since the start of the year despite the Fed tapering  In fact  yields on 10 year Treasuries have dropped from 3 00  at the start of the year to around 2 55  currently  This has urged investors to look elsewhere in the ETF space for their current income  As such  they are showing great interest in products that pay outsized yields irrespective of the segments  Investors should note that high dividend paying ETFs play a defensive role in a portfolio and can reduce volatility in turbulent times  Further  these products provide greater stability and safety thanks to their strong cash flow streams  While U S  dividend ETFs have been popular over the past few months  the yield hungry investors often overlook the products that do not include the top dividend paying companies but still offer robust yields  Some of these funds could be illiquid and might not participate in the global stock rally but offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis  Below  we have highlighted four ETFs with double digits yields that could be the perfect choice for investors seeking higher income in the ultra low rate environment while protecting the downside risk from market uncertainty  Yield on these products are clearly crushing the broad dividend space and the high yield bond world by wide margins Silver Shares Covered Call ETN  SLVO    Yield  16 63  This ETN offers investors a safer way to play the precious metals market while receiving an excellent income flow  SLVO tracks the Credit Suisse NASDAQ Silver FLOWS 106 Index and employs a covered call strategy on a notional investment in iShares Silver Trust ETF  SLV     Basically  the product will hold a notional long position in SLV while at the same time notionally sell out of the money call options on the position on a monthly basis  With this process  any premium received over the notional trading costs is paid out to investors  This approach does cap risk  but big gains are unlikely with this ETN  The product gained 6 7  in the year to date time frame  slightly higher than the gain of 6 2  for SLV and has higher dividend yield of 16 63  annually  However  it is worth noting that this product has paltry volumes  which could result in higher bid ask spreads and increased trading costs  This makes the note a bit pricey as its expense ratio already comes in at an elevated level of 0 65   Further  since the product is structured as a note  it is exposed to the credit risk of the issuer iShares FTSE NAREIT Mortgage Plus Capped Index

204706,426222,AGNC,The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks For 2016,opinion,"Well  she finally did it  Janet Yellen finally hiked the targeted fed funds rate from 0  to a whopping 0 25   But she also made it abundantly clear that she had no plans to raise it aggressively from here  Although we have officially achieved liftoff  rates will still be very low for a long time to come 
So  if you re waiting for a 5  CD to help fund your retirement   let s just say I hope you re not holding your breath 
The bottom line is that income investors are going to need to look elsewhere in 2016   and probably for several years to come  And one solid option is in monthly dividend stocks 
The problem with traditional dividend stocks and bonds is that the cash flows are lumpy  Our expenses tend to be monthly  yet bond interest is generally paid twice per year and most dividends are paid quarterly 
But some of the very best dividend stocks are those that pay 12 times a year  While you should never buy a stock purely because of its payout schedule  there is quite a lot to like about monthly dividend stocks  When they commit to paying monthly  management is showing very ostentatiously that they are giving their shareholders what they want 
And for investors reinvesting their dividends  the monthly frequency means faster dividend compounding 
So with no further ado  let s just into my favorite monthly dividend stocks for 2016 
EPR Properties  EPR 
I ll start with a quirky stock that is something of a misfit in the REIT space  EPR Properties  N EPR  
The persistent wailing and gnashing of teeth throughout 2015 over the Fed s rate hike hit REITs particularly hard  and EPR was no exception  Between late January and September  the stock lost 25  of its value  though it has been steadily gaining ground ever since 
EPR has an odd mixture of properties and focuses mostly on entertainment assets  such as movie theaters  ski parks and gold driving ranges    EPR  is short for  Entertainment Properties    It also owns charter schools and child development centers  This makes it hard to compare EPR to peers  because frankly  it really doesn t have any 
Over the past five years  EPR has grown its dividend at a nearly 7  clip  For a conservative REIT  that s pretty good  and certainly better than the rate of inflation 
I don t see a quarter point Fed hike having much of an impact on EPR from here  Buy it for the monthly dividend and plan to hold on to it for a while 
Stag Industrial Inc  STAG 

Next up is Stag Industrial  N STAG   a relatively small REIT with a market cap of about  1 3 billion  This makes STAG too small for the big institutional investors to buy but still big enough to be properly diversified 

There is a major advantage to being a regular  individual investor  We can buy outstanding stocks like STAG without having to worry about moving the market 

 STAG  is an acronym for  single tenant acquisition group   and this sums up the growth strategy well  Stag buys standalone single tenant properties in the light industrial space   things like warehouses and manufacturing facilities   that generally don t need a lot maintenance 

STAG had a portfolio of 233 properties spread across 38 states  and the majority of its tenants are investment grade rated  Furthermore  STAG is very well diversified across its tenant base  Its largest tenant only accounts for 2 7  of its rental income  STAG s tenants are also well diversified across industry  The two largest industry concentrations   automotive and air freight   each account for only 12  of rents  That s a conservative profile  which is exactly what you want from one of your monthly dividend stocks 

STAG s monthly dividend yields a whopping 7 6   and STAG is a serial dividend raiser  STAG has only been trading since 2011  and it has already raised its dividend eight times 

Prospect Capital Corporation  PSEC 

Let s take a break from REITs and take a look at another segment of the market that has gotten crushed this year mostly due to Fed fears  business development companies 

BDCs as a sector have been trading at discounts to their net asset values for well over a year now  though the mispricing only seems to be getting worse  Prospect Capital  O PSEC   which I recommended as my Best Stock for 2015  trades at an almost incredible 35  discount to book value  In theory  you could buy up the entire company  sell it off for spare parts  and walk away with a nice 35  profit 

Could Prospect Capital be inflating its book value  Sure  BDCs have a fair amount of wiggle room in how they report the values on illiquid holdings  But even if book value were overstated by 5 to 10 percentage points   and I should be clear that I do not believe that to be the case   PSEC still is trading at a deep discount 

And there is the dividend  At current prices  PSEC s monthly dividend yields a fat 15  

Yields that high don t come without risk  Could it be that PSEC will be forced to slash its dividend if business takes a turn for the worse 

I suppose it s possible  Current cash flows cover the dividend  But with shares trading at such a deep discount  management has effectively lost the ability to raise new funds for growth via the capital market  In the worst case scenario  I suppose that Prospect and other BDCs could be forced to make the same ugly decision Kinder Morgan  N KMI  did when it opted to slash its payout 

But the way I look at it  given that the stock is trading at just 65  of book value  there s not a lot of risk in holding it at these prices  And it s not unrealistic to expect total returns of 100  or more over the next 12 to 24 months 

UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2X Mortgage REIT ETN  MORL 

The next recommendation is a mouthful  the UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2X Mortgage REIT ETN  N MORL  

MORL isn t exactly a stock  It s a leveraged exchange traded fund that tracks the performance of a basket of large mortgage REITs like Annaly Capital  N NLY  and American Capital Agengy  O AGNC   But because it s leveraged  you get two times the yield and two times the market moves of the underlying basket 

In 2015  that wasn t exactly a good thing  At one point in the year  MORL had lost nearly half its value in price terms  although the massive monthly dividend certainly eased the pain a little  

Normally  I would avoid a leveraged ETF  as I find that the returns are rarely worth the risk taken  But in MORL  the cheapness of the mortgage REIT sector leads me to make an exception  Annaly Capital trades for just 76  of book value  and American Capital Agency just 74   That s crazy pricing given that the underlying holdings are real mortgage securities  Much of the rest of the sector trades at similar crazy discounts to book value 

Do these discounts guarantee that prices can t go lower  Of course not  As John Maynard Keynes put it  the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent  But at these prices  our downside is definitely limited 

If MORL is simply too volatile for you to stomach  try an unleveraged mREIT ETF like the iShares Mortgage Real Estate ETF  N REM   It doesn t pay monthly like MORL  but it does sport a nice yield of nearly 15  

Cohen   Steers Limited Duration Preferred and Income Fund  LDP 

Next up  we have the Cohen   Steers Limited Duration Preferred and Income Fund  N LDP   LDP  like our mortgage REIT ETF  isn t a stock  It s actually a mutual fund that trades like a stock 

LDP is a closed end fund  and it s very different from what you might be used to with your typical mutual fund 

In a traditional open ended mutual fund  you send money directly to the manager  or your broker does  and they invest it on your behalf  When you want to get your money back  the manager sells off some of their holdings  if they don t have the cash on hand  and sends you the proceeds  Money is constantly going into and out of the fund  and new shares are constantly being created and destroyed 

Well  that s not how a closed end fund works  Instead  there are a fixed number of shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange  And that s where it gets fun  Closed end funds often trade at large premiums or deep discounts to their underlying portfolio values 

At current prices  LDP trades at an 11  discount to its book value and yields more than 8   Furthermore  the book value itself has been affected by Fed fears  As the yields of virtually all non Treasury debt have risen this year  so have the yields of the preferred stock in LDP s portfolio 

As the credit markets return to something closer to  normal  in 2016  I expect LDP to benefit from both an improvement in book value and a narrowing of its wide discount  And while we wait  we collect a fat dividend 

All told  not a bad haul 

LTC Properties Inc  LTC 

Let s jump back to REITs and add one more to our list of monthly dividend stocks  health and senior living REIT LTC Properties Inc  N LTC  
The ticker symbol really says it all   LTC  stands for  long term care   one of LTC s property specialties that makes the REIT a viable way to play the aging of the baby boomers  LTC is a stock you can safely buy and stick in a drawer forever  all while enjoying a steady stream of monthly dividends 

LTC s portfolio is concentrated in skilled nursing  assisted living  independent living and memory care properties  though roughly a fifth of the portfolio is invested in mortgages backed by these kinds of properties  This makes LTC something of a hybrid 

LTC currently sports a dividend yield of 5 2   For a stock with LTC s safety and consistency  that s an attractive cash return and more than double the 10 year Treasury yield 

Realty Income Corp  O 



And finally  no list of monthly dividend stocks is complete without the  Monthly Dividend Company  itself  Realty Income  N O  

I should be clear on something  Realty Income is not a bond  It is a stock with all of the risks that come with an investment in the stock market  But that said  Realty Income is about as close to a bond as you can get while still being in the stock market  O stock pays its monthly dividend with the reliability of a Swiss watch  and its cash flows are supported by a portfolio of essential  recession proof retail properties 

This stock has made 545 consecutive dividend payments  and I cannot see anything short of nuclear Armageddon breaking that streak 

But while I consider Realty Income as safe as a bond  its returns are competitive with a growth stock  Since going public more than 20 years ago  Realty Income has enjoyed compounded total returns of 16 6  per year  And it has also raised its dividend for 73 consecutive quarters 

I have shares of Realty Income that I keep in my IRA that I have pledged never to sell  My dividends are set to automatically reinvest  and I never look at the account  I intend to leave these shares to my kids someday  and if they re smart they ll do the same for their own children 

I can t say this about too many companies  but I expect Realty Income to still be paying its monthly dividend long after I m dead and in the ground

204711,426227,AGNC,Mortgage REITs  Leverage Poses Significant Risk To Mortgage Market,opinion,With the GSEs  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  forced to shrink their balance sheets  see discussion   the private sector will need to step in  As demand for mortgages increases with the growth of the US population     the federal government will simply lack the political will to allow the GSEs to accommodate this new demand   particularly after the spectacular taxpayer bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008 and numerous capital injections by the US Treasury since then  But the private sector mortgage providers will not always be banks  With capital requirements increasing under Basel III and other regulatory pressures  the banking sector growth may also be limited    More than half of the top 25 U S  banks aren t earning enough to cover their cost of capital  leading to stock prices that are  significantly lagging previous global recoveries   according to the note   The vast majority of the reduction relative to pre crisis levels is attributable to structural issues like deleveraging and regulatory reform   One development in this space that some say may be poised to meet the rising mortgage demand has been the explosion  52  increase between 2010 and 2011  of Mortgage REITs  mREITs   They are publicly listed trusts that operate similarly to their cousins in commercial real estate but focus on residential mortgage securities or sometimes pools of mortgages  These include companies such as American Capital Agency  AGNC   Hatteras Financial  HTS   and Annaly Capital  NLY   Anyone looking at these firms will notice that they have outperformed most asset classes over the past year  And a large portion of that outperofrmance has been from high dividends  The Bloomberg mREIT index shows 27  total return from a year ago  with less than half of that coming from price appreciation  mREITs have been rapidly coming to market with IPOs and secondary offerings this year  A number of these  such as Putnam Mortgage Opportunities  American Capital Mortgage Investments  Pimco REIT  Apollo Residential Mortgage  etc   have been sponsored by some of the largest US asset managers  In a trend that is quite similar to other fixed income asset classes  see this discussion   a great deal of the new capital for these products is coming from ETFs  With the popularity of mREITs  REIT ETFs growth has also exploded  Take for example Market Vectors Mortgage REIT Income ETF  MORT   The chart below shows MORT s shares outstanding growth since the ETF s launch  The performance of this ETF has been tremendous  explaining some of the demand growth So how is it that a mortgage product can generate some 30  return in a year when the universe of mortgages securities generated roughly 3 4  over the same period  The answer as always is leverage  Mortgage REITs are able to pay high dividends because of the tremendous leverage they maintain  What s more  they tend to finance long term mortgage securities with short term repo  Typically they borrow from banks for 60 90 days and just roll their loans  Banks don t have to use much capital for securitized short term loans  so they generally extend credit lines to REITs with no trouble  The repo lines to mortgage REITs have grown as quickly as the assets  The financial crisis of 2008 had little impact on the growth  which has been close to exponential The asset liability mismatch has been the most troubling aspect of this business  Both Bear Stearns and Lehman were brought down due to their inability to roll short term repo in a similar setup  not due to derivatives as is commonly believed   The advantage that mREITs have is that they tend obtain term repo lines rather than the overnight financing that investment banks ran prior to the crisis  That means if their lines are pulled  REITs have 2 3 months to sell their securities  And the average term of financing has actually increased recently   which should help with stability The danger of course is that the Fed maintaining extraordinarily low rates for a long time will generate tremendous demand growth for such leveraged product  as assets continue to increase exponentially  Everyone will get comfortable with mREITS  always  making money  Then interest rates will begin to rise and the 30  returns will quickly turn into  30   or worse  as leverage works both ways  At the same time banks will get concerned about their massive exposure to REITS via repo lines and will inevitably require more collateral for the same amount of repo loans or shrink pull the credit lines altogether  This deleveraging could result in a disastrous scenario of forced selling and rising mortgage rates   and as in 2008 falling mortgage securities prices will precipitate more forced selling  It is great to see the private sector step in for the GSEs to meet some of the excess mortgage demand  But unlike banks who are limited in their ability to grow leverage  although it is quite high  and have access to deposits and the Fed for funding  the deleveraging of these  shadow banking  entities could pose a significant risk to the US mortgage markets  and potentially the economy as a whole  should interest rates begin to rise ,2012-09-12,Sober
