7455,228970,CSGS,Bet On These 5 Value Tech Stocks In 2019 ,opinion,Tech stocks had started 2018 on a strong note with the Technology Select Sector SPDR  XLK  gaining a whopping 17  by the end of August  However  the tide turned for tech post that  resulting in a grievous rout for the sector  Notable casualties of this phenomenon are long term investor favorites  the FAANG stocks which tasted both the highs and the lows that year Sky high valuations may have triggered the rout in the first place  but other macroeconomic factors were also at play  These include a weakening growth environment and stronger rate environment However  as routs go  this is not as severe as others that have taken place in market history  Further  tech companies are financially far stronger than what they were during the last major market reverse for stocks  the dotcom bubble  This is why the current debacle is a good chance to buy into the sector and add select value picks to your portfolios Valuations  Regulation   Broader Concerns Rattle SectorIn the last quarter of 2018  the XLK lost more than 17 7  owing to several factors  First  valuation fears struck home with investors finding even healthy earnings inadequate to justify surging share prices  This is because a number of headwinds were hitting industry majors at the time By November  rumors were rife that Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   was cutting iPhone production  These reports actually came true with Apple slashing its holiday sales projections  Also  Facebook   NASDAQ FB   paid a price for its questionable privacy standards Investors were also concerned about tech majors facing stiffer regulatory standards  Meanwhile  semiconductor makers like NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   and Applied Materials   NASDAQ AMAT   were facing woes of their own with trade tensions leading to fears of lower demand Additionally  the sector had to face broader concerns which were weighing on markets at large  An economic slowdown and a stiffer rate environment also contributed to their downfall  since their heady ascent meant their descent would be rocky at best 2019  A Buying Opportunity But as tech routs go  the recent reverse is far less than severe than other historical reverses  Currently  almost half of the tech stocks in the Nasdaq 100 are languishing in a bear market  Still  it helps to keep in mind that the dotcom bubble was such a disaster that it took years for the Nasdaq 100 to move above its 2000 high  Several dotcom era favorites like Pets com vanished altogether And tech majors are in a much stronger financial position compared to the 2000s  Apple is holding  237 1 billion in cash at the moment  In the third quarter  Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   posted record net income of  2 9 billion  And Facebook s third quarter earnings blew past expectations Such strong financial performances are likely to protect tech stocks from a tougher rate environment  Another factor working in their favor even in difficult conditions is the  moats  or barriers to entry which they have created over time  This allows them to sustain their competitive advantage Our ChoicesTech stocks have survived a bad year  and more importantly a terrible quarter  But their financial condition looks solid overall  Several of them have also been able to create distinctive barriers to entry which are likely to serve them well in difficult times Adding select value stocks from the sector to your portfolios looks like a good option at this time  Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Value Score and Zacks Rank We narrowed down our choices with the help of our new  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best opportunities in the value
