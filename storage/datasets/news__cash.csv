28570,250085,CASH,5 Top Efficient Stocks To Buy For Striking Returns,opinion,Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions  After all  efficiency is a potential indicator of a company s financial health  Moreover  a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks  These efficiency ratios are Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a four quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales  which resulted in excess inventory  Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four quarter average of total assets  Like the above ratios  high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient Operating Margin  This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 21 Here are five stocks from the 21 that made it through the screen Copart  Inc    NASDAQ CPRT   provides online auctions and vehicle remarketing services  The company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 10

28571,250086,CASH,Should Value Investors Consider Meta Financial  CASH  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Meta Financial Group  Inc    NASDAQ CASH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Meta Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 08  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 58  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Meta Financial s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 07  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Meta Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 00  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Meta Financial stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Meta Financial has a P S ratio of about 2 37  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  CASH is near the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Meta Financial currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Meta Financial a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too     For example  the P CF ratio for Meta Financial came in at 8 65  which is a far lower than the industry average of 11 91  Clearly  CASH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles    What About the Stock Overall  Though Meta Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of C  This gives CASH a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction  while the current year estimate has seen two upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period This has had a notable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 15 3  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has risen by 7 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Meta Financial Group  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line Meta Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 36  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence   However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Financial   Savings and Loan industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just

28731,250246,CASH,5 Solid Stocks With Impressive Net Profit Margin,opinion,Investors flock to a business that reports profits on a regular basis  And to gauge the extent of profit  there is no better metric than the net profit margin Net Profit Margin   Net profit  Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company s operations and cost control measures Higher net profit is indispensable for rewarding stakeholders  Net margin helps investors judge the risks of investing in a company  Creditors also view it as a major factor in determining a company s ability to pay off debts Moreover  a higher net profit margin as compared to peers lends a competitive edge  Also  strength in the metric not only attracts new investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison an uphill task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt  instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on the net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective to analyze a company s performance The Winning StrategyA healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought after elements in a business model Apart from these  we have added a few other criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy Screening ParametersNet

company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance  Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks  These efficiency ratios are Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a four quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales  which resulted in excess inventory  Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four quarter average of total assets  Like the above ratios  high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient Operating Margin  This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable  You can see  Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 17 Here are four stocks from the 17 that made it through the screen NVR  Inc    NYSE NVR   is engaged in the construction and sale of single family detached homes  townhomes and condominium buildings  The company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 17 2  MAM Software Group Inc    NASDAQ MAMS   is a

28750,250265,CASH,Wells Fargo  WFC  Troubles Deepen On Fake Account Scam ,opinion,"Troubles have been intensifying at Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   following its  to resolve regulators  claims of illegally opening millions of unauthorized accounts   On Friday  three customers in Utah filed a lawsuit against the banking giant for fraud  breach of contract and invasion of privacy The lawsuit  the first one that emerged tied with the scandal  was filed in the U S  District Court in Utah  and seeks class action status on behalf of thousands of customers According to the complaint  the  abusive and fraudulent tactics  undertaken by the bank s employees in order to meet sales targets has hurt customers  The plaintiffs noted   Those failing to meet daily sales quotas are approached by management  and often reprimanded and or told to  do whatever it takes  to meet their individual sales quotas  The plaintiffs alleged that the bank has invaded customers  privacy and failed to protect their confidential information  The plaintiffs further claimed that though the bank executives were well aware of employees misusing the system  they failed to take proper action  In fact  several executives were awarded promotion for shoring up the bank s figures  The plaintiffs referred Wells Fargo s firing of around 5 300 employees as  cosmetic  with the bank s intention to offer  plausible deniability  Notably  The U S  Department of Justice has also launched an investigation that may result in civil or criminal charges Further Probe
In further fallout from the fake account scam  the U S  House Financial Services Committee  announced earlier on Friday  that it has commenced an investigation into the bank  As part of the probe  the committee intends to call John Stumpf   Chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo   to testify at a hearing later this month Chairman of the committee   Jeb Hensarling   in a letter to James M  Strother  Senior Executive Vice President  General Counsel at Wells Fargo  stated  The Committee is very concerned by these serious allegations and is investigating Wells Fargo s questionable sales practices and corresponding agreements with federal regulators in order to evaluate the application  administration  execution  and effectiveness of Federal laws  Apart from seeking all records related to the timing and detection of the unauthorized customer accounts  the committee will also ask several corporate officers to appear for interviews  Additionally  the committee may mull over further actions  including subpoenas Bottom Line
The monetary fine by the regulators  including Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  CFPB   will have no material impact on Wells Fargo s financials  However  the company continues to come under fire from several quarters  which undoubtedly tarnishes the reputation of one of the largest banks in the nation Last week  Democratic senators   including Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown   wrote a letter to the U S  Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby  calling for an investigation of the matter and asking Wells Fargo CEO  John Stumpf  to testify 
Further   the bank s scam drew attention of rating agency Moody s Investors Service which noted    T he regulators  revelations are highly disturbing  they highlight that Wells Fargo s vaunted cross selling capabilities were inflated  its incentive structure had led to pervasive inappropriate practices  and its retail banking sales process lacked adequate and effective oversight  As such  the implications of this announcement are credit negative  Wells Fargo  known for setting aggressive sales goals for its employees  announced last Wednesday that it will remove all product sales goals in retail banking  effective Jan 1  2017 Notably  since the announcement of the settlement  shares of Wells Fargo lost nearly 9   Year to date  the company fell more than 16

28895,250410,CASH,Best Use Of Corporate Profit  Cash   Case Studies ,opinion,IntroductionI recently authored two articles showing that  all other things being equal  a stock that pays its shareholders a dividend generates a higher total return than a stock with similar growth characteristics that doesn t  This is based on the reality that stock prices follow earnings in the long run  and it is this relationship that generates the capital gain component of total return  Therefore  if there is a dividend it will provide the shareholder the additional return from the income component  dividends   Links to the articles can be found here and here Both of these articles generated a rather lively comment stream  However  very few of the comments actually discussed the concept of the dividend providing additional return  Instead  the comments denigrated into exhaustive discussions about whether or not a company would grow faster or not by not paying a dividend  In other words  the discussions did not talk about the return augmentation the dividend provided  rather  the debate focused on whether companies should pay dividends or not  This led then to discussions about reinvesting into the business  and share buybacks  et cetera  These are entirely different subject matters which inspired me to write this article Consequently  the focal point of this article is to discuss  and try to answer the very important questions  regarding what is the best use of corporate profits  Should a company retain their profits and reinvest in itself  should a company buy back their stock  should they use it to fund acquisitions  reduce their debt or pay dividends  These are all important questions  and the comment threads on my previous articles suggest that many investors have very strong feelings about these matters  Fortunately  I have the absolute perfect answer to these questions  Drum roll  please     the simple answer to all these questions can be stated in two words it depends The point is that all of these uses of corporate cash flow can be the best use under the appropriate circumstances  On the other hand  all of these capital deployments can also be the absolute worst utilization of corporate cash flows  And the correct answer can be different for virtually every company out there  and the correct answer for any specific company can be different today than it is tomorrow  Accordingly  the reader should understand that there is an almost infinite array of circumstances and situations that would dictate a different answer for each situation  Consequently  this article will only present some general guidelines and concepts about when each of these capital deployments makes sense  and when they don t The Capital Deployment Pecking OrderAn article in the Wall Street Journal on February 27  2012 by Maxwell Murphy titled The Pros and Cons of Stock Buybacks interviewed two prominent Wall Street personalities with strong views on the subject of buybacks  They were Whitney R  Tilson  founder and managing partner of T2 Partners LLC  and Gregory V  Milano  cofounder and chief executive of Fortuna Advisers LLC  Here is a link for anyone interested in reading the whole article  The reason I share this article is because Mr  Milano described a concept that he referred to as a capital deployment  pecking order theory  as follows  Many believe capital deployment should follow a  pecking order theory  that prescribes that managements should apply their cash flow  in order of priority  to fix their balance sheet if overleveraged  fund organic investments  pay dividends  fund acquisitive growth and  only when there is additional cash left over  to distribute it via share repurchases  While this may seem theoretically sensible  in practice it leads to buying back more shares when the market value has increased significantly in response to stronger cash flows  I believe this quote perfectly addresses many of the issues  and opinions of those who believe that dividends actually represent a drag on the company s potential to grow  Notice that dividends came in third place after deleveraging the balance sheet and investing in organic growth  With this article  I will provide a brief introduction on each of the cash flow deployment options based on the pecking order theory introduced above Fix The Balance Sheet  Reduce Debt The old adage that you can t go bankrupt if you don t have any debt equally applies to corporations as it does for individuals  On the other hand  applying the appropriate amount of leverage can also be a beneficial way for corporations to increase their returns  The level of interest rates is also a big factor  the lower the rates are the more attractive it is for corporations to borrow  This includes issuing bonds and notes and or establishing credit lines  etc  But perhaps most importantly  the company s cash flow generating abilities and levels capable of amortizing debt is a critical consideration Furthermore  a corporation can have a good reason for taking on debt  such as to fund a strategic acquisition  more on that later   However  depending on the individual company  it s important to never let your debt reach a level that becomes unmanageable  Consequently  using corporate cash flows to reduce debt is more often than not a good use of corporate cash  On the other hand  this doesn t mean that the corporation must use all of their cash flow to pay down their debt  In fact  it is not uncommon to find companies that deploy their cash flows across all of the  pecking order  options The following F A S T  Graphs   fundamentals analyzer software tool  will look at two companies where one might want to deleverage and the other doesn t need to  The first graph looks at Clorox   Co   CLX   where a case is easily made suggesting that Clorox   Co  is in need of deleveraging their balance sheet as debt represents 101  of capital  However  a review of the company s financials shows that lately they have been reducing long term debt  Furthermore  the company generates strong operating cash flows and has increased their dividend for 35 consecutive years In contrast to Clorox   Co   Accenture PLC  ACN  is currently paying a generous dividend  and has the luxury of no long term debt  Obviously  this company has no reason to consider the deleveraging option Fund Organic Investments  Reinvest In The Business Very fast growing companies are typically very capital hungry  In other words  they need to use the vast majority of their earnings and cash flows to fund their rapid growth  Consequently  it is very common to see high growth companies not pay a dividend  Therefore  funding organic growth is arguably the best use of their earnings and cash  This is especially true if the company s capacity to produce its goods or services is lower than the potential future demand for their products or services  Logically  companies in this situation need to increase their capacity in order to meet future demand and exploit their full profit potential On the other hand  if a profitable corporation  perhaps one that operates in a small niche  has excess capacity that exceeds the demand for their products or services  it would make no sense for them to continue to invest to create greater capacity  Companies in this situation might be best served to return profits to shareholders via either dividends or share buybacks  both will be covered later  The moral of the story is that the company should only continue to invest in its own business when it makes sense for them to do it  Management needs to be certain that any reinvestment they make will provide returns that at least match what they are currently earning  or even better  exceed it  The point is that some companies have a very strong need for reinvestment  while other companies can continue to generate profitable growth without reinvestment A fast growing  but still relatively small restaurant chain like Buffalo Wild Wings Inc   BWLD  represents a good example of a fast growing company that needs to retain and reinvest all of their earnings and cash flows in order to fund future growth  Consequently  it makes sense that this rapidly growing company does not pay a current dividend Raven Industries Inc   RAVN  on the other hand  is a rapidly growing company that operates in niche industries  The company generates very high revenues per share  which provides them ample cash flows to fund future growth while simultaneously leaving ample cash available to pay regular and special dividends to their shareholders  The following earnings and price F A S T  Graphs  on Raven Industries shows the numerous special dividends the company has been able to return to shareholders The following three slides from Raven s annual shareholders meeting in May 2012 illustrate their strong revenue generation  and their modest capital investment needs required to continue funding their rapid growth  Consequently  it would seem risky and maybe even foolish for them to invest their earnings beyond their current capital needs The following excerpt from Raven s third quarter fiscal 2013 results summarizes their ability to fund growth while simultaneously continuing to reward shareholders with a generous dividend from such a fast growing company Attractive Cash Position Despite Increased InvestmentsAt October 31  2012  cash and investment balances were  48 1 million  up from  44 2 million a year ago  Increases in capital expenditures and the  12 million payment to acquire Vista Research  Inc   in the fourth quarter last year were offset by cash flows from operations  The company paid  3 8 million in dividends to shareholders   0 105 per share  during the quarter  Accounts receivable increased to  55 5 million compared with  50 7 million at October 31  2011  Inventories were  50 0 million  up from  49 9 million one year earlier  Average accounts receivable days outstanding increased year over year while inventory turns declined slightly  Nine month operating cash flows increased to  58 0 million from  37 7 million in the prior year  Pay DividendsAt the most basic level  if a company does not need all of its earnings and cash flow to fund their ability to grow  it is only prudent that they reward their shareholders with a cash dividend payment  Said another way  if the company s Board and management determine that their business is growing as fast as it can  given the dynamics of their market and size  etc   and therefore  they have excess cash available  it s only logical for them to pay a dividend to shareholders  Otherwise  they could inadvertently reduce their Return On Equity  ROE  and or Return On Assets  ROA   thereby actually slowing their growth rate down To put this into another perspective  it is very common that mature  very large blue chip companies find that their growth rates are maxed out as they hit the barrier known as the law of large numbers  Consequently  companies in this situation find that their growth rates will tend to mirror the mean growth of the whole universe  When this occurs  their ability to sustain an above average rate of growth hits a wall  Consequently  in order to attract and maintain shareholders  interests  it is very common for them to establish a generous dividend policy with their excess cash  By doing this  they can provide their shareholders a return that is greater than their earnings growth rate  see the links to our previous articles in the introductory paragraph  The point is that when a company pays a dividend  that action allows it to compete more effectively against faster growing companies that pay no dividends  There are many investors  especially those in retirement or close to it  that are looking for income producing investments to either fully fund or augment their income  Dividend growth stocks with a long legacy of increasing their dividends each year provide a very attractive option for the income seeking investor  Today  not only are dividends competitive  and in many cases superior to fixed income yields  the fact that they provide the shareholder a raise each year sweetens the pot even more  David Fish provides a terrific resource for dividend growth investors with his CCC lists of dividend Champions  Challengers and Contenders which can be found here There are a lot of arguments against dividends based on taxation  and other issues  that suggest the notion that the company would be better served not to pay them  However  one practical point that these arguments often ignore is the idea of the return of capital  If you invest in a dividend paying stock  each time you receive a dividend  you are in practical terms  receiving a return of your original capital investment  Not a return on  but a return of your original capital  Although technically this doesn t reduce your cost basis for tax purposes  etc   it does reduce the true amount of capital you now have at risk  A good dividend growth stock can return a third to half or more of your original investment in cash dividends in a decade s time The following performance report on McDonald s  MCD  since December 31  2002 shows that in addition to growing shareholder assets over five fold  it paid out over 96  of shareholder s original one thousand dollar investment in cash  Consequently  a buy and hold investor that bought and held McDonald s over that time would now have the majority of their original investment paid back in cash  Admittedly an extreme example  but it tells the story of a true benefit from receiving cash dividends  Fund AcquisitionsMaking acquisitions can be a terrific source of corporate cash  or an unmitigated disaster  Therefore  whether or not acquisitions make any sense depends on the situation and the company making the acquisition  The following earnings and price correlated graph and performance table on Danaher Corp   DHR  represents an example of a very successful serial acquirer  This company has grown by acquisition  and has what I believe one of the most competent management teams capable of integrating new businesses under what they call the Danaher Business System  DBS   The following summary taken directly from their website summarizes their skill sets nicely Danaher s long term record of growth and shareholder performance validates their corporate strategy and culture  Note that although they do pay a dividend  it is extremely modest In contrast  a quick review of Hewlett Packard s  HPQ  recent history of acquisitions tells an entirely different story  Not only have many of their recent acquisitions hurt the company s earnings growth  they have generated devastating consequences on the stock price  Although the jury is still out on others  acquisitions such as the disastrous Autonomy transaction in 2011  has been very costly This first graphic reviews the long term results of Hewlett Packard s biggest acquisitions  Note the effect that they had on earnings per share  the orange line on the graph  The second graphic looks at Hewlett Packard s most recent acquisitions  to include the disastrous Autonomy transaction which led to an  11 billion write off so far  Therefore  while acquisitions have been very kind to Danaher Corp s shareholders  the same cannot be said for the shareholders of Hewlett Packard Corp Share BuybacksShare repurchase or buyback programs are the final option in the pecking order of how a company can use its cash  and is often very controversial  However  I believe there is really no need for controversy here  Share repurchases can be analyzed very simply  if you have the right tools  However  it should also be pointed out that management often has an overly optimistic view of their company s intrinsic value  So simply stated  buybacks can be good for shareholders when share prices are low  Conversely  buybacks can be very bad when prices are high To my way of thinking  determining whether a company should buy back their shares or not is no different than me deciding whether I should invest in their shares  If the company s share price is low enough and its earnings growth potential high enough that it represents a high future investment return with low valuation risk  then buying back shares may make a lot of sense for management  just as investing in the shares make sense to me  This is especially true if the company does not have any more attractive options imminently available to them For example  Intel Corp   INTC  recently announced that they are selling notes in order to finance a large share buyback program  As a shareholder  I believe this makes a great deal of business sense considering how undervalued I believe Intel shares are  Intel generates very high levels of operating cash and free cash flow  which we define as Net Cash Flow minus Cash Dividends minus Capital Expenditures  The following graphic reveals Intel s cash flow prowess The earnings and price correlated graph on Intel with dividends makes a strong case that the shares are not only historically undervalued  but also undervalued based on intrinsic valuation  Consequently  I believe that Intel s desire to buy back a large amount of their shares is a very prudent use of shareholder capital currently I believe that Intel s intrinsic value is  30  35 per share  therefore  the following report on their recent buyback activity which shows an average purchase price of approximately  20 per share seems like a very attractive use of capital In contrast to the attractiveness of Intel share buybacks  I think the current aggressive share buyback program of Costco Wholesale Corp   COST  is an imprudent use of their corporate cash  I believe their shares are significantly overvalued  fair value  67  current price  98  in the marketplace today  and therefore  if I were a shareholder I would not be comfortable with this utilization of their cash  Instead  I would much prefer a more generous dividend Summary And ConclusionsCorporations have numerous options and uses for the profits they generate  However  there is no right option that applies in all situations  The decision of what a corporation should do with its excess earnings and cash flows depends on the company s management and board carefully assessing all of the options before them  Sometimes the best use is to invest all of its excess cash directly in itself  other times it might make more sense to pay dividends or buy back shares  Strategic acquisitions can also be a good use of corporate earnings and cash  However  none of these options apply at all times and in all cases On the other hand  very large multinational blue chip companies facing average long term prospects for growth often find that paying a dividend is a very attractive and important option with which to reward shareholders by  Many investors prefer investing in dividend paying stocks and eschew investing in a company that doesn t pay one  Moreover  these income seeking investors tend to be long term shareholders that trade infrequently  Perhaps this explains why many of the blue chip dividend paying stocks has a very low beta  Lower volatility would seem to be the trait of a company that has a very low turnover of its shares  Corporate management and boards would certainly favor less volatility with their shares Therefore  at the end of the day investors must rely on the integrity and skills of the management teams running their respective companies to make the proper decisions regarding capital allocation  Furthermore  in many  if not the large majority of cases  the correct capital allocation decisions will often be a blend of the many options available  In other words  many companies will pay a dividend  buy back shares  commit to capital expenditures  CAPEX   pay down debt  and even make acquisitions all at the same time  And at other times  the same companies may only engage in a few of these capital allocation options at any given point in time  The decisions should always be based on management s judgment of what the best use of their capital for the benefit of their shareholders would be Disclosure  Long CLX  MCD  HPQ and INTC at the time of writing Disclaimer  The opinions in this document

28899,250414,CASH,The Manchurian Chairman  Bernanke Revealing His True Identity ,opinion,If you thought that Ben Bernanke has been brainwashed by secret handlers intent on destroying capitalism in the United States  and this week lit the fuse for the economic bomb he buried deep in the financial markets way back in 2009  you might be correct to call him the Manchurian candidate  Bernanke revealed his true identity as the secret slayer of markets in his remarks at the conclusion of FOMC meetings on Wednesday  Although the Fed left rates unchanged and QE intact  the Chairman stated that the Fed could cut back the pace of its QE bond buying as early as the end of this year  and be out of the bond buying business by the middle of next year  Major Ben Marco barely blinked while he made these pronouncements  almost as if he were in a trance sparked by some hidden hypnotic cue   The markets responded as if they had been hit by sniper s round  Gold dropped nearly  100 oz  and the Dow fell nearly 600 points in two sessions following the Fed chairman s remarks  And bonds sold off sharply  backing up the 10 Year yield to the 2 7 handle  a two year high    In the know  Fed reporters such as Jon Hilsenrath and Robin Harding wrote up a storm about the Fed taper  without much accuracy  yet the markets responded   The pundits were not the only ones focused on the potential shift in Fed policy  FOMC members have spoken out as well  In an unconventional rash of public statements  both opponent and proponents of the  taper  have taken to the airwaves  It appears the Chairman is having difficulty keeping all the dogs mushing straight in the traces   Fed policy has not changed  The Fed continues to buy  85 Billion each month  and the interest rate target remains at 0 00  0 25   So why did the markets sell off   Markets  particularly the equity markets  are forward looking  Prices reflect future earnings  inflation and other factors  Studies show Dow prices look ahead six months or so  If the Fed does taper on Bernanke s schedule  then the Dow is telling us removing the Fed subsidy will deflate that stock index 10 15   Likewise  Treasury yields will climb to the 4 5  level   Big Ben s remarks turned the QE tailwinds into headwinds for gold  Investors hit the sell button to raise cash  Gold is now finding support at the 1200 level  Gold bugs know a bargain when they see one  Because the price of gold is reflects much more than supply and demand  gold is telling us that the ill effects of central bank quantitative easing will come home to roost  The Fed exit is good news for investors  That s because when the Fed quits intervening in the credit markets interest rates will normalize  the yield curve will steepen  and traditional risk  return premiums will return to all assets in the marketplace  Stocks prices will be driven once again by fundamentals  instead of floating up on Fed hot air  Bond yields may actually turn positive  restoring the risk fee return at the natural interest rate  Stocks will relinquish their Fed induced role as substitutes for fixed income yield   It will be a welcome day when the Fed gets the heck out of the business of  managing the economy   Historians and economists will study Fed policy leading up to and throughout the Great Recession  It s highly likely that the consensus will be that the ultra easy monetary policy did little to halt the decline and less to stimulate the  recovery   In fact  Fed policy actually hindered the recovery by preventing the flow of capital out of malinvestments into productive segments of the economy  Progressive fiscal policy also contributed to economic failure   That s because continued large annual Federal deficits have created a massive national debt burden  which this year eclipsed the national output at  16 6 Trillion   It s spending  stupid   that Standard and Poor s cited when it cut the credit rating of the United States  It s still the spending  stupid  The current regime has abdicated its responsibility to balance the federal budget  And it politicized its own budget sequestration plan  railing against it as if it were evil  The fact is sequestration is working  and more cuts the bloated federal budget are needed  Every Dollar the federal government does not collect in taxes or borrows from China helps the private sector to expand and flourish  That concept is lost on the Keynesians in power today   Just before Ben Bernanke addressed the press at the conclusion of the June FOMC meeting  the president told Charlie Rose the Fed chairman  has stayed longer than he was supposed to   Now there s a glowing exit interview assessment of the Fed Chief s tenure  Poor Ben s legacy will not be as burnished as he would have liked  But the fact remains  Bernanke s monetary policy has failed to speed the US recovery  So long  Ben   The bench of potential Fed Chief replacements is not very deep  What s worse  all of the likely candidates are dyed in the wool Keynesians  Where is Art Laffer when you need him   How will the markets behave with the new Fed policy in mind going forward  Well  the markets will stabilize without the Fed put in place  Stocks prices will climb  the bond market will correct  and then recover to healthy levels  Commodity prices will climb  All because the Fed has taken its thumb off the scale   But that happy day is not coming anytime soon  Unless he resigns  Ben Bernanke will remain at the helm until January  And unless there is a sudden change at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  the fiscal policy of tax  borrow  regulate and spend  spend  spend will continue until 2014 or 2016   If he keeps to his word  Big Ben will keep buying bonds until unemployment drops to 6 5   But current unemployment is 13 8   U 6 measure   and at the current rate of hiring the US won t reach 6 5  until 2035  Inflation  according to the Fed central tendencies model is registering 2 0  inflation  So Ben has a lot of room for more QE before inflation becomes a problem  But the BEA understates inflation  which if calculated in the traditional manner  is hovering at the 7  level  GDP growth slowed 0 1  to an anemic 2 4  in May  What we have here is stagflation  And there is little on the horizon that will bring the positive change we need   So  the Fed will keep buying lots of bonds  And the administration will continue to tax and borrow to overspend on its big government programs  The combination of continued deficit spending and ultra easy monetary policy will continue to weaken the Dollar  Inflation will emerge as a leading drag on the economy   The objective of the Fed s bond buying program  known as Quantitative Easing  is to stimulate economic activity by adding liquidity  cash  to the banking system  Helicopter Ben has believed from the beginning bankers would lend out the free cash he continues to provide  His belief can be traced back to Keynesian theory  But we know that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon  At this point in time  all the new money the Fed has created out of thin air should have pushed general prices well above the 2 0  inflation rate  What s going on  The reason inflation is so low  even after flooding the banks with  3 Trillion in new cash  is the banks are hording the stuff  Rather than lending out to new homeowners and businesses  Fed member banks are sitting on over  1 8 Trillion in  excess reserves   A major reason is the Fed Chairman is paying the bankers interest on the funds they hold  The major banks can reap risk free profits without the risk of lending to new homeowners or businesses facing uncertain demand  It s as if the Fed Chairman suffers from multiple personality disorder or is actually under hypnotic control of some hidden handler We can see from data compiled by the St Louis Fed  major banks are hording over  1 8 Trillion in excess reserves  If the Chairman stopped paying interest on these idle funds  the banks would this capital to work One way to track economic activity is by measuring the rate at which money changes hands  Economists call this the velocity of money  which is measured by M2  This metric should be much higher than numbers show  mainly because the banks are hording cash  But eventually  the banks will lend in earnest again to make money on the spread between higher long term interest rates and lower short term rates  Banks will make money the old fashioned way  taking advantage of the normal  steeper upward sloping yield curve  Even Ben Bernanke cannot hold natural interest rates from rising  Ask Bill Gross  who is losing billions by sitting firmly on the wrong side on the bond trade  This week  10 year Treasury yields backed up over 2 7   Investors are bailing out of Treasurys  in the start of the Great Rotation When bond yields normalize  Ben Bernanke s adventure in credit intervention will be over  Inflation will accelerate high powered money floods out of the banks and into the broad economy  Dollar denominated commodity prices will shoot higher  As a result  general prices will rise while real wages decline  leading to economic contraction  These are the conditions for a classic death spiral  We have seen this dynamic play out in history  This was the case in the 1970 s under Carter  It took a free market president to turn that recession around  Reagan cut tax rates for individuals and corporations and cut the federal red tape that hindered small business growth  Reagan created 21 million jobs in the second longest economic expansion in US history  Bill Clinton cut taxes too  which helped create private sector jobs  while adding hundreds of billions to federal revenues The country needs Reagan like policies  and a Reagan like president  to stage the type of robust recovery that will restore the nation to the light of the world  the  shining city on the hill   Until that time comes  citizens should protect their wealth and

28999,250514,CASH,A Wild Week In Review,opinion,It was a wild week for the market and a grueling one for me  Let us start by reviewing from the last post  Readers know that I am leaning bearish  As a bear  when I see that everyone around is agreeing with me  it scares the day light out of me  If everyone agrees and everyone is right  it would be so easy to make money in stock market  Alas  it is never that easy    Today I closed my short position because I would not be able to monitor it regularly  may be a little too early and left some profits on the table  but hey  no regrets  The big game is still on and I will be there  For now I think a bounce is brewing  which will kill few bears and trap few more bulls   However  for now when everyone has jumped on to the bear side  I would like to step back and wait for a while  I do not trust these bots and dark pools  Moreover  FX has not dropped along with Apple  Euro is still above 1 2062 and AUD has not broken 1 02 yet  They will break down very soon  but for now  the slide has halted  Short term  the indexes are over sold  This week 173 firms representing 37  of S P will have their ER  So caution is warranted  Now you be the judge How do I read this market  I am just amazed that they are able to manipulate the market so easily  As if just by mere wishing  And there are suckers every time ECB or The Fed or their pets mention QE or some sort of bond buying program  Or just simply says   believe me   We definitely are walking on quick sand and people still fall for the same BS over and over again How do I invest or trade in this market  I do not invest in this market and have been largely in cash for well over two months now  I kept writing that preservation of capital is most important in this environment  I believe that the fundamentals do not justify the stock market going up and requires at least a 20  correction before we can see value again  The sovereigns are struggling and on the verge of bankruptcy or default  The Powers That Be are out of tools and are applying band aid after band aid and are praying each day that passes  The markets are behaving like a terminally ill patient in ICU  who is given blood transfusion and steroids just to keep it alive  When given the shot  it stirs and sits up but the effects of these transfusions are getting shorter and the patient falls back in coma shortly thereafter  At some point  the patient will die Understanding that fundamental concept and knowing that manipulators with the active backing of a corrupt governmental system are playing havoc  will help us remain safe  But there are still people out there   I know  I get comments and emails   who have faith in the system  who thinks that the market is bigger than the ability of the TBTF banks to manipulate and those who think technical analysis alone will help them make money in this quagmire  Even God cannot save you  guys You may ask  very well  now that we know that it is doomed  why are we not short with everything or as Prechter says  short will leverage  Let me explain that with an analogy  Its rainy season and rain is expected  The weather man said at night that tomorrow there will be sun shine  You get up in the morning and see that it is not raining but the sky is over cast  What do you do  I would still take an umbrella while going out but not open it  The situation is somewhat similar here  The dark clouds are hovering over us  The weathermen   B and D  are telling us that it is not going to rain and everything will be fine  So we remain prepared for the worst but do not open the umbrella either  I have said repeatedly in the past  never under estimate the power of these crooks  They can and will distort the market in the short term  TA is powerless in the face of these master puppeteers  But I take my cue to get out of any short position from TA  Please don t ask for any particular indicator because there is none  It is a combination of many indicators and judgment call  At the end of the day  we make the call and hope to be lucky  When I got out of the short position on 24th July  I was thinking maybe I got out too quickly  But I was sure of the coming squeeze and I sent out many tweets to that effect So what s next  I think the risk remains to the downside  Against everything negative  low revenue growth  earnings call misses  global slowdown  looming sovereign default of Eurozone countries and massive   unsustainable debt by USA  only thing holding up the market  is the hope that Bernanke will bring QE on August 1st  By front running QE it is making Bernanke s job that much difficult  When DOW is 13000  what justification can he have to pump more money  Isn t the QE been already priced in  Even if QE comes on 1st August  which I doubt  how far will it push the market up when the economy is on stall speed at 30000 ft above the ground  Personally  I do not think we will have the QE this time  Because it will be politically suicidal for Ben when  Audit The Fed  bill has passed congress and the Democratic hack Chuck Schumer is openly urging him for action  Everyone knows that Ben s is the only game in town and Republicans will tear into him  But It will be there before election  If what I am thinking works out correctly  can you imagine how disappointed the market will be on August 1st  But we cannot be certain  It is a bad idea to gamble with the retirement savings  If we must play  then take a calculated risk of losing a very small portion of the portfolio and try out to see what happens  But I would advice strong risk management  Even if we miss this down opportunity  we can be sure of the easy money opportunity coming next because then there will be QE and we can catch the ride up risk free  I want to emphasis that this is not the last opportunity and if we have the power dry   Cash  we can shoot when the ducks are in line  Right now  they are scattered all over  If we allow our conviction and greed to override caution  we will get hurt So let the markets go up for the next two days  Some indicators are over bought  some are not  But over bought can remain over bought for a long time and if you want to short just looking at RSI  that would be a mistake  Wait for the short squeeze to end and momentum to fade  Above all  just remove that  fear of missing out  from your head  If no QE 3 on August 1st  then the road is clear for the bears ,2012-07-29,BB Finance Blog,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-wild-week-in-review-131208,131208
29000,250515,CASH,Market Update  Trade Within Your Means,opinion,I spend a fair amount of time talking about living within your means on a personal finance front  And really  that same respect for money and discipline comes into play on an investing front  You see  trading with discipline is key  even better with technical discipline  wink   When short term market direction becomes a bit murky like it is right now  investors need to step back  clear their head  and ensure that they are not forcing things For instance  if you are a short term trader trying to game the markets  it s probably best to keep trading plans tight and concise  Realize that there is no need to force the action  it s okay to keep positions smaller than normal and to keep your powder  cash  dry for good setups  And for those who are less active  it s important to create and follow a plan based on longer term support and resistance levels  This will ensure that you are staying involved  yet comfortable And considering the current market environment and construct  discipline is a virtue  Price action has neutralized bullish sentiment  but this is exactly the time that the bull bear squawking gets going  maybe it s in the spirit of the presidential debate season  It s best to stay out of the emotional thought process and focus on your plan  As Todd Harrison says   discipline over conviction  Recent price action has offered little in the way of conviction  Sideways chop isn t necessarily a bad thing  but it does throw some investors off  particularly when it comes time for price to exit the range  shake and bake or a classic fakeout is common  so be aware Technically speaking  the market went too far  too fast  After puncturing the upper channel line and driving for the 1478 open gap  still open   the market ran out of gas and reversed  But  so far  that reversal lead to a standard 3 percent pullback  But where it gets tricky  is that the trend didn t immediately resume  like a typical  buy the dip   Instead  we ve seen a sideways chop  1430 1455 is the range  and outside that range are 1478 and 1497 on the upside and 1420 and 1405 on the downside  See charts below  Good luck and trade safe Disclosure  No position in any of the securities mentioned at the time of publication  Any opinions expressed herein are solely those of the author  and do not in any way represent the views or opinions of his employer or any other person or entity ,2012-10-04,Andrew Nyquist,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-update:-trade-within-your-means-138725,138725
29001,250516,CASH,How I Caused The 1987 Crash,opinion,I got a chuckle from the biz blogs and TV yesterday with the rehash of the 1987 stock crash  Twenty five years is a very long time  I d forgotten most of the events of that day   I was at Drexel  and at that time  Drexel was a powerhouse  The firm had plenty of capital and huge capacity to borrow money to fund positions  Money was rolling in  risk taking was encouraged  I was working with a small group of people on one of the screwier sub sets of the high yield bond market  It was referred to as LDC debt  Less Developed Country debt   These were the busted bank loans of all of the countries in South America   You might wonder why anyone would spend time mucking around with the debts of Brazil  Mexico  Argentina and Chile  Actually  it was a great business  We were coining money  The key to our  and others  success was the ability to make a price on illiquid assets  If some regional bank needed to sell  25Mn of Brazilian debt  we would make a bid on the phone  If a company were in need of some Mexican debt that would be used in a debt for equity transaction  we would offer the paper to the buyer  even though we did not own it   My old days of currency trading came in handy as some of the paper we traded was denominated in currencies other than the dollar   The fact that I had a  license  to trade currencies gave me the opportunity to speculate pretty freely  and I we did  The shop that I worked in was no different than any other on Wall Street  We had a  book  of positions  Some were outright specs  others were hedges against commitments we had made  To hold this book together  we required equity  cash    The Crash of 1987 happened on a Monday  But the crash really started the week before  The S P tanked 9  on the week  Friday was a particularly bad day  The big move in stocks set things in motion over a very nervous weekend  I got the call from the controller s office on Saturday  It went like this   Controller  Hi  Sorry to bother you  but we have some issues with our bank lenders  It was Bankers Trust that first pulled the plug on street liquidity   They are nervous  and want to cut back our funding lines  You are using a fair bit of capital in your trading book  Can you tell me what all this money is being used for   BK  Sure  We have a matched book of longs and shorts on the prop trading side  We also have some open currency positions  We have an inventory of hedges against open client positions  We also have some naked longs   Controller  Ah  can you be more specific   BK  Sure  We are long Brazil  Mexico and Chile  we are short Ecuador  Peru and Venezuela  We are naked short the USDHK  and have  60Mn of Cuban bonds in inventory   Controller  You re shitting me  What is that junk  Is any of this liquid  Can you sell this book of crap   BK  I might be able to run things down a bit  How much time do I have   Controller  Close half by Monday night   And that is how the crash of 87 happened   Sunday night October 19  at the opening in Tokyo the HK  position was closed off  at a loss of course   I got up at 2am and started the calls to London where there was a market for LDC paper  I was hitting bids on anything I could  The prices for the long assets were getting clobbered  There was no liquidity in the markets I was short  It was about minimizing losses and cutting a book  There was no finesse about it   Of course I was not alone in those early morning hours  Hundreds of players from NYC were on the phone hitting bids on all sorts of squirrely assets  The folks who make markets in London were never dopes  When their phones lit up with Americans looking to lighten up  they voted with their feet  Bids for everything dropped like a stone  By eight o clock in NY everyone knew that wholesale liquidations were going on  and that stocks were going to get beat to a pulp when the market opened up   I think I stood all of that day  The phones rang and rang  Both buy and sell side clients were panicked  Most were sellers  the buyers went on strike  Prices were dropping without any trading taking place  The brokers were all   offered without the bid   It was next to impossible to get trades off   Some where s around 2pm NY time  the Cuban paper got sold  more losses   There was not much more that could be done  So I sat down and watched the Reuters screen and the Dow tape for the rest of the day  I d had next to no sleep  drank a ton of coffee and smoked too many cigarettes  I d sweated all day  and stank  I left before the 4pm close   To me  there are today many similarities to the market conditions that triggered the 87 crash  These two ring a bell   In 87 I bet on Cuban paper  The rumor at the time was that Castro was sick  The thinking was that when he died  the bonds would increase in value  I d bought the bonds at around 5 cents on the dollar  Exactly the same bet  for the same reason  is being made today The Hong Kong dollar was pegged to the USD in 1983  Four years later guys like me were betting that the central bank could not hold the peg  Money was flowing into Hong Kong  the central bank was forced to intervene in the market to keep the lid on the HK   This same trade is popular today  The most important comparison has not yet shown up yet in 2012  In 1987  over the course of a weekend  and many panicky phone calls   market liquidity and the ability to finance off the run assets dried up  It started at the bottom of the rung of asset quality  by the end of the day it had spread to the most liquid stocks   On Thursday  October 15  1987  the farthest thing from my mind was a squeeze on the equity capital I was using to support a book of business  If anything  I was  everyone was  being encouraged to put more money to work  That vaporized in hours  It was one giant  risk off  event   There were no external factors of significance that led to the 87 crash  The market did itself in on that day  All it took was a few calls that said   I want you to cut back at open    The repo markets that fund the zillions of assets  good and bad  in 2012 are exponentially larger and more complex than in 1987  If anything  that market is more vulnerable today to the call that says   Cut it back    Note  Of course I didn t really start the 87 crash  I was a small cog in a very big wheel  There were thousands of folks who were scrambling on that day   On Monday night  10 19 87 the Fed  Greenspan  called the heads of the big banks and told them to open the spigots  The Repo markets were flush with cash on Tuesday morning   From my perspective  it was much ado about nothing ,2012-10-19,Bruce Krasting,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-i-caused-the-1987-crash-140518,140518

29004,250519,CASH,Lessons From The Sharks On Pitching A Fund ,opinion,A provocative elevator pitch has long been prized in sales  But in the hedge fund world of predators and prey  pitches need to be stellar to avoid swimming with the fishes  ABC s hit show  Shark Tank  based on the original Canadian series  Dragon s Den  offers several notable tips on delivering a better pitch for investment capital   Shark Tank s website description for obtaining start up investment lifeblood is deceptively simple  The entrepreneurs who dare to enter the  Shark Tank  must try to convince the tough  self made tycoons to part with their own hard earned cash and give them the funding they desperately need to jumpstart their business ideas  But these Sharks have a goal  too  They want a return on their investment and to own a piece of the next big business idea  In exchange for the Sharks  cash investment  the entrepreneurs give up a percentage of their companies  equity  When the Sharks hear a great idea  they re ready to fight each other for a piece of it  The once desperate entrepreneur can rejoice in the fact that the Sharks find value in their product  service  or business  But if the pitch is poor  the Sharks will tear into the ill prepared presenters and pass on the idea with a simple  I m out    The entrepreneurs have only a few minutes to convince the Sharks that their business is ready to take off  Typically they stand next to a display of the product and rattle off standard pitch details in QVC style  name of business  what it does  why it works  and how much capital they are seeking from the Sharks to grow to the next level  This takes 90 seconds or so in TV time  close to a typical elevator pitch  The interchange that follows from the Sharks is illuminating for the typical hedge fund start up trying to become a business   The Sharks then begin to circle the prey  entrepreneur  and fire off a series of questions  which the entrepreneur must navigate successfully or the dreaded  I m out   will propel a Shark out of the tank of potential funding  These questions focus on essential business viability issues that ultimately determine whether or not a Shark believes taking on the risk of the project is worth its potential pay off   The first question is invariably about the current valuation of the business and what proof the entrepreneur can offer to justify the amount  The Sharks will be lending based on this information  and negotiating for a piece of the business equity  If the answers to these issues fall short  the potential deal is dead in the water A hedge fund business hopeful should take note of this critical point when seeking angels and seeders  as alternative investors often offer to take an equity slice of somewhere between 10 50   with the negotiated split averaging 15 25   This is partially determined by the fund strategy  how crowded it is  and what the investment appetite is likely to be going forward for it in the alternatives space  Hedge fund business owners needs to consider in advance if they will be able to meet the payback schedule and exactly what their tolerance is for equity sharing prior to negotiating these issues with an investor   Second  the Sharks will challenge the entrepreneur to define what their plan is for scaling up the business  This typically includes distribution issues  strategic partnerships  patent developments  if appropriate   and the clarity of the marketing message  The entrepreneur gets mere seconds to address each of these items in front of the Sharks  but hedge fund business owners should be prepared to address these same topics with an investor as directly  They need to show that they have a solid understanding of all facets of building a business  and have already considered the factors they are being assessed on prior to seeking investment capital   Third  if the entrepreneur has survived the Sharks  initial probes  the next issue they likely face is how well they can take in criticism of their business model and adapt on the fly to the Sharks  suggestions for change  Often the Sharks  savvy business opportunists all  zero in on the weak points that present the biggest obstacles to overcome  They attempt to determine if the entrepreneur has the clarity of vision and business acumen to accept change and input from a potential equity partner  A hedge fund business hopeful will need to possess these skills as well  given that cooperation and negotiation are essential to gaining an investor partner   Finally  if the entrepreneur has made it through the process  the Sharks who are interested in owning a piece of the business will make their bid  The entrepreneur then faces an exciting but nerve racking negotiation with an investor  Shark  who has more experience  been there  done that   more leverage  cash   and more control over the outcome   I m out     The crux of the deal often comes down to the ownership percentage that must be given up  The amount of cash to be lent to the entrepreneur is incidental to the Shark  they have cash to lend to generate a preferred rate of return  and no shortage of solicitors for their business to deploy it  What gets the Sharks thrashing amongst themselves is the unknown upside potential  as represented by their equity stake in the fledgling business   This is where the novice entrepreneur  or hedge fund business hopeful  should be prepared to compromise  The goal is to balance giving up the least amount of equity with avoiding the killing of the deal  Giving up a 20  stake in a new business may be vastly preferable to walking away with no deal and 100  of a failure to thrive  Hedge fund hopefuls need to spend some serious time considering these pitching and negotiating issues prior to finding themselves in front of a shark  The objective is on creating the best chance possible to obtain the investment or risk ending up swimming with the fishes at the bottom of the capital pool    Disclosure  Diane Harrison is principal and owner of Panegyric Marketing  a strategic marketing communications firm founded in 2002 and specializing in a wide range of writing services

 Meta expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward looking statements on behalf of the company or its subsidiaries  whether as a result of new information  changed circumstances

like to welcome everyone to our fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings call  We are pleased to report fiscal 2020 first quarter results  including earnings of  21 1 million or  0 56 per diluted share  representing growth of 44  over the prior year s first quarter EPS  These results are reflective of our key strategic initiatives  increasing the percentage of balance sheet funding from core deposits  optimizing the interest earning asset mix of the balance sheet and improving our operating efficiencies  Executing on these initiatives is having a positive impact on the earnings power of the company and driving shareholder value  In November  we announced that MetaBank entered into an agreement with Central Bank for the sale of our Community Bank division This transaction is of strategic value to both companies and will enable us to focus our attention on our national payments and lending platforms  streamlining operations and serving key markets often overlooked by traditional banks  The transaction with Central Bank is expected to close in the second fiscal quarter of 2020  As always  credit quality remains a top priority for our company  and we remain disciplined in our underwriting decisions  which Glen will discuss further in his prepared remarks  During the quarter  we disposed of the assets related to the previously disclosed agricultural relationship that were formerly held in other real estate owned  Resolution of this matter resulted in marked improvement of our nonperforming asset ratios over previous quarters  In November  the Board also authorized a new share repurchase program for up to 7 5 million shares of Meta s common stock During the quarter  we book    bought back roughly 319 000 shares completing the first program announced in June of 2019  and another 580 000 shares  utilizing the new program  As previously stated  we intend to use the expected pre tax gain on the pending sale of the Community Bank division of approximately  18 5 million for share repurchases as well as other corporate purposes  We will continue to consider repurchase activity within the context of a balanced capital management approach  designed to support the company s growth prospects and maximize shareholder value Now let me turn the call over to Glen Herrick  our CFO  to provide more detail on our fiscal 2020 first quarter financial results Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Brad  and good afternoon  everyone  For the first quarter of fiscal 2020  we reported GAAP net income of  21 1 million or  0 56 per diluted share  compared to  15 4 million or  0 39 per diluted share for the same quarter of the prior year  Earnings per share growth of 44  over the prior year s first quarter  primarily reflected higher net interest income as a result of efforts to optimize our balance sheet  During the first quarter of fiscal 2020  we originated  17 9 million in solar leases with related tax investment credits further improving after tax income  Though the timing and impact of future investment tax credits are expected to vary from period to period  we continue to expect the tax rate for fiscal year 2020 to settle in the low teens  Total gross loans and leases were  3 58 billion at December 31  a decrease of 2  on a linked quarter basis  which was mostly a function of the transfer of  252 million of Community Banking loans to held for sale during the quarter in connection with the pending sale of the Community Bank division to Central Bank Compared to December 31  2018  total gross loans and leases increased 8   Our commercial finance loan portfolio totaled  1 99 billion at December 31  an increase of 4  on a linked quarter basis and a 23  increase year over year  driven by growth in the term lending  asset based lending and government guaranteed loan portfolios  Turning to the liability side of the balance sheet  Average payments deposits were  2 78 billion for the quarter  rising nearly 12  versus the average for the same quarter in the prior fiscal year  and represented 60  of total average deposits  As a result of our continued balance sheet optimization efforts  we generated  64 7 million of net interest income in the fiscal 2020 first quarter  up 7  compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019  Our net interest margin expanded by 34 basis points year over year to 4 94  for the fiscal 2020 first quarter  Loan yields were 7 32  for the quarter  compared to 7 51  for the previous quarter and 7 69  for the first quarter of the prior fiscal year  reflecting the impact of a lower rate environment  Purchase accounting accretion added eight basis points to loan yields in the first fiscal 2020 quarter versus 20 basis points in the prior quarter and 31 basis points in the first fiscal 2019 quarter Nonperforming assets at December 31  2019 represented 48 basis points of total assets  compared to 91 basis points of total assets at September 30  2019  As Brad mentioned  during the quarter  we disposed of assets related to a previously disclosed Community Bank agricultural relationship that were held in other real estate owned  which represented 46 basis points of nonperforming assets as of September 30  2019  The company recognized a pre tax net loss of  4 1 million related to the sale of the foreclosed property during the quarter  While the levels of nonperforming assets and charge offs often exhibit some degree of volatility  the company continuously monitors its various loan and lease portfolios for trends of deterioration and as of December 31  management remained comfortable with the trends and the risk characteristics of our loan portfolios Noninterest income was  37 5 million for the fiscal first quarter  a decrease of less than 1  from the same quarter of fiscal 2019  due primarily by the previously mentioned loss on sale of foreclosed real estate  Excluding the loss on sale  noninterest income benefited from higher rental income  gain on sale of loans and leases  other income and tax product fee income  Noninterest expense increased by 2  to  75 8 million for the fiscal first quarter  compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2019  Looking ahead  we remain committed to allocating capital and resources to businesses with the most attractive growth and profitability profiles  while improving our overall efficiency ratio  Finally  let me discuss our earnings per share outlook  We are reiterating our fiscal 2020 GAAP earnings per share guidance range of  3 58 to  3 78  We are also reiterating our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance range of  3 30 to  3 50  excluding the expected gain on branch sale and the incurred loss of foreclosed property previously discussed With that  I ll turn the conversation back to Brad for closing comments Brad Hanson    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Glen  To recap  we re pleased with our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020  The progress we ve made thus far toward our three key strategic initiatives and the opportunities ahead in 2020  That completes our prepared remarks  So I ll ask Glen to join me for Q A Operator  please open up the line for any questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from the line of Steve Moss from B  Riley FBR  Your line is now open Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystI guess  to start off on just the overall loan trends here  Just curious as to what you re seeing for the loan pipeline and your expectations for commercial finance here going forward Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSteve  it s Glen  We re seeing a lot of opportunity  And quite frankly  a fair amount of customer confidence  especially with a lot of the small market businesses that we serve today Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystAnd so when we think about loan growth for 2020  still thinking like a mid teens type of number  perhaps  in loan growth Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  yes Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystOkay  And then in terms of just loan yields here  obviously  a lot less purchase accounting accretion  I think  that I was looking for  Just kind of wondering  one is  where are loan yields headed here given the lower rate environment  I m assuming a little bit lower to go  But then also  does purchase accounting accretion come back a little bit as we head in the next couple of quarters Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  no  Given the nature of the portfolio  purchase accounting really goes away after this quarter  And so a drop eight basis points on the linked quarter basis  our NIM was down one basis point  And so we would expect  excluding the tax loans  that our NIM would move north from here  and it will cross over 5  in 2020 Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystOkay  And then where are you guys seeing loan yields for the commercial finance portfolio these days Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThere s a lot of different portfolios  but that plus or minus the 9  is kind of a good weighted average rate today Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then in terms of just the noninterest bearing deposit growth  it looks like a pretty good increase on the average year over year  Is it still consistent to expect more or less high single digits  low double digits for noninterest bearing deposit growth going forward here Brad Hanson    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think that s a fair assumption Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystOkay  Good  And then  I guess  one more thing on expenses here  Any color around expenses  I think  it s going to be a little bit of a messy quarter  perhaps with the bank  not exactly sure  But maybe if you could just give a little color around expenses ex tax for second and the third quarter Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Yes  Right  We had a few divestiture related expenses this quarter  we ll have some next quarter  And obviously  a fair amount of increase in expenses related to the tax business that s variable  But if you look at our absolute expenses of roughly  76 million    noninterest expenses of  76 million for this quarter  I would hope that would be a pretty good base for us outside of tax expense  or tax season Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystRight  And then  I guess  with this    with the sale of the bank  could we back off a little bit  perhaps  like  below to mid 70s or like    from the June quarter Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So there ll be some mix shift in there  We ll still have a  900 million portfolio that we ll be paying servicing fees on  So you could see some geography shifting in the expense line from comp to servicing fees or processing as well as  as we ve talked about  we expect to continue to grow our other loan portfolios  especially commercial finance and staffing or variable cost to go with that OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Perito from KBW  Your line is now open Michael Perito    KBW    AnalystI wanted to    Glen  I was wondering if you could maybe just spend a minute to kind of walk us through how you re kind of thinking about what  kind of  like an operating or core earnings number for the fiscal first quarter was  Obviously  there s a few moving pieces and it looked like in fees and expenses and the provision with regard to the divestiture  And I was just    I was trying to piece it all together  And I thought it maybe just easier to see how you guys are thinking about it given those moving parts I just mentioned Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  I look at it as the noncore related to the    it s really all around the Community Bank divestiture  And so we d look at the disposal of that OREO that had been hanging out there  The expenses that we highlighted  the  900 000 of expenses in the first quarter as well as then offset by the provision recapture when we move that portfolio to held for sale Michael Perito    KBW    AnalystSo was that good  like  that it s like a roughly  0 59 or  0 60 type of EPS figure for the fiscal first quarter as you guys adjust for all those tax affected Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I think that s a good adjustment Michael Perito    KBW    AnalystOkay  And then  Brad  on the repurchases  you mentioned utilizing the gain in the next quarter here to put toward repurchases and other general corporate purposes  But I was just curious if maybe you could just comment more broadly about what the Board s appetite is here for repurchases  I mean  clearly  the authorization you guys put out is a large figure  I imagine that the reason for that is you intend to use quite a bit of it  But I was just curious if you could maybe comment more specifically just about what the appetite is that we should expect going forward Brad Hanson    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  just remember that the authorization is pretty long in term  It has several years remaining on it  So we re going to be opportunistic with it  We think  at these prices  that it s a good investment for us based on the capital we re bringing in here  But we monitor various factors and other opportunities that may arise along the way that may affect how much we repurchase over the course of the authorization itself Michael Perito    KBW    AnalystOkay  Helpful  And then just one last one I wanted to ask  just on the deposit growth in the quarter  As we try    over these next couple of quarters  I know  there s quite a bit of seasonality in your deposit portfolio between the holidays and then tax season  So I was just curious if you could maybe give us an update of kind of the core growth that you re seeing underneath kind of some of the seasonal inflows and outflows  both in the current quarter  but also  kind of  as you look out  I mean I know you mentioned that the noninterest bearing overall expectations for the year  Steve s question previously  But is that kind of taking into account some of the seasonal factors as well Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So that s why we specifically called the 12  out year over year quarter to account for the seasonality  We really look at that as the core deposit growth  So it s continuing to ratchet up as we had hoped  As Brad has mentioned before  some of these can be a little lumpy  some of the payments relationships  But we look at 12  core deposit growth year over year  and would hope that  that trend would continue Michael Perito    KBW    AnalystAll right  And then just    I ll just sneak one more in quickly  Just on the  2 5 million of charge offs  I think you mentioned in the press release  it was mostly commercial finance related  Can you just give us a little bit more color about what the drivers were there Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJust a couple of relationships that  that went to charge off  from an absolute dollar standpoint  You certainly could expect our charge offs in commercial finance to grow on a dollar basis  just because of the growth in that portfolio  But we re happy with the credit metrics and believe that looking forward  that they re going to stay within the range that we expect and model Operator Operator Instructions  And our next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi from Piper Sandler  Your line is now open Frank Schiraldi    Piper Sandler    AnalystI just wanted to ask  Glen  on the card fee line item  the  21 5 million  I know in the past  you ve had some programs winding down that has boosted that number  Is this a pretty good run rate here for the first    for the fourth fiscal quarter Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So this is very clean  Frank Frank Schiraldi    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And then you mentioned the 12  growth in Payments related deposits  I m assuming it s still reasonable to take    to think about year over year growth in card fees and maybe assume a little bit lower rate of growth than what you re getting on the deposits  So is it reasonable from here just to think about maybe a mid single digit rate of growth in that card fee income line year over year Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Yes  As we ve said before  we would expect    every program is a little different  different economics  But collectively  we would expect the core deposit growth in the Payments division to grow at a faster rate than the fee income side of it Frank Schiraldi    Piper Sandler    AnalystRight  Okay  And then just on the tax rate  In my model  at least  the rate came in a lot lower than I had expected  I m just curious  are you guys    were you surprised  I mean  was this a lot lower than your budgeted number as well  Or is there something seasonal with the solar tax credits that the December quarter was always going to be much lower than the rest of the year Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  we are    I d say  related to our budget  we re happy with the production in this quarter  There are some step downs in the investment tax credits  And so a couple of folks  certainly  developers push to get deals done prior to year end to maximize the tax credit Frank Schiraldi    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And when you talked about the low teens  I think  tax rate  was that from here for the last three    for the next few quarters  Or what was that   Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerFull year    yes  full fiscal year  full 12 months fiscal year Frank Schiraldi    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  Great  And then  I guess  it seemed to me like a pretty good run rate versus what a lot of people were expecting in this quarter    in the first fiscal quarter  So just curious  I mean  it seems like credits are a bit better than you guys    even you guys anticipated  Is there some place else in terms of the geography of the income statement  where you guys are behind schedule  Just kind of curious  why  Obviously  you guys reiterated your number for the full year versus what I thought was a pretty good strong run rate for the first quarter or so Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I think that kind of stance on the statement there  Frank  We re certainly happy with the quarter  We re happy with the progress against our strategic initiatives  and we re comfortable reiterating that guidanceFrank Schiraldi    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  But there s    it doesn t sound like there s something that you guys are behind schedule on  It was just a strong start to the year  and you re reiterating guidance  is that fair Glen Herrick    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s correct OperatorAt this time  I am showing no further questions  I would like to turn the call back over to CEO  Brad Hanson  for closing remarks Brad Hanson    President
