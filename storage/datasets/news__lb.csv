219672,441188,LB,2 More Hurdles Standing in the Way of L Brands Shedding Victoria s Secret,news,"Although parent company L Brands  NYSE LB  has yet to confirm it  the working theory that it s considering a sale of its Victoria s Secret arm remains the market s assumption  A  person familiar with the matter  intimated the possibility to Bloomberg on Wednesday of last week 
The prospect is far from guaranteed  however  L Brands may be looking to sell Victoria s Secret  but that doesn t inherently mean a suitor is willing to buy it    at least not at a palatable price  The lingerie brand s same store sales have been shrinking for a long while now  and full year operating profits are frequently flirting with nil  Any organization that acquires it will be taking on a sizable repair project 
The impasses to a sale go well beyond slumping sales  however  While news of the sale and the corresponding exit of CEO  and founder  Leslie Wexner have dominated the headlines since Bloomberg introduced the idea  a couple of other headaches are waiting in the wings  Both raise questions of how fiscal responsibility might be divvied up 

1  La Senza s Unpaid Bills
Some L Brands shareholders will remember the company sold off its smaller lingerie store chain La Senza in early 2019 to private equity firm Regent  Though the fiscal details of the deal were never disclosed  it looked like a relatively straightforward transaction rooted in L Brands  desire to focus on fewer but bigger brands 
There was a curious quirk included within the terms of the deal  however  according to La Senza inventory supplier MGF  It says L Brands was to guarantee payment on  20 million worth of inventory delivered to La Senza between the middle of 2019 and May of this year 
As of its latest tally  MGF reports it has not been paid for  42 million worth of inventory it s supplied for La Senza  It s unclear to what extent L Brands may be held liable for that figure 
La Senza  for the record  was already losing money when Regent bought it  logging an operating loss on the order of  40 million the year before the deal was made  It s unlikely the retailer in just one year has swung back to a profitability that would allow it to pay all of its bills 
Were it just a few million dollars  worth of inventory  it would be an annoyance  but not necessarily a dealbreaker  But it s not just a  20 million check L Brands may have to write  the company s recent SEC filings also indicate it s guaranteed lease payments of now up to  44 million to keep La Senza stores open  The last of those leases expires in 2028  The potential hiccup is how might the total  64 million liability be divvied up when one of the two big divisions of L Brands can t actually afford to pay La Senza s unpaid bills either 
For perspective  L Brands has recorded an operating profit of  1 3 billion on sales of  13 1 billion for the past four reported quarters  though only  267 million of that operating profit came from Victoria s Secret 
2  Divvying up debt
In that same vein  Jefferies analysts highlight another matter that will surely surface  should divestiture whispers become reality  From the Jefferies analysis   We see a heavy debt load creating a large obstacle for investors that seek a split of Bath   Body Works and Victoria s Secret   The heavy debt load in question stands at just under  5 5 billion worth of long term liabilities  per L Brands  most recent SEC filing 
There is no solution the parent and the suitor and shareholders are likely to agree on  Technically speaking  Victoria s Secret is the bigger unit as measured by sales  accounting for 56  of 2018 s total top line of  13 2 billion  But  as measured by profits  Bath   Body Works is the workhorse  contributing 75  of 2018 s operating income of  1 44 billion 
The suitor will argue it s doing L Brands a favor already by taking Victoria s Secret off of its hands  and shouldn t be saddled with much  if any  debt  L Brands will argue Victoria s Secret offers the most potential  and should at least take a fair share of that debt load with it 
It s possible the debt matter could be so unresolvable  one or both of the parties at the table decides to walk away 
Buckle up  or hunker down    your choice
Of course  making bets on buyouts or divestitures is a bad idea  so for bystanders  these two additional wrenches will mean little  Most investors are already on the sidelines  uncertain of L Brands  future with or without a split of the company s brands 
But for the shareholders hoping a sale of Victoria s Secret would serve as a graceful exit of another soured consumer goods name  don t hold your breath  This story is apt to get messier before the dust finally settles ",2020-02-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqe--,2074408

219676,441192,LB,L Brands Is Looking to Sell Victoria s Secret,news,"L Brands  NYSE LB  is close to a deal to sell its Victoria s Secret brand to Sycamore Partners  according to a report from CNBC  Terms of a deal are not final yet  as negotiations are ongoing and could still fall through  But a deal could be announced as soon as next week  
A sale of Victoria s Secret  VS  would be good news for shareholders of L Brands  given the abysmal performance of the VS business lately  The shares spiked about 7  on the news in pre market trading on Monday  

A time to sell
In early January  preliminary sales results were issued for the holiday period that saw comparable sales at Victoria s Secret decline by 12   Year to date for the current fiscal year  comp sales are down 8   which reveals the situation getting worse  Victoria s Secret is not only losing share to American Eagle Outfitters  Aerie brand  but it s losing relevancy in the retail industry altogether 
Talks of a possible sale signals that management doesn t have the answers as to how to fix the iconic brand  Given that L Brands generates  13 billion in annual sales and that Victoria s Secret makes up most of that amount  the company would likely receive a hefty sum in a deal 
What would a sale mean for investors 
While Victoria s Secret is heading south in a hurry  L Brands  better half has been the Bath   Body Works business  where comp sales were up 9  year over year in November and December  By shedding Victoria s Secret  management would draw more attention to the better business  and that would likely send the shares higher ",2020-02-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptcht,2080664
219677,441193,LB,Why L Brands Stock Jumped 27 8  in January,news,"What happened
Shares of L Brands  NYSE LB  soared 27 8  in January  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  following an initial report from The Wall Street Journal that the consumer discretionary company was weighing whether to sell its Victoria s Secret subsidiary 
So what
It was no mystery that the Victoria s Secret concept has weighed down L Brands as a whole in recent quarters  with its persistently declining same store sales and profits amid an increasing number of consumers turning to the wares of trendier competitors 
So L Brands stock unsurprisingly popped 13  on Jan  29 alone when the Journal broke the news  According to the Journal s sources  CEO Leslie Wexner was in talks to sell Victoria s Secret  retire from his position  or both amid pressure from activist investors  They want to maximize shareholder value by separating the outperforming Bath   Body Works concept from the rest of the business 

Now what
Sure enough  on Feb  9  CNBC separately cited people familiar with the matter as saying L Brands is close to a deal to sell Victoria s Secret to private equity firm Sycamore Partners  and could even announce a formal agreement by the end of this week 
Nothing is set in stone at this stage  however  So I think investors would do well not to incorporate a potential divestment as a core piece of their bull thesis for L Brands stock  But given the prospect of separating this struggling piece of its business from its stronger retail concepts  it was no surprise to see L Brands shares climbing higher in response ",2020-02-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptr6g,2081614

219688,441204,LB,Why L Brands Stock Just Popped 13 ,news,"What happened
Shares of Victoria s Secret owner L Brands  NYSE LB  are soaring on angel wings  up 13 3  as of 11 a m  EST after The Wall Street Journal reported this morning that CEO Leslie Wexner is in talks to sell Victoria s Secret  retire from his post as L Brands  boss  or both   

So what
L Brands stock and the S P 500 have moved in opposite directions over the past year  with the S P up 24  and L Brands stock down 26   Sales are down  and profits along with them  For these reasons if no other  investors may be thinking that a change of management is in order 
Additionally  the Journal points out that activist investors including Barington Capital Group have been pushing L Brands to consider splitting off its fast growing Bath   Body Works consumer products brand from the weaker Pink and Victoria s Secret  probably by spinning off and selling the latter 
Last year  sales at the flagship Victoria s Secret business declined a fraction of a percent  while Bath   Body enjoyed nearly 12  sales growth  VS profits fell by roughly half  while Bath   Body operating profit was up 13     even better than sales growth 
Now what
Selling off VS  and maybe also Pink  a lingerie brand targeting teens and tweens  would instantly diminish L Brands  sales  but just as quickly lift its profit margin and provide a big cash influx that could be reinvested in growing the brand that s actually growing  It would  however  also deprive L Brands of any benefit that a buyer might reap from turning around the iconic Victoria s Secret

219690,441206,LB,Why Victoria s Secret Will Continue to Be a Drag on L Brands,news,"It s no secret that Victoria s Secret has been the reason for L Brands   NYSE LB  earnings woes  The company s once adored lingerie brand has seen revenue dwindle as shoppers turn to rivals that focus more on comfort than glamour  And yet  this month analysts at Bank of America  Deutsche Bank  Keybanc  and Barclays all upgraded the shares  even suggesting an eventual L Brands breakup  according to CNBC 

Investors may want to bet on an L Brands turnaround  and some might consider sales at the company s Bath   Body Works bath products chain a reason to be optimistic  Same store sales rose 9  in the third quarter and were up 10  over the first three quarters of the year compared to the prior year period 
But here s where the problem lies  At least for now  L Brands isn t just about Bath   Body Works  and the bath chain s sales gains fail to compensate for declines at Victoria s Secret  The lingerie chain s quarterly sales slipped 7  and were down 6  year to date   and related impairment charges resulted in a net loss for L Brands  More recent financial data doesn t brighten the picture  After L Brands  comparable sales fell 3  over the holiday period  the company lowered its guidance for fourth quarter earnings per share to  1 85 from  2 
An image problem
So what s the issue at Victoria s Secret  and what s the company doing about it  A big problem is image  Victoria s Secret has failed to keep up with the needs of today s shopper  These days  many women prefer a brand that emphasizes comfort over fashion  About 40  of millennials say their closets hold mostly  comfort wear   according to research by The NPD Group  Further  the report showed that millennials were responsible for more than a third of women s intimate apparel sales in 2017 and 2018 
L Brands has made some efforts to align Victoria s Secret with shoppers  new priorities  The brand sells the comfortable sports bras and bralettes  bras without wires or padding  that have gained popularity  therefore reducing its reliance on items like the pushup bra  The cancellation of the Victoria s Secret Fashion Show featuring glamorous models wearing lingerie and angel wings may also signal that change is ahead  On the third quarter earnings call  chief financial officer Stuart Burgdoerfer said   It s important to evolve the marketing of Victoria s Secret  
Emotional content
But investors need to see more before scooping up L Brands  shares with confidence  Though the company seems to be toning down the Victoria s Secret glamour above all else image  it s unclear if the plan is to reshape the brand s image or just make a few adjustments  As for concrete changes  management said that in the sleep and lounge business  the brand is investing in higher quality fabrics  and overall the aim is to increase product quality and  emotional content  across all categories  Still  this doesn t offer us more clarity about what Victoria s Secret will look like a year from now or further down the road    and that makes it difficult to bet on an L Brands recovery 
If L Brands decides to truly transform the Victoria s Secret image  a new question arises  Will it be successful  The strength of the image    once a benefit    now may be the brand s downfall  It won t be easy to change the image of pink  lace  and beautiful models most people see when they think of Victoria s Secret 
Too early or too late 
Of course  it is possible that with or without an image revamp  L Brands will successfully boost sales at Victoria s Secret  It s also possible that an L Brands breakup will happen and improve the financial picture  In either case  results won t be delivered overnight  and any such plan will be costly for the company in the near term  For the long term investor  this is exactly why now is too early to bet on better days at Victoria s Secret and L Brands 
Or  from another perspective  it s too late  Last year  the shares traded at about 8 times earnings  their lowest by that measure in at least 10 years  and finished the year with a 29  decline    but that s no longer the story today  They ve rebounded 15  this year  sending L Brands  valuation to more than 15 times earnings  There may be short term gains ahead as some investors react to analyst upgrades and speculate on recovery scenarios  but until signs of improvement or a new strategy emerge  the shares seem too risky ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pov18,2071486
219691,441207,LB,Victoria s Secret may be up for sale ,news,"The secret s out  
Victoria s Secret may be up for sale  L Brands  NYSE LB  s CEO is exploring strategic alternatives that could result in a full or partial sale of the lingerie retailer  according to the Wall Street Journal 
The company has been under pressure from an activist investor to sell the struggling Victoria s Secret brand  where sales have fallen for at least four quarters  Customers have been buying cheaper bralettes and sports bras from the likes of Aerie and Rihanna s lingerie line  Savage X Fenty  A full sale would leave would chop its  13 billion revenue nearly in half  leaving L Brands with Bath   Body Works and PINK under its umbrella

219692,441208,LB,L Brands May Want to Shed Victoria s Secret  but It s a Tough Sell,news,"Read the headlines carefully  and you ll see L Brands  NYSE LB  has neither confirmed nor denied rumors of lingerie retailer Victoria s Secret being put up for sale  Likewise  whispers that CEO Leslie Wexner is stepping down only cite unnamed  people familiar with the matter  as the source of the prospect 
Nevertheless  given the company s ongoing struggle to reverse its declining same store sales and the fact that the sale prospect has been broached before  there could be some truth to the matter  Investors certainly felt that way on Wednesday after hearing the suggestion  sending shares higher to the tune of 12 9  by the close  
The market may want to tamp down the enthusiasm  however  L Brands could be interested in selling the Victoria s Secret brand and holding on to its  much  more successful Bath   Body Works brand  but that doesn t mean anyone s interested in buying a brand that needs a major overhaul 

Not aligned with 2020 societal norms
In its heyday  it was all the rage  Any respectable mall in the 1990s was home to a Victoria s Secret store selling lingerie and other high end undergarments  in an era where the sexualization of the female form was the norm 
But  times have changed  Victoria s Secret s customers in their 20s and 30s in 1990 are now in their 50s and 60s  and their 20 something and 30 something daughters aren t buying into some new cultural norms  Yes  the advent of the  metoo movement was and still is a factor  although a careful look at the shift reveals it was taking shape before movie producer Harvey Weinstein found himself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons  The shift has also been rooted in more than just the objectification of one gender  The retailer has been criticized for excluding women that don t have model esque bodies  which as it turns out are most women 
The damage the Victoria s Secret brand has suffered  however  goes beyond the typical frustration consumers might feel when a company lets them down  Tex Mex food fans were irritated when Chipotle Mexican Grill was found to be the epicenter of an E  coli outbreak  It took a couple of years for the restaurant chain to recover from that letdown  Shoppers wanted J C  Penney to continue sending them coupons in the mail  The retail giant still hasn t recovered from that letdown  For Victoria s Secret and what it stands for  though  too much of the consumer pushback has been unapologetically hostile 
Take last year s comment from the plus size model Jessica Leahy as an example  She pulled no punches in saying  I can t wait to dance on Victoria s Secret s grave  after the company was essentially forced to cancel its annual fashion show  It was a strong comment  but one reflective of growing ire about the lingerie retailer s entire operational premise  Les Wexner s relatively close professional relationship with accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein is also a connection many consumers simply can t overlook  
It s particularly problematic considering the company s prime target market  Forrester data suggests almost 7 out of 10 millennials consider an organization s values before buying their products  The same store sales trend says those consumers are balking 

Competitors responded to the cultural shift first
That s the proverbial rub for L Brands and any potential buyer of Victoria s Secret  It s a name that not only has to be rebuilt for relevancy in the 2020s  but it must also erase its reflection of a time when social norms were less than healthy  As Citigroup analyst Paul Lejuez put it last year   It will be a tough balancing act to attract new customers without alienating its existing customer base  While we still think a change toward inclusivity is the right move  a move in that direction might be more difficult to pull off  
Raising the bar on the already tall order is the need to do so in a market that s given rise to competitors like ThirdLove and American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO  brand Aerie  Both sell underwear but cater to comfort seekers rather than to the shrinking number of consumers interested in uncomfortable lingerie  Aerie s promotional materials also feature women that look like and are shaped like  real people   Indeed  if nothing else  the rise of Aerie demonstrates there s room for new undergarment retailers even in a struggling brick and mortar world  while ThirdLove suggests even a direct to consumer underwear label can work 
That s not to suggest sexier attire is completely out of fashion  For occasions where something a little racier is in order  however  more accessible alternatives than Victoria s Secret still exist  Among all of its present challenges  Victoria s Secret stores are also fighting the headwind of a retail apocalypse 
Too far gone to command a premium
In 2018  Victoria s Secret s U S  business generated  7 4 billion worth of revenue  with three fourths of it still being driven by physical stores  It s on pace to do about  7 billion in sales for all of fiscal 2019  and has logged several consecutive quarters of declining same store sales  Operating income of  300 million in 2018 could be pared down to nothing once 2019 s final figures are reported  Technically speaking    assuming nothing changes    there d be no measurable benefit in acquiring the name at all 

As such  the only motivation to buy the Victoria s Secret brand would be absolute certainty on the part of the buyer it could do something that Wexner hasn t tried yet  Perhaps worse  a suitor would have to undo much of what has been done to damage the brand 
That s going to make it tough to find a buyer at a price that investors can live with ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppe-o,2072869

A quarter ago  it was expected that this owner of Victoria s Secret  Bath   Body Works and other chain stores would post earnings of  0 19 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 24  delivering a surprise of 26 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
L Brands  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry  posted revenues of  2 68 billion for the quarter ended October 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 46   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 77 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
L Brands shares have lost about 33 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 24 5  
What s Next for L Brands 
While L Brands has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for L Brands was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 94 on  4 84 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 37 on  13 05 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

LB s  window of opportunity  for action is fairly limited   which creates a risk reward that is now  skewed meaningfully to the  upside   Kanaga contends

219715,441231,LB,Why L Brands Stock Dropped 29  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of L Brands  NYSE LB  fell 29 4  in value last year  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence 
The company continued to be a tale of two brands  On one side  the Bath   Body Works business has been L Brands  better half  reporting comp sales growth of 10  through the first three quarters of fiscal 2019  That is consistent with the performance in the previous year  
On the other side  it s clear that Victoria s Secret is losing market share to competitors  Comp sales have been ugly  falling 6  in the first three quarters of fiscal 2019  which shows a worsening trend following the 1  decline in the previous year  And given that Victoria s Secret makes up most of the company s revenue  weak performance there is pressuring results for the whole company  
Retail spending is an important trend to watch with consumer discretionary stocks  The recent holiday season looks to have been a healthy environment for most retailers  according to the latest data from Mastercard SpendingPulse  But that doesn t appear to have helped Victoria s Secret  L Brands reported a decrease in comp sales of 3  for the holidays and lowered full year earnings guidance to  1 85 from the previous guidance of  2 00  

So what
Victoria s Secret used to be an iconic retail brand  and in some ways it still is  but the brand obviously has an image problem 
Here s the deal  Victoria s Secret is famous for using supermodels to market its product  but sales are falling  Meanwhile  American Eagle Outfitter s Aerie brand is designing and marketing its product for all body types  and sales are exploding  Two different approaches  and two completely opposite outcomes  
Supermodels might have been the ticket in the 1990s  but not in the 2020s  The good news is that management gets it  The long running Victoria s Secret Fashion Show was cancelled last year  and that might be a sign that L Brands is starting to adjust its marketing approach to respond to competitors 
Now what
Victoria s Secret still has tremendous brand awareness going for it  It can use that to its advantage and turn itself around  but it needs an entire makeover from product design to marketing  but a comeback won t be easy 
One problem for L Brands is that it has cornered itself by relying heavily on discounts to drive sales  Once a retailer goes down that rabbit hole  it s tough to dig itself out  Customers become trained to wait for discounts before they buy  and that makes it very difficult to keep margins firm 
New managers are trying to rework the assortment and pricing strategy at Victoria s Secret Lingerie and the PINK brand  but investors are probably not going to send the stock higher until Victoria s Secret proves it can string together a quarter or two of comp sales growth ",2020-01-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ph2aj,2057600
219716,441232,LB,Weakness at L Brands Is Likely to Continue,news,"L Brands  NYSE LB  has been plagued by declining sales for both its Victoria s Secret and Pink brands  The retailer announced weaker holiday sales and cut its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter  Its third quarter sales results also came in below expectations  Shares have dropped 28  over the last six months 
While Victoria s Secret and Pink report declining sales  the company s Bath   Body Works business is posting higher growth rates  with a 9  increase in comparable sales for the nine week holiday period ended Jan  4  In contrast  Victoria s Secret s comparable store sales fell by 12  in the same period  below last year s 4  decrease  Victoria s Secret and Pink may be two fashion brands that have fallen out of favor with fickle consumers  and strength at Bath   Body Works may not be enough to keep growth going for the company 

Amid recent results  Bath   Body Works is a bright spot
L Brands announced that sales for the two month holiday period shrank by 3   down to  3 9 billion from  4 1 billion in the prior year  As a result of the weaker holiday sales  management cut its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter to  1 85 per share from the prior  2 00  The revised forecast is notably well below average analyst expectations of  2 00 
Victoria s Secret had weak holiday sales  with store traffic down in the mid teens  while higher promotional activity further hurt sales and margins  Management specifically cited weakness in the sales of sleepwear and tops  Sales and store traffic at Pink were also down 
One bright spot was Bath   Body Works  which had a 9  increase in comparable sales for the holiday period  The division  known for its scented candles and body wash  built on momentum in the third quarter  which featured a 9  increase in comparable sales and 10  increase in operating income  However  some analysts voiced concerns over how long the strength at Bath   Body Works could continue  Jefferies analyst Randy Konik wrote that  margins are beginning to erode and compares are daunting  
Issues likely to continue at Victoria s Secret and Pink
Competition is fierce in the women s lingerie and apparel space  Newer  more nimble brands like ThirdLove  Savage X Fenty  and other specialty retailers like American Eagle s  NYSE AEO  Aerie are taking market share from Victoria s Secret and Pink  Victoria s Secret is also developing a reputation for products that have lower quality and less comfort  It also appears to have lost touch with increasing preferences from consumers for more inclusivity and mass appeal 
While Victoria s Secret management launched a new advertising campaign a few months ago focused on diversity and inclusivity  it may take a while for the brand to shift its image  In November 2018  the brand suffered a setback when its former marketing executive stated that he didn t think transgender or plus size models should star in the annual fashion show because  it s a fantasy   Angry consumers called for boycotting of the brand  The Victoria s Secret fashion show was canceled and the brand s image suffered 
A potential catalyst for shares 
L Brands  stock will likely continue to be hindered by the performance of its Victoria s Secret and Pink brands  However  an activist investor has been pressuring the consumer discretionary company to consider strategic alternatives  including a separation of Bath   Body Works from the underperforming Victoria s Secret operation  The company is reported to have met with bankers to discuss possible M A strategies that would help improve shareholder value  L Brands also has a history of selling off selective brands  including Lane Bryant and The Limited  If the company were to pursue this strategy  it could potentially please investors  However  as things currently stand  the retailer will likely continue to be weighed down by Victoria s Secret s sales growth struggles ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phvla,2058998

219727,441243,LB,Why Victoria s Secret s Image Is Hurting L Brands,news,"The glamorous image of Victoria s Secret is no longer adding sparkle to owner L Brands   NYSE LB  earnings  The company  which owns the famous lingerie brand as well as bath shop chain Bath   Body Works  has seen sales and profit shrink as customers turn away from Victoria s Secret in favor of options like American Eagle Outfitters   NYSE AEO  Aerie and private companies like Harper Wilde and ThirdLove 
So the question is  Why is today s customer leaving Victoria s Secret  It s all about image  Shoppers of the  80s and  90s flocked to Victoria s Secret  known for its push up bras  statuesque models  and extravagant annual fashion show  Lingerie in silks  satin  and lace was in everyone s closet  and the idea of comfort wasn t a big part of the bra purchase decision  Instead  glamor was the word 

Looking for comfort
Fast forward a few years  and the entire lingerie landscape has changed  These days  women are looking for comfort  According to The NPD Group  40  of millennials say that most of their wardrobe is made up of  comfort wear   Millennials  representing the largest share of the women s intimate apparel market in the U S   were responsible for more than a third of all sales in 2017 and 2018  the data showed 
L Brands has made efforts to reshape Victoria s Secret s image  The brand sells popular styles including sports bras and bralettes  bras without wires or cups   which can be readily found on its website  and has reduced its reliance on items like the push up bra  In November  the company also canceled the Victoria s Secret fashion show  Airing annually around the holidays on primetime TV  the show featured glamorous models wearing the company s lingerie and iconic angel wings  On the company s third quarter earnings call  Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Stuart Burgdoerfer said L Brands is  figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand  and that it is important to  evolve  the marketing of Victoria s Secret 
The message shoppers want to hear
L Brands may have to think quickly to move ahead of the competition  which already is pronouncing the message shoppers want to hear  Aerie  Harper Wilde  and ThirdLove all focus on the comfort theme that s so important to millennials  Inclusivity is another key point for shoppers  and these brands have a handle on that trendy term too  According to Accenture  42  of ethnic minority shoppers would switch to a retailer that puts a focus on inclusion and diversity  and 29  of all shoppers would likely switch to a retailer that reflects the importance they place on these elements 
Comfort and inclusivity are obvious as soon as a shopper visits the websites of Aerie  Harper Wilde  and ThirdLove  The brands inform customers that their bras are all about comfort  The Harper Wilde and ThirdLove websites offer a vast range of sizes and sizing information  ThirdLove even has a quiz to help the shopper find their size  and feature models with a natural look  wearing bras in neutral tones  Aerie uses words such as  empowerment  and  feeling good  
Though it seems L Brands recognizes the need to reposition Victoria s Secret  the concern is this  Can a brand with such a strong image linked to glamor and ostentation truly revamp to please a customer who is looking for just the opposite  Can shoppers imagine a Victoria s Secret without the vision of models with angel wings strutting down the runway popping into their minds 
For L Brands  the answer to those questions will be a determining factor for sales  earnings  and  therefore  stock performance  The company in the third quarter said sales at Victoria s Secret were at the low end of its expectations  and L Brands reported related impairment charges that resulted in a loss per share 
Even if L Brands is successful in its work on the Victoria s Secret brand  any positive impact on earnings appears to be quite a long way down the road  Though analysts expect a 12  upside in the shares after last year s 29  decline  and the price to earnings ratio of about 13 is far from the highs of more than 60 a decade ago  the difficulties at Victoria s Secret mean it s too early to look at this consumer discretionary stock s shares with much optimism ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfwwm,2055910

ULTA is typically a big mover on earning releases with an average move of 7 16  over the past 8 quarters  4 up  4 down   Zacks Consensus Estimates for the July Quarter reflect an EPS of  2 79 on revenues of  1 68 billion  which would represent year over year growth of 13 4  and 12 6  respectively 
Management sentiment and guidance drive ULTA on quarterly reports more than surprises on top or bottom line metrics 
The Business
Ulta Beauty is the largest beauty retailer in the United States  offering customers more than 25 000 products across roughly 500 brands  They are one of the only pure play beauty businesses in the retail space with no close publicly traded competitors 
As other retailers are closing their doors  Ulta has been able to expand its footprint  It s opened 99 stores or more annually for 7 consecutive years  increasing the number of stores by 2 6x since 2011 
The retail space has been closing stores at an exponential rate with more than 7000 announced to close in 2019  This is good news for Ulta who will be filling some of this brick and mortar retail void  expecting to open 70 80 new stores annually for the next  several years   Currently operating 1 196 stores  analysts are projecting this could hit 1 600 with the potential of expanding its operations internationally 
E Commerce Focus
Ulta has been able to pivot with the shifting retail industry  investing in its digital technology so that modern omnichannel consumer demands are met  Omnichannel customers spend almost 3 times more than store only customers  according to Ulta s latest annual report 
Their e commerce business has been the fastest growing channel  currently making up only 11  of revenues but expected to make up a more substantial portion of the business as Ulta continues to invest in its  digital innovation ecosystem   Ulta management is anticipating to grow its e commerce business by 20    30  for fiscal 2019 
At the end of the past year  Ulta acquired two tech start ups that focus on AI and augmented reality  This might sound like a strange move for a beauty retailer  but these acquisitions are going to improve their digital platform 
AI is projected to strengthen the firm s understanding of consumer patterns and personalize buyers  preferences  Augmented reality is becoming more widely used in digital retail  helping consumers try on products without leaving their homes  These should enhance Ulta s product offering and further advance their e com presence 
Outlook
Ulta Beauty is expected to see double digit top and bottom line growth for the next two years as this business continues to expand rapidly  Sell side analysts have been increasing full year EPS estimates for ULTA  and I believe that this will continue as the firm continues to over deliver  ULTA is currently sitting at a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
ULTA is currently trading at a forward PEG of 1 25x  significantly below its 5 year median and below the nonfood retail industries PEG of 1 82x  UTLA s forward P E tells a similar story  demonstrating very reasonable valuations  If Ulta s ostensible future growth can come to fruition the shares are a buy right now 

Comps
There are no publicly traded pure play beauty competitors for me to use as a direct comparison  L Brands   NYSE LB    which owns Victoria Secret and Bath   Body Works  has a similar customer base to ULTA but have not been able to achieve the same results  LB has lost 74  of its market value over the last 5 years  with losses exceeding 35  year to date  L Brands announced they would be closing another 53 Victoria Secret stores this year  following the 30 that were closed in 2018  This is a quintessential retailer that hasn t been able to adapt to the changing consumer 
Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU   also has a comparable consumer base to Ulta but has been following a very different narrative than L Brands  LULU is a prime example of retail gem and has shown investors over 50  returns since the beginning of 2019 
Take Away
Earnings after the bell tomorrow should prove to illustrate another robust quarter for Ulta as US retail sales remain strong in Q2  This stock has a ton of potential with its business model catering to all generations  Ulta s ability to evolve to millennial and now Gen Z consumer needs has given it the leverage to take control of the space domestically and potentially internationally 
Look for changes in management guidance moving forward as well as management sentiment in the earnings call  This would not be a bad stock to put a small position on before the release considering that the last two earnings have had a strong positive price action  If you are a risk averse investor wait till after the dust settles to get in

Sales were fueled by robust performance in three key categories  including body care  home fragrance and soaps   sanitizers  Per sources  the brand has also impressed customers by bringing in new products to the shelves such as bath bombs and face masks  among others Management expects Bath   Body Works brand to experience another solid year and remains committed to improve Victoria s Secret performance  Overall comps are likely to show improvement from the fourth quarter  Management expects overall comps to improve in the range of 1 4  during the final quarter  For fiscal 2019  the company anticipates comps to rise in low single digits Stocks to ConsiderBoot Barn Holdings   NYSE BOOT   has a long term earnings growth rate of 17  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Zumiez   NASDAQ ZUMZ   has a long term earnings growth rate of 13 5  and a Zacks Rank  1 Canada Goose Holdings   NYSE GOOS   has a long term earnings growth rate of 28 5  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8   five of our screens returned  38 0    61 3    61 6    68 1   and  98 3  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   2018  while the S P averaged  4 8  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  56 2  per year ",2019-09-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/l-brands-down-nearly-35-ytd-victorias-secret-remains-dull-200463065,200463065

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is L Brands due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  L Brands Q1 Earnings Top  Bath   Body Works Aid ResultsL Brands  Inc  reported better than expected first quarter results that also prompted management to lift the lower end of fiscal 2019 earnings view range  We note that impressive performance at Bath   Body Works brand aided the quarterly results  However  results remained dismal in the company s Victoria s Secret business  which has been battling competition and consumers  changing preferences for quite some time This specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel  beauty and personal care products now envisions fiscal 2019 earnings in the band of  2 30  2 60 compared with  2 20  2 60 previously anticipated  Management now projects second quarter earnings per share between 15 cents and 20 cents Detailed Quarterly DiscussionL Brands reported quarterly earnings of 14 cents a share that outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a break even figure  This was the sixth consecutive quarter that this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has registered positive earnings surprise  However  the bottom line declined 18  from the year ago period  We note that higher costs of goods sold  buying and occupancy  and increased interest expenses hurt the quarterly earnings Net sales came in at  2 628 8 million  up marginally from  2 625 8 million reported in the prior year period  The top line figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  2 557 million  However  comparable sales were flat compared with

single digits in the lingerie business  while the metric declined in the low double digit range at PINK  Victoria s Secret Beauty comps were about flat  Further  total digital sales registered an

improvement in comparable store sales Sales were fueled by robust performance in the three key categories  including body care  home fragrance and soaps   sanitizers  BBW direct channel remained sturdy  with sales up 40   Further  merchandise margin rose on the back of lower promotions We note that L Brands  International sales came in at  135 million  almost flat year over year  The increase in revenue and reduction in the China operating loss was offset by fall in partner businesses L Brands  gross profit fell 1  to roughly  934 million during the quarter  We note that gross margin contracted 40 bps to 35 5  on account of lower merchandise margin rate  which was partly mitigated by buying and occupancy expense leverage  Operating income declined to  153 3 million from  154 8 million in the year ago quarter  while operating margin shriveled 10 bps to 5 8  SG A expense fell 1  to  780 7 million  while as a percentage of net sales  the same leveraged by 30 bps due to fall in

Body Works stores were inaugurated and three were closed  which took the count to 1 732 stores  At the end of the quarter  the company operated 79 international stores  As of May 4  2019  L Brands

expenditures to be  575  600 million  It anticipates generating free cash flow of approximately  700 million during the same period GuidanceManagement expects Bath   Body Works brand to experience another solid year and remains committed to improve Victoria s Secret performance by staying customer focused  enriching assortments  and enhancing store and online experiences  At Bath   Body Works segment  management hinted at continuing its investment in the White Barn concept in 2019  The company has chalked out about 200 White Barn projects for 2019 L Brands expects second quarter comps to be about flat  Further  gross margin is expected to contract year over year owing to lower merchandise margin rate  SG A expense rate is anticipated to escalate on account of flat sales For fiscal 2019  the company anticipates comps to rise in low single digits  Gross margin rate is likely to decrease year over year primarily due to lower merchandise margins  SG A costs are expected to increase year over year  stemming from higher wage rate and expense associated to technology initiatives undertaken

219766,441282,LB,Ulta Beauty  A Diamond In The Retail Rough,opinion,"Ulta Beauty   NASDAQ ULTA   is another retail gem that has somehow defied the broader retail trend  Over the past decade  Ulta has grown its top line by more than 6 fold  and its bottom line has grown over 2400  in the same time frame  Over the past 10 years  the stock has surged 3845  beating every benchmark by an astronomical amount 
 
Ulta Beauty is the largest beauty retailer in the United States  offering customers more than 25 000 products across roughly 500 brands  They are one of the only pure play beauty businesses in the retail space with no close publicly traded competitors 
As other retailers are closing their doors  Ulta has been able to expand its footprint  They have opened 99 stores or more annually for 7 consecutive years  increasing the number of stores by 2 6x since 2011  The retail space has been closing stores at an exponential rate with more than 7000 announced to close in 2019  This is good news for Ulta who will be filling some of this brick and mortar retail void  expecting to open 70 80 new stores annual for the next  several years  
E Commerce Focus
Ulta has been able to pivot with the shifting retail industry  investing in its digital technology so that modern omnichannel consumer demands can be met  Omnichannel customers spend almost 3 times more than retail only customers  according to Ulta s latest annual report  Their e commerce business has been the fastest growing channel  currently making up only 11  of revenue but expected to make up a larger portion of the business as Ulta continues to invest in its  digital innovation ecosystem  
At the end of last year  Ulta acquired two tech start ups that focus on AI and augmented reality  This might sound like a strange move for a beauty retailer but these acquisitions are expected to improve their digital platform  AI is projected to strengthen the firm s understanding of consumer patterns and personalize buyers  preferences  Augmented reality is becoming more widely used in digital retail  helping consumers try on products without leaving their homes  These should enhance Ulta s omnichannel platforms and further advance their e com presence 
Outlook
Ulta Beauty is expected to see double digit top and bottom line growth for the next two years as this business continues to expand rapidly  Sell side analysts have been increasing full year EPS estimates for ULTA and I believe that this will continue as the firm continues to over deliver  ULTA is currently sitting at a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Be cautious with this stock considering its beta is very close to 1  meaning it is expected to follow the broader markets performance closely  Ulta Beauty is in the consumer discretionary space implying that the company does better when consumers have a larger disposable income  which will trace the US s economic performance 
ULTA is currently trading at a forward PEG of 1 35x  which is below its 5 year median and below the nonfood retail industries PEG of 1 84x  I use price to earnings to growth  PEG  for this firm s valuation because of how quickly it is expected to continue growing  It appears that ULTA is trading at a discount and could make a savvy buy if you believe the equity markets will continue the decade long bull rally 
 
Comps
As I mentioned earlier  there are no publicly traded pure play beauty competitors for me to use as a direct comparable  L Brands   NYSE LB    which owns Victoria Secret and Bath   Body Works  has a similar customer base to ULTA but have not been able to achieve the same results  LB has lost investors more than 44  over the last 5 years with losses exceeding 26  in just the last 52 weeks  They announced they will be closing 53 Victoria Secret stores this year  following the 30 that were closed in 2018  This is a quintessential retailer that hasn t been able to adapt to the changing consumer 
Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU   also has a comparable consumer base to Ulta but has been following a very different narrative than L Brands  LULU is a prime example of retail gem and has shown investors over 64  returns in the past 52 weeks  Analysts have continued to raise EPS estimates for the next couple years pushing this stock into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Earnings Preview
Ulta is releasing its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday and investors are expecting double digit growth figures  EPS estimates sit at  3 06 per share  representing a 23  increase from Q1 last year  ULTA has beaten EPS estimates over 92  of the time since 2012  with an average upside surprise of about 3   Revenue is expected to be  1 7 billion for Q1  which would illustrate over 14  growth from the same quarter last year 
Take Away
ULTA  closing today at  334 85  has shown investors 36 8  returns since the first of the year and is just 7  off its all time high of  359 69 that it hit at the end of April  I believe that this firm could bust through the  360 level to new highs if they can continue their prolific expansion and the equity market   economy don t fall apart  ULTA would make a good retail sector addition to your portfolio

219775,441291,LB,Analysts Estimate L Brands  LB  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects L Brands  NYSE LB  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 22  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of Victoria s Secret  Bath   Body Works and other chain stores is expected to post break even quarterly earnings per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  100  
Revenues are expected to be  2 56 billion  down 2 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 67  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for L Brands 
For L Brands  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that L Brands will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that L Brands would post earnings of  2 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 14  delivering a surprise of  3 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
L Brands doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-l-brands-lb-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200421705,200421705

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is L Brands due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  L Brands Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates  Sales in LineL Brands reported fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results  wherein top and bottom lines improved year over year and the latter marked its fifth consecutive quarter of positive surprise  However  results remained dismal in the company s Victoria s Secret business  which has long been battling competition and consumers  changing preferences In the quarter under review  L Brands  adjusted earnings came in at  2 14 per share  which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 07  Also  the bottom line improved 1 4  year over year  Solid performance by Bath   Body Works was the primary driving factor Net sales climbed marginally to  4 85 billion  The top line figure came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Furthermore  L Brands  total comparable sales climbed 3  in the quarter   Victoria s Secret sales dropped 5  to  2 532 million  Comparable sales fell 3   while comparable store sales  comps  tumbled 7   Comps remained flat in the lingerie business  whereas the same declined low double digits at PINK  On the brighter side  Victoria s Secret Beauty comps saw a mid single digit jump  Also  total digital sales registered an increase of 8  Management stated that Victoria s Secret results in this segment lagged expectations as comps declined and merchandise margins fell considerably in all core categories  The fall in margins stemmed from elevated promotions to boost traffic and clear inventories On the contrary  Bath   Body Works   BBW  delivered a solid show and surpassed management s expectations  Total sales here improved 9  to  1 951 million  with 12  rise in comparable sales and 8  growth in comparable store sales Sales were fuelled by robust improvements in the three key categories  including home fragrance  soap and body care  Notably  product acceptance for the Fall and Holiday season items aided results BBW direct channel remained sturdy  with sales up 30   Also  merchandise margin rose on the back of lower promotions We also note that L Brands  International sales rallied 12  in the fourth quarter to  190 7 million  courtesy of strength across both Victoria s Secret and BBW L Brands  adjusted gross profit dropped 3 6  to roughly  1 967 7 million  while the adjusted gross margin contracted 170 basis points  bps  to 40 6   Reduction in merchandise margin rate and higher occupancy costs led to gross margin decline Adjusted operating income declined from  986 6 million to  898 7 million  as strength in Bath and Body Works was more than offset by softness in Victoria s Secret  Adjusted operating margin collapsed 200 bps to 18 5  Store UpdateIn fiscal 2018  L Brands opened three Victoria s Secret stores and shuttered 30  taking the total count to 1 143  In the same period  55 Bath   Body Works stores were inaugurated and 28 were closed  which totaled to 1 721 stores At the end of fiscal 2018  this specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel had 79 international stores  The company sold its La Senza stores  United States and Canada  to an

Accessories and Bath   Body Works  respectively Other Financial DetailsL Brands exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  1 413 5 million  down from the prior year quarter s  1 514 9 million  Long term debt increased marginally to  5 739 4 million from nearly  5 707 million a year ago  Shareholders  deficit came in at  865 6 million For fiscal 2019  the company projects capital expenditures to be  575  600 million  It anticipates free cash flow of  700 million for the same period In fiscal 2018  L Brands repurchased 5 4 million shares for  196 1 million  As of Feb 2  2019  the company had shares worth  78 7 million remaining under its existing  250 million buyback plan GuidanceToward the end of fiscal 2018  management decided to shut its Henri Bendel business  sell off La Senza and reset its dividend  These actions are likely to help the company focus on the core areas with higher growth potential  In fiscal 2019  management intends to remain committed toward improving Victoria s Secret s performance by staying customer focused  enriching assortments  and enhancing store and online experiences Further  the company focuses on efficient management of costs  capital and inventory  Additionally  the company announced that it will stop reporting monthly sales and only report quarterly sales data  henceforth In fiscal 2019  sales are likely to be hurt by La Senza s sale and closure of Henri Bendel business  Moreover  soft merchandise margins are likely to hit gross margin rate All said  L Brands anticipates first quarter fiscal 2019 comps to fall low single digits  Total sales growth is expected to be roughly 1 point lower than comps  This can be accountable to La Senza s and Henri Bendel s loss  Further  gross margin is expected to contract year over year due to lower merchandise margins SG A costs are anticipated to escalate as a percentage of sales on account of lower sales  Earnings per share are envisioned to be breakeven in the first quarter compared with 17 cents recorded in the year ago period  This includes nearly 5 cents adverse impact from higher tax rate  Also  the earnings guidance for the first quarter falls way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents For fiscal 2019  the company anticipates comps to rise low single digits  Total sales growth is likely to lag comps by about 2 points due to the same factors impacting the first quarter sales  Gross margin rate is likely to decrease year over year  mainly due to lower merchandise margins  SG A costs are expected to increase year over year  stemming from higher wage rate and inflation related pressure Further  management envisions fiscal 2019 earnings per share to be  2 20  2 60  The guidance includes nearly 14 cents impact from greater tax rate  Moreover  earnings per share are envisioned to be breakeven in the first quarter

219791,441307,LB,Stocks   U S  Futures Drop as North Korea Talks Collapse  4Q GDP Ahead,news,"Investing com   U S  futures pointed to a lower open on Thursday as U S  President Donald Trump s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ended abruptly  while sentiment continued to suffer after downbeat comments on a potential trade deal with China from U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer 
The double blow came ahead of a delayed reading on the strength of the U S  economy  in the form of fourth quarter gross domestic product data at 8 30AM ET  13 30 GMT  
The blue chip Dow futures lost 51 points  or 0 19   to 24 957 5 points by 6 41 AM ET  11 41 GMT   the S P 500 futures fell 7 points  or 0 25   to 2 787 88 points  while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 28 points  or 0 39   to 7 094 0 points 
U S  President Donald Trump said that he had walked away from talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un because of unacceptable demands to lift U S  sanctions 
Trump insisted that good progress was made over denuclearization  but that the U S  could not lift all of the sanctions at the current juncture 
 Sometimes you have to walk  and this was just one of those times   Trump said  adding that  it was a friendly walk  
Markets had already turned more cautious after comments from USTR Lighthizer on Wednesday 
Lighthizer told a Congressional hearing on Wednesday that it was too early to predict an outcome to negotiations between Washington and Beijing over trade  dampening hopes for a quick and comprehensive deal 
Thursday s calendar also features data on weekly jobless claims as well as the Chicago PMI survey 
Among several appearances from Federal Reserve officials  investors will likely focus on remarks from the central bank s  chief Jerome Powell and vice chairman Richard Clarida

219794,441310,LB,Earnings Preview  L Brands  LB  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects L Brands  NYSE LB  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 27  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of Victoria s Secret  Bath   Body Works and other chain stores is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 07 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 9  
Revenues are expected to be  4 85 billion  up 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4 49  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for L Brands 
For L Brands  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 13  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that L Brands will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that L Brands would post earnings of  0 15 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 16  delivering a surprise of  6 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
L Brands doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-l-brands-lb-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200390210,200390210

over year and the latter marked its fifth consecutive quarter of positive surprise  However  results remained dismal in the company s Victoria s Secret business  which has long been battling competition and consumers  changing preferences In fiscal 2019  sales are likely to be hurt by La Senza s sale and closure of Henri Bendel business  Moreover  soft merchandise margins are likely to hit gross margin rate  These factors led to a not so impressive guidance  which seems to have hurt investors  confidence  Well  shares of the company lost 6 2  during the after market trading on Feb

Comparable sales fell 3   while comparable store sales  comps  tumbled 7   Comps remained flat in the lingerie business  whereas the same declined low double digits at PINK  On the brighter side  Victoria s Secret Beauty comps saw a mid single digit jump  Also  total digital sales registered an increase of 8  Management stated that Victoria s Secret results in this segment lagged expectations as comps declined and merchandise margins fell considerably in all core categories  The fall in margins stemmed from elevated promotions to boost traffic and clear inventories On the contrary  Bath   Body Works   BBW  delivered a solid show and surpassed management s expectations  Total sales here improved 9  to  1 951 million  with 12  rise in comparable sales and 8  growth in comparable store sales Sales were fuelled by robust improvements in the three key categories  including home fragrance  soap and body care  Notably  product acceptance for the Fall and Holiday season items aided results BBW direct channel remained sturdy  with sales up 30   Also  merchandise margin rose on the back of lower promotions We also note that L Brands  International sales rallied 12  in the fourth quarter to  190 7 million  courtesy of strength across both Victoria s Secret and BBW L Brands  adjusted gross profit dropped 3 6  to roughly  1 967 7 million  while the adjusted gross margin contracted 170 basis points  bps  to 40 6   Reduction in merchandise margin rate and higher occupancy costs led to gross margin decline Adjusted operating income declined from  986 6 million to  898 7

the company had shares worth  78 7 million remaining under its existing  250 million buyback plan GuidanceToward the end of fiscal 2018  management decided to shut its Henri Bendel business  sell off

Price and EPS Surprise

For L Brands  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
L Brands currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 91   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 27  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

219820,441336,LB,Chart Of The Day  Despite Recent Losses  Bulls Are Back For L Brands,opinion,"L Brands  NYSE LB   the company that owns such high profile global brands as Victoria s Secret and Bath   Body Works led yesterday s retail stock advance  gaining 6 74  after consumers descended on stores during Black Friday  This bullish move pushes back on bears who punished the stock after the company released Q3 2018 earnings on November 19  where it reported a decline in profits and announced it would cut its annual dividend 
In the two weeks since  shares of the company have lost a quarter of their value  falling from a high of  38 on November 12 to a low of  28 10 on November 21  off those losses  a full  6 was shaved off immediately after the Q3 report 
While its revenue increased 6  YoY to  2 78 billion  beating estimates by  10 million  its profits dropped  0 30 YoY  The retailer s Victoria s Secret and Pink stores lost market share to more modest brands  As well  the company had to resort to accounting gimmicks to show a boost in sales 
Technical analysis  however  tells another story 

Despite the  6 12  or 17 71  bloodbath the stock suffered on November 19  the price found support at its October low  propelling the price higher over the past three days so far  paring half of the previous dead drop 
Zooming out reveals that the pattern is being traded in an H S bottom  subject to an upside breakout of the neckline  where the previous highs meet  with precision at  38 14  Yesterday s jump climbed back above both the 50 DMA and the 100 DMA 
Also  the 50 DMA crossed above the 100 DMA  So  not only is the price doing better than these averages but the level over the last 50 days is better than that of the previous 100 days  Note how the 200 DMA  red  protects the neckline 
The positive divergence provided by the RSI is also notable  It rises from May September  while the price during the same period fell  A positive momentum price divergence occurs when the momentum climbs while the price descends  And since momentum leads price  it suggests the price will follow suit and head higher  Note the significance of the H S bottom as the 50 week MA guards its neckline 

Zooming out further reveals a staggering   72 60 plunge from the  98 68 peak made in November 2015 to the  26 08 low this past August  Since a pattern is judged within the context of the previous move and a bottom must follow a decline  it suggests that the more significant the preceding drop the potential rebound will be equally significant 
Case in point  the weekly RSI provides a double positive divergence with the price  The RSI rose from August 2017 to April 2018 and then again to August 2018  Conversely  the rate declined during both these periods 
Trading Strategies   Long Position Setup 
Conservative traders should wait for a 3 percent penetration of the neckline to filter out bull traps  Then they d wait for a likely return move to retest the upside of the neckline  with at least one long  green candle following a red or small candle of any color 
Moderate traders should wait for a minimum 2 percent penetration  then for the return move that may follow  Depending on risk aversion  they could enter a position close to the neckline s resistance to reduce exposure or wait for integrity confirmation  with at least one long  green candle engulfing a red or small candle of any color

219832,441348,LB,Are Investors Undervaluing L Brands  LB  Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Considering these trends  value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
One company value investors might notice is L Brands  NYSE LB   LB is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 14 38  which compares to its industry s average of 15 60  Over the last 12 months  LB s Forward P E has been as high as 19 91 and as low as 9 84  with a median of 12 45 
Investors should also note that LB holds a PEG ratio of 1 25  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  LB s industry currently sports an average PEG of 1 32  LB s PEG has been as high as 1 73 and as low as 0 86  with a median of 1 08  all within the past year 
Finally  investors should note that LB has a P CF ratio of 7 14  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 8 54  LB s P CF has been as high as 12 22 and as low as 5 07  with a median of 6 99  all within the past year

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 67   A quarter ago  it was expected that this owner of Victoria s Secret  Bath   Body Works and other chain stores would post earnings of  0 34 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 36  delivering a surprise of 5 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
L Brands  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry  posted revenues of  2 77 billion for the quarter ended October 2018  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to year ago revenues of  2 62 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
L Brands shares have lost about 41 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 3  
What s Next for L Brands 
While L Brands has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for L Brands was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

A long term underperformer  LB has shed more than 46  year to date  and touched a six year low of  30 42 on July 25  The stock recently rallied into overhead resistance at its 40 day moving average  which  according to data from Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  may indicate that it could be an attractive time to bet on LB s next leg lower 
Per White  L Brands shares are now within one standard deviation of their 40 day moving average  after a lengthy stretch below this trendline  There have been nine similar signals of this kind in the past three years  after which LB went on to average a one week loss of 1 28   with just 22  of those returns positive  One month later  the stock was lower more than half the time  down an average of 1 98  

Switching gears to LB s earnings history  the stock has closed lower the day after the company reported in four of the last eight quarters  including a 13 9  drop in early March  On average  the shares have moved 5 9  the day after earnings over this time frame  regardless of direction  This time around  however  the options market is pricing in a larger than usual 9 2  move for Thursday s trading 
Options traders have been anticipating a move to the upside  Data from the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  shows the the equity s 10 day call put volume ratio of 2 46 in the 93rd annual percentile  In other words  LB calls have been purchased over puts at a faster than usual clip in the past two weeks    though with a healthy 8 2  of the stock s float sold short  some of this could be due to hedging 
Regardless  L Brands stock has consistently rewarded premium buyers over the last year  per its elevated Schaeffer s Volatility Scorecard  SVS  reading of 93  out of 100   In other words  LB has tended to make outsized moves in the past 12 months  relative to what the options market was anticipating ",2018-08-22,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-retailer-could-drop-after-earnings-200339980,200339980

219936,441452,LB,Should Value Investors Consider L Brands  LB  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put L Brands  Inc    NYSE LB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  L Brands has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 18  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 39  If we focus on the long term PE trend  L Brands  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15 18 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs  indicating that it could be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Retail   Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 27 29  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should point out that L Brands has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 69  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  L Brands has a P S ratio of about 1 23  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  L Brands currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes L Brands a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though L Brands might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  CA  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives LB a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to seven lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight up and three down in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 8 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate inched higher by 0 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below L Brands  Inc  Price and Consensus    This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineL Brands is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 10  out of over 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks categorized Retail   Apparel Shoe industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Stocks to Ride a 588  Revenue ExplosionAt Zacks  we re mostly focused on short term profit cycles  but the hottest of all technology mega trends is starting to take hold   By last year  it was already generating  8 billion in

219964,441480,LB,Exclusive  Some charities to refuse money from U S  financier accused in sex case,news,"By David Ingram NEW YORK  Reuters    Some charities that have received money from U S  financier Jeffrey Epstein said they are reviewing their relationships with him or will decline to accept any future gifts from him in the wake of recent allegations he forced an underage girl to have sex with Britain s Prince Andrew and other powerful men  Epstein  62  who pleaded guilty in 2008 to procuring an underage girl for prostitution and served a year in a Florida jail  has long burnished his reputation as a philanthropist through a series of foundations that he says have given millions of dollars to institutions ranging from Harvard University to a New York junior tennis league  The allegations involving Epstein became a tabloid sensation on both sides of the Atlantic after lawyers for one of Epstein s accusers made them in a court filing just over a month ago  It prompted strong denials from Prince Andrew and from prominent U S  lawyer Alan Dershowitz  who was also accused of having sex with the girl  The filing has also renewed questions about Epstein s once close links to former U S  President Bill Clinton  though there are no allegations of any wrongdoing by Clinton   In interviews with Reuters  three recipients of Epstein s money said they would accept no more gifts  at least while the recent allegations are under review  They are a cancer researcher at New York City s Mount Sinai hospital who with colleagues received  50 000 in seed funding  a mentoring program for young Swedish businesswomen that got  30 000  and Ballet Palm Beach in Florida  which declined to say how much Epstein gave    The further I can keep myself from anything like that the better   Ballet Palm Beach founder Colleen Smith said in a phone interview  Epstein did not respond to interview requests  In response to two pages of written questions from Reuters  a lawyer for Epstein said the financier s philanthropy has been widespread for an extensive period of time   His efforts include making substantial contributions to scientific and medical progress and in helping children in providing them with the educational and technological tools necessary for their having a chance to succeed   the lawyer  Martin Weinberg  said in an emailed statement   It would be unfortunate if the recent media activity would in any way adversely impact Mr  Epstein s efforts in any of these areas   he added       DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE Well before Epstein went to jail  he saw philanthropy as a way to bring together people from different walks of life in settings ranging from his own mansions to academic conferences  friends said    His interest is in interesting people and interesting ideas   said Arizona State University physicist Lawrence Krauss  who directs a program on the origins of life that Epstein has supported  He said he would feel cowardly if he turned away from Epstein because of accusations Krauss knew nothing about  Epstein has touted his philanthropy through regular press releases  such as one in November that referred to him as  an unusual Harvard investor and private financier   According to publicly available tax records  Epstein has given money through at least three foundations  One of the three dissolved in 2012  and a second disbursed only  107 000 in a recent 12 month period  according to its tax return   For the third foundation  named the J  Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation Inc but also doing business as Enhanced Education  the most recent tax return Reuters could locate was from 2002  Epstein s primary residence is a private island off St  Thomas in the U S  Virgin Islands  Epstein s total donations are difficult to estimate because Reuters had access only to publicly available tax records for foundations where there was confirmation of a link to Epstein  In two cases  Epstein boasted about donations he never made  a major university said  In a July 2014 press release  Epstein claimed he provided  critical funding  for scientists at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to restore five Mark Rothko murals  and in a September 2014 press release  he said he gave money to the MIT Media Lab to teach toddlers computer programming   The Rothko press release  was simply not correct  and was issued without our knowledge or agreement   and the toddler press release was also  completely incorrect   said MIT Media Lab spokeswoman Alexandra Kahn in an email  A press release issued by the Harvard Art Museums on the Rothko project credited eight funding sources  none of them Epstein  An MIT press release on the toddlers credited five sources  and Epstein was not among them   Epstein did not respond to questions about the MIT programs         MILLIONS TO HARVARD The recipient of one of the largest donations from Epstein has been Harvard  to which Epstein pledged  30 million in 2003  according to news reports at the time  By 2006  when charges against Epstein were made public in Florida  he had fulfilled at least  6 5 million of that pledge  the reports said  Harvard s then president said he would not return the money because it was doing good for science   Harvard declined to comment to Reuters  citing donor privacy  Epstein s philanthropy website  jeffreyepstein org  had until recently listed about 20 charities he gave to last year  By last week  the page was no longer visible   Little is known publicly about how Epstein made his money  He has said that  after working at investment bank Bear Stearns beginning in the 1970s  he managed assets for billionaires such as Leslie Wexner  founder of Victoria s Secret parent L Brands Inc  The latest allegations against Epstein emerged on Dec  30 when lawyers said in a Florida federal court filing that Epstein trafficked a teenager for sexual purposes to prominent businessmen and public figures  The woman and other accusers are asking a judge to examine Epstein s 2008 plea agreement with the U S  Justice Department to see whether their rights as victims were violated       NOT GIVING IT BACK No group interviewed by Reuters said it would give back money  Doris Germain  an associate professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  said she could not return the money because it was spent more than a year ago on breast cancer research   I don t think I would accept money from him anymore  but then you sort of wonder   Germain said   We happen to know what he s done  but what about all the other people who are giving money to foundations  We don t know what they re doing  Is it all clean  I don t know   Epstein s money has been refused before  In 2006  Eliot Spitzer  a Democrat then running to become governor of New York  returned about  50 000 in campaign contributions  news reports said  Spitzer did not respond to a request for comment  In 2006  one of Epstein s three foundations gave  25 000 to Bill Clinton s foundation  according to tax records  Clinton s foundation did not respond to requests for comment  Epstein flew Clinton to Africa in 2002 to talk about anti poverty and anti AIDS programs  And according to flight records obtained by the website Gawker  the former U S  president traveled on Epstein s jet at least 10 other times between 2002 and 2003   Reuters was unable to independently confirm the flights  Clinton could not be reached for comment   At least two grant recipients in academia are standing by Epstein  saying he remains a friend  Krauss and Robert Trivers  a Rutgers University biologist  Trivers said Epstein is a person of integrity who should be given credit for serving time in prison and for settling civil lawsuits brought by women who said they were abused   Did he get an easy deal  Did he buy himself a light sentence  Well  yes  probably  compared to what you or I would get  but he did get locked up   Trivers said  He said he got about  40 000 from Epstein to study the relationship between knee symmetry and sprinting ability   Trivers also said he believes girls mature earlier than in the past   By the time they re 14 or 15  they re like grown women were 60 years ago  so I don t see these acts as so heinous   he said  Another recipient of Epstein s foundations  Ira Lamster  a former dean of the Columbia University dental school  said he has not asked Epstein for funding since getting  100 000 about three years ago to study the relationship between diabetes and oral health   
 Am I glad I didn t go back for additional funding   he said   I guess I am  but in my interactions with him  he was always a gentleman  ",2015-02-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-some-charities-to-refuse-money-from-u.s.-financier-accused-in-sex-case-326007,326007

220005,441521,LB,5 Retail Stocks Queuing Up For Q2 Earnings Beat  Add To Gain,opinion,"The spring season this year was disappointing as sales picked up late in June after witnessing colder than normal weather in April and May  Alas  this has weighed on the second quarter comparable sales  comps  performance of most retailers in April and May  while sales picked up in June as retailers posted better than expected comps 

Despite the odds  the future prospects of the retail sector look promising as it is positioned to gain from the improving U S  economy  which highlight a favorable job scenario and rising consumer spending  The third estimate for gross domestic product  GDP   released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  expanded at an annual rate of 1 1  in first quarter 2016  above the second estimate of 0 8  

We note that the U S  labor market looks quite stable  with unemployment rate for June making a comeback at 4 9   after falling to 4 7  in May  Also  U S  consumer spending rose for the second straight month in May  climbing 0 4  after a 1 1  gain in Apr 2016 that marked the strongest rise in seven years  This indicates that the U S  economy picked up in these two months after a slow start in first quarter 2016  The report further suggested that income rose 0 2  in May  following a 0 5  increase in April 

Further  as we look at the current retail activity  retailers are busy with the onset of another significant spending event in the U S    the Back to School and Back to College shopping season  This period generally extends from mid July through early September  with Labor Day usually serving as the symbolic beginning of the school year  This is a crucial time for retailers as American households stock up on school and college supplies 

Per a research conducted by National Retail Federation  NRF   total back to school and back to college spending for 2016 is expected to reach  75 8 billion  up from last year s  68 billion  This selling season represents nearly 17  of the full year retail sales in the U S  The key categories of sales during this season are apparel   accessories  books   music  computers   consumer electronics  office equipment   supplies  toys   hobbies and sporting goods  to name a few 

Now coming to the second earnings season  as we enter August only 43 2  of S P retail members have released their earnings numbers  meaning there is much more to come from the sector and the trend is actually not clear at this stage  The trend  so far  for the sector looks chic as total earnings are up 9 6  year over year  on 6  revenue growth  Also  the beat ratios are positive with 42 1  in earnings beat and 21 1  in revenue beat  making for a blended beat ratio of 5 3  

The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest   report published on Jul 29 

That said  we bring to you five retail stocks that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold    and a positive   Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   It makes sense to add these potential winners to your portfolio ahead of their releases  A rational investment can fetch higher returns on the heels of an earnings beat

220018,441534,LB,Is There An Upper Limit To Limited Brands Stock ,opinion,"Quality fashion is the key to L Brands Inc  NYSE LB  success  And maybe a little bit of old fashioned marketing  Oh and having Taylor Swift bring attention to one of your most popular brands might add a bit  The point is that Limited Brands  has locked up the demographics they are serving  Whether you like it or not teen and millenial girls cannot get enough of Victoria s Secret  Frankly as the father of a young girl I am not sure Victoria has any secrets left 
What interests me more is the chart of the stock price  It had a brief  pun intended  run higher to start the year before a double top action turned the price back lower  The market low on August 24th marked a bottom for Limited Brands as well and it has been moving higher since  In fact that day marked a terminal Price Bar at the Potential Reversal Zone of the bullish Shark harmonic 

I know  not your typical cocktail party market talk  What that means is a pattern played out and the reversal signal triggered  So far it has seen 13  upside  But are future returns limited  pun intended again   There are several pieces of data in the chart that suggest not 
The first is the Golden Cross  The opposite of the Death Crosses you have been reading about  this one is when the 50 day SMA crosses up through the 200 day SMA and is a broad scale bullish signal  Next  the target on the reversal from that Shark pattern looks for a retracement now of 61 8  of the pattern  or to 87 86  The wedge that has been building since early July looks likely to be tested again  and push over the top would look for a move to 95  Finally the momentum indicators are both rising and in the bullish zone  supporting more upside price action 
I cannot tell you how far this stock will go  but maybe the future has some of those Victoria s Secret Angel wings and is not limited

220019,441535,LB,Limited Brands Is Still Looking Good,opinion,"Three weeks ago I noted in Is there an upper limit to Limited Brands stock  that L Brands Inc  NYSE LB  was ready to move higher on the back of some Victoria Secret model wings  One week later it was up 9   That was some flight  But since then the stock has not moved much  staying in a tight range  Are those wings just too tired  Or was it just a fantasy  bra   In fact the picture looks even better now 
Here are 5 reasons why this stock may have a lot more left in the tank 

1  The consolidation resembles a bull flag   Measured off of the August 24 bottom  a projected move higher out of the current consolidation would target 109  The volume is falling off  typical to the end of a bull flag as well 
2  The reversal higher out of the bullish Shark harmonic has reached the 88 6  retracement of the pattern  Typically this move  above the 61 8  level would continue on to at least a full retracement at 95 83 
3  The Death Cross from July 29 is reversing  This measure of when the 50 day SMA crosses down through the 200 day SMA has math in its favor to reverse to a Golden Cross shortly  For the next 30 days  even a flat price would drop rising values from the 200 day SMA and falling values from the 50 day SMA  It would not be the first time Death Cross has marked a bottom 
4  Relative Strength  The sis up 9  since the August low while the S P 500  Russell 2000 and Nasdaq 100 are all quickly retracing to that low 
5  Momentum is still strong  The RSI is holding firmly in the bullish zone  and although the MACD is starting to roll over it is still strong positive  A reversal in price higher would reverse the MACD 
Of  course none of this means that Limited Brands will continue higher  But all of these indications followed by a a price trigger over 93 50 suggest owning the stock is the right course of action

220020,441536,LB,The Only Positive Sector In A Sea Of Red,opinion,"Year to date  the market has seen a lot of red  August and September  in particular  provided some dramatic swings 
But it hasn t been bad for one particular sector   
In this week s chart  we re looking at the performance of Consumer Discretionary stocks  As you can see  it s the only sector that locked in a positive return through the third quarter 
Why has Consumer Discretionary been the sole breadwinner  If you ve been paying attention to U S  economic data  this shouldn t come as a complete surprise  Throughout the last few months  U S  consumers have frequently been mentioned as a source of strength 
In a recent Investment U   Matthew Carr referred to the American consumer as  the most powerful force in the global economy   As buyers  we contribute more to global GDP than China 
Of course  just because this sector has performed well over the first nine months of 2015  that s no guarantee it will continue   
Or is there 
We re coming up on the biggest spending time of the year    the holiday shopping season  These are the pinnacle months for consumer spending 
Roughly 40  of all retailers  revenue is generated in the fourth quarter 
So  with the sector primed for takeoff  what s a good company to look at  How about L Brands  NYSE  N LB   the parent company of Victoria s Secret and Bath   Body Works   
It recently reported a better than expected comparable store sales increase of 9  for September  That s more than double expectations  With shares already up 11 8  YTD   and entering what Matt calls its  Prime Period  for sales   L Brands could easily continue higher 
But while Consumer Discretionary has performed well this year and continues to do so  you may be wondering what to expect from the rest of the market  If you read last week s article  you know that even after a dismal third quarter  the fourth quarter could be a record breaker 
So far   
The S P 500 is up 6 90 
Consumer Discretionary is up 6 73 
Healthcare is up 2 49 
Energy is up 11 78 
The Financials sector is up 5 38  
Granted  we re only a few weeks into the quarter  But it s already shaping up to be a strong end to the year  If you ve been sitting on the sidelines  waiting for an opportunity to dive back into the markets  this could be it 
And if you re still lacking the confidence  Well  perhaps all you need is a little coaching ",2015-10-25,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-only-positive-sector-in-a-sea-of-red-269136,269136

week  In addition to the figures on joblessness some of the most closely watched indicators markets will mull over monthly sales figures from retailers for the key holiday shopping month of December Major U S  stock exchanges closed Monday in observance of the New Year s holiday the day before  Heading the slate of economic indicators this week are nonfarm payrolls data and the latest unemployment rate from the U S  Department of Labor on Friday  The report will determine whether 2011 ends with continuing improvement in the job market  In the prior month  the U S  unemployment rate fell to 8 6   the lowest level since March 2009  Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires predict payrolls will rise by 155 000 but the unemployment rate  which is deter mined by a separate survey  will tick up to 8 7  The Institute for Supply Management releases data on manufacturing activity Tuesday and services Thursday  and the U S  Census Bureau s factory orders report comes Wednesday  U S  retailers will report December s same store sales results  the broadest indication yet of how the key holiday shopping season played out  Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect same store sales
