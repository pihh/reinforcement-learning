2721,224236,CPSS,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Consumer Portfolio Services,opinion,"Consumer Portfolio Services  Inc    NASDAQ CPSS   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for CPSS broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 3 1  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for CPSS stock 
If that wasn t enough  CPSS isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  1 estimate has been reduced  while none has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So  either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for CPSS  You can see

2780,224295,CPSS,Why MoneyGram Is Down Nearly 80  In A Year  What s Further ,opinion,"The stock of MoneyGram International  Inc    NASDAQ MGI   seems to have fallen out of favor with investors due to declining revenues  increasing competition  weak operating conditions in some of its markets and a high compliance cost In the recently reported fourth quarter  results were released only last week   this money transfer company s earnings of 1 cent per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 90   The bottom line also plunged 96  year over year  Deflating revenues were mainly responsible for the company s lackluster results Numerous headwinds plaguing the stock have dragged its value down by 79  compared with its  s decline of 14 5  What s Behind the Stock Slump MoneyGram s total revenues have been waning since 2015 through 2018  except in 2016   The top line has been impacted by increasing compliance controls and imposing limits on certain transactions  Also  the effect of tighter restrictions in corridors such as Nigeria and the United States induced the revenue decline  Moreover  the U S  to U S  market is a persistent challenge with an increasingly aggressive market pricing and a variety of new competitors Political unrest and economic weakness in parts of the Middle East and Africa  currency controls  constraints in certain key markets might keep the company s revenues under pressure in the coming quarters  For 2019  revenues are expected to further subside approximately 2 4  on constant currency basis MoneyGram also faces compliance risks associated with regulations governing its business and cost structure across numerous jurisdictions worldwide  From 2014 to 2017  the company incurred nearly  39 million  on average  in its compliance enhancement program  In 2018  the company further incurred  12 9 million  up 34  year over year toward compliance enhancement program  High compliance requirements have suffered loss of agents and customers  Plus  these expenses weigh on the company s margins MoneyGram s high leverage also concerns investors  Its net debt to capital ratio is 107  compared with the industry average of 32   This high leverage is not favorable  especially at the time when the company s revenues remain stressed  Also  the company s interest coverage ratio of  0 51 times compared with the industry average of 6 13 times is very poor  implying that its earnings are not sufficient to cover interest obligations  raising worries of default on interest payments And all this boils down to dismal return on equity  ROE   the most widely used measure for a company s profitability  MoneyGram s trailing 12 month ROE of a negative 7 1  compares unfavorably with 22  ROE for the industry  This simply reflects the company s inefficiency in utilizing shareholders  funds Moreover  for 2019  the company is projecting revenues to dip approximately 2 4  and adjusted EBITDA to drop approximately 8 12   both on constant currency basis  This tepid guidance raises investors  woes What Lies Ahead Though regaining the stock value seems like a tough call right now but the company has taken certain initiatives  which might help the stock rebound in the coming quarters These growth initiatives are Growth of Digital Payment Platform  Revenues from the company s digital platform have been rising consistently since 2013 through 2018  Its investment in innovative products and services  particularly Digital Self Service solutions such as moneygram com  mobile solutions  account deposit and kiosk based services help enhance revenue growth and diversify its product offerings   The company is also working on improving its mobile app and many corresponding programs  a combination  which will enhance its digital capabilities  These investments will make the company a digitally enabled customer centric organization  thus enabling it to compete efficiently with numerous fintech companies thronging the money transfer industry Use of Cryptocurrency  MoneyGram has partnered with Ripple  which will allow it to use the latter s digital currency named XRP in its internal payments process  The use of cryptocurrency will expedite the company s remittance settlement time and lower money transfer costs  Also  the deal will ramp up MoneyGram s global treasury operations and improve customer services Growth Initiatives  During the first quarter of 2018  MoneyGram undertook business restructuring and reorganization program as part of its Digital Transformation initiative  To this end  it incurred  20 million of expenses in 2018  The program is expected to cost an additional  2 5  5 5 million  which is expected to be completed by 2019  The company saved  30 5 million of expenses in 2018 and another  55 million is anticipated on an annualized basis upon completion  We believe  the company s restructuring efforts will aid its margins in the long run The stock has also staged a comeback post fourth quarter earnings release and has even gained 3  ever since compared with the industry s rise of 1 5   The company s disclosure about its cost savings program and digital expansion along with other measures to achieve revenue growth must have favored the stock  These endeavors when reflected in future earnings numbers will surely enable the stock to recover in the quarters ahead

2781,224296,CPSS,Is Market Pricey  5 Cheap Stocks With Solid Estimate Revisions,opinion,"U S  markets have seen a great start to 2019  thanks to a dovish Fed and U S  China trade optimism  The S P 500 has recovered sharply this year from the Christmas lull and has touched 2 800 for the first time in nearly four months  The index also recorded its s  And the Dow Jones hit its 26 000 mark in late February for the first time since Nov 9 
The S P 500 returned 3 0  in February on top of 7 9  in January  This helps the key equity gauge to log the fifth largest gain to start a year in the history of the S P 500 and the best start since 1987 
Are Stocks Overvalued  
After the astounding gains  thoughts of a correction in the market or overvaluation concerns are justified  This is especially true given that stocks  pricier in the last two months while  
Analysts  earnings estimates for Q1 and Q2 of 2019 are declining  The consensus estimate for  earnings is now likely to decline 2 7  for Q1  and rise just 0 7  for the June quarter   representing a downward swing of 4 2 points in the outlook since the start of the year      
Analysts are deducing operating EPS  which is normally around 15  lower than the GAAP  The blend of declining earnings projections and the S P s two month jump has boosted the forward P E from 15 1x at the start of the year to 17 7x right now   
Meanwhile  global growth worries remain rife  Most of the developed economies  especially in Europe and some emerging economies  have been suffering from a slowdown  Though there were signs of improvement in 2018  U S  China trade tensions are not resolved yet  Even if the duo manages to strike a deal  the hope is currently priced in at the current level that any real deal appears a  sell the news  opportunity for investors right now 
How About Low P E Stocks With PositiveEarnings Revisions 
Having said this  we would like to note that the Fed is acting dovish and this should give some warmth to equity investing in the near term  Investors can thus definitely tap for stocks that have lower forward P E than the S P 500  17 7x  and have witnessed an uptick in EPS growth estimates for the current year in the last 30 days  These stocks boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy
