4360,225875,BMS,Why Bemis  BMS  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Bemis in Focus
Bemis  BMS  is headquartered in Neenah  and is in the Industrial Products sector  The stock has seen a price change of 19 5  since the start of the year  The packaging company is paying out a dividend of  0 32 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 33  compared to the Containers   Paper and Packaging industry s yield of 2 44  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 28 is up 3 2  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Bemis has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 3 38   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Bemis s payout ratio is 44   which means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  BMS expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  2 99 per share  with earnings expected to increase 7 17  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  BMS is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-03-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-bemis-bms-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200401453,200401453

4362,225877,BMS,GPK Vs  BMS  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Containers   Paper and Packaging sector have probably already heard of Graphic Packaging  GPK  and Bemis  BMS   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Graphic Packaging has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Bemis has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  right now  This means that GPK s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
GPK currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 94  while BMS has a forward P E of 18 59  We also note that GPK has a PEG ratio of 1 15  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  BMS currently has a PEG ratio of 2 54

4365,225880,BMS,Bemis  BMS  To Report Q1 Results  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Bemis  BMS  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 billion  down 2 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bemis 
For Bemis  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bemis will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bemis would post earnings of  0 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 71  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Bemis doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bemis-bms-to-report-q1-results-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200408456,200408456
4366,225881,BMS,Containers   Paper   Packaging Industry s Near Term Outlook Grim ,opinion,The Zacks   industry primarily includes companies which manufacture paper and plastic based packaging products utilized within consumer and industrial end markets  Their products range from containerboard and corrugated packaging to flexible and rigid plastic packaging The industry participants serve a wide array of markets including food  beverage  foodservice and other consumer products like beauty  personal care and home care  The industry also serves the chemical  agribusiness  medical  pharmaceutical  electronics and industrial markets Let us take a look at the three major themes currently governing the industry  Demand in the Containers   Paper And Packaging industry is usually fairly stable across economic cycles  due to its high exposure  more than 60   to steady consumer oriented end markets  such as food and beverages and healthcare as they include essentials used in day to day lives  Favorable consumer spending  strong labor market  rising government expenditures instill further optimism  Moreover  rapid urbanization and rising purchasing power in Asia  particularly China  India  and Southeast Asia will sustain demand for packaging going forward  Additionally  demand for sophisticated packaging is on the rise and the industry is constantly striving to meet this by adopting new technology and innovative products  It is also likely to gain from capitalizing on growing global demand for eco friendly biodegradable packaging materials spurred by environmental concerns  The evolution of e commerce has significantly impacted demand in the industry  Notably  packaging has been gaining importance over the years as it not only has to maintain the safety of the product but also be durable enough to withstand the complex automated and manual supply chains involved in delivering the product  According to   global retail e commerce sales are anticipated to grow to  4 88 trillion in from  2 3 trillion in 2017  In developed markets  e commerce has become second nature for consumers  while developing countries are catching up  India is one of the fastest growing e commerce markets and according to the   it is expected to reach  120 billion by 2020 from  39 million in 2017  Apart from high raw material costs  the industry has been bearing the brunt of rising transportation costs  chemical costs and fuel costs  Consequently  the companies have to pass on as much of the raw material price inflation as possible to customers  However  it might not always be feasible to pass on the price increase to customers  Consequently  the companies are now focusing on reducing costs  improving productivity and in turn increasing profitability  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dismal ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates gloomy prospects in the near term  The Containers   Paper And Packaging industry  which is a nine stock group within the broader Zacks   sector  carries a Zacks Industry Rank  171  which places it at the bottom 33  of 256 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Over a year s time  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 5  Despite the bleak near term prospects of the industry  we will present a few Containers   Paper And Packaging stocks that can be retained in one s portfolio given their prospects in the long haul  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current

4380,225895,BMS,What Makes Bemis  BMS  A New Strong Buy Stock,opinion,"Bemis  BMS  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Bemis basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Bemis  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Bemis
For the fiscal year ending December 2018  this packaging company is expected to earn  2 79 per share  which is a change of 16 7  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Bemis  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Bemis to a Zacks Rank  1 positions it in the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-bemis-bms-a-new-strong-buy-stock-200381143,200381143

4414,225929,BMS,Bemis  BMS  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Bemis  BMS  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 71 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 7  
Revenues are expected to be  980 94 million  down 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bemis 
For Bemis  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bemis will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bemis would post earnings of  0 78 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 77  delivering a surprise of  1 28  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Bemis doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bemis-bms-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200378954,200378954

4425,225940,BMS,Containers   Paper   Packaging Outlook  Encouraging Prospects,opinion,The Zacks  industry primarily includes companies which manufacture paper and plastic based packaging products utilized within consumer and industrial end markets  Their products range includes containerboard and corrugated packaging  flexible  and rigid plastic packaging  among others  The industry caters to a wide variety of markets including food  beverage  foodservice and other consumer products like beauty  personal care  home care  to name a few  The industry also serves the chemical  agribusiness  medical  pharmaceutical  electronics and industrial markets  Let us take a look at the three major themes currently governing the industry Demand in the Containers   Paper And Packaging industry is usually fairly stable across economic cycles  due to its high exposure  more than 60   to stable consumer oriented end markets  such as food and beverages and healthcare as they include essentials used in day to day lives  Favorable consumer spending  a strong labor market  rising government expenditures and increased consumer confidence instill optimism  Further  rapid urbanization and rising purchasing power in Asia  particularly China  India  and Southeast Asia will sustain demand for packaging going forward  Demand for sophisticated packaging for several consumer goods and products is on the rise and the industry is constantly striving to meet this by adopting new technology and innovative products  It is also likely to gain from capitalizing on growing global demand for eco friendly biodegradable packaging materials spurred by environmental concerns  The evolution of e commerce has significantly impacted demand in the industry with every passing year  Packaging has gained utmost importance as it not only has to maintain the safety of the product but also be durable enough to withstand the complex automated and manual supply chains involved in delivering the product  According to   global retail e commerce sales amounted to  2 3 trillion in 2017 and likely to grow to  4 88 trillion in 2021  In developed markets  e commerce has become second nature for consumers  while developing countries are catching up now  India is one of the fastest growing e commerce markets and according to the   the India e commerce market is expected to reach  200 billion by 2026 from  39 million in 2017  India is expected to surpass the United States to become the second largest e commerce market in the world by 2034  driven by ongoing digital transformation in the country  Among others  South East Asia and Latin America are also picking up pace  Apart from high raw material costs  the industry has been affected by rising transportation costs  chemical costs and fuel costs lately  Thus  the companies have to pass through as much of the raw material price inflation as possible to customers  However  it might not always be feasible to pass on the price increase to customers  Consequently  the companies are now focusing on reducing costs  improving productivity and in turn increasing profitability Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Containers   Paper And Packaging industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  37  which places it at the top 15  of more than 250 Zacks industries  The group s Zacks   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates continued outperformance in the near term  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1  Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry s rank has entered the top half after languishing in the bottom half for the past six weeks    The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of solid earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  In the past year  the industry s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised upward by 5   Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture  Industry Outperforms Sector but Lags S P 500 The Containers   Paper And Packaging industry has outperformed its own sector over the past year  However  it has underperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite over the same time frame  Over this period  the industry has fallen 21 6  compared with the sector s decline of 23 9   Meanwhile  the Zacks S P 500 composite has declined 7 6   One Year Price Performance  Containers   Paper And Packaging Industry s Valuation  On the basis of forward 12 month EV EBITDA ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Containers   Paper And Packaging companies  we see that the industry is currently trading at 9 1 compared with the S P 500 s 9 8x and the Industrial Products sector s forward 12 month EV EBITDA of 10 9  This is shown in the charts below  Enterprise Value EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio  F12M  Enterprise Value EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio  F12M   Over the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 12 7x to as low as 9 0x  recording the median of 10 8x  Bottom Line The Containers   Paper And Packaging industry will be supported by continued demand growth  backed by new technology and innovative products  The industry is not only focused on containing and protecting the product but is now also providing sustainable packaging solutions to cater to increasing consumer awareness on environmental issues  Consequently  industry players will benefit from focus on maintaining quality of the package  conforming to industry standards and ability to minimize carbon footprint  Further  the boom in e commerce will sustain demand in years to come  However  higher costs from rising fuel and freight charges  and volatile raw material may weigh on the near term prospects of the industry  We are presenting

4428,225943,BMS,BMS Vs  ATR  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Containers   Paper and Packaging sector might want to consider either Bemis  BMS  or AptarGroup  ATR   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Bemis and AptarGroup are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  4  Sell   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that BMS has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use

projected to be up roughly 16 7  versus the industry s increase of 9 9   Solid Business Opportunities  Berry Global primarily serves customers in the healthcare  beverage  food and personal care markets through its three operating segments   Engineered Materials  Health  Hygiene   Specialties  and Consumer Packaging  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  revenues generated from the Consumer Packaging segment increased 8 2  year over year and that for the Health  Hygiene   Specialties segment expanded 21 5   These positives were partially offset by slight 0 6  fall in revenues in the Engineered Materials segment As noted by Berry Global  the Consumer Packaging segment will gain from innovative products and packaging solutions in the quarters ahead  Conversely  investments in hygiene products in China will be advantageous for the Health  Hygiene   Specialties segment while solid product line  advanced technology  initiatives to expand businesses and rising importance of e commerce business will benefit the Engineered Materials segment Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  568 million for the Consumer Packaging segment   688 million for

Products   part of the Health  Hygiene   Specialties segment   is predicted to yield  40 million in cost synergies  Half of the estimated benefits are predicted to be realized in fiscal 2019  Alternatively  Laddawn assets   part of the Engineered Materials segment   will boost Berry Global s business in the core films market and generate roughly  5 million of cost synergies It is worth mentioning here that Berry Global used  702 million for making acquisitions  net of cash acquired  in fiscal 2018  Further  buyouts added 9  to sales growth in the fiscal year Capital Allocation Strategy  Berry Global effectively uses its capital on organic growth  acquisitions  share buybacks  repaying debts and cost reduction initiatives  In fiscal 2018  the company used  335 million for reducing its debts and  33 million for repurchasing shares  It is worth noting here that a share buyback program of  500 million was announced in August 2018 Berry Global anticipates cash flow from

Bemis Company  Inc    NYSE BMS    Sealed Air Corp    NYSE SEE   and UFP Technologies  Inc    NASDAQ UFPT   Industry  PackagingLink  Paper   Plastic Packaging Set to Grow  3 Top PicksThe Zacks  industry is likely to continue on growth trajectory on the back of favorable consumer spending  strong labor market  rising government expenditures and increased consumer confidence  Further  rapid urbanization and rising purchasing power in Asia  particularly China  India  and Southeast Asia will sustain demand for packaging going forward Consumer End Markets  Innovation to Sustain GrowthThe industry includes companies which manufacture paper and plastic based packaging products  It caters to a wide variety of markets including food  beverage  foodservice  consumer products  chemical  agribusiness  medical  pharmaceutical  electronics and industrial markets  Notably  demand in the Containers   Paper And Packaging industry is usually fairly stable across economic cycles  owing to its high exposure  more than 60   to stable consumer oriented end markets  such as food and beverages and healthcare as they include essentials utilized in day to day lives  This ensures stability  steady growth and earnings for the industry  Demand for sophisticated packaging for several consumer goods and products is on the rise and the industry is constantly striving to meet this by adopting new technology and innovative products  It is also likely to gain from capitalizing on growing global demand for eco friendly biodegradable packaging materials spurred by environmental concerns  Nowadays  packaging is not only containing and protecting the product but also includes sustainable packaging solutions to cater to increasing consumer awareness on environmental issues  Consequently  industry players will benefit from focus on maintaining quality of the package  conforming to industry standards and ability to minimize carbon footprint E commerce Boom to Spur Packaging DemandThe evolution of e commerce has significantly impacted demand in the industry with each passing year  Packaging has gained utmost importance as it not only has to maintain the safety of the product but also be durable enough to withstand the complex automated and manual supply chains involved in delivering the product  According to   global retail e commerce sales amounted to  2 3 trillion in 2017 and likely to grow to  4 88 trillion in 2021  In developed markets  e commerce has become second nature for consumers  while developing countries are catching up now  India is one of the fastest growing e commerce markets  In fact  according to the   the India e commerce market is expected to reach  200 billion by 2026 from  39 million in 2017  India is anticipated to surpass the United States to become the second largest e commerce market globally by 2034  driven by ongoing digital transformation in the country  Among others  South East Asia and Latin America are also picking up pace Cost Inflation Remains a ConcernApart from high raw material costs  the industry has been affected by rising transportation costs  chemical costs and fuel costs lately  Thus  the companies have to pass along as much of the raw material price inflation as possible to customers  However  it might not always be feasible to pass on the price increase to customers  Consequently  the companies are now focusing on reducing costs  improving productivity and in turn increasing profitability Industry Valuation is InexpensiveThe Containers   Paper And Packaging industry is housed within the broader

Over the last year  the Containers   Paper And Packaging industry has fallen 17 6  compared with the sector s decline of 22 2   Meanwhile  the Zacks S P 500 composite has declined 6 8  However  the valuation looks really cheap now  One might get a good sense of the industry s relative valuation by looking at its Enterprise Value to Earnings before Interest Depreciation and Amortization  EV EBITDA   which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Containers   Paper And Packaging stocks  On the basis of forward 12 month EV EBITDA ratio  we see that the industry is currently trading at 9 1

4445,225960,BMS,This Is Why Bemis  BMS  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Bemis in Focus
Based in Neenah  Bemis  BMS  is in the Industrial Products sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 15 56   The packaging company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 32 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 41   This compares to the Containers   Paper and Packaging industry s yield of 2 46  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 28 is up 3 2  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Bemis has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 3 38   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Bemis s current payout ratio is 44   meaning it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
BMS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  2 99 per share  with earnings expected to increase 7 17  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  BMS is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-03-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-bemis-bms-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200396566,200396566

4451,225966,BMS,Is Bemis Company  BMS  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Bemis Company  Inc    NYSE BMS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Bemis Company has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Bemis Company s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Bemis Company has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Bemis Company stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Bemis Company has a P S ratio of about 1  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  BMS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Bemis Company currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Bemis Company a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Bemis Company might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D  This gives BMS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen no upward or downward in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action  for the stock in the chart below Bemis Company  Inc  Price and Consensus     This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBemis Company is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 27  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall   So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020

4479,225994,BMS,Bemis  BMS  Gains On Reports Of Amcor s Acquisition Bid,opinion,Per a Bloomberg report  packaging products maker Bemis Company Inc    NYSE BMS   is the takeover target of Australian company  Amcor Limited  Following the report  Bemis  shares surged 10  to close at  46 90 on Sep 7  Amcor is working with advisers in order to prepare a bid for Neenah  WI based Bemis  which has a current market capitalization of  4 47 billion  The company offers multilayer polymer  blown and cast film structures as well as injection molded plastic and folding carton packaging products  Its products are utilized in producing packaging for food  medical  pharmaceutical  personal care  electronics  and industrial applications  It sells its products through direct sales force in North America  Latin America  Europe  and Asia Pacific  Is Bemis Worth a Takeover Bid  Bemis s recent results were nothing to write home about  In the first half of 2017  the company s earnings declined 17   In both the quarters of 2017  Bemis  earnings failed to match the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In the trailing four quarters  the company has posted a negative average earnings surprise of 5 89   During second quarter conference call  Bemis lowered 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to  2 35  2 50 from the prior range of  2 50  2 60  citing the impact of sharp contraction and tough economic environment in Brazil  The mid point of the guidance reflects a year over year decline of 10   The estimates for third quarter 2017  fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018  have moved south in the past 30 days  reflecting the negative outlook of analysts  For the third quarter  the estimate has gone down 11  to 64 cents per share  For fiscal 2017  the estimate has dipped 6  to  2 40 in the past 30 days  For fiscal 2018  the estimate has gone down 6  to  2 67 per share During March  certain of Bemis  large U S  core consumer packaged goods customers lowered volume projections for the balance of 2017  These lower volumes  along with the operational inefficiencies associated with the lower volumes  will impact Bemis  sales and earnings for 2017  Further  the political instability and challenging economic environment in Brazil continues to impact business  In June  Bemis announced details about its restructuring and cost savings plan to improve profitability  primarily in the U S  and Latin American businesses by reducing manufacturing and administrative cost structure  These efforts are likely to generate total cost savings of  55  60 million  with savings starting in 2017 and fully realized during 2019  In the past year  its shares have declined 4 5  in contrast with 9 3  rise recorded by the industry  The company continues to bear the brunt of a flat to declining U S  packaged food market  In eight of the past nine years  volumes in the core flexible packaging business have been flat to down as Bemis continues to struggle within a complex supply chain  The stock price underperformance could make shareholders welcome an offer by Amcor  Bemis is currently trading at a forward 12 month Enterprise Value  EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio of 10 3 while the industry s 12 month forward EV EBITDA ratio is pegged higher at 12 4  This implies that the stock is cheap at current levels  Manifold Benefits to Amcor Amcor Limited provides packaging solutions in Western Europe  North America  Australia  New Zealand  and internationally  The company manufactures rigid plastic containers for a range of beverage and food products  It also manufactures flexible and film packaging for the food and beverage industry as well as pet food packaging  and medical and pharmaceutical  fresh produce  and snack food segments  The company also offers flexible packaging for specialty folding cartons for tobacco packaging and other industries  and packaging solutions for home and personal care products  If the takeover happens  it  would make Amcor the world s fourth biggest packaging company surpassing can maker Ball Corporation   NYSE BLL   but behind big three paper and pulp businesses   International Paper Company   NYSE IP    WestRock Company and Oji Holdings Corporation  The transaction would be in sync with the Amcor s long endeavor to shift from metal and glass to plastics  Further  Bemis would increase exposure to the Americas from around a third of revenues to more than half   Bemis currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   A better ranked stocks in the same space includes  Avery Dennison Corporation   NYSE AVY   which flaunts a Zacks Rank  1

4480,225995,BMS,Should Value Investors Pick Bemis Company  BMS  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Bemis Company  Inc    NYSE BMS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Bemis Company has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 8  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Bemis Company s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 17 9  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Bemis Company has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 19 7  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Bemis Company has a P S ratio of about 1 1  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Bemis Company currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BMS a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 4  which is marginally better than the industry average of 10 5  Clearly  BMS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Bemis Company might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F  This gives BMS a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen five estimates go lower in the past sixty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen six downward and no upward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined about 1 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Bemis Company  Inc  Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBemis Company is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a good industry rank  top 19  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump Policies If the

4488,226003,BMS,AptarGroup Or Bemis  Which Stock To Buy Ahead Of Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"The global packaging industry has been growing driven by increasing urbanisation  development of retail chains along with the mushrooming healthcare and cosmetics sectors  An increase in living standards and personal disposable income in the developing economies triggers consumption across a broad range of products that eventually leads to growth in demand for the packaging of these goods Consequently  customer convenience remains the top priority for the packaging companies and they remain constantly focused on evolving new packaging designs  These companies are focused on expanding geographic reach and realigning product offerings to reduce operational costs 
At present  the market is witnessing intense restructuring and consolidation because of the overcapacity  The preference for value added services and customized packaging solutions to provide convenience  safety  durability as well as freshness protection will continue to boost the industry going forward The Zacks categorized  sub industry has thus outperformed the S P 500 on a year to date basis  The industry has gained 12 1  while the S P 500 clocked a rise of 9 3   We note that the industry is also favorably placed as it occupies a space in the top 25  of the Zacks classified industries  65 out of the 256  The sub industry falls under the  sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  which put up a 28 5  growth in earnings in first quarter 2017  None of the S P participants in the sector have released earnings results yet  For the sector  an 11 9  growth in earnings is projected for second quarter 2017  This makes the Industrial Products sector one of the five sectors projected to log a double digit growth this earnings season   Read more   Consequently  investing in the packaging space is a prudent move  Further  given that the curtains on second quarter earnings are about to rise  it will be wise to zero in on stocks that are expected to perform well this earnings season  With packaging stocks  AptarGroup  Inc    NYSE ATR   and Bemis Company  Inc    NYSE BMS   both scheduled to report on Jul 27  this may be a good time to analyze which is the better stock to hold at this moment Rank ComparisonAptarGroup carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  while Bemis has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

This is a signal of inefficiency  and implies either poor sales or excess inventory  Though both the companies have inventory turnover ratio lower than the industry level  Bemis scores a little better on this front Return on Assets  ROA Our research shows that the average one year trailing 12 month ROA for AptarGroup is pegged at 7 86   higher than the 6 78  for Bemis and 5 92  for the Containers Paper Plastic sub industry Dividend YieldBemis  dividend yield over the last one year period is 2 59   higher than the sub industry s figure of 1 80   With a dividend yield of 1 44   AptarGroup s shareholders earn significantly lower dividend yield than Bemis as well as the industry at large Net Margins
In the past 12 months  AptarGroup s net margin has been 8 75   much ahead of the industry average of 6 26  and Bemis  6 31   Thus  AptarGroup is a better bet on this front 
Earnings History and ESPConsidering earnings surprise history trend  AptarGroup has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1 78  in the last four quarters  Bemis clearly loses on this front as it has a negative earnings surprise of 1 93  in the trailing four quarters AptarGroup is expected to post an earnings beat in the next quarter  This is because the company has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive   the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   The combination of AptarGroup s Earnings ESP of  1 04  and a Zacks Rank  2 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat Meanwhile  Bemis  Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with ESP of  1 75   makes surprise prediction difficult for this quarter Estimate Revisions  Growth ProjectionsFor Bemis  estimates for the second quarter and fiscal 2017 have tanked 20  and 11   respectively  in the last 90 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter projects a year over year decline of 15 14  and for fiscal 2017 predicts a year over year fall of 5 10  AptarGroup s estimates have moved up 4  for the second quarter and 5  for fiscal 2017  in the past 90 days  reflecting investors  optimism in the stock  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter projects a year over year growth of 5 18  and for fiscal 2017 predicts a year over year growth of 10 13  AptarGroup is the clear winner of this round 
ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Bemis holds an edge over AptarGroup when considering valuation  dividend yield and inventory turnover  However  AptarGroup is superior when considering price performance  margins  earnings revisions  positive growth projections and chances of an earning beat in the next quarter  Clearly  AptarGroup is a better bet this earnings More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ",2017-07-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aptargroup-or-bemis:-which-stock-to-buy-ahead-of-q2-earnings-200201033,200201033

4542,226057,BMS,Bemis  Attractive Value  Yield And Growth ,opinion,Bemis Co Inc  BMS  has achieved a moderate record of long term earnings growth in a semi cyclical fashion  However  even though earnings growth had faltered slightly during our last two recessions  the company remained highly profitable  We believe the company appears reasonably valued at its current quotation    Dividend Champion   Bemis Co Inc     This article looks at Bemis Co Inc  a Dividend Champion  through the lens of the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool  Since a picture is worth a thousand words  the reader will be provided the  essential fundamentals at a glance  expressed vividly in pictures     A Dividend Champion is defined as a company that has increased its dividend every year for 25 or more straight years  Bemis Co Inc is a dividend champion that has raised its dividend every year for 29 consecutive years  The complete Dividend Champions list is compiled    Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Champions list    Bemis Company  Inc  is a major supplier of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials used by leading food  consumer products  healthcare  and other companies worldwide  Founded in 1858  the Company is included in the S P 500 index of stocks and reported 2011 net sales of  5 3 billion  The Company s flexible packaging business has a strong technical base in polymer chemistry  film extrusion  coating and laminating  printing  and converting  Headquartered in Neenah  Wisconsin  Bemis employs approximately 20 000 individuals worldwide     Bemis Co Inc  A Dividend Champion with 29 Consecutive Years of Dividend Increases   Learning from the Past   Looking at Earnings Only   Since dividends are paid out of earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots Bemis Co Inc s earnings per share since 1998  A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that Bemis Co Inc has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 5 1   see purple circle on graph  per annum  Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line  Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1       The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide    2       The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs  Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance  Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values  Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income Bemis Co Inc The associated performance results  with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested    When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 2 6  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of Bemis Co Inc would have received an additional  43 483 62 in dividends that increased their total return from 2 6  to 4 4  per annum    Note   Since this is a Dividend Champion it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 25 years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate  The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Bemis Co Inc is  62  which is historically normal Looking to the Future   Extensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants    1       The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings   2       The price or valuation you pay to buy those earnings   Therefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance    Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation    represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Champion at a reasonable price  The important factor is that Bemis Co Inc has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns    The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions    The consensus of 12 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Bemis Co Inc long term earnings growth at 7    Bemis Co Inc has high long term debt at 50  of capital  Bemis Co Inc is currently trading at a P E of 15 5  which is inside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Bemis Co Inc s True Worth valuation would be  46 21 at the end of 2017  which would be a 9 8  annual rate of return from the current price  including assumed dividends  Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Bemis Co Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that Bemis Co Inc s expected earnings would be 5 8 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component This report presents essential  fundamentals at a glance  on Dividend Champion Bemis Co Inc  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conduct his or her own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not  Summary   ConclusionsBemis has increased their dividend every year for the past 29 years in close approximation to their earnings growth  Consensus estimates appear to be in line with the company s long term track record  and so does current valuation  Therefore  we believe that Bemis offers the conservative dividend growth investor a solid choice with an above average

4544,226059,BMS,The Essence Of Stock Valuation Is Soundness  Not Rate Of Return,opinion,Introduction on Stock ValuationWhen it comes to writing about investing in common stocks  my favorite theme typically revolves around valuation  In fact  I once had a reader dub me  Mr  Valuation   Which  I might add was very flattering to me  Moreover  in the context of discussing valuation there are normally three concepts that are included  They are typically fair valuation  undervaluation or overvaluation Oh  but would it not be wonderful  if everything about valuation were that simple  In truth  the concept of valuation is much more complex than those three simple notions  Therefore  one of the primary objectives of this article is to broaden the reader s perspectives and understandings of the incredibly important concept of valuation as it relates to investing in common stocks However  before I delve too deeply into this subject  I would like to offer these following positioning statements  Position number one  just because a stock is technically trading at fair value  does not necessarily mean that it is a good or attractive investment  Position number two  just because a stock is moderately overvalued  does not necessarily mean that it is a poor or unattractive investment  In truth  there are circumstances where a moderately overvalued stock is actually a much better investment than a stock that is fairly valued  The key  as will be discussed later  revolves around the potential growth of the respective company  The reason that the above positioning statements are true and valid is because valuation is only one component of many relating to common stock investment returns  There are many other factors such as the earnings growth rate of the stock in question  past  present and future  that will impact the future total return  Whether a company pays a dividend or not  and the level of the dividend it pays  if it does pay one  is also very important Therefore  to summarize  valuation is but one important component of successful stock investing  Furthermore  I would argue that valuation is more relevant to the soundness of the investment than it is to the total return the investment is capable of achieving  This is why  and I will elaborate more on this later on in the article  two companies with vastly different growth rates can technically be fairly valued with the same PE ratio  However  the potential future performance of each can be materially different as a function of each respective company s growth potential A Conceptual Definition Of Fair ValueIf you look up the term fair value on sites such as Investopedia or Wikipedia and others  you will discover what I believe are vague and even somewhat esoteric definitions  Therefore  I believe it is important that I offer my own definition of fair value so that the reader can at least be cognizant of the precise concept I am referring to  To me  fair value  as it relates to common stock investments  is manifest when the current earnings yield provided by the company s profits  compensate me for the risk I am taking by providing both a realistic and acceptable return on my invested capital When referencing my definition of fair value  it s important to focus on the concept  current earnings yield   There a couple reasons why I feel this is both rational and important  First of all  the current earnings of a given business are typically precisely known  reported earnings   Therefore  the calculation of the return that the current earnings are offering me can be accurately calculated  To clarify a little farther  after years of extensive research and experience  I have determined  or at least satisfied myself  that a PE ratio of 15 represents fair valuation for the majority of companies based on realistically achievable growth rates In addition to the fact that after examining thousands of companies over several decades  through the lens of the FAST Graphs   Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool   I have observed that a 15 PE ratio represents historical fair value for earnings growth up to 15  per annum  There are other logical facts that also support a 15 PE  First  I believe that it is not a coincidence that the more than 200 year average PE ratio of the S P 500 is 15  Second  this is a fact because I believe it also represents  and is consistent with  the long term average return of 6  to7  that common stocks have traditionally delivered to investors This fact is supported by the reality that a 15 PE ratio represents an earnings yield  E P  of 6 67   or approximately 6  to 7   My point being  that this is a rational and realistically achievable rate of return commonly found in the real world of stock investing  But I believe the most important point regarding this 15 PE concept rests on the notion of soundness  not rate of return  When the current earnings yield is between 6  and 7   the investment is currently attractive whether or not the business grows  and almost regardless of the company s rate of growth  up to a point   15   Moreover  I will further offer and contend that there is a logical reason why the growth rates on what I am calling the average company are represented with a rather broad range  That range is from 0  earnings growth up to 15  earnings growth  This notion is built on the reality that any future stream of income  whether it grows or not  is worth a multiple of itself  To be as clear as possible  I am suggesting  based on years of experience  that the fair value multiple will often equate to a PE of 15  earnings yield 6  7   with regards to publicly traded common stocks  and private businesses for that matter  Allow me to offer the following allegory in order to establish the veracity of this claim Let s assume that you owned a business that was generating you  100 000 per year of net net net income  Furthermore  let s assume that the  100 000 per year was both fixed and guaranteed  But let s further assume that it was now time for you to retire and sell your business  The seminal question is  what price would you be willing to accept from me  if I were a potential buyer If I offered you  100 000  PE   1   you would  or at least should  without hesitation turn me down because you would know that in one year s time you would be broke  However  if I offered you  1 500 000  a PE of 15  you might consider selling  Because  if you invested the  1 500 000 and received a 6 67  return  the earnings yield from a PE of 15  your income would be  100 500 per year  or approximately what the business was earning you  This is the essence of why a PE of 15 is both rational  normal and most importantly  sound Although the above allegory assumes a business with no growth  it is important that the reader recognize that growth will have an impact on what future return the buyer of the business would earn  However  the principle of soundness is based on the idea that both buyer and seller are receiving an acceptable and realistic return of 6  7  even with no future growth  Additionally  it should also be recognized that there is always risk in achieving a given level of growth  The higher the expected growth  typically the riskier it would be to achieve it  On the other hand  once again  the soundness of the transaction on the seller s behalf is somewhat predicated on the notion that one in the hand is worth more than two in the bush  Therefore  the 15 PE in reality properly compensates both the buyer and seller of the business on a current earnings yield basis  regardless of future growth The PE Ratio as a Valuation Guide Not an AbsoluteTo me  the proofs of any hypothesis  especially those regarding investing in stocks  are so to speak in the pudding  In other words  if the hypothesis has any validity at all  you should be able to demonstrate it through real world  real life examples  Stated more directly  you should be able to measure the fair valuation PE ratio by examining actual companies and the typical historical valuations that have been applied to them Therefore  I will provide eight examples of companies with different earnings growth rates to illustrate how accurately the normal PE ratio as a proxy for fair value applies to companies with growth rates from 0  to 15   However  three of my examples will show growth above 15  in order to demonstrate that above this threshold  higher PE ratios reflecting fair valuation are justified But before I provide the examples  there is one additional concept of incredible importance that I believe must be understood  The valuation discussions that I have presented in the context of this article should be thought of as guidelines representing a reasonably accurate reflection of fair value  It is vitally important that the reader does not try to become too precise with these notions  Although I fervently believe that fair valuation is a vital component of a successful stock investing strategy  I also understand that it needs to be thought of as a rational valuation array Consequently  as I will elaborate on with each following example  the reader should be focused on objectively determining whether these valuation guidelines have relevance or not on each specific case  As a clue  if these notions of valuation that I have presented are reasonably accurate  then we should see a very strong correlation between earnings and a 15 PE ratio in the long term stock price movements for any company with growth from 0  to 15   However  I repeat that this should be thought of as guidelines and not as absolutes The Fair Value 15 PE Ratio For Growth From 0  to 15 In order to illustrate the validity of the fair value PE ratio of 15 on companies growing between 0  to 15   I will review the historical earnings and price correlation of several companies through the lens of the fundamentals analyzer software tool FAST Graphs   I will start by illustrating a company with historical earnings growth of only 1 5  and progressively move to higher and higher earnings growth examples With the first five examples  the reader should clearly understand and recognize that the orange line on the graph plots the company s earnings per share at precisely a PE ratio of 15  Therefore  no matter where you look on that graph  the orange line represents a fair value PE of 15  As a result  the monthly closing stock price line  the black line on the graph  should closely follow and correlate to the orange earnings justified valuation line  Notice that when the price goes above the line how quickly it returns  and how when the price falls below the orange line how quickly it returns  If my hypothesis is correct  there should be a high correlation between the stock price and the earnings line  Consequently  as you review each of the examples ask yourselves these simple questions  Does the orange line  PE 15  represent a sound price to pay if I really wanted to invest in this company  What typically happens in the future when the price goes above the orange line  and conversely what typically happens when the price falls below the orange line  Let the facts answer these questions for you  The idea is to try to visually recognize whether or not the fair value 15 PE ratio makes sense  or represents soundness Of equal importance  the reader should recognize that the slope of the orange line equates to the company s historical earnings growth rate  This is shown in the green box within the FAST FACTS presented at the right of the graph  Therefore  also recognize that the capital appreciation component will be highly correlated to the company s growth rate  assuming that fair valuation at the beginning and end of the period being measured is in alignment For extra credit  you might also notice that in the long run the stock price always moves to the orange line  thereby generating the capital appreciation component of total return  The light blue shaded area on the graph depicts dividends  see the color coded section of the FAST FACTS to the right of the graph   Consequently  it should be clear that total return will be the combination of the capital appreciation based on earnings growth  plus the additional contribution from dividends Consolidated Edison  ED  1 5  Earnings GrowthMy first example reviews Consolidated Edison  a utility stock with a history of earnings growth only averaging 1 5  per annum  The orange line on the graph represents our theoretical fair value PE ratio of 15  To be clear  anywhere the stock price  the black line  touches the orange line it s trading at a PE ratio of 15  Of course  if it s above the orange line the PE is higher than 15  and if the price is below the orange line it s lower  But the most important point to be gleaned from the graph is that it is clear that you should never be willing to pay more than the fair value PE of 15 to buy this stock  Moreover  it is also clear that the stock price has gravitated to and tracked the orange line  PE of 15  over the long run  With Consolidated Edison s growth as low as it is  investors can t afford to have any material drop in price  because it would easily destroy any capital appreciation they could expect  Moreover  it s also clear that even if this company is bought at a fair value PE of 15  it would be unreasonable to expect capital appreciation to be greater than the 1 5  earnings growth the company generates Furthermore  by examining the blue shaded area representing dividends  relative to the green shaded area representing earnings  it should be clear that Consolidated Edison pays the majority of its profits  approximately 70   to shareholders  in the form of dividends  Consequently  it should also be clear that Consolidated Edison s attractiveness is based more on the consistency and level of its dividend than on capital appreciation  Also  we can see that dividends provide a significant portion of shareholder s total return Southern Company  SO  3 2  Earnings GrowthOur second example  Southern Company  is also a utility stock  The primary difference in this example is that we are moving up the growth rate chain  Southern Company has averaged 3 2  earnings growth versus Consolidated Edison s 1 5  earnings growth  Nevertheless  it should be clear that our fair value PE ratio of 15 continues to represent a clear proxy for fair valuation  Although the price line does on occasion move above and below our fair value PE of 15  it continuously moves back into alignment  Once again we see that a PE ratio of 15 represents an undeniable proxy of fair value for Southern Company  It is easy to analyze the graph on Southern Company and conclude that we would never want to pay much more than 15 times earnings to invest in it  Moreover  notice how the price had risen above the fair value PE of 15  the orange line  for much of 2012  but has since come back into alignment as the price is once again touching the orange line Bemis Company Inc  BMS  5 6  Earnings GrowthOur third example  Bemis Company  a paper packaging company  moves up the growth chain with a historical average earnings growth rate of 5 6   Nevertheless we once again see that the price tracks the orange line representing the fair value PE of 15  Therefore  at this point we see the relevance of the 15 PE over earnings growth rates ranging from 1 5  for Consolidated Edison to 5 6  for Bemis  But most importantly  we are seeing that the fair value PE continues to apply  Cracker Barrel  CBRL  7  Earnings GrowthOur fourth example  the restaurant chain  Cracker Barrel  has averaged 7  historical earnings growth which moves us approximately half way through our 0  to 15  range previously discussed  Once again  we see that our fair value PE represents a strong proxy for fair valuation  even at this higher earnings growth rate  Remember  that this represents that a 15 PE is a sound investment  but that the total return will be a function of the company s future earnings growth rate  Therefore  even though our PE of 15 still represents fair value  Cracker Barrel s higher historical growth rate will generate more capital appreciation than we saw with our slow growth utility stocks  United Technologies  UTX  10 9  Earnings GrowthWith United Technologies our historical earnings growth rate now exceeds 10   yet we continue to see that our fair value PE of 15 continues to represent a clear proxy for fair value  In other words  by simply reviewing the graph  it is clear that a 15 PE ratio is a sound valuation to pay to buy United Technologies  Moreover  we also see that any time the price falls below our normal PE of 15  a bargain manifests  Conversely  we can also state that purchasing United Technologies at a PE ratio above 15 is not optimum  AmerisourceBergen Corp   ABC  15 6  Earnings GrowthAmerisouceBergen Corp  our sixth example  is presented because it crosses over our upper threshold of an earnings growth rate of 15   Once earnings growth exceeds 15   the FAST Graphs  research tool automatically applies the formula PE ratio   growth rate  Therefore  the orange earnings justified valuation line in this example represents a PE ratio of 15 6  It should be clear that even though it is not precisely a PE of 15  it is very close  Moreover  AmerisourceBergen Corp also represents an example that PE ratios higher than 15 are justified when growth exceeds 15   As growth rates exceed 15   the fair value PE ratio will be higher reflecting this faster growth  The Rule of 72Without elaborating in great detail on why this is the case  allow me to simply offer the insight that the power of compounding comes into play at 15  growth and above  Once you get past 15  growth  the time it takes for a company s earnings to double is shortened to the extent that a geometric factor begins to really kick in  Allow me to take the following sidebar to illustrate what is happening as growth exceeds 15  per annum  The Rule of 72 represents a simple way to illustrate the geometric effects of compounding  To illustrate this  I will compare the long term results of two hypothetical investments where one is growing at 10   under the 15  threshold  and the other is growing at 20   above the 15  threshold   I will assume a 36 year time period which theoretically represents a working lifetime  I have selected these numbers because they will clearly allow me to present what is hopefully an understandable portrayal of the compounding effect According to the Rule of 72  if I divide 10  into 72  it calculates that it will take 7 2 years to double my money at 10  growth  In contrast  if I divide 20  into 72  it calculates that it will take 3 6 years to double my money  With this information  I now know that at 10  growth  I will get 5 doubles on my money in 36 years  36 yrs  7 2 yrs    5 doubles   Therefore  my first dollar invested will double 5 times as follows   2   4   8   16  and finally  32 for my first dollar invested at 10  growth over 36 years However  at 20  growth  I will get 10 doubles on my money in 36 years  or double the doubles  36 yrs  3 6 yrs    10 doubles   Therefore  my first dollar invested will now double 10 times in 36 years as follows   2   4   8   16   32   64   128   256   512  and finally  1 024  Therefore  my 20  return  which is double the 10  return  does not just double the amount of money I will earn  it doubles the number of times my money doubles over the same time frame  For purposes of this article  our experience and research has shown that this effect begins to change the fair value PE ratio at the cross over point starting at 15  growth  However  I would add as an aside that once growth exceeds 30   the fair value PE ratio tops out  This concept would require another article to be fully developed  therefore I respectfully introduce it here in order to provide the beginning of insight into fair valuation at higher growth rates Ross Stores Inc  ROST  17 2  Earnings GrowthOur seventh example  Ross Stores Inc  has a historical earnings growth rate of 17 2   Now we are getting far enough above our average fair value PE ratio of 15 where we can see how faster growth finally warrants a higher PE ratio  The orange line on the Ross Stores  graph represents a PE ratio of 17 2 with is equal to its earnings growth rate  With a close examination of the earnings and price relationship  it is clear that a 17 2 PE ratio represents a good proxy for fair value for Ross Stores Inc  More simply stated  it would have been historically sound to invest in Ross Stores at a PE of 17 LKQ Corp  LKQ  27 3  Earnings GrowthMy final example reviews LKQ Corporation  a recycler of auto parts  with a historical earnings growth rate of 27 3   For the first five years in this example  we see that the fair value PE ratio was the equivalent of the 27 3  earnings growth rate  Then the great recession lowered the PE ratio to the normal PE of 22 1  Nevertheless  this chart reveals that LKQ s earnings growth rate has been significantly above 15   and therefore  has commanded a significantly higher valuation  In other words  this stock could never have been bought at our 15 PE ratio  because the stock has never traded at such a low valuation thanks to its high growth  SummaryThe following table summarizes our eight examples which are presented in order of highest historical earnings growth to lowest  Although the fair value PE of 15 applies to all the companies below 15  earnings growth  as an indication of soundness  note that the annualized performance of each company closely correlates to its historical earnings growth This illustrates our thesis that although all the companies below 15  growth warrant a fair value PE of 15 to be considered sound investments  this does not mean that all of them will produce the same rates of return  The rate of return will be more a function of each company s earnings growth rate  assuming that they are bought at the appropriate fair value PE of 15 for growth below 15   and a PE ratio equal to the earnings growth rate for companies showing above 15  earnings growth  ConclusionsThe purpose of this article was to illustrate the principles and nuances of fairly valuing common stocks at various growth rates  Hopefully it also illustrated that valuation is a valid concept that helps determine whether the investment is sound or not  However  it should also be recognized that fair valuation should always be thought of as a guideline rather than an absolute number  Furthermore  this does not diminish the value or importance of getting fair valuation right  Possessing a solid understanding of fair valuation is a vital prerequisite to successful common stock investing  Fair valuation is not meant to be rigidly adhered to  Instead  it should be thought of as an important tool in the investor s arsenal assisting them with making sound and successful investments in common stocks Disclosure  Long UTX  ABC  ROST   LKQ at the time of writing Disclaimer  The

Not surprisingly I suppose  conclusions are mixed as to whether it is a positive or negative to be added or deleted from the Index  here  here and here   Many reasons can result in a company being added removed from the index  For example  removal can occur because a company s business prospects are declining and in that case future stock performance may be weak  On the other hand  a company may have sold portions of their business resulting in a smaller capitalized company that may actually perform well going into the future  One of the white papers at a link noted earlier in this paragraph concludes stocks added to the S P 500 Index underperform due to the application of a larger discount rate because of potentially higher stock price volatility  For investors  understanding why a firm is added or deleted from an index is important  Evaluating a company s long term business prospect is more important than whether or not it is in a particular index ",2014-12-08,Blog of HORAN Capital Advisors,https://www.investing.com/analysis/evaluating-potential-changes-to-index-holdings-234926,234926

4557,226072,BMS,Should Value Investors Consider Bemis  BMS  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Bemis Company  Inc    NYSE BMS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Bemis has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 69  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 17  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Bemis  current PE level puts it marginally below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Industrial Products  Containers   Paper and Packaging industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 41  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that Bemis has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 18 43  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Bemis has a P S ratio of about 1 09  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 13 right now  As we can see in the chart below  this is just slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years BMS is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Bemis currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Bemis a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 02  which is better than the industry average of 11 76  The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  Clearly  BMS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Bemis might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives BMS a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen zero upward and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 6 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Bemis Company  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBemis is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 34   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or
